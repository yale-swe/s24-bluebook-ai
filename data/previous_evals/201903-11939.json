   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This class engaged in some discussions about different types of truth that was relevant both to theatre and the world we currently live in. I also had to work on overcoming barriers to creating my own self-driven piece, where I was only partly successful but appreciate the experience.",
    "I was exposed to bunch of very interesting one person performances and was challenged to expand my creativity when it comes to theater creation and performance.",
    "I learned how to unleash my inner artist! I've always wanted to do more creative writing and this forced me to do it; it helped me to get over my fears. We had to write \"morning pages\" which is three pages of free writing every morning. By the end of the semester we had about 300 pages. You you do it right, you develop great discipline.",
    "CAPTOPP had a great reading list. I really enjoyed how many of our readings focused on the creative process itself, and the lessons we gained from the texts to be applied to any creative endeavor. Hal is great at giving feedback to actors. It is very apparent that he tells his students exactly what they need to hear to improve, which varies from student to student.",
    "I feel that this course really helped me get a sense of the variety of possibilities that exist in the theatrical realm of the one-person play, a genre I'd had limited exposure to before taking this course. I also deeply appreciated the variety of texts Professor Brooks assigned to us, as I feel they helped me realize that inspiration for dramatic work can come from anywhere, and that the one-person play is merely a smaller part of storytelling as a whole.",
    "I was able to explore different forms of storytelling through acting and play writing. I was exposed to performances and the power of storytelling. I also learned that sometimes the most powerful stories come from within and not from others.",
    "Insight on how to live creatively and how to be more productive by using rituals and other techniques. Also gained a wider appreciation for different media of performances (monologues, etc).",
    "(as the course title suggests) we learned how to compose and perform a one-person play, taking advantage of different techniques such as morning pages or artist dates, as well as inspiration from various performers.",
    "I learned a great deal about the role of the one person play in modern day American theatre, and what it means to compose and star in a play. This included looking at techniques that many actors employ when it comes to switching between characters and getting in the right headspace. I also learned to define a story in different ways and how we should consider the importance and impact that many one person plays (e.g: talks, soliloquies) can have on an audience.",
    "This class was immensely insightful regarding creativity and idea-manifestation. We learned of several approaches to coming up with and then developing ideas. We analyzed each others work; the work of professional actors; and several articles, books, and plays in order to better understand the process of creativity and creation. By doing so we essentially learned of several approaches to creativity. We learned how to stay focused and committed but also open to change in regards to theatre."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A lot of the readings and video material for this course makes it really interesting. However, the fact that it meets only once a week means that it is easier to \"check out\" during the week and then end up cramming on Sunday afternoon.",
    "The class was very intriguing but definitely holds theater to a high standard!",
    "More in-class writing exercises! Discussions could be shorter. Hal was big on you creating a play that only you could perform. Something about your insight on the world or a take on a character had to be true to something in you. He would say something like \"this isn't therapy, but you should get personal.\" I think the people who did best were the ones who really exposed themselves in their writing and their emotions when they performed.",
    "CAPTOPP's biggest strengths are the freedom it gives its students and the exposure it gives us to great resources, texts, and exercises. The course's greatest weakness is its structure. The course always begins with a lengthy discussion of the texts for that week, followed by whatever activity is planned for that lesson. I always wished that there had been less time allocated to discussion, and more towards the acting and writing exercises, as those exercises always seemed to be a bit rushed due to time constraints.",
    "Strengths: great sense of community and support between students in the classroom; helpful variety of texts within the syllabus; engaging teaching style. Weaknesses: sometimes, assignments were posted significantly later in the week than expected, which meant rushing to finish.",
    "The greatest strength of the course was the very constructive and hands-on approach to teaching the material. It made the class not only fun but educational. The greatest weakness has to be the workload. I understand that the class met once every week, but sometimes the workload would get really heavy and would occasionally make it very difficult to get other work done.",
    "The exercises (object, failure, etc) were the parts that helped me the most. The supportive atmosphere of \"anything goes, be the first to raise your hand\" was also great. I think the weak parts revolved around feedback and revision. Sometimes the feedback from Hal is not the clearest and also, with the midterm and final, there should be a check on progress outside of just \"bring in a few excerpts\" because many of us (most, I think) did not properly pace ourselves and the final and midterms could've been even better if we did.",
    "Strengths: material, instructor, class debates, class participation. Basically everything about it, except Weaknesses: some of the activities (morning pages, artist dates, rehearsing with classmates etc) could feel forced, and arent something everyone in the course will enjoy. But thats also kind of the point: exposing up-and-coming artists to different techniques, and seeing if anything sticks. Even still, I wish students were (somehow?) given different options of activities, to increase the chance that theyll find something they enjoy.",
    "Strengths: Good focus on practicality aspect of the one person play (students are encouraged to act, to think of their own plays with regards to other ones) Weakness: There does not seem to be enough focus on the technical aspects of acting. Discussions tend to go somewhat unfacilitated. How it could be improved: I think a greater focus on discussing technique (for both writing and acting) would be very useful.",
    "A great strength to this class is that it doesnt really require any background in playwriting or acting, however, I do think it helps. Another great strength is that a lot of work can be done out of class and that the quality of writing and performance is really up to the effort of the student. A shortcoming of such a course is that the class size is too large given the single class every week. 18 people is simply too many for 1 hour and 50 minutes per week, I think reducing that class size to 12 or so would work ideally or if there was one more meeting per week. I think it also makes for limited performance feedback (in terms of the midterm for example) which I wish had been a little more in depth."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. The material is interesting as long as you are motivated enough to engage with it, and it's a great opportunity to push yourself creatively. Also, getting to watch the presentation of the rest of the class is a truly incredible experience; everyone's plays were rich and engaging.",
    "If you are interested in theater already, I would say yes.",
    "Absolutely. This class is a great opportunity to get raw in front of people and yourself. I found that is was a great groundwork to create rich relationships with other members of the class and Hal.",
    "I would highly recommend CAPTOPP to another student. The workload was quite heavy but always extremely satisfying. All the readings were fun and thought-provoking, and the midterm and final performances were always a joy to write, practice, and perform.",
    "Absolutely! Even for non-Theatre Studies majors, this course is a great way to develop one's creative writing and comfort with performing, in addition to developing a familiarity with a stunning array of other works (novels, plays, performances, etc.).",
    "I would recommend this course because not only is it interesting, but the skills used can be applied to lots of other fields. I would caution them about the high work demand of the course. It can be very easy to slip up and fall behind.",
    "It is definitely a great class if you're looking for a way to get out of your comfort zone. It was definitely a fun course and Hal facilitates a safe environment where it is encouraged to take artistic risks.",
    "100%, this class has you explore new areas and mindsets, even if you have previously participated in theater.",
    "Hal Brooks is a fantastic instructor, youll create connections with peers that isnt like anything in other classes, and once everything is said and done itll have been a fantastic experience. I definitively feel like itll be one of the biggest highlights of my time at Yale. Just be warned, the morning pages are hard to keep up with.",
    "Yes. This course gives a first year the opportunity to explore literally any topic they like, which I feel is rare for one's first semester of their career at Yale. While many may not be inclined to take a Theater Course, the readings span all sorts of topics, and at the very least, the class builds comfortability with public speaking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Id recommend it to a student who likes the idea of creation, someone who appreciates the limitless possibilities of art, or a student who would like a creative challenge. They dont have to be extroverted or anything of that sort, this course is structured well so that anybody can take it. This class gives a very good toolset of methods to approach creativity and theatre which is also applicable to many other things. What I learned I will keep with me forever. A strength or weakness of such a course, depending on what your perspective is, is that art and creation is limitless. For some people this is a blessing and others a curse so it's important to be aware of this when deciding to take this class."
