   "comments": [
    "Not an explosive, blows-your-mind class, but I really enjoyed it. The pace is good: 4 tests, each worth 25% of your grade, and no final. Material got easier as we moved forward.",
    "Interesting material, boring lectures. Only 4 tests and no final. You be the judge.",
    "Take it. It'll make you understand the wonderful field of affective neuroscience.",
    "If you are really interested in the material take it, but if not, it's boring.",
    "Every psychology major (and others!) should take this class. There is no assigned readings or assignments, simply lecture and 4 in class exams, so the workload is manageable but you learn so much! The 4 exams help you stay on top of the material as the tests are on the more difficult side but if you study hard for exams you will do well. A fascinating topic and fun class, highly recommended!",
    "a lot of info presented through psych studies",
    "Affective neuroscience is an awesome class -- the material is fascinating and the workload manageable. The course is organized into four units (basic of neuroscience, fear, stress, and attachment\/cognition) and at the end of each unit there is a test. We cover micro and macro angles of the materal, ranging from the cellular biology of synaptic plasticity and fear learning to clinical applications of the treatments. The four tests are your only assessments! The tests are predictable as long as you memorize everything, which can be a bit of a drag but really makes you appreciate the field. It's absurd that the class doesn't get an Science credit, but this does make it a little bit of a niche class (about 25 students) and you get people who really want to be there. I think there should be section in this class to discuss papers in the field \/ review stuff from class, but that's a minor point. Professor Schafe is an engaging lecturer and knows his stuff (the fear unit prominently features his research, lol). I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Take the class if you're interested. A lot of things to memorize. If you want to learn, then reach out to the professor\/TA, because there really isn't much student-professor interaction.",
    "Yes, take this class if you're interested in neuro. Fascinating material!",
    "Affective neuroscience is a pretty standard Yale neuroscience course. There were 4 non-cumulative tests and the lowest one ended up being dropped. I'd recommend this course to fellow students interested in neuroscience, but if you don't have any background in the area it can be somewhat technical. I would definitely suggest taking one or two other neuroscience courses first unless your taking it credit d.",
    "I would recommend Affective Neuroscience for someone looking for a class with very interesting material and a light workload. Regardless of major or background, it's a really interesting and accessible introduction to behavioral neuroscience.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in neuroscience, especially the underlying biology and many of the recent studies and their applications. The course is not necessarily easy; there is a LOT of material covered. However, it is super interesting. Glenn Schafe knows the material and puts together a curriculum of everything pertinent to affective neuroscience. The only weakness is that he tends to read off of his powerpoints pretty dryly, but this was his first time teaching the course I believe, and I really think he'll improve at this. You can't get this material all in one textbook, so the course is very valuable.",
    "Great class, you learn a lot and are rewarded for the effort you put in studying for exams. Definitely a class where you'll be learning a lot about neuronal\/cell level concepts, and the effects that neuronal\/cell level manipulations have on behavioral measures. It's also less about humans and more about animal studies.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych 311! It's necessary to take an intro neuroscience class (like Brain and Thought or Psych 170) before taking this class, since it's important to have some background in the material. The content of the course is interesting, especially if you want to know what is happening in your brain when you are scared, stressed, etc. There is no reading, and the entire grade is based on 4 exams. Therefore, lecture is incredibly important. But the lectures are very interesting, and Professor Schafe is awesome.",
    "Great class",
    "This is a science class without the science credit. Take it credit\/D because you will learn a lot, all the material is given in lecture, but the tests are very difficult and make up your entire grade.",
    "Interesting and rigorous introduction to the neuroscience of emotion. Recommended to students interested in this sort of thing.",
    "This class is very straightforward.There are four, non-cumulative tests, and that's it. Everything you need to know for the tests is on the powerpoint slides, just know them well and you are good to go. Lecture can be dry at times but going is necessary once you get into descriptions of the experiments being performed, since you need them to make sense of the slides. My only complaint is that the unit the last test was based on wasn't as cohesive as the others, which made studying for it a lot more difficult. Similarly, the long essay question on each test didn't address a single topic, and would therefore be better structured as a couple of separate questions that required a mid-sized paragraph. Otherwise, the subject is pretty interesting, so give it a try!",
    "Wonderful upper-level psychology\/neuroscience course that gives a very strong foundation in neuroscience and builds on it to teach about all sorts of behavioral neuroscience protocol while giving information about different facets of emotions and behavior. Appeals to a variety of interests and is a rigorous course, so if that's what you're looking for, Take it!"
