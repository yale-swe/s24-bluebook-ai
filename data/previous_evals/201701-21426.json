   "comments": [
    "Best lecture: The one on Fiction Writing. It actually taught me something about the process of writing which unfortunately cannot be said for the rest of the course. The lecture (despite its mandatory attendance) does not foster growth. If anything, all growth is made outside of the classroom with the TA in tutorial. I gained confidence in my writing and began to understand how my writing skills are ones that need to be exercised like any muscle in the body. Neglect it, and you lose it.",
    "Daily Themes is a unique class in that it actually does help you develop skills -- writing every day and meeting with a person who reads so much of your writing every week will actually make you become a better writer. Also, working on a class where you have to engage five times a week at minimum will make you a better student.",
    "I learned how to write short things",
    "I learned a lot of things: that I should write at least weekly, that my writing is sometimes good and sometimes bad, how my writing stacks up alongside that of my peers. It's a good class, although I have to say that lecture's a bit quirky.",
    "Making concise writing a daily habit.",
    "I learned how to write. It was hard, trying, and beautiful.",
    "to write. write prolifically. write in a way that works with how you think.",
    "I stretched the topics and angles from which I approached writing, and got better by doing.",
    "The habit of daily writing not only improved my overall writing abilit but also, more importantly, the speed at which I could think of and brin. Into fruition an idea.",
    "Writing habitually, writing non fiction, especially writing about the self and people",
    "Learning how to write on a daily basis was incredibly useful. The routine forced me to put words on a page and the quality ended up surprising me more often than not.",
    "Awesome classs! My writing and imagination really grew well together.",
    "I improved my writing by... writing. A lot.",
    "Learned to improve my writing skills through various types of writings methods and points of view.",
    "I learned a lot about my writing style and I got the tools to keep writing on my own.",
    "Daily themes is a wonderful course for developing your proficiency in creative writing - I was really amazed at the level of improvement to the way I think and express myself on a page",
    "I improved my writing skills both for creative writing and structure-wise.",
    "I learned to think about my writing and subject matter more in depth, and how to better revise what I created.",
    "I improved my fluidity as a writer, and my confidence as a result.",
    "I learned how to be bolder in my writing, how to discipline myself to write every day, and many technical writing skills.",
    "I got better at the minute technical aspects of writing--word choice, punctuation, syntax, etc. And at getting ideas and working through them in general.",
    "I did a lot of writing! To be honest I don't think my writing actually improved, in fact I think my best themes were in week one. I learned how to write for prompts that were literally all over the place, and I learned how to compare my writing to others and feel inferior.",
    "The discipline it gave to my writing was wonderful, and I definitely learned how to be a better self editor.",
    "Developed my writing abilities, patience with myself.",
    "First and foremost, Daily Themes has tightened my writing. I am a much more precise writer than I was four months ago. My syntax is cleaner, my vocabulary is more accurate, and my themes are more cogently developed. I self-edit efficiently and am no longer afraid to kill my darlings for the sake of precision. Even my emails have a certain sharpness to them now, a certain purpose. This skill will serve me well in any career I pursue, writing or otherwise. Daily Themes has also flexed and expanded my creative muscle. Whereas last semester I found myself constantly plagued with writers block, I now have no trouble finding things to write about. I can conceive characters, stories, and scenes with greater ease. Writing has truly become a joy, something that I look forward to at the end of each day, a release rather than a burdensome chore. I have developed a greater appreciation for my surroundings. I now look at everything with the intention of describing it precisely later. My eye is closely attuned to the movement of nature and people. I keep mental notes of beautiful scenes that I may be able to incorporate later. My process has not changed significantly, although I now have many more tools at my disposal to approach prompts. For example, I now consider how I will develop motifs through syntax, flow, and the sounds of certain words. March 28 was a particularly formative week for me in this regard. The theme, Using the Louis Menand paragraph as a model, write a paragraph of not more than 250 words in which the length of the sentences, and the punctuation, parallel the theme and the action taught me that the sound of ones writing can complement the content. I would like to work on crafting characters unique voices, adopting their vernacular, syntax, and most importantly, way of looking at the world. Currently, my writing relies largely on extensive description of a characters surroundings. I would like to move towards character and relationship-driven stories, I would also like to explore new ways of structuring my writing: for example, telling a story from the perspective of a limited narrator or in reverse chronological order. This would help me escape the common tropes I fall into that make my writing repetitive and stale. I really enjoyed the related themes week. It allowed me to immerse myself in a literary world for an extended period of time, constructing an alternate reality. I would not say there was anything uniquely educational about the week: I just enjoyed it. Similarly, I loved Andre Acimans pieces and lecture. I found his writing gorgeous, his themes poignant, and his candor inspiring. I was profoundly impacted by his discussion of unwritten lives and the potent connection between senses and memory. In short, I am so glad that I took Daily Themes. I have learned a great deal about writing and about being a writer, lessons that will serve me and guide me for the next three years. I have learned that I want to be an English major. Most of all, I have learned that I love writing.",
    "The practice of writing daily really helps form a habit and improve your writing, particularly personal narrative and fiction.",
    "Writing every day is hard, but it is worth it. I have seen more improvement in my writing in this class than any other."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Tutorial Weakness: Zarin's lectures are dull and unenlightening. THEY ALSO SAID THEY WOULD ISSUE A MIDTERM GRADE REPORT WHICH NEVER CAME. If you say you will do something on the syllabus, goddamit do it. If I am required to do everything on the syllabus I would expect the professor to uphold their end of the bargain.",
    "The strength of the course is just the structure: it's so much fun to write every day, the prompts are usually pretty interesting, and the TAs are awesome (especially Donald). The course's weakness is the lecture portion: it feels extraneous and Zarin is clearly not a big fan of it either. Daily Themes is great because of the themes; the lecture is unnecessary.",
    "Awesome concept, guest lectures were good, my tutor was ok, non-guest lectures were pretty bad",
    "Strengths: Prompts were always interesting, tutor-student system is great, some interesting guest lectures Weaknesses: lectures weren't particularly enlightening on average and didn't add to my workshop\/writing experience nearly as much as the tutor sessions",
    "The course is what it is: you write every day. I wish some of the congratulatory parts were made more easily understood (the X-Themes, the final reading), but otherwise, I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "Loved the guest lecturers and themed weeks, though the prompts themselves didn't always correspond. Loved the opportunity of working with a tutor one-on-one. What I didn't like as much, though, was that your experience seemed to heavily depend on who your tutor was.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the guest speakers and lectures. But by far, the best part was my TA.",
    "Doing the themes and receiving one on one feedback was excellent. Meeting other students and their work was also really interesting. The lectures were not at all helpful for improving writing or adding to the course, with the exception of the X-themes.",
    "Outside of the structure of the daily assignments, the weekly meetings with a writing tutor were a major strength of the class. I felt like I was getting more personalized attention for the type of writing I wanted to persue. In addition, some of the promprs were challenging enough to push me out of my comfort zone. However, many of the prompts seemed contrived, the lectures that didn't come from a guest speaker grew dull, and I feel like we needed more class reading.",
    "Strengths: manageable workload, engaged tutor Weaknesses: lectures were prescriptive and uninteresting, guest lectures were hit and miss, prompts were hit and miss, heard one story about a tutor who was insensitive and focused inappropriately on a student's socioeconomic\/cultural background instead of a student themself",
    "The lectures were very poor, but the one-on-one time with the tutors was invaluable. Lectures should give more concrete, pragmatic tips on how to write instead of broad, abstract concepts.",
    "Cynthia Zarin should not be giving this lecture-- she is clearly a passionate writer but just as clearly does not want to be giving a lecture and her talents could be better applied to the class in other ways-- guest readings, etc. she read a pre-written lecture every class and it often did not relate to the assignments for the week.",
    "Lectures could be a little bit more engaging!",
    "Lectures are TERRIBLE! I didn't take anything from the lectures. This class would be exponentially better if you didn't have to hear professor Zarin read off a page she wrote years ago for over an hour.",
    "Daily Themes works very well as a practice course -- after all, the best way to improve one's writing is to simply write, a lot. There's a component of Daily Themes that is almost an introduction to writing philosophy, i.e. lectures consisting of sort of broad statements about the notion of writing and forming ideas and articulating them in words. I found these lectures to be interesting about two-thirds of the time, wholly useless (sorry) another third of the time, and directly applicable to my writing pretty much never. I think if these lectures were pared down a bit in favor of smaller, more involved meetings between students, other students, and tutors (and instructors and guest instructors as well!!) students would get a lot more practice actually thinking critically about writing, instead of listening passively to someone else talk about it.",
    "I think the purpose of the lecture needs to be fleshed out. It felt a lot like listening to the instructor do a reading of a piece that did not quite make sense and it was hard to engage as a result. I loved the tutoring though, and so that was totally redemptive for the often nonsensical lectures (which didn't really make the writing process any clearer but certainly sounded like nice prose). I also loved the guest lecturers and how different they were.",
    "The format of the course involving writing every day is its biggesf charm and should not be altered. The lecture should be optional though, in my opinion",
    "Strengths: we are able to write everyday (best way to improve writing skills) and have one-to-one tutor meetings Weaknesses: the class is not very engaging. Specially to those students that prefer visual aid for learning.",
    "The course is a very interesting course. It's such a wonderful experience to write every day. Your writing improves tremendously. However, the lectures are ridiculous. Professor Zarin seems to just talk in circles for the entire lecture, and it's difficult to get to the crux of what she's trying to say. She also has a very distinct taste and writing style, so that when she chooses her themes of the week, they tend to be very similar. It makes it difficult to read a variety of writing. The lectures, especially those taught by Zarin, seem to lack any organization. She goes on long rants and reads her entire lecture from a script, making them many times dull and unengaging.",
    "The guest lecturers were interesting and inspiring--a nice bonus.",
    "I loved this course! The strengths were the writing and my wonderful tutor, Shifra Sharlin. I loved the rhythm of writing every day and loved meeting with Shifra who was incredibly supportive and interesting. The weakness was the lecture. I understand that it is difficult to lecture about writing. Perhaps it could be improved if a different guest speaker came in every week!",
    "Great course if you want to write every day. Really gets your creativity going, and it's a good habit to be in. Lectures tend to be less rewarding--I wish there were more elements of them that encouraged participation.",
    "The strength of the class is that you have to write every day. It's a great exercise, and I highly recommend it to everyone. The tutors were another strength - it's always nice to form close relationships with professors at Yale. Everything else was a weakness. I have never been less engaged by lectures. Except for a few of the guest lectures, I was actively miserable during the hour and 15 minutes each week. They were absolutely pointless, and I always felt like I was being scolded. I recognize that it's hard to lecture about writing, but I thought they were poorly done. I also did not like the prompts. When I signed up for the class, I was looking forward to prompts that would make me think, reflect, and grow as a person and a write. While some of them did this, a lot of them just felt like busy work.",
    "The course is a legend at Yale, and its premise of writing every single day is a valuable one--it's good to exercise the writing muscle, it's good to learn more about ourselves and what's important to us. And my understanding is that most of my friends in the class really liked their tutors, the only individuals actually looking at their writing. I really liked mine. The professor--Cynthia Zarin--is the course's weakness. She is dreadful and a terrible lecturer and her weekly lectures seemed fairly uninspiring and unnecessary.",
    "Daily structure of course assignments is the centerpiece, and it's golden. The weekly meetings with a tutor are also helpful. The lecture is not helpful at all, and should be eliminated or changed.",
    "The premise of the course is excellent, and I learned a great deal from writing every day. I would change little about the structure of the course. I think more opportunities to write extended pieces across the course of several days would be beneficial. I think more instruction on how to revise themes would also be beneficial. I enjoyed how the course was structured around core questions, and I enjoyed almost all of the prompts.",
    "I think weekly lectures were a weakness of this course. They could be improved to be more engaging or help students where they are in the course.",
    "One-on-one with tutor is great; lecture was cool and enjoyable, but not that helpful in terms of becoming a better writer. You take the class to write and receive feedback, not to sit through the lecture.",

   "comments": [
    "Sure. It is a Yale Classic but be aware that Zarin is not a wonderful lecturer",
    "I would absolutely recommend Daily Themes to another student. I think everyone should take it -- it's an incredible learning experience and it also offers you the opportunity to really document a portion of your life by writing about it every day. It's a commitment, but it's worth it.",
    "I think this would be a hard class to not go all-in on. As a mostly STEM person, writing themes was a fun break from whatever else I had to do, and I put a lot of time into it. If you're willing to do that, then definitely take it. I think that the one-on-one attention to your writing is really worth it, though the lectures are kinda bad. But they're only once a week, and every other week is a guest lecture. Tutor experience seems to range from \"pretty alright\" to \"incredible.\"",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants to write. For the sake of writing, but also to improve, to see what your writing is like, and to experience the writing of your peers first hand.",
    "Definitely take Daily Themes because it's one of those \"Yale\" classes - as we were often reminded of.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "It's definitely worth doing if you're interested in writing! The prompts are super fun. The lecture is not, but it's only once a week, and a good time to just chill out.",
    "Absolutely . A lot of fun if you enjoy creative writing",
    "Yes, Daily Themes is a fun class that really improves your writing ability and you would be remiss to not apply!",
    "Yes, it's a fun class that is entirely dependent on a good tutor and how much work you put into it. No final project, so it goes easy on you at the end of the semester.",
    "The course is fantastic as long as you get a good writing tutor. Really depends on the luck of the draw.",
    "Yes in general, although not as it is currently organized with Zarin lecturing. Also- it's a lot of work! you're writing every day! sometimes about things you don't feel like writing about! I think it would be more rewarding to take earlier in your college career, rather than as a senior, because you're just not as engaged.",
    "Yes! This is a wonderful way of improving your writing skills in a fun and engaging environment with a lot of feedback provided.",
    "For sure! Though I've never been in a class where the lectures were so horrendous. I will say though that the prompts and personal tutoring more than makes up for it.",
    "You know what you're gonna get -- you're gonna write (just about) every day and you're going to get very tired of it somewhere in the middle and then break through at the end, triumphantly. You will write a lot of garbage, and you will write some really nice things that will help you to better understand yourself and the people and things and world around you. As a bonus, you will sit through twelve lectures. Some of them will be very boring. Some of them will be a little less boring. One or two of them may actually be enjoyable. Take it, really, if you want to write until you run out of ideas, until \"writing from the heart\" isn't an option because you already got it all out. See what happens when you dig past that and learn to write from whatever's left. Your guts, I guess. Learn to write from your guts.",
    "Daily themes is a great course if you want to write more for a semester and figure out where your strengths and weakness lie. I always wanted to keep a journal but was too scared, and so this was the perfect class for me to take. It's a great class to take senior year (either Credit\/D or for a grade...though you might want to start off C\/D\/F) because the work is done by the last week of classes! Doing the themes can be a bit annoying at times, although mostly just when you don't like the prompt, but you get used to it and if your tutor is like mine, he\/she will probably understand if you choose to ignore\/modify the prompt.",
    "I would recommend daily themes to all students who attend yale college",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this course for everyone who is trying to improve writing skills. If he\/she doesn't want to become a writer.",
    "For anyone who enjoys writing or might, I would recommend this course.",
    "The course is a very interesting course. It's such a wonderful experience to write every day. Your writing improves tremendously. However, the lectures are ridiculous. Professor Zarin seems to just talk in circles for the entire lecture, and it's difficult to get to the crux of what she's trying to say.

    "I would definitely recommend the course as it will improve indispensable writing skills.",
    "yes",
    "Loved this class! It was one of my favorite classes I've ever taken. It's basically a credit to journal every day and meet with someone once a week to talk about your writing. Maybe this class would only be good for you if you know that setting aside an hour each day to write\/revise would not stress you out!",
    "Yes! If you like your tutor, go for it--they are the center of your experience of Daily Themes, and if you have a good one, it's a really fun and rewarding course, whether you consider yourself a \"writer\" or not.",
    "I\"m very torn. I think it's a wonderful idea for a class, and I do think there's nothing quite like writing every day. I have definitely gotten faster and more comfortable simply putting words on a page. However, the class had so much potential and it really let me down. I knew about Daily Themes before I even came to Yale. I wanted to take it more than any other class. I was so excited when got into the class - and I was disappointed. The lectures were a major let down - I got absolutely nothing out of them. (Except for the guest lecture about place - that one was good.) More than that, I was really disappointed by the prompts. I wanted them to push me, to challenge me, not to frustrate me. The prompts were either too vague to be helpful, or too specific to have enough room to be creative. I was expecting so much more, I was expecting a class that changed my life, and I simply didn't get it. I can only remember five or six of the themes I wrote, and that is sad.",
    "I would, if you are intending to put a great deal of work into it. You will only get out of it what you individually put into it--the professor is not the reason to take the class, and in fact she's a great deterrent for many. I stuck through it with her and her terrible, meandering lectures only because I wanted to keep improving my writing with my tutor and to keep the discipline of it--I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. That is a good facet of the course--the feeling of pride at the sheer volume of work you create by the end of it.",
    "Yes, take if you want to be forced to write every day and grow.",
    "I loved this course and would recommend it to another student as long as Cynthia Zarin is replaced.",
    "This class was one of my best experiences at Yale despite the fact that the lectures are worse than useless. My tutor was incredible, attentive, and thoughtful--I made remarkable growth as a writer in just a semester. I think any student at Yale could benefit from writing every day and talking once a week about how they can improve. That being said the lectures should either be optional or given by someone who has any concrete advice about writing to give. I am sure professor Zarin is a wonderful person and a talented writer, but she should not be leading this class. Her lectures were rambling anecdotes about her own writing that offered nothing of substance to her audience. Still though, she managed to fill them with references to her ultra-privileged lifestyle in Manhattan and her frustration with those who didn't share her experiences. The lectures were an ordeal to say the least.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The closer the relationship you have with your tutor, the better! The lectures are not very useful but the practice of writing is.",
    "Take it! My writing improved tremendously, and it's such a special feeling to be part of such a Yale institution.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course for the experience of speaking to the tutors each week--most are kind, brilliant individuals who will bring attention to minute details in your writing. ESPECIALLY take if it you get Shifra, without whom this course would have been awful."
