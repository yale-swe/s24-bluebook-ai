    "Students interested in energy policy, this is a must take course",
    "I thought that this was going to be a course on energy laws in the U.S., instead we really just reviewedthe same policy issues that we discuss in other energy classes already in less detail, with less accuracy, and with less structure. The final paper was somewhat conducive to learning because we could dive into an area of policy of our own choosing so I could think about something that I hadn't worked on in other classes, but at the same time it was so open ended and there was so little direction given as to what was expected that it made it very difficult and stressful to figure out what to do. The readings were interesting, especially Graetz and Yergin, but the assignments were too long to really complete each week and they did not really teach us energy laws as much as energy issues over time."

    "Bringing the authors in to discuss their books.",
    "The excuse to read Dan Yergin's The Quest and Graetz's The End of Energy.",

    "Professor Elliott never had a clear\/comprehensive format, so discussions were all over the place and difficult to follow. It would be much more interesting to have a formatted and outlined discussion of U.S. energy policy tied back to the readings and with case studies than the format employed. I would have learned much more had a different approach been used.",
    "The course has met my expectations and i like the way the present approach.",
    "It would help to have a few more up-to-date short readings to connect how historical policymaking has shaped what is going on today.",
    "I really wish Elliot would not have interrupted people during their final presentation, it just threw everyone and everything off.",
    "The professor conducts the class with no structure and rather than guiding the discussion, he often uses the time to rant about his own opinions which are not always grounded in facts."
