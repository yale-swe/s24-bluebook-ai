   "comments": [
    "Directed Studies Literature covers a wide variety texts from Homer to Dante. We write three papers throughout the semester on varying topics. I would emphatically recommend this class to anyone that was considering taking it!",
    "I would describe it as an intensive literature class. I would definitely recommend it but I would warn the student that there is a lot of reading and we are held to a very high standard both in class and in our written work.",
    "If you love literary analysis, take this course. It is a wonderful survey of Western literature, and the essays force you to upyour thinking skills by several notches. However, a love of reading is *not* necessarily enough for this class. I love to read, and thought that DS would be a perfect opportunity to familiarize myself with the classics, which I never got to read in high school, but I discovered that I was in over my head--not in terms of the workload, but in the level of analysis required in the discussion sections and for the essays. Because of this, I will not be taking DS next semester. This does not seem to be a course for beginners, even though it is more topically broad than many literature courses at Yale.",
    "Since you can't really take DS lit on its own.... Literature honestly made DS worth it for me to take. I loved getting an exposure to a lot of the canon, as well as just exposure to different professors in the lectures from different departments. I don't know how much I loved my lit experience because of the professor vs. the curriculum (I suspect it's more of the former), but overall Literature was the best out of the three sections for me.",
    "DS Lit Fall Semester is a wide survey of many of the greatest\/most influential works from the Greek epics and tragedy to the Bible and Dante's Divine Comedy. It often requires massive amounts of reading (and with Professor Billings focused on close readings as well as how they related to the whole, familiarity with the entire text really was important), but that's the nature of the epic scope of DS. The reading was wonderful (highlights including the Divine Comedy and particular works of Greek tragedy), and it was particularly neat to see inter-textual echoes between the works of literature as well as across the DS readings (Aristotelian philosophy with Dante's Christian afterlife, for instance). By virtue of the scope, DS Lit doesn't allow you to really soak in the texts (heck, people have spent their entire lives studying just one or two of these works), but you gain a very good understanding of key passages and interesting aspects of each. For me, this semester has been wonderful - if often stressful and sleep-deprived - and has kindled a deep love for and interest in Greco-Roman Lit",
    "DS Lit is incredible. Terrific books, amazing lectures throughout, and great professors. While all the fall Lit professors are terrific, Billings is really as good as they get. He's not easy, especially near the beginning of the semester, and will really push you, but you will appreciate and love him as the semester ends. I've improved more in his class than any of my other DS sections. He's also incredibly accessible and helpful \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0make sure that you go to office hours as often as you can. His feedback is terrific: he will write more feedback on papers than you wrote, and will set up individual appointments to hand back papers. Did I mention that he's probably the smartest person I've ever met? Don't take Billings if you want an easy semester, but if you're willing to stretch yourself a bit, try as hard as you can to get him. Seriously, Billings (and DS Lit) are amazing.",
    "Directed Studies: Literature was unexpectedly my favorite of the DS classes. The works read are some of the most essential, yet also most interesting and moving, of Western literature. The lectures were almost always mind-opening, while section was also a treat with Professor Billings. He has an incredible depth of knowledge and insight, endearing himself to all his students. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take this class or this section if you expect an easy A, but if you want a fascinating, challenging course from one of the best up-and-coming Yale professors, take this one.",
    "Professor Billings's class is incredibly rewarding. He stimulates you to take notice of the contours, the texture of a text -- the things that you wouldn't notice at first glance. As it is incredibly rewarding, it is also extremely challenging. Be prepared to pour hours and hours into your papers only to receive difficult grades. You will gain so much from his section.",
    "If you are assigned to Professor Billings for section, I would suggest you keep with him. I would strongly suggest you keep with him. Actually, just keep with him. He will make you work hard, and those essays won't be pretty, but he's fair and fairly brilliant at teaching.",
    "Yes, you cover a lot of material with more depth than I was expecting. The weekly lectures are especially good.",
    "The best class I've taken at Yale. Billings is a phenomenal professor. The reading list is uniformly fantastic\u00e2\u0080\u0094I thought I wouldn't be the sort of person to complain about not being able to treat every work in depth, but that really is the one drawback of the course. This class was probably the hardest thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done and more than worth it; you'll be consistently tortured over writing your papers and consistently astonished by the insights you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll walk away with after every class. If you want a solid foundation in Western classical literature and\/or to learn how to really think about literature, take it."
