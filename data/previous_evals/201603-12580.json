    "I learned a lot about the history of animation, which was interesting and enjoyable (watched a ton of neat films). Also pondered some really intriguing questions raised by the medium. Theres much more depth and uncertainty than you might first think and lots of theoretical issues with broad implications for society and certain cinema. Worked more on my ability to write about film.",
    "How to analyze an animation.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of \"animation\" as it applies to cinema and television. It not only explored the varying definitions of animation in a theoretical sense, but also offered insight into the historical trajectory of the genre.",
    "You learn about the history of animation, how to apply film theory to animation, what concerns and issues are specific to animation and its medium, how animation complicates cinema, etc. You also learn how to read animation as a medium that talks about itself.",
    "A thorough historical overview of the history of animation, as well as a strong introduction to and survey of the theoretical landscape surrounding it."

   "comments": [
    "Sometimes I felt it would have been better as a lecture rather than a seminar.",
    "The design of the course is good, with background on Monday, the films of the week that night, and then discussion of the films on Wednesday. The larger assignments are also paced well. The seminar style is nice, since theres lots to discuss, but it also made it painfully clear when plenty of people hadnt done the reading. Left a few of us basically alternating answers to Professor Gerows questions. To be fair, some of the readings were rather dense or super theoretical, but that goes with the territory. But hypothetically, the course works very well.",
    "Although the readings were useful for understanding the lessons of the course, it would be nice to have a little less in the future (or make some of the readings optional). I appreciated the availability of the readings, but sometimes, felt the workload intimidated some students in a way that hurt class discussion\/participation.",
    "It gives a good clear history of how animation develops and the primary concerns with it. It does a good job situating these theorists within cinematic theory. It could do a little bit more in analyzing animation as a reflection or a study of a particular culture (it does this with the Soviet animation and a little bit with the animation).",
    "An amazing class, although I'm not in love with group projects."

    "This is a good class, a little dry at times, but overall a great overview of the history of animation and the different aspects of it. I'm not a film studies major, but my inexperience was not a problem. Workload is light but the readings can be a bit long.",
    "An interesting course, if you want to learn more about animated cinema from around the world and the interesting theoretical challenges and implications of the medium. The assignments arent bad; a close analysis of a short, a fairly chill presentation on an animator, and a solid final paper. The readings can get a bit dense and\/or theoretical at points, but try to do them, because they arent ever that long, and it makes the discussion a lot less awkward when Professor Gerow doesnt constantly have to ask and reframe questions that people clearly have no idea about. It definitely is not just history but theory, so be prepped for that. The films are fun - youll see some you know and love and many youve never encountered - though be prepared for the screenings get a bit longer towards the end. Take it because youre interested in learning more about cinema, not because you just want to watch cartoons.",
    "Yes, very interesting course and very responsible professor.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in both the history and meaning (theory) of animation. The material could be relevant not only to film studies majors, but also art majors, history majors, and general animation enthusiasts.",
    "Yes, it's a thorough history, but it's not a joke. It's not a ridiculously hard class, but this is a serious study of animation, and Professor Gerow really cares about the subject and wants you to learn.",
    "Absolutely. Learning the theory of animation is both fun and genuinely eye-opening. Changes the way one looks at cartoons.",
    "I would recommend this course for those very interested in film theory or being introduced to film theory. Given the topics covered in the course, the reading and work tends to get into the very theoretical, detaching itself, in part, from the films viewed to get a deeper understanding of the mechanics of animation as a form and as a medium. While this is useful, it can be harrowing."
