    "Yes, definitely, this is a very good chance to development critical thinking and learn to appreciate literature inside and outside your own fields.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. You learn a lot and become much more adept at reading primary literature, but definitely be prepared for a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because it is a good introduction to the relevant research topics in the MMPP Track.",
    "Path680 is very interesting and also challenging. It makes you become familiar with brand new topics and helps you learn to think critically about scientific research. It has week to week work, as opposed to other classes with tests every so often."

    "This course further strengthened my literature reading skills and introduced me to topics I might not have otherwise come across.",
    "This course expanded my base of knowledge about different scientific approaches and techniques. It gave me a nugget of knowledge in several very different areas, and made me feel confident that I would be able to understand new scientific areas and questions thrown my way in the future."
