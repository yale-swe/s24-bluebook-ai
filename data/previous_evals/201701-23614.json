    "Some really interesting reading that was helpful in placing FES students within the context of a broader historical and cultural movement. That said, I think the course needs to be workshopped a bit in order to receive higher marks. It was the first time teaching this course so many of these issues were just growing pains, but I do think at times it felt a bit all over the place.",
    "I strongly feel that this course would benefit from being 3-credits rather than 1-credit. There is a wealth of interesting readings we were not able to dig into because students were less focused on this course than they might otherwise be if it were a higher credit load. Moreover, I believe a course of this topic should be central to our learning at FES; how are we to be the next generation of environmental leaders if we don't have a course that explores what it even means to be an environmentalist, or the multi-facetted experiences of what it has meant and could mean in America.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The professor clearly put an incredible amount of time and effort into the preparation of the course and it showed. As the first time this class was offered, it was a delight to be part of it and participate in the lively discussion that the reading and the professor helped bring about. I hope that this class is taught in the future, either as a 1 credit or as a 3 credit, as it provided a space for learning and discussing American Environmentalism in a way in which it is not offered in other classes. It allowed for questioning and for developing our ideas in real time as we discussed the topics, which is a unique opportunity for F&ES students.",
    "This class is a gem. I've learned so much about the philosophical AND practical aspects of American environmentalism in this seminar. This is truly a seminar in comparison to others I've taken at FES. There was so much brainstorming, debating, and knowledge & experience sharing in this class that I never wanted to be absent from it. To be honest, why Josh isn't made a tenured faculty at the Yale Law School baffles me. I don't think there are that many faculty on campus that can teach like him. He is extremely eloquent in speaking and takes extra care in facilitating the class. I don't recall meeting a lecturer so organized, energetic, and supportive in my career at FES."

   "comments": [
    "- Wide range of readings, covering different topics and in different formats and styles - class discussion on both philosophical and practical aspects of environmentalism - policy implications discussion",
    "Readings and class discussions were really interesting - helpful in working through ideas presented throughout the course.",
    "The best aspect of this class was the enriching discussion focusing on class readings led by Professor Galperin. Professor Galperin always asked pointed questions and tailored the discussion to the topics the students raised in class.",
    "Josh is a great teacher and really good at facilitating discussions, adding his thoughts and questions while still letting us talk.",
    "The instructor encourages open conversation about potentially challenging topics in class.",
    "Great readings! I really enjoyed getting the background information on american environmentalism.",
    "I was glad to have the extra push to read some works from the environmental cannon I had never actually read. I have ordered a few books for this summer to continue reading in some of these areas.",
    "The lightning presentations at the beginning of each class by Professor Galperin. The readings were all really insightful as well and provided great background for discussion. I'm glad this was a class that allowed for discussion, which was largely thanks to the circular set up of the classroom.",
    "As advertised, this course presented me with a lot of interesting material detailing the evolution of the various forms of environmentalism we see today.",
    "I love the seminar format. I at times felt that I was in the ancient Greek school. I love how every student brings in his\/her own professional experience and knowledge to the class discussion. The class is so much richer because of that. And obviously, Josh is what makes the class great. I hope the Yale Law School can see that and put him on tenure track..."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "More structure on weekly basis. More emphasis on writing responses. Overview lectures rarely were kept under 10 minutes which was how they were intended, often cutting into class discussion. A larger diversity of voices presented through readings would have been welcome.",
    "I think that Professor Galperin could add clearer guidelines for the writing assignments. It would have helped to have more guidance prior to submitting the assignments.",
    "Some of the different weeks' topics felt really similar.",
    "The readings I feel we spent far too much time reading out-of-date conceptions of environmental incrementalism put forth by individuals such as Dan Esty and not nearly enough time exploring authors who articulate an environmentalism that is not focused on continued wealth and materials consumption and accumulation. Moreover, if the course were 3-credits instead of 1-credit, students would have more freedom to engage with the material, challenge themselves, and participate more deeply.",
    "Class discussions were not well focused, it was hard for me to follow, even when I had done all of the readings.",
    "In general I found the discussions in class to be too abstract. I usually like thinking about big-picture, even theoretical, stuff, but this class felt un-grounded on too frequent a basis. At times I wasn't sure what other students (or Josh) were talking about, and I found it frustrating that Josh didn't do more to re-ground the conversation when it wandered\/became highly confusing. I also wasn't a huge fan of the rapid fire presentations at the beginning, although I got better at absorbing them throughout the semester. It's a lot of fast talking to absorb in 5 minutes directly after walking into class. Lastly, I didn't always think the group of readings selected each week cohered. Sometimes I would read the pieces and struggle to see the connection. I think it would have been helpful to delve more deeply into some of these individual readings given how fascinating they were, so maybe the lesson is that less can be more.",
    "The way that Professor Glaperin led the discussions at times did not allow for the smooth transition of ideas. I would suggest for the future to be a bit more deliberate in how long each person speaks for and how the discussion is led in order to best keep the flow of the conversation and ideas going. This means that the professor would have to mention at the beginning of class how long each person should speak for and also be willing to stop people and re-direct the conversation if necessary.",
    "There were too many people in the course for really robust conversations; while the readings and discussion opportunities were fantastic, the class should have been capped at 10 or 15.",
    "The topics of discussion change constantly in class. Students seem to be more interested in raising their own new points then pursuing one topic\/argument to explore it further. There's a virtue to breadth, but depth too, deserves exploration. Josh can facilitate this further in the future."

    "Interested in learning about American Environmentalism holistically, not just from one discipline. Curious about the policy implications of some of the theoretical and academic work I've done related to the environment.",

    "3 reasons: I was interested in the topic, I wanted to support this type of course being offered at FES, and I'd heard Josh was a good professor.",
    "Overall I have been severely disappointed in the course offerings at FES and wanted, in my last semester, to take a course at the school rather than continue to seek courses elsewhere throughout Yale.",
    "I wanted to learn more about the environmnetal movement as a whole.",
    "For the reasons given above.",
    "This was the exact kind of intellectual course that I hoped to take when coming to graduate school -- where we, as students, are introduced to readings that we have mostly not yet read and then given the opportunity to discuss as a group the ideas within the readings. I also enjoyed the fact that our discussion was varied in opinion, we didn't always agree, but it felt like a safe space to discuss our differing approached to environmentalism and our differing understandings of the ideas presented in class. I also was looking forward to taking a course with Josh Galperin, as I had him as my professor of EPC and really enjoy his teaching style.",

    "Yes, the knowledge I gained from the course met my expectations. Discussing the topics with an open mind gave me guiding questions that will shape my understanding of environmentalism. Though there were some conclusions that came from discussion, I think the most important aspects of each discussion centered around the subtleties of the issues and the different competing considerations that would ideally be acknowledged in a conclusion.",
    "Yes - learned a lot about different schools of environmentalist thought.",
    "Yes and no. Again, I strongly feel this course should be 3-credits rather than 1-credit. I also think the course would benefit from bringing in additional readings from authors outside the traditional economic-environmentalism that Yale so consistently highlights.",
    "Yes",
    "I was hoping this class would act as a stimulating weekly book group, which didn't end up materializing. I was glad I read some of the works I had never read, but I was frustrated how much it felt like we were jumping around and how abstract and confusing the discussions ended up being.
