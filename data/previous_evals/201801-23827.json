   "comments": [
    "The course felt a little disorganized, especially once the guest speakers started lecturing. Would be nice to have a better feeling of what the trajectory of the learning material is.",
    "I think this course's main weakness is its lack of structure. There does not seem to be any overarching organization. The guest speakers were interesting, but I think they also contributed to this feeling of not knowing the key takeaways of the course.",
    "It is an amazing class.",
    "This course could be more organized both in terms of lecture and content structure.",
    "Strengths: Great guest lectures Weakness: Unstructured",
    "great",
    "Strengths: guest lectures Weaknesses: N\/A",
    "the textbook has been really helpful for working on the assignment, however, by saying this, I hope the context in lectures can be more closely related\/followed the textbook.",
    "A good introduction to the field Doesn't really prepare one for a career in the field",
    "This course is excellent. Kind Professor, well designed class, evenly distributed workload every week, easy exams. I really think it's worth taking.",
    "Dr. Makuch evidently knows the subject matter in great detail as he formerly worked as a special government employee at the FDA. However, the course was at times difficult to digest and could have been presented differently - sometimes it felt like it was all over the place. I came out not really understanding where someone in public health could work in regulatory affairs - even though the professor mentioned several times how possible that was. I am really interested in the topic but unfortunately was a bit disappointed in the course. The subject matter was interesting but the use of several guest speakers didn't seem warranted. It might be improved if the material was presented differently. The course text was also outdated and the inclusion of more current events\/articles to prepare for class would be helpful.",
    "This class is a comprehensive intro to regulatory affairs. But it depends on students on interests a lot.",
    "It gave nice insight into what is going on in the real world. There is a good connection between the content and its impact on Public Health.",
    "Great guest speakers and real life case studies",
    "The speakers were amazing.",
    "Strengths- guest speakers and the professor's in-depth knowledge of the pharma industry and regulatory process. Weaknesses- the powerpoint and other class material are really disjointed, and the first midterm was a really strange method of assessment.",
    "Strengths- a very practical course that teaches you the in's and out's of drug development and approval. The speakers were all great and brought real-world examples to the classroom. Weakenesses- a little unorganized with course materials",
    "Good overall introduction to the regulatory field. I liked that the course not only focused on the US, but also the respective regulatory bodies in the EU and Asia. I would've liked course materials (powerpoints, homework solutions, and important announcements) to have been released in a more timely manner though. The last month of class was all guest speakers, which was a good illustration of how class material relates to current industry.",
    "Weaknesses: Messy lecture notes. The professor did not care about teaching. Professor Makuch should really spend some time to correct the typos and improve the structure of the lecture notes and slides.",
    "This class was pretty poor. The highlight of this class is the guest speakers that came to talk about their work in the industry. Some of these speakers lead a class that actually taught us a concept, but many just shared their experiences through stories. Both were valuable. When the professor taught, he more or less lectured off the slides, intermittently throwing in stories that seem helpful and interesting at first, until you realize that he doesn't quite know the details of different things he's mentioning. I think his knowledge base is pretty limited and the greatest benefit of taking this class is perhaps the knowledge he has about some of the opportunities in the field and his connections."

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0His remarks\/references sometimes go over the heads of the students, but its nice to have a professor at YSPH with a sense if humor.",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is really professional and has tons of experience in the field. I cannot think of other person in YSPH can teach this module if not him. I hope he can provide the materials following an easy-to-difficult flow. This field is really new for all of us, and thus, let's start slow.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0N\/A",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Excellent professor, very kind to all students, and even care about students job hunting, which is very warm, helpful and friendly",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is really knowledgeable on the subject matter. I really appreciated his incorporation of a current AdCom meeting about an opioid and discussing that current event in class. He has a lot of wisdom to impart to students, but the way he presented material was at times very difficult.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0He is funny and very successful experts in regulatory affairs",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Professor Makuch is full of stories about the industry and gives a lot of real-world examples of how regulations are practically applied. He makes for an interesting speaker and listens to student concerns very well, even outside of class. He also frequently alerts us of opportunities (internships, conferences) in the field, which I appreciate. However, I would've liked to have a bit more feedback from him on the midterm (aside from just a numeric grade) prior to finals week.",

   "comments": [
    "Groovy",
    "This course is required for the Regulatory Affairs track, which is the only reason I took it. It's just like Clinical Trials with Dr. Makuch, but with even less structure and transparency. I would not recommend it to those who do not need to take it, as you won't learn much.",
    "It's a great class!",
    "Would not recommend. Plenty of courses that are much more useful.",
    "great",
    "take if you want to have a taste of regulatory affairs. you will get at least an overview of the major contents.",
    "N\/A",
    "Great course. Worth taking",
    "If a student is really interested in regulatory affairs and\/or trying to discern that interest, it is a good course to take to get your feet wet with the topic. Though it is good information to have in general and understanding how the FDA works is vital to public health practitioners, a career in regulatory affairs is likely going to be for someone with scientific background and\/or biostatistics. It doesn't seem like there is much of a place for others in this career path. The course includes several guest speakers who were very informative but ultimately the information could have been presented much differently\/ more systematically.",
    "This course is easy and allows you to get a better understanding at the complexity of regulatory affairs, and the behind the scenes of what goes on in the FDA.",
    "Great intro into Reg Affaires",
    "Greatly recommend if youre interested in the FDA workings",
    "I would recommend it if you didn't take Clinical Trials because it gives you a good overview of the regulatory process. However, if you've taken clinical trials and aren't seeking to fulfill requirements for the Regulatory Affairs track then I would skip this class.",
    "This is a great course for learning how the pharmaceutical industry works, including drug development and drug approvals. I enjoyed it and appreciated the amount of work and amount of real-world experiences Dr. Makuch brought to the course!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in pharmaceutical regulation (we didn't cover medical devices or combination products).",
    "I will not recommend the course. The lecture notes were messy. The professor did not care about teaching. Professor Makuch should really spend some time to correct the typos and improve the structure of the lecture notes and slides.",
    "I guess the Regulatory Affairs track could be important in name to some people, but I wouldn't really recommend any of the core classes, especially this one. I would really recommend that the school find better professors that can make this track worth pursuing for more than just the name"
