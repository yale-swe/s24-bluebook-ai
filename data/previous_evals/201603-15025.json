    "The quality of this class really depends on the classmates that you have. I really enjoyed this class and feel that I did learn a ton from this. For the second semester, I also loved the groupmates for my GS brief which led to such a pleasant experience for me. Managed to read a lot of the classics that I always wanted to, and being able to discuss grand strategic things was just a really fun and enjoyable experience. The summer project component was also excellent and should definitely be continued.",
    "This class constantly made me think about and question the assumptions I hold - about politics, international relations, and even personal relationships. Working on the Marshall briefs was also a really valuable exercise in learning how to work effectively with a team of people, and in learning how to present an argument effectively and respond to criticism of it.",
    "Synthesising material from various disciplines and mediums into compelling arguments, making meaningful connections between the academic material and real-life scenarios, understanding the dynamics of the US government specifically and the international system as a whole. Most importantly, however, this class really teaches you life skils: how to make decisions under pressure, how to collaborate in a team, how to learn from your failures, how to apply what you've learned to real-life situations.",
    "This semester of Grand Strategy mostly revolves around the skills of presenting and persuading.",
    "I learned a great deal about collaborative work, due as much to the expert guidance of my professors as the process of working together on the brief. I also became intimate with the bureaucratic mechanics of government and associated roadblocks to progress on issues of grad strategic importance.",
    "GS allowed me to apply the theories pertaining to grand strategy to real life scenarios in what has been one of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "Grand Strategy has provided the opportunity to examine the historical roots of modern policy issues, and to constantly be examining the way other players and other factors constantly force those issues to alter. This course, particularly the policy brief, was a great chance to practice understanding nuance, taking on risks, and conveying my ideas with strength anyway.",
    "I developed practical skills - how to think like a policy-maker, within a theoretical background, which I thought was really helpful",
    "Grand Strategy sets itself apart by its emphasis on teaching both knowledge and skills. While the material covers everything from politics, philosophy, geopolitics to public health, skills range from leadership to presentation.",
    "I gained presentation ability and teamwork--far more practical skills than most of my other classes. The class ended up being far more interesting than planned because we had to change the framework for the Marshall briefs we do given the election, which I thought was a useful exercise. In addition, the mentorship of Professor Bradley was invaluable.",
    "This class gave me lots of experience working in a group, organizing and giving a presentation. Basically it was very helpful for teaching me strategies for working with other people and also challenging me to think through a completely different lens.",
    "Part 2 of the course is by far the more applicable, interesting and crucial part of the course. Learnt how to present complicated topics to principals in the form of presentations\/written briefs. This is a skill at least 80-90% of us will have to use in the real world. Can't stress enough how important it is. Over the course of the two semesters we also learnt how to distil large theories\/famous texts into soundbites or key components that could be digested in short papers, another important skill. And then of course we spent plenty of time with some of the best theoreticians\/practitioners Yale has to offer!",
    "-a framework to view current events\/global policy issues on a macro level of inter-related effects, rather than getting overly bogged down in the weeds of particular issues and events -experience working in a group setting with other highly driven type-A people (and being able to overcome the dynamic of \"all leaders, no followers\") -exposure to pretty remarkable academic and policymakers in course dinners, guest lectures, and advisors -an ability to pursue a fun and engaging summer project to travel and soak up experience while trying to apply the lessons of the course to your chosen issue"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The challenge facing this course especially in the first semester is that there are so many useful GS things to read but only so little weeks. I strongly believe that one of the weeks should include the grand strategy of small \/ middle-sized states -- simply because majority of the world comprise small or medium states and studying their strategies just seems to be so much more crucial than just studying those of major powers. I think there is much to learn from studying the grand strategy of small states such as Singapore. I think it is fascinating, and it puts everyone on a level playing field. This is because many of the readings are familiar for those who have done DS or who are experts in American history, and I think it's important that people come into this class to learn something they don't already know. For the 1st semester, I think Sun Tzu, Thucydides, Augustus, Machiavelli, Clausewitz Lincoln, Alinsky should be kept. I didn't really get much value from Kant and the constitution, and there maybe should not be 2 weeks on the European order. Aung San Suu Kyi was new, but I think we can bring back female leaders from the past semesters! For the second semester, I thought the syllabus was great. However, there should be a better way to enforce that people go to their assigned classrooms during the GS briefs - for some briefs there were so little people in the classroom because either everyone is in the other classroom, or those who have presented are no longer showing up to class. I would also like to suggest that it might be beneficial to mix things up a little -- currently everyone picks a topic they are experts in for their brief. However, professors should encourage that students pick a topic they are NOT experts in but could still be interested in and that should be their brief instead. This seems to be more reflective of real life; where you don't always have the topic that you are an expert in but still have to do the necessary research to talk about it. Also, it ensures that people don't already come into the brief with a pre-determined answer or mindset and can expand their creativity.",
    "I much preferred the first module of this course. This semester we were supposed to apply insights from first semester, but other than that the connection between the two modules was rather vague. We also didn't have as many dinners this semester, which is a shame.",
    "The beginning of the semester, in which different lecturers came every week, felt a little bit disjointed. It was also hard to have a class discussion when all 40 of us were in the same room together. The second part of the semester however, when we did the Marshall briefs, was a really intense and valuable learning experience.",
    "This class is an excellent combination of theory and practice. The second semester in particular is a real boot camp: from high-stress briefs to the intense crisis simulation, you really learn what it's like to work in government. Despite the stress and the pressure, however, the class is invaluable for learning how to work in a team and make informed decisions under pressure. The main flaw of the class, in my opinion, is a lack of mentorship when it comes to the summer project, and particularly the paper that accompanies it. To address this, I think the instructors should implement a more rigorous proposal process for the project, urging the students to solidify their plans and research goals sooner, so they can have more time to refine and specify them and have a clearer idea about what exactly their deliverable at the end will look like.",
    "The biggest weakness of this course is the way in which it is graded. A surprising number of people took this course Credit\/D\/Fail this semester. Among the many high-achieving students, there is a sense that the grading is unfair between graders and does not account for the time and energy put into projects. Because grading is split between two professors with their own expertise, projects on topics beyond their scope seem to be slighted in the evaluation process.",
    "Adding more graduate students to the class would broaden the background of the students.",
    "Professor Bradley has done a wonderful job of expanding the program to make it more inclusive. I think the briefing portion of the course (i.e. this term) has very few flaws. Two suggestions: 1) Eliminate the first seminar on whether Globalization will continue. The class was a slapdash attempt at a 35-person seminar whose purpose was to answer a mostly empirical question for which only some people in the room had any evidence to offer. Either assign readings for this class or cut it. 2) It would've been nice to have a final class for reflection and closure, even if this meant that GS would meet for the last time during reading week.",
    "Strengths: Good emphasis on practical skills, like working well (as opposed to just working) with a group and presenting to a demanding audience-- the first time at Yale that I've been forced to orally defend my ideas during semi-hostile questioning. Amazing opportunities for directed research and interaction with policy makers. Crisis simulation was absurd and really fun. Weaknesses: Many students (myself included) were somewhat disengaged by the second semester in particular. I felt also that the summer research could have been better integrated into the course itself, maybe through short in-class presentations or an outside-of-class reception with student presentations. Generally, too much self-importance. And some weird tension between the new guard and old guard.",
    "The group project in the second semester is highly dependent on the strength of your group. Some are graduate students who don't care about the grade given to your group. Just a warning.",
    "Greatly enjoyed both the first semester curriculum and the content of the second semester briefs. I did find the discussion more effective in the split-class seminar setting, overall.",
    "This course has so many resources - in both faculty, students, and opportunities. It's really breathtaking. It could leverage those resources better, and especially make the second semester into smaller- sized seminars. Spring semester could also have smaller seminars too",
    "I think that this course is on its way to a lot of improvement--in terms of the diversity of the class and of the course material. I didn't enjoy the plenary format of the first half of this semester, but I hear that's going to change also. I think getting rid of that format will induce more people to feel more responsibility to actually do the reading.",
    "This semester of GS was actually super solid since it focused on helping you develop an important skill. The first half of the semester before the marshall briefs was a bit weaker since we were all in one room and only learning vague topics. Perhaps that should be changed. But the Marshall Briefs were a great opportunity and the ending simulation was fun.",
    "Strengths - the briefing process from start to finish is a remarkable exercise and one of the very best things I've got to do at Yale academically; the quality and availability of the professors is remarkable; studying GS in real-world issues is very illuminating. Weaknesses - sometimes feedback feels very disjointed and hard to act upon, especially for the briefing; sometimes can be hard to see how the whole course \"comes together\" as opposed to just being a series of disparate, disconnected pieces.",
    "strengths: -caliber of guests and brainpower available in the room at any given time -summer project -supplementary lectures, events, and discussions -feedback on group project presentation skills weaknesses: -although improved since the previous iteration (per the testimony of previous GSers), the second half of the fall semester, with group presentations, did devolve into people being on their laptops rather than following the thread of the presentations. I'm not sure how to ameliorate this, other than banning laptops, but I think the steps taken to more greatly involve students in the feedback process is a step in the right direction -occasionally arbitrary grading (e.g. \"Great ideas, research, and structure -- but writing has too long sentences for my taste, B+)"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, but note that the quality of class will depend a lot on your classmates.",
    "There are many perks to GS. Cool dinners, exposure to a variety of professors, David Brooks. But there was no real teaching this semester, just self-directed preparation for briefings.",
    "I'm very glad that I took this class because it pushed me out of my comfort zone, and helped me develop my critical thinking and presentation skills. That said, it is not for everyone, and I know that some of my classmates had significant problems with the way it was taught.",
    "Writing up summer research is a great exercise, and you will really learn a lot through the Marshall Briefs (although they are definitely a challenge). Simulation at the end of term is a lot of fun.",
    "This class has changed my life, so I have spent the past year recommending it to fellow students. This class, however, is not for everyone: if you're considering it, you absolutely must be honest with yourself about what it is you're seeking to get out of it. Doing so will not only guide you through the application process but also, if you're lucky to get in, through your experience of the class as well. Getting into GS, for me, was like getting into Yale again, so my priority was to make sure I put in as much work as I possibly can to get as much out of it as possible.",
    "Take the course with the intention of making it better moving forward\/further diversifying\/integrating the program. Can be an amazing experience, but it still has some improving to do. Dr. Bradley is wonderful!",
    "Yes. And if you take the course, attend the dinners.",
    "Definitely",
    "Absolutely excellent. This is one of the few courses at Yale that will actually teach you how to be extremely productive in a group setting (an amazing skill for navigating both Yale and the world beyond). The briefs are fascinating and extremely high-quality. You will put in a lot of work and be proud of what you did. You will meet a great deal of highly impressive people who will introduce you to new knowledge, experience, and challenge. A note: this course is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomachCharles Hill opened the comments on the first briefing with \"That was atrociously awful.\"",
    "Yes. There were times when I regretted the choice to take the class because of the opportunity cost (two other credits). But overall, I learned so much about group dynamics, presentation, policymaking and how to read history for resonances across time in order to learn tangible lessons, that it was definitely worth it. Plus it's just sort of a silly strange experience that I enjoyed from an anthropological perspective. It's rare to find a class with such a strong sense of itself.",
    "Absolutely. No other course at Yale is as comprehensive as Grand Strategy, extending far beyond the classroom and into the real world.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in politics and particularly foreign policy.",
    "Absolutely. During my year in Grand Strategy, I've gotten to explore the roots of change and the structures of power and how those roots form, and those structures interrupted and built again, from a historical perspective, from a modern policy perspective, and from many interdisciplinary lenses. My summer project has completely focused my academic work not only at Yale, but in the future as well. Working with these professors has been a great opportunity, and above all, working with my cohort of students has been such a gift at Yale.",
    "Yes! Really fantastic, learned a ton, made a lot of new friends. And Betsy Bradley is the bomb",
    "Yes definitely!",
    "Definitely take!! I loved my experience in Grand Strategy. The ability to travel this summer was actually amazing and I learned so much. As much as people knock the second semester, I actually learned a lot about working in a group by doing the Marshall Brief and it really helped improve my presentational skills. The end of the class simulation was just super fun.",
    "Yes for sure if you get in. Be prepared to grit your teeth through some of the tougher parts, but give it a chance. Once you wrap your head around it, GS is an amazing subject and a great challenge and privilege to be a part of.",
    "Take GS if you like being in a community of driven, ambitious, interesting people. Contrary to the reputation of GS as the club for future perpetrator of war crimes, GSers tend to have super-interesting specialities and passions (Chinese legal reform, migrant policy, cyber-security) -- and that's only the under-grads. Working with the grad students and military professionals was a real pleasure. When else have your fellow students served as special forces operatives in Afghanistan? Don't take GS if you're doing it solely to check the box that ambitious people do, and if you don't want to spend lots of time working on research and improving your group presentation. Long story short: worth it for the exposure to great guest lectures (US military officers, environmental policymakers, etc), being able to work together with your fellow students, work on your own project over the summer, and think seriously about \"how would I actually try to fix the world's problems if I had the power.\""
