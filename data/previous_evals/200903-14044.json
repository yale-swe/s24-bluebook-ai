It was easy to forget the seminars were being held because they did not happen every week and relied on email announcements about when they would occur. The confusion as to when they were happening and what topics they were discussing was not good and probably caused many students to miss them by accident.",

   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Interesting subject matterWeaknesses: The material was not relevant to my interests or specialty. The course seemed to be tailored more to CDE than SBS.",
    "Some of the lectures were interesting, in particular the ones by Trace Kershaw and Melinda Irwin, but overall I didn't really see the point of the lectures.",
    "First of all, these seminars did not occur during the times they were originally scheduled during which made it hard to attend or even remember that we had a seminar. They were also not very related to SBS but more geared towards CDE, although SBS students were required to attend. Almost none of the speakers were interesting or effective lecturers. I learned absolutely nothing from this course and found it a complete waste of time. This was a real disappointment because I had been looking forward to it and the other divisions had very good seminars.",
    "Interesting topics covered.",
    "While being introduced to the professors' work was beneficial, the scheduling variability made it difficult to attend all sessions. Also, greater attention to the contextual issues- political, economic, etc- would make the seminars more relevant to the goals of SBS students.",
    "It was nice to see some of the faculty research from the division; however, a major shortcoming was the class scheduled immediately following, so that the students would line up outside the door and make quite a bit of noise toward the end of the hour.",
    "It is interesting to hear about the research going on in the department, although it would be nice if the sessions were somehow more interactive or tailored to the students. Perhaps an intro from each individual about their career development and how they got to where they are would be interesting. Since the times and locations at times varied, it was challenging to attend all of the sessions because of conflicts.",
    "Most of the seminars were insightful and interesting.",
    "This course was scheduled as lectures every Thursday at noon. But in reality, the lectures were scattered throughout the week and often only occurred bi-weekly or monthly. Students have other commitments on other days of the week so lectures need to be kept on the scheduled day to ensure enrolled students can actually attend.",
    "I believe that the CDE\/SBS seminar should be broken into two seminars - one with a focus on social and behavioral sciences and one with a focus on chronic disease epidemiology. The vast differences between these two fields seemed to always make one half of the room disinterested with the topic being discussed.Also, please instruct students at the beginning of the semester as to the status of when and what quantity of food will be provided. It was disheartening to arrive at the seminar with either no food and then sit hungry for an hour or bring food from home when a sufficient spread was provided.",
    "lectures were mostly interesting. having>1 in a week was too much.",
    "Some of the lectures were difficult to understand or relate to. Others were very interesting. It was very nice to be served lunch at the lectures.",
    "sometimes interesting",
    "The seminars were usually interesting; occasionally, the presentations were dry. It depended on the person presenting.",
    "One weakness of this course was the limited number of outside lecturers. The majority of lectures were from CDE faculty, while interesting this information can be more effectively gained by other means.",
    "It was an utter waste of time, just like this evaluation form.",
    "This is a required seminar for first-year SBS and CDE students, so there's not really any choice in taking it. I honestly feel like it is somewhat of a waste of time. Some of the topics are really interesting, but I don't quite understand the purpose of these seminars. Also, the scheduling of them is somewhat odd - the class schedule says they are every other Thursday, but in reality they are random Mondays, sometimes announced with very little notice. Also, it is mostly faculty who ask questions, so it seems like a way to have faculty discuss among themselves their research interests while the students look on.",
    "It would be nice if there was a standard sign up sheet that came around? Also since it was from 12-1, it either always conflicted with a lunch meeting, TA office hour, or severely limited our abilities to pick up lunch (for those of us who had lectures before and after). It would be nice if a more convenient time was chosen."

    "The course was not relevant to my area of interest or my division. If you are in SBS, prepare to be bored.",
    "Horrible. If it weren't required for graduation, I would not have attendedat all.",

    "I don't think I need to recommend it because it's mandatory. However, it's nice to have it required, since my schedule got so hectic that I didn't make it to nearly as many talks as I would have liked, so this way I did get to see some presentations. The faculty is very impressive as well, they did a nice job of choosing the talks.",

    "Come for the food and only the topics you are interested in.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this to another student if they had a choice. Some of the seminar topics I would attend voluntarily because they interest me, but other not so much. They seminar is held during lunch and sometimes there are just snacks or no lunch at all (after many of us have been in classes for 3 1\/2 hours straight). I think much can be improved about the structure of these seminars.",
    "brief introduction to staff research projects in CDE\/SBS.",
