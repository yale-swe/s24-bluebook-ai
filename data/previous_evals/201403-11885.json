    "Don't go into this class with the attitude that it's a burdensome requirement and you will get a LOT out of it.",
    "I wasn't sure how this course would go, and it turned out to be a hugely valuable \"brain trust\" for the crafting of our senior projects and artistic work. The coursework itself still needs some fine-tuning, but the seminar is new so this will work itself out. I think the key to this class is having strong, artistic, kind people present to support and advise each other. We certainly had this, and I'm grateful for it.",
    "For any senior creating a project as their thesis, this class is a must. Incredibly helpful.",
    "Yes absolutely. The opportunity to create a senior project in theater studies that is guided by a faculty member is extraordinary. Make sure you and your advisor have similar artistic visions and your advisor will be committed and available to you.",
    "This is a required course but it is SO valuable. It's the opportunity to have knowledgeable people comment on and help you in your work, to form a bond with your fellow senior majors, and to have substantive conversations about theater in practice. I always looked forward to coming to his class - even with its early start time.",
    "If you want to do a senior project in Theater Studies, you need to take this class. I'd say, if you're writing a play, don't bother taking it UNLESS you know you're the type of writer who needs a sense of community to stay on track. Otherwise, the playwrights are left on their own, which can be either scary or liberating, depending on how you work."
