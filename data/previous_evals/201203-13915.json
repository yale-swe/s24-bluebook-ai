    "It was good, went over some really cool areas, lots of sweet stuff. Van Vleck is nice and wants students to do well, but she's pressed for time and very busy. Some of the students in the class were total jocks who didn't seem to care. Some of the students in the class were smart. It's all about who's in the class. Weekly reading replies aren't a ton of work, and class discussion can be really great. The final paper is a lot of work. Get started on it early.",
    "The OCI summary is sufficient. For me though, the strength of the class was its students.",
    "Yes -- this is a very fun Junior Seminar with a great professor. The reading is enjoyable. Take it!",
    "Yes, good seminar.",
    "I highly recommend this course. The central topic is technology... specifically, how has the way we talk about technology changed? And is technology indeed the main driving force in recent history? The course totally changed the way I think of machines and more importantly the concept of \"progress\" in modern society. The readings were incredible. Van Vleck does a great job of leading class discussions. The weekly reading responses were straightforward and stress-free. For me, the highlight was writing the research paper. There are a lot of really fascinating collections at Yale relating to technology and it was fun to get a chance to explore them. In sum: We all need to learn how to examine arguments about technology and progress with razor-sharp criticism and I think this course may be one of the best ways to do that. SO. Please take it."
