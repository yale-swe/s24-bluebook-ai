   "comments": [
    "I mean, yeah, take it. If you've done DS fall, do DS spring. It's better. Not a ton better, so you'll still be sick of it by the end, but you might as well read the good books on the spring list.",
    "Directed Studies Literature 2nd semester provided a good overview of the sweep of Western literature from the Renaissance to the 20th century. Books were thematically connected, and we got to sample a large spread of some of the greatest works in the Western canon. Professor Hagens is very jovial and is an all around great guy. Our discussions were some of the most engaging and fun academic experiences I have ever had. I would definitely recommend this class and Professor Hagens' section.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course and would recommend it specifically, as well as Directed Studies in general, to all incoming freshmen.I thought that having reading responses due each class certainly increased our workload far above the other literature sections, but the reading responses also helped me to ground my though individually and to facilitate class discussion.All in all, a great group of students, an inspiring professor, and fascinating material.",
    "Jovial--that's how an evaluation from last year summed up Professor Hagens. Overall, Directed Studies: Literature is a whirlwind tour of literature from the Renaissance onwards, and, while there's no way to get that in depth with such a fast pace and books as long as War and Peace, the works and discussion were illuminating. Professor Hagens assigns a reading response for every section, but, considering that the page-count for assigned reading was the highest of any in DS, Professor Hagens managed to minimize our workload. Class discussion involves a lot of building off of others' comments and a fair share of joking around before delving into the text. One of the most fun classes I've taken so far--left me smiling each section, while still treating the great classics of Western literature.",
    "German. Jovial. Absolutely delightful.",
    "YES! Take it. Especially with Hagens, who is just so awesome and great. It's a lot of reading, but what the heck, it's all good stuff. Go for it!",
    "Basically picking up where you left off last semester. Reading list kind of drags at times, but overall really good. Some really great lectures. I would totally recommend this course.",
    "DS Lit is a chronological survey of the Western Canon from around the 14th century on. The course is writing and reading heavy, but if you're willing to put in the effort needed to finish the course, I cannot recommend it enough. It will make a better writer, a more critical reader, and generally will change your view of the world for the better.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. Spring Semester DS is the past part of the program. Take it!",
    "This is one of the most fun courses of Directed Studies, although the workload is massive (understandably, with \"War and Peace\" and \"Don Quixote\" - but they can be somewhat manageable if you read over half over the breaks). Jan Hagens is a fantastic instructor, really good at leading the direction of the discussion while letting students participate and invest in the conversation. He's also really funny and nice. The only issue is that we often didn't get to the most important passages, which is a bit inevitable with the length of the works we covered.",
    "I would highly recommend DS to everyone who is interested in tackling the important questions and encountering what has been written by the best and brightest of mankind.",
    "After taking this course, you will find, almost without realizing it, that you will be closer to answering the fundamental question, \"What is literature?\". Most importantly, Professor Hagens is an amazing instructor who cares deeply about his students. He will set you on the right path in this extraordinary labyrinth of literature."
