    "this course teaches about individuals in the civil rights movement that many students may not have known about, in addition to larger trends, ideologies, and movements, and expands the idea of the movement from the 50s and 60s to situate it in larger US history, with implications for the present",
    "I learned a lot from this course: I was grateful to have the opportunity to learn more about the unsung leaders of the Civil Rights movement. Particularly enjoyed reading the perspectives of female figures.",
    "Professor Feimster presented a longer narrative for the Civil Rights Movement starting in the 1930s and going through the 1970s. She focused on key actors largely written out of the popular retelling of history like Ella Baker, Diane Nash, Pauli Murray and others. This class pushed me to reexamine the way that I conceive of the Civil Rights Movement and what it means to be an activist.",
    "I learned how to consider the civil rights movement as a longer era, encompassing from the 1930s to the 1970s. I did my best to become a more critical writer and analyzer. Even if my paragraphing didn't significantly improve, my thesis writing did, especially in regard to making arguments about reading assignments on a weekly basis.",
    "I gained critical historical essay writing skills. I learned how to make connections between one decade in history and another and one week's class to another's.",
    "How to write critically and with precision, how to question historical facts and complicate widely-accepted narratives, how to skim readings. Learned about the long civil rights movement, how it looked through the decades, how these ideas were not new but what others had said in the past.",
    "This course is a must-take. You learn the long history of the civil rights movement, from the early 20th century to present day. It's eye-opened to learn how much grassroots organizing was part of the civil rights movement--especially important in today's political climate.",
    "I learned so much about the Civil Rights Movement that I previously didn't know! You learn intellectual history, grassroots politics, and so much more.",
    "I gained an entirely new understanding of how the Civil Rights Movement in the United States occurred and continues to progress. I also learned how to be more critical of classical media or historical narratives that normally seem conventional if one takes them at face value.",
    "I learned to think more critcally about historical narratives and their continued use is relevent today. In writing I developed my ability to make an argument by synthesizing information from varied sources.",
    "Responding critically and developing theses based on readings",
    "Best class you'll take at yale. A COMPLETE history.",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding of the civil rights movement and developed skills of historical inquiry by taking this class.",
    "This class was absolutely phenomenal! I used to think I wasn't a \"history person\" until I took this class. I learned so much about events surrounding the traditional long civil rights movement and it was invigorating! I learned about key figures who have been erased, tactics that have been obscured, and events the media has distorted!",
    "I learned so much about story-telling through this class, and the lasting significance of movement building and the lessons we can draw from the many people who devoted their lives to the civil rights movement. An incredibly crucial course for the moment.",
    "This course provides a much deeper understanding of the civil rights movement and how it was manifested before and after the classic era of 1955-1964. It helped me think so much more contextually about race relations today and taught me about unrecognized activists and disagreement within the movement.",
    "I learned to think bigger picture to expand my understanding of history across time as layered, complex, and intertwined rather than separated out. The way that Professor Feimster frames her lectures makes it less difficult to follow and think through thick and complex ideas. From this course, I was able to develop skills in making connections between historical events, places, and people that were once separate in my mind and for developing stronger arguments in my writing."

   "comments": [
    "the course was very strong, although the many readings sometimes meant i felt that i couldn't get too in depth in understanding each week's topics.",
    "This course was amazing, Professor Feimster is amazing. I learned a lot this semester. But, I wish we had been given more guidance on the assignments. For example, the first assignment was designed as a short letter to your parents. We were told it was casual, and anyone who asked for more detailed instructions was told not to worry about it. Yet every assignment was graded pretty harshly and strictly, which is fine, but did not match how Professor Feimster and the TAs acted before the assignments were submitted. I also think the readings could have lined up with the lectures more, because often it felt like the readings for one week should have been assigned with a different week's lectures.",
    "One thing that really disappointed me was how much time was spent watching documentaries in class. I loved the lectures and alway felt bit let down when we spent the full class period watching a film that could have been watched at home.",
    "This class's greatest strength was Professor Feimster. She clearly cares about the material and presents it in a way that makes you care about it as well. All the lectures were engaging and interesting. Best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "The contents of lecture need not be changed. Professor Feimster appropriately incorporates multimedia into her lectures. The Malcolm X documentary was a transformative film, as well. However, there are too many short assignments. I think we would be better off if one of the three letters were taken away, and the remaining two were made longer, perhaps by a page.",
    "It covered a lot of information but still remained focused, which kept it interesting and was helpful. A suggestion would be to cut back on the reading. It was extremely difficult to get through all of it in a timely manner.",
    "Strengths: dedicated TAs, lecture recaps help a lot when studying, interesting material, interactive lecture made it easier to synthesize information, good mix of media and text, although we were not Professor Feimster's main class, she did show interest in getting to know us. Weaknesses: hard to keep info neat and get it all when we just write instead of typing, directions for assignments were not always clear, TA's had unexpected activities during section that could have been made smoother had there been prior knowledge of said activities.",
    "This course is a lot of work. There is a lot of reading assigned, and I wished there was less assigned so we could focus more on the readings we did and engage with it better. Lectures were interesting even without powerpoints, but it would have been beneficial for note-taking to have some sort of general outline on a powerpoint. The handouts with lecture notes given out on some days were helpful, but tapered off at the end of the semester. It would have been helpful to have them throughout, especially when it came to studying.",
    "This is a fantastic course, and I would recommend it to everyone. You really learn all about the Long Civil Rights Movement, and everyone should take it.",
    "This class had too much reading and too many assignments. I found it incredibly difficult to keep up, which affected my ability to really engage with the class. I also disliked the fact that the lectures, readings, and section topics were often all out of synch, so they were all discussing different events that happened at different times. This was very confusing.",
    "This class makes students feel engaged despite being a lecture. This is the only lecture class I have taken where I feel connected with the professor, and consequently the class was enjoyable. I cannot think of any obvious weaknesses related to this course.",
    "Overall, the course is extraordinary, especially for people with little background in the civil rights movement or race theory in the US. The professor is phenomenal and the material is fascinating. However, the biggest drawback is the amount of assignments, which includes writing assignments and readings. I think the course would be better if the students were assigned less reading, but with a higher expectation to complete all of it.",
    "The strengths of this course are the powerful content that Professien Feimster curates and the arguments she makes in her lectures. She teaches a new way to think about the civil rights history specifically, and the study of history more generally. The weaknesses of this course are that compared to other intro level lectures, there are more readings and assignments. This can make it hard to keep up, but the TFs and Professor Feimster have taken steps to keep people engaged and up to date.",
    "Incredible lectures, use of media is relevant, helpful, and fascinating.The material is extremely important and presented engagingly. A weakness would be the assignments for the course. For most it was highly unclear as to what was being asked of us regardless of independent inquiries to both the professor and tfs. The letter assignments were not only unclear but also felt quite unproductive in comparison to a straightforward reading response which it seemed like was what they were actually looking for. The film review also felt undefined - just perhaps a reevaluation of what assignments should look like and a more strict definition of them might be useful\/helpful.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've ever taken. Essentially my only complaint is that when I did readings in advance of class significant parts of lecture felt somewhat pointless since they were direct quotes from the readings.",
    "Comprehensive and thorough. Very engaging and relevant to today. Feimster is amazing.",
    "Strengths- lectures of storytelling are amazing! Papers were challenging but you learn a ton! Weaknesses- a lot of reading and section required a lot of busy work.",
    "This course is GREAT. I have no complaints. Lectures were awesome, assignments were fun. Maybe my one complaint would be that it was kind of weird to have us write film papers without any sort of film analysis instruction. As a Film Studies major, I was hit up by a lot of people for help with that, and 3 pages is a crazy short amount to write for a first film paper. I know everyone's really eager to bring media into the classroom, but I just am sad when people do that without acknowledging the work that goes into film and media studies. That's a really small complaint, though, I'm just insecure because people are always tryna tell me film isn't a legitimate academic discipline. Anyway, this class was perfect otherwise. 10\/10 would take again.",
    "I found myself wishing for a more substantive writing assignment. Both the essay and the film review felt too short to really do satisfying analysis. I thought the syllabus was excellent, but the assignments felt too easy and could be tweaked to make them more engaging and challenging.",
    "This course is absolutely wonderful-- it's very well organized, and Professor Feimster is a great lecturer. However, the amount of reading is sometimes too high, and it would be helpful to have more visual aids during the lectures.",
    "Professor Feimster's lectures are the highlight of the course: always engaging and challenging, insightful and all-encompassing, and I felt like I took something valuable from each one."

    "would absolutely recommend.",
    "Everyone should take civil rights history!",
    "Take this class. Professor Feimster is the best professor at Yale. You will learn so much about history in a way that feels personally relevant.",
    "This is one of those courses that I'd jokingly suggest should be mandatory. It might replace Holloway's post-emancipation history course as ~the~ introductory African American Studies\/History course to be taken at Yale. It is an important and comprehensive study of civil rights in the United States from 1930 through the 1970s, with select attention to a handful events from the 80s to the present. I enjoyed lecture. There were a lot of great videos. Professor Feimster cares deeply for her students, as well. Beware on the short writing assignments though. They are somewhat tricky, and it is frustrating to run out of space or feel like you are writing about something trivial.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone. It is an absolute must-take. Professor Feimster is a brilliant and amazing woman, and the class itself covers a portion of black history that is usually distilled to bare bones in general education. TAKE THIS CLASS. Seriously, you need to take this class.",
    "Yes because I think this is important material to learn, good Professor and TA's, good mix of reading and multi-media, more interesting ways of learning material in section, decentralizes MLK and brings other activists to the forefront that often go unheard in school, challenges widely accepted historical narratives and shows that there was more than one way to challenge Jim Crow and legal racism.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I loved this course so so much. Professor Feimster is one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale. Her lectures are so thoughtfully planned out and combine written speeches with video\/documentary clips. She was so inspirational and dedicated. She valued each and every member of the class and took the effort to learn peoples names even though it was a decently sized lecture. It is a greater workload than other classes--there is a lot of reading BUT it is honestly so worth it because the text is so interesting and valuable. TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Highly recommended. The kind of course that completely changes your conceptions of the world.",
    "This is a fantastic course, and I would recommend it to everyone. You really learn all about the Long Civil Rights Movement, and you greatly increase what you've learned before coming to Yale. Everyone should take it!",
    "Do not take this course unless you have a really light schedule. I found it incredibly difficult to keep up with all of the reading and the large number of assignments, so I wound up learning very little in the class.",
    "Absolutely: this course absolutely changed my conception of the United States Civil Rights Movement and challenged my understanding of how the media shapes activist narratives. This was my favorite freshman year class.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Everyone student at Yale should be required to take this course. It breaks down so many myths and \"popular narratives\" about the civil rights movement that are actually used to delegitimize modern day protest and maintain levels of discrimination. To truly understand the state of discrimination and poverty in the US, this course is a must. However, its also important to note that it requires a lot of reading and has a large amount of writing assignments. To truly get the most of this class, it takes a lot of time, work, and commitment.",
    "Yes, the lectures are engaging and the material is important. The workload is a little heavy for a lecture, but the class is set up for you to do well and get a lot out of it.",
    "Yes, definitely. It is an extremely important subject that does not receive the detailed attention it should unless one seeks out these courses - which they should! Great lecture with fascinating use of media and other materials to add to it. Professor Feimster is wonderful and passionate. Though obviously often very sad given the topic, nevertheless a joy of a class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any other student. Professor Feimster is an incredible lecturer and the course is perfectly curated to develop thought about race and the struggle for civil rights through the whole twentieth and twenty first century. Truly one of the best, if not the best, class I have ever taken.",
    "Yes! Everyone should learn this history, especially yales role in it",
    "Absolutely would recommend. This was an excellent introduction to the Long Civil Rights Movement and provided really important historical background that everyone should know.",
    "Yes! You will learn so much beyond what you thought you knew about this era. This is a MUST take.",
    "Yes! Take it! Feimster is great, her lectures are amazing, and the course is a great historical survey. Not too much work. The perfect 5th class! Or a great introduction to AFAM\/History!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Professor Feimster is a wonderful lecture and the course readings were well selected.",
    "This course is wonderful for anyone, no matter their interests and prior knowledge of the freedom movement and race relations in the US; it's a thorough lecture that remains interesting and engage info throughout the semester and offers a new perspective on the civil rights movement. Professor Feimster is an incredibly kind, humorous and deeply knowledgeable authority on this subject. Simply put, it was an honor to learn from her in this course.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Absolutely! This is one of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Yes! This is one my favorite history lectures that I have taken.",
    "Yes! This course will expand your understanding of the Long Civil Rights Movement, especially in terms of gender, class, and its leaders. Professor Feimster is charming and engaging and fun to learn from. The course is framed so that you're not learning about Civil Rights in a vacuum, but thinking about the Movement as it pertains to movement-building today as well. You will learn about figures and events and places that you've probably never heard of and definitely never engaged with in such a critical and expansive manner. Feimster has a way of getting to the heart of the matter and then pulling us out to look at the big picture. The course flowed well to follow the course of history into student and civil rights movements of today."
