   "comments": [
    "This course was a disaster. The revit requirement completely derailed the focus on the course, from systems to software. Most of the critics were largely useless, and the lectures were absolutely pointless.",
    "The most effective lecture series were the example based ones. The content based lectures were often repeats of information we should have picked up in building project and environmental design. On the other hand, the lectures that were presented by the consultants were helpful. The weekly meeting sessions were helpful.",
    "The material presented and the content of this course followed a very logical sequence, and the syllabus and assignments effectively familiarized us with the lessons and principles pertaining to systems integration.",
    "the combination of learning a complex BIM modeling software and how to detail afairly large institutional building, not only in architectural, but structural and mechanical terms - is just ridiculous. it shows a complete disrespect to all of the disciplines involved.ironically - i was extremely interested in all of the material presented, but the timeframe of the course only allows for a very surface skimming of all of them. perhaps that is the point, but there is such a thing as being TOO generalist.overall, the professors dealt with the added requirement of BIM rather well. what we really needed was the revit tutorials much earlier and an actual professor or TF on staff during the nights we were actually using the software and generating questions.",
    "This course was well organized and presented. The role playing of the consultant was unnecessary and created a strange atmosphere.",
    "the sequence made sense, but it was unclear what the main focus of the course was. if the purpose was to learn how to prepare a set of construction documents and understand how the different systems work together, then we should have spent more time on that and not been worried about how to make the revit program work. the course is not long enough to have to deal with both. if we were already proficient in revit when we started the class, then it would have made sense to use it.",
    "I wish the course had been better coordinated. Not only did the lectures appear confusing and worthless, but I felt that the time should have been spent instead on instruction that was both more particular the projects and more applicable to practice.",
    "The material presented in the course follows a logical progression, and allows for a more or less seamless transition through the semester. That said, given the nature of building design, it becomes necessary, despite the proper sequence of the material in the course, to continuously go back and tweak previous decisions based on new developments with the design of the envelope, mechanical systems, etc. The process is inherently non-linear, though the syllabus is laid out in as logical a progression as there is.",
    "The material was important and I enjoyed learning it. I wish we could have concentrated more on that than on learning Revit.",
    "My major complaint about the course is the effectiveness of the Friday morning lectures in Hastings. I think the constant flow of case studies from guest speakers would have been enormously more beneficial with a few actual instruction sessions in there. For someone who seems to have such a vested interest in the way architects are educated, I was slightly surprised how much this teaching model mirrored studio: We come to class every week without any dialectic \"instruction,\" we pin up work to have it redlined and critiqued, and in the meanwhile we are inundated by a myriad string of presentations and precedents from which we're supposed to become inspired or informed. I don't think it's outside the scope of reason to think that this class of all classes might have benefitted from some more direct training of the ways that systems work. It also would have really advanced the discussions with our consultants if we weren't starting from square one at the start.",
    "Now that the instructors and students are a bit more acquainted with what Revit brings, I think that there should be a push back toward the syllabus as provided. I think that this year we missed some key points of the class because of the changeover, such as greater time in the detailing phase and greater emphasis on devising thorough environmental strategies complete with wall section values.",
    "Wonderful - a truly important course.",
    "Revit complicated the schedule. Would have wished that we spent more time detailing and learned more about systems through details instead of understanding how a program works as a solution of systems integration.",
    "per usual, as a directive of the administration, revit was integrated into the course with little preparation, thought or concern for the overall implications. this is NOT finio's fault. IF you are going to ask us to use revit, which is not a bad idea, you MUST make other modifications to the course. 1. SPACE- revit files take more space. this should not be ebberharts last stand. space is cheap. when we run out of file space our revit files lose links and essentially become useless. this should not be a problem we should encounter 12 hours before our final review.2. we need training. good training. asmita was good. one session is not enough. we need access to individual instruction and q&a AT LEAST twice in the semester.3. perhaps you should install the WHOLE program on our computer if you are going to ask us to use revit and pay for licenses. this includes the family blocks and tutorials...",
    "The syllabus was very disorganized and it should have included a manual with all the information we would really need in order to complete the assignments. Rather than telling us we should look at a book of standards in the library as reference for our drawings, they should have given us a more complete PDF set for the drawing of an architectural detail, mechanical drawings (I know a few of these were placed in the resources folder, but they were poorly organized, and also placed rather late in the semester), and engineering drawings. Also, since most of the instructors had little to no understanding of Revit, they were unable to help us with any Revit questions. The teams that were able to thrive with the program, were only the teams that had someone who had some previous knowledge of it from past work experience. The Revit sessions were hardly helpful. What we really needed was someone to come around the studio while we were working on our projects, i.e. Thursday night, and answer any questions we had.",
    "assignments were fare save the revit requirement.",
    "The assignments should have been less demanding and had less parts. Also, it was unfair that the teams of three had the same workload as the teams of four. Having an extra team member could have enabled us to get a lot more done. I think teams of four should be the norm, and if there have to be teams of three based on the numbers, it should be three of the more experienced people in the class.",
    "This is a good course, however the Revit experiment was I thought totally counterproductive to the aims of the class. rather than actually learning how to put together a mock CD set and learning about systems and structures etc. Students should absolutely have to draw a wall section by hand and learn how draw these things with intention rather than just exporting from revit. Revit essentially removes any sense of detailing from the exercise and is more about choosing options off the shelf rather than actually gaining confidience in how CD coordination works for a large building.Essentially every group picked their most experienced to do the detailing, wall section etc. after we gave up on Revit and the other 2 or 3 members split up the rest. So if the goal was to learn to Revit, maybe it was successful, but it certainly got in the way of learning systems."

   "comments": [
    "This class has a bad reputation and now that I\u0092ve finished it, I don\u0092t disagree. The deliverables are unmanageable, especially this year because we were all forced to learn and use a program that we did not know and is not without its own issues. Many of the teachers falsely claimed that revit could produce the entire project. In reality, those firms that use revit export files from revit to cad for clean. I question the actual value of this tool in a course like this where we need to learn assembly methods, as well as drawing standards. I will not willingly use revit again and I truly believe that it is detrimental to the profession as a design tool. In this program, more than any other modeling tool, it is so easy to not think about the building in section. Revit is a plan oriented modeling program with off the self building components. It is a myth that this program makes it easy to produce sheets and I can see architects getting further and further removed from the assembly process the more it is used. Please do not encourage the use of this tool in our profession.",
    "I wanted to be able to sit down with experts from other fields and simulate a professional environment, but with the freedom to ask as many questions as I liked. I was able to do this and the discussion sections were a real joy.The lectures were a mixed bag and did not correlate to the actual knowledge that I felt we required. They were interesting but essentially useless to the task at hand.Overall - I wanted more explicit instruction - if I wanted to be referred to graphic standards I would go to an office that would actually pay me to look things up. I feel that this is a problem not just with this class, but Yale's motto of cramming as much information - no matter what the logistics are - into a course.",
    "Although I have learned a lot from this course, the focus on this course did not seem very clear. It seemed like it was all over the place (including revit). i think it could have been a better course.",
    "Overall the class met my expectations.",
    "it would have been helpful to have consultants who were willing to teach you how to make a complicated building work, and not simply revert to dumbing the building down to make it conform to a straightforward systems layout.",
    "I expected to be able to develop a project to a greater level of detail than what we usually do in studio, and I was disappointed that that expectation was only partially met.",
    "Having gained a substantial amount of building systems experience from working professionally before school, I more or less knew what the course would present in terms of material. The course met these expectations, and by using the students' own studio projects, allowed for an even greater level of exploration. The Revit component of the class, however, was an unforeseen and unfortunate hindrance for the progression of the work overall.",
    "They were met well. I'm glad I learned the software.",
    "My expectations for this class were to go deeper into the development of a studio project and focusing on the mechanical portion I feel like I did gain a large amount of foundational knowledge from this course. I do think if there was a greater sharing between the projects being developed at least with your set of critics that there could be even more gained from other teams struggles. Though I heard the back end of what was happening as people busily finished for class I did not get to hear what was discussed.",
    "I was unsure as what to expect, especially with Revit (which has to stop even though Autodesk is a major donor), but we had a wonderful set of consultants and irregardless of expectations they really taught us all quite a bit.",
    "Would have wished that we spent more time detailing and learned more about systems through details instead of understanding how a program works as a solution of systems integration.",
    "I think this is a really helpful course.",
    "I did learn a lot from the class, especially how mechanical systems came together. However, I feel a lot of this work went unnoticed, and because there was such a focus on the \"revit model\" a lot of attention on the other aspects of the course really fell apart, which I find unfortunate since I think that the most useful aspect of the class lies in its ability to teach us how to read and produce these technical drawings, rather than making a revit model...",

    "I learned, essentially, nothing I didn't already know.",
    "I think this course could be extremely valuable, however the way that it is set up now it is not. Architecture students don\u0092t know how things are put together and this is the class that we should learn that. We should be looking at more details.",
    "This course was very valuable me, from both a standpoint of learning about systems integration and a means of learning Revit.",
    "This course was valuable and well placed, the work load could have been managed better on both ends.",
    "i learned about structural and mechanical systems, but not necessarily from our professors.",
    "I expected to be able to develop a project to a greater level of detail than what we usually do in studio, and I was disappointed that that expectation was only partially met. The Revit component of the course felt like a red herring; a useless detour and a waste of our time.",
    "The material of the course is extremely valuable. Having a clear comprehension of the multiple systems that allow a real building to function, and knowing the amount of physical space required for those systems in the building itself, is critical for any architecture student who wishes to build in their career. While learning the new BIM software is also very valuable to the students who wish to stay current with contemporary practice, the merger of the two lessens the collective value of both to the students, as we struggle to grasp the program and simultaneouslyprogress in our understanding of the course material.",
    "The course was valuable. I do think more care should be taken in choosing the buildings to develop in the class, particularly if we are going to use Revit. Had we had a simpler building that was more designed in the first place and had a geometry that would work better in Revit I believe we would have had more time to devote to learning more about Systems, which is the point of the class.",
    "I think that this course is very well run and I think the way it was focused was very positive. I do think that wherever possible that the ideas should be emphasized over the busywork and although clean and clear drawings are important the main purpose is to develop innovative solutions to challenging buildings.",
    "This course is incredibly valuable - I would encourage some more thought into exactly how to integrate some BIM software. Revit is not the way to go.",
    "I have high expectations of the class, and wanted to make the best out of the experience. Unfortunately the difficult in the resources stifled some of the learning. All and all, still a great class.",
    "i appreciate the value of the course. i learned a lot.",
    "Again, as mentioned before, I'm happy I got to learn about mechanical and structural systems, but because of the time wasted and pressured placed on the revit model, less time was devoted to the actual construction of the drawings, and in producing a nice packet, which I think would have been more helpful, and it would be something we can actually take away with us and even bring to a job interview in the future.",
    "I find the process of working through the nitty gritty of making a building buildable and believable to be highly educational and very important preparation for the workplace. This especially so since it typically takes many years for an employee in a firm to see through a process through its completion (given the many twists and turns that occur in a project's lifetime). This class gave ample simulation to the real life functioning of an office without the attendent issues that plague an office environment (like cost).Nonetheless, its value depends on the respective responsibilities or \"portfolios\" that each student takes. A student who works on the building envelope or structure or egress will learn more useful material for his future work as an architect than one who does mechanical.",

    "Emer was great.",
    "The teachers should have focused more on helping us learn how to put a building together rather than force us to learn a new program.",
    "My section leaders (Craig, Kristin, and Ed) were extremely helpful and friendly, and I enthusiastically recommend each of them for next year's class.",
    "They were encouraging and helpful; but I wish they were more involved in helping out one details rather than asking students to find the way by themselves since the students are not exposed to the information.",
    "Everyone was very helpful and willing to put in extra time to get the work done. John and Anibal put in extra time as need to keep the project moving in the right direction and to make sure we understood the core concepts. Overall they both did a great job. I terms of the Revit portion, it was not well supported, Revit is a complicated program that could sponsor its own 3 credit seminar to fully learn. If it is the intention of the school to have us learn Revit in this semester it needs to be integrated into a weekly class that builds skills over the course of the semester.",
    "the consulants were not always helpful.... and ours in particular were not very forthcoming with information, particularly Shanta. While other mehanical consultants provided their groups with guidelines for many things, we were left to try to figure it out on our own.",
    "Our consultants were excellent, although again I wish that our instruction had been more particular to our project, and more direct than the simplistic approach in which it is the students' charge to try to figure things out and inevitably get them wrong.",
    "My set of critics were very strong overall, and helped our group progress far in the class. They listened intently, and offered helpful critiques of our drawings and documents, and challenged us to face the most difficult conditions presented by the project. Overall, the three worked well together, not trying to dominate the conversation or to allow one aspect of the course to dominate the others.",
    "The teachers were all knowledgable. Laura Turlington was the best in our group of consultants. She was clear, knowledgable, and helpful.",
    "I think that this course was very well run considering the high amount of coordination that had to take place to make all of these meetings and lectures possible.",
    "I had Laura Turlington's team for my section. Laura needs to be aware of how she treats the females in the group. Though probably unintentional, she often only addressed the male members of the group and often ignored the females despite the fact that there was an even distribution of work by males and females in our group. Otherwise she was quite knowledgeable. Ken Gibble needs to be more open to non-traditional structural systems.",
    "The professors only really responded to what we had in front of us to show them and did not bring up any issues with our drawings that weren't already present. The result what that in the final review, people were asking us about things that we had not even considered, but rightly so as our instructors failed to point these weaknesses out to us at the start.",
    "Kristen, Craig and Stanley have all been committed \"consultants\" in simulating how the studio project could become believable and buildable. Stanley may have been especially tough on the structural\/enclosure aspects of the building not because the original scheme could not be build, but partly because (I believe) he relishes an additional layer of challenge - and is ready to identify new and more challenges that make the issues to resolve tougher.I have found in Kristen a committed architect, and committed to pursuing all options available in the process of building a buildable scheme, while wanting to be true to the original intentions of the design. Her openness to all available options is perhaps a result of her Pelli background which lends itself to a diversity of possibilities while awareness of the realistic issues we have to confront. I strongly appreciated her involvement and commitment andopenness.Craig is very knowledgeable and committed, in teaching and conveying the underlying mechanical systems and working through how the system would work, and in reviewing the drawings. I learnt a lot from him of how building mechanical systems work.All three, Stanley, Kristen, and Craig have made themselves available beyond the Friday sessions and made sure that we check in with them, usually ensuring that meaningful and quality work is done for our Friday sessions.",
    "it wasnt so much taught. Too much material had to be generated by the students, the instructors for the course offered very little help in solving issues within the project. Saying that what someone does is wrong is not an effective teaching method. Explanation of how to do it should be required. We are coming here to be taught.",
    "There should be more uniformity between sections. Sometimes, our group would be told to look up a complicated mechanical formula ourselves, while other groups would be given the formuals."

    "No revit. Actual redlines from the critics.",
    "Overall I thought it was a very important course for our career. It was useful to start to know Revit but much more instruction was needed for the degree to which we were expected to use it. Perhaps more Revit discussion sessions instead of lectures.",
    "The focus on revit made it more difficult to learn the material. We wasted too much time fighting the software instead of tackling the tasks we were given.",
    "As it is set up now, the majority of the work ends up on the student who\u0092s project is selected. The projects are selected randomly, so many of the students selected had no knowledge of how to produce construction documents. The team members who\u0092s project it is not, do not feel that they can make changes to the buildings because it is someone else\u0092s design, so they don\u0092t do the work, or they do minimal work. Furthermore, we lack hierarchy because of the school atmosphere, so the work does not get delegated properly. I would suggest that the projects not be chosen from student work. It would make more sense, especially if the course continues to promote Revit, that each group start with a box and detail it. That way, it would be a group effort to figure out how it meets the ground, get the structure and mechanical in right and make material and construction technique decisions together.",
    "More explicit instruction - with lectures tied to the scale of the building we are working on. (no more high rise pelli lectures!)More help with software. Continuous help.",
    "There are two ways to improve this class, one is to make the projects simpler and therefore easier to take to the detail level. The other is to make the class more experimental, which would requiremore openness to failures and more room in the schedule for experimentation. As it falls short of both and would benefit from taking a position.",
    "lectures seemed tangential to course content most timescourse is extremely time-consuming and stressfulintroduction of revit was very strenuous - prevented me from learning specifics of building systems or detailingbecame a class in revitexpectations each week for section were very hard to meet",
    "Donot try to teach Revit; see above.",
    "Learning Revit is critical and will help the students prepare well for a life in the professional world. Many students understand that fact. However, by including that component into this class, it makes the overall experience of the course much more painful, and forces the students to spend more time struggling with the program and less time learning the material of the course. In addition, many of the requirements of the course (and many of the complexities inherent in the studio projects) cannot be developed in Revit. Subsequently, the Revit model in many cases became more of a collage of linked Rhino and cad files than a working model itself. Perhaps Revit would be best introduced earlier in the curriculum (or students could be encouraged to dabble with the program on their own time), such that the students all have a good working knowledge of the program before the systems class begins. Then I believe everyone will be able to get more out of the class in terms of the material presented.",
    "see question 6",
    "I do think that the Revit training should be offered earlier and that each team should start developing their model at that point. It is best to learn through a project and instead of the standard examples that we already get in the digital media course the preceding summer, I think jumping into revit from the start would be beneficial. I also think that there should be training offered for revit structural and mechanical on a very basic level. Though architectural was explained my team did need greater help in the other capacities which would have saved hours of time. Teaching each one of these and the collision detection as a result would offer the greatest amount of potential from the time invested into these models. I also believe that the choice of the projects should continue without consideration of what would \u0093work best in Revit.\u0094 Part of the challenge of the course is toward the software on hand and I think the students should be offered the help to manipulate and challenge the software with the most challenging projects.",
    "IMPORTANT - do not let one consultant dominate the meeting. I would even suggest to change meetings to 1.5 hours and give each consultant a half an hour just so that each component is touched upon. Its SO SO important not to let anything fall to the wayside.",
    "Lose the Revit and focus on the basics of details\/construction and systems.",
    "dear bob stern,butt out.love,everyone",
    "I do not think that Revit was successful. The majority of us ended up using Rhino and autocad (in fact, those who had the best final models and the best drawings were the people who did not use Revit). I think it is too overwhelming to have us both try to grapple with understanding these systems and also have to learn an entirely new computer program, which is far from self-evident. It is also only really helpful when you know exactly what you need to draw\/model, and it is not so helpful in our case when we are drawing without entirely knowing what we are doing and are learning through the process.",
    "In a second-year schedule, putting Systems on a Friday after a Thursday studio day is difficult and draining. Many of us felt that Systems could work better for a second-year schedule on a Tuesday instead. It may lead to a more intense week, but also could create a stronger momentum in a second-year student's learning schedule.",
    "Decide what this course is supposed to be. If it is a revit course, make it a revit course. It is impossible, with the assumption of course that we are human beings, to learn this program as well as learn how to \"integrate systems\" within one 3 credit hour course in a semester of 18 credit hours!"
