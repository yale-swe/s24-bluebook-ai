   "comments": [
    "A lot of people come into Yale looking to take a new language. I highly, highly recommend picking up Russian and taking the intensive class. My friends in the normal class complained of its slowness, and Intensive actually moved at a good pace - not too fast, but definitely not too slow. Expect to be challenged but also expect to feel great about yourself when you realize that you can actually hold conversations with authentic Russians after only a few months. Take this class FOR SURE.",
    "The course does indeed move at a fast pace, but if you're good with languages do it. You'll be shocked by how much you will know by the end of the semester. Professor Muravnik is great and very helpful.\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0435!",
    "If you want to learn Russian fast, and are really, really serious about it, this is your course. If you just want to learn some Russian, please don't take this course.",
    "DO IT. If you're willing to commit to the time, the class is incredibly rewarding.",
    "Optimum for someone that may already know quite a bit of russian, but needs to have the structure defined. There is a lot of time required to accomplish all of the work in this course. It's not a course you can expect to miss a few days of and catch back up. You must stay on top of the work or it will pile up very fast.",
    "Yes, I would, but only if the student is determined to learn this language in two years and willing to spare hours of hard studying every day.",
    "If you are a student very motivated, then you will love this class.If you are not motivated enough you will suffer from the hard schedule, the huge amount of material to memorize and the several examinations."
