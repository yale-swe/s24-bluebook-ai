    "This class felt like 5 different classes in one. There was the lecture vein, which I didn't even really need to show up to because anyone who took even one environmental studies\/public health class in undergrad would know all the subjects they cover (not surprising that it is an undergrad cross-listed course); there was a group work vein, which was the real heart of the class (designing and building stuff); and then there were these mini assignments every once in a while that seemed to have no rhyme or reason.",
    "Lectures were painfully slow and material was very basic. The majority of the group work was also slow and unchallenging. More time, including class time, should have been devoted to the final project.",
    "I wish the course would have spent less time on trying to lecture on the various topics associated with green manufacturing and instead would have allowed the groups more time to work in class with the help of the professors. Also I wish that the schedule would have allowed more time to actually work on the final product and maybe we could have had intermediate presentations. The expectations for the final product were not clear."

I feel thatwe got a high level view of too many topics, most of which students will forget by the fall.",
