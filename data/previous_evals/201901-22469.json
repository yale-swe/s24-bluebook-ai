    "The trip was wonderful, fun, and elucidating; I am so glad that we got the chance to know each other better and learn from each other in that environment! My one small logistical suggestion for future ISM trips might be to appoint someone (this could even be a student) to serve as logistics\/social coordinator on the trip, perhaps with a small stipend? There is a significant amount of labor involved just in getting around as a large group of people--booking taxis, making restaurant reservations, looking up Google Maps, etc--and I wonder if it might be helpful to appoint and pay someone to do this, rather than that administrative burden falling to the faculty or to individual students.",
    "The readings were pretty interesting, I particularly enjoyed the variety of genres. Honestly the course was pretty great, the trip was so useful and since our group was fantastic, I learned so much from my classmates."

    "This was a wonderful class that brought together a range of contexts, texts, and sources--I learned a lot about Reformation theology by reading materials that I wouldn't necessarily have thought to explore on my own. Bruce and John are an absolute gift: they complement each other well and run a class beautifully together, sometimes taking the lead and sometimes taking the backseat and prompting the other with questions, etc. It is inspiring to learn from them and watch them in action! The trip was fabulous and very special...this may not run again as a travel seminar, but if it does, don't miss the chance to take it! (And take it anyway even if it isn't a travel seminar.)",
    "YES! Both professors are insanely knowledgeable and lead excellent discussions, introducing a topic then letting an active class take it away!"
