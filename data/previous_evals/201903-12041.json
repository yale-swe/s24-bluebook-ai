    "an intuition about biochemistry by learning basic principles and important molecules and applying that knowledge to metabolism",
    "Much more in depth knowledge of the things we may have heard of in the past. First time all the older stuff starts to become very internalized.",
    "Good overview of biochemistry.",
    "MB&B300 teaches you a wide scope of the fundamentals of biochemistry, looking at different kinds of molecules (primarily carbohydrates, fats, and lipids) and their vastly dynamic interactions. It culminates in going through the entirety of metabolism and how each bodily system connects - truly wild! You really learn so much from this course about how proteins work and how essentially every reaction and pathway works.",
    "A survey knowledge of many fundamental concepts in biochemistry, from understanding individual biomolecules, to the basics of various metabolic pathways.",
    "Principles of biochemistry",
    "I learned so many new biochemical concepts that are integrated in the final few lectures through metabolism.",
    "I learned biochemistry",
    "I gained the ability to fluidly apply concepts normally learnt in a dense biochemistry textbook to the real world, e.g. why we need to eat, have blood, etc. It was a very interesting and engaging class and I very much look forward to Biophysics in the spring 2020 term.",
    "Structure and function of biomolecules, metabolic pathways and how they are regulated\/integrated.",
    "I developed a comprehensive understanding of biochemistry minus nucleic acids.",
    "I learned a lot about the human body on a molecular level.",
    "Learned the principles behind biochemistry and how to think like a biochemist. We started off by talking about individual molecules (like amino acids), then worked our way up to larger pathways, which I thought was a really great way to learn. I felt that I not only learned (lots of) facts about biochemistry, but truly how everything works together.",
    "I learned a lot about many of the underlying principles of biochemistry and how to integrate those principles together to have a deeper understanding of biological processes and the complexities that accompany them.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of biochemistry both in terms of the literal chemistry of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats and also in terms of processes like metabolism and signal transduction.",
    "This class taught me about the fundamentals of biochemistry so that they can be applied elsewhere.",
    "I learned about the principles of biochemistry and how to study and learn biochemical systems.",
    "I learned a lot about the fundamentals of biochem and the research methods used in the field.",
    "General Biochemistry knowledge.",
    "LOTS about metabolism.",
    "You will learn a lot of basic biochemistry! Its a good intro to the subject especially for students planning on taking the MCAT! Also there is more focus on understanding and apply general biochemistry concepts rather than wrote memorization which I thought was great!",
    "Proteins (amino acids, protein purification, enzyme kinetics), lipids, carbohydrates, and metabolism How to think critically about metabolic pathways and effects of malfunctions",
    "Small scale and overall big picture ideas of biochemistry ranging from the organization of lipids in cell membranes to metabolic pathways that use these lipids. Very cool interconnected stuff.",
    "This course is very comprehensive in teaching the basics of biochemistry and giving the language and skills to further learn it.",
    "I learned about molecular function, themes in biochemistry, and a general understanding of metabolism",
    "Metabolism, Carbohydrates, Respiration, Signaling Pathways",
    "I gained such a strong and comprehensive understanding of the major principles of biochemistry though this class. We cover fatty acids, carbohydrates, proteins (extensively), and then integrate all these into the pathways of metabolism. This class is rich in learning and material!",
    "This was a great course that provided a foundational knowledge of biochemistry.",
    "I not only learned the introductory principles of biochemistry, but was able to learn different styles of teaching and how to adapt under a heavy workload and intake of content.",
    "I gained the basic knowledge necessary about Biochemistry and metabolism.",
    "Good foundational skills in biochemistry",
    "fundamental biochemistry concepts: enzyme regulation, activation, and mechanism; membrane structure; lipid structure and roles; signal transduction pathways; principles of metabolism and major metabolic pathways",
    "How biochemistry impacts bodily processes",
    "I gained knowledge of basic biochemistry principles.",
    "I developed an understanding of the forces that govern interactions at the molecular level. I then gained insight into metabolic pathways that exemplify these interactions at the macroscopic scale.",
    "This course offered a very detailed and in depth overview of proteins composition, structure and folding, regulation, and involvement in in metabolism processes.",
    "facts about glycolysis and metabolism",
    "I learned about three of the four macromolecules (proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids), with significant time spent on proteins, and metabolism. I learned (very well) glycolysis and all 20 amino acids (required to memorize). We learned how to think more like medical practitioners, especially in the last couple lectures concerning the integration of metabolism: we were given different abnormalities and asked to hypothesize what cycle was affected (appeared on the final as well)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked that the instructors provided one page study guides for each lecture and also gave a ten minute supplement at the end of each lecture, instead of lecturing for the whole time because lectures were pretty boring.",
    "Strength: SO organized. I want to hold this course up to other courses to show them how it's done. Weaknesses: I would have liked to see a more cohesive thread throughout the lectures. Metabolism brings it together at the very end of the semester, but it would be nice to see more overlap between other lectures, especially near the beginning and middle of the course.",
    "Great course with good study guides at the end of lectures and well organized to learn. The switching between 3 professors can be jarring at transitions but overall not an issue.",
    "One big weakness was the the fact that they do not curve the ending of the class. There is a large range in scoring, and it would be more appropriate to curve so that students can gain credit for the work they are putting in.",
    "This course is fantastic. The material is incredibly interesting (especially towards the end when we get to pathways) and the content is incredibly applicable and interdisciplinary. You definitely walk away from the class feeling that you know more about how things really work, and how you could actually apply this knowledge. As for weaknesses, sometimes lectures would get really content-heavy which could make them kind of a long trudge onward. The instructors expect you to know the small details, which can be weary. Overall, though, it is totally worth it!",
    "All of the professors are pretty solid lecturers and there are plenty of resources to help students, from piazza to practice tests, to lecture slides being provided to every student. Having one dropped midterm is also pretty nice to help relieve stress.",
    "Strength: good lecturers, facilitated for learning Weakness: n\/a",
    "The course is so well organized, and the midterms and final were very reasonable. TAs are available and very helpful.",
    "Taught very well! Exams had rote memorization, which I was not a particular fan of, but I understand why they had those. I think the application based questions were very good.",
    "strengths are the chill psets. The exams were easy; perhaps even too easy because the average on the midterms made it hard to tell how we were doing in the context of the class, but that's a small shtick because I overall appreciated the forgiving nature of the exam overall.",
    "This course was very challenging, but I believe fair. From this course, I've gained the ability to understand on a much deeper level the biochemical and metabolic principles that govern the daily function of our bodies.",
    "Strength-Lots of opportunities for help throughout the semester, able to drop a midterm as well as the three midterm format which breaks up the material into very manageable chunks, professors that really care about the material they are teaching Weakness- There's a lot of work that contributes very minimally o your grade in the psets and quizzes. The glycolysis quiz is a particularly frustrating use of our time- its straight memorization (probably 2-3 hours worth) for a quiz that counts for 2.5% of your grade that you can immediately forget because it will be given to you on every subsequent exam",
    "Strengths of this course were the professors and the course material. The professors were very clear and knowledgable and the course material engaging.",
    "A strength is that the course has a logical order from smaller phenomena like molecular bonding up to biomolecules and finally to whole pathways.",
    "Strengths: Great teaching (Prof Simon and Prof Koelle were great), very manageable psets (they're designed to only take 30 min), and the professors and TAs were overall very accessible and willing to help. I think the course was organized very well. Weaknesses: The final was really difficult compared to the midterms in my opinion. Also, I thought Candie's teaching wasn't as good (though it was fine).",
    "I thought this course was very strong overall! The professors presented a lot of material in clear and understandable ways, and they always made it a point to answer any student's questions about any of the material. The class felt very organized and well structured, and I loved that the professors had a supplement at the end of each class to talk about cool discoveries in the field of biochemistry, or their own experiences as scientists.",
    "This class was good because it focused on the principles and made sure we understood biochemical details and examples not just for the sake of memorization but to understand deeper principles.",
    "I thought lectures were engaging and offered really good introduction to biochemistry (especially for the mcat rip lol). The printed lecture slides were really helpful in taking and organizing notes, and the study guides were super handy in studying for tests. Tests often were very, very specific but they told us that ahead of time so there were no surprises.",
    "The strength is that the content is generally presented in a logical and reasonable way. You are not (with the exception of 2 short quizzes on amino acids and glycolysis) required to rote memorize information and regurgitate it on an assessment. The instructors stress the underlying concepts of biochemistry.",
    "Haven't gotten final grade back yet so obviously can't say, but I've heard this class gets curved down which would be ridiculous and regardless should not be a course's reputation.",
    "The exams require that you apply information you learned in a way that we don't see in problem sets or in lecture, which can be seen as unfair.",
    "I wish quizzes were worth more and sections\/ review sessions aren't helpful unless you have a good TA!",
    "Strengths: course material was super cool and taught very well; lecture study guides were helpful; the \"supplements\" were interesting and medically and currently relevant; professors and TAs replied very promptly to Piazza questions; exams were fair Weaknesses: some lecturers went a little too fast to follow",
    "Well taught! I feel like supplements at the end of lectures are a cool way to segue into different but related thinking. Thanks for having them.",
    "Strengths- the class structure of quizzes, psets, and exams. Allows for different ways to show mastery of the subject and lessens the pressure per each examination.",
    "The division of the class into three parts with three different instructors sometimes made the class seem a bit disjointed, but other than that, I found no glaring weaknesses with the course. One of the strongest strengths was the study guides posted for each lecture.",
    "Strengths: the 3 professors, the organization of the curriculum, and the printouts provided each lecture to encourage participation. Weaknesses: none",
    "The emphasis on general concepts rather than details is the strength of this course. It makes the material much more approachable, and by framing the details within a unifying concept the instructors make the details easier to retain. The use of quizzes to ensure students grasp really crucial information (amino acid structures and glycolysis) well in advance of examinations is judicious. My primary criticism of the course is that not all of the examples are equally important, this distinction is not made clear. Some examples are presented as mere illustrations of a concept, while others expand on past ideas and need to be memorized\/understood. It would be nice if professors were more systematic about delineating this information in lecture (or in the slides). I don't have anything against lots of examples, but I am bothered when I have to spread myself thin studying things that the professors never intended for me to study.",
    "The lecturers all have vastly different styles in teaching! It was a little difficult to adjust to each professor's divergent modes of communication, ways of emphasis and communication on the fly. Otherwise, the course is very strong. The material is presented systematically and logically. The TAs work so, so hard to make the course successful. There are abundant resources to help students who are struggling with the material. I think there is quite a bit of material, but this is the nature of a introductory biochemistry class.",
    "The course was well taught and well structured.",
    "The course is overall well taught. It is tricky switching between so many professors, but each professor did a wonderful job and had a unique style of teaching. While it most likely cannot be changed, the amount of content that needs to be memorized and applied is high and sometimes too difficult to manage.",
    "Great job all around.",
    "Good professors - overall good course",
    "Strengths: powerpoints are well organized and lectures are very useful in understanding what is on the slides, there is ample opportunity to ask questions, and the TAs are super helpful; Weaknesses: the study guides, especially for the metabolism section, could be more detailed to provide more guidance on what is important information. There is so much specific information that it is very easy to get lost in the details, and better study guides to significantly help us get an idea of what is important to study",
    "Weaknesses - the readings often did not match the lectures, making it difficult to keep up with reading",
    "This course had excellent and engaging professors.",
    "I think having three professors is the most that a course can have before the course loses its fluidity. It was also apparent that the instructors worked together to plan their lessons because there was a substantial amount of overlap between their lectures.",
    "This course is great because there are many resources made available to students. The course provides handouts of the material which helps with note taking. The course also provides study guides and ample practice exams. The professors are very clear about what is expected of students.",
    "nothing good or bad about this course - a course on proteins and metabolism (as the name implies)",
    "Strengths of this course include the amazing teaching staff, especially Matt Simon. The supplements always kept me engaged, and applied what I have been learning to real-world scenarios. This course is really important, in my opinion, in learning how to think critically, both medically (what is the cause of this symptom?) and experimentally (how can I test if this is my protein of interest?). Weaknesses include the necessity to memorize all 20 amino acids and glycolysis (although it was helpful because now I know amino acid properties, and the first committed step of glycolysis). Another weakness was the location of this course: LC is quite far away from science hill, where all my other classes were. For the glycolysis quiz, you only had two days to study for it, so start studying early. Strengths of this course definitely outweigh the weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "I mean don't take it unless it's a premed requirement or a major requirement. Between the two biochem classes, I think the other one is probably easier but it's hard to tell.",
    "Yes! Take this class. It was a great biochem course, and I think the professors do a wonderful job.",
    "It depends. This course is built for a specific subset of students who are invested in going past the basics covered in MCDB Biochemistry, and want to invest two semesters to go in depth (second semester is focused on DNA, RNA, proteins mostly). There is a LOT of information covered, so you need to keep up, take good notes, and study well. The course isn't \"on a curve,\" The grading is truly ambiguous, but TAs have said that the grade shift is \"very generous\" and supposed to \"greatly benefit students.\" Take that as you will because I truly have no clue what that means, and I have no clue what my grade will be based on what I have right now.",
    "Yes. Learning from Prof Koelle again was great even if it was only for a third of the course and you gain a much deeper appreciation for the subject.",
    "I would recommend MCDB biochem instead.",
    "Yes! Best science lecture at Yale I've taken so far. So, so well organized. Lectures and powerpoints were clear and engaging, exams and quizzes were handed back in a few days. There were fascinating 10-minute \"supplements\" at the end of each lecture, and the professors were all such great lecturers.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed the course. I think if you are interested in the mechanisms of biology (and especially if you like organic chemistry), you must this class. The professors are very engaging and really know the material (it's kinda scary how much they know). Everyday I would walk away feeling like I got a better understanding of how biology works on a molecular level. With that said, be prepared to put in the work and stay on top of things - particularly towards the end of the semester when you learn metabolism, you have to stay on top of the material.",
    "Don't know too much about the other biochemistry class, but I definitely found this class enjoyable. A healthy challenge.",
    "Yes! Great lecturers that make you think more than just simple equations and processes.",
    "Yes, if youre at all interested in biochemistry or have to take the course! It is so reasonable and a lot more interesting than the MCDB version from what Ive heard.",
    "Yes! Take this course! It is a lot of work before midterms, but you really learn a lot.",
    "take it for pre-med",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in the natural sciences. Biochemistry at Yale teaches not only many concepts condensed into an understandable curriculum, but also a way of learning material that should be taught in every science class.",
    "It's fine, not the most interesting STEM lecture I've taken, and can be a bit misleading while shopping bc I think Matt Simon is the most engaging lecturer of the course, but you only get him on the beginning. On the flip side, I think the course is extremely fair in what it tests you on, and professors and TFs really do want you to do well and it shows in their effort to help students understand the material",
    "Yes, for the appreciation you gain about the biochemistry that makes up living organisms.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who needs this for their major or not. This course was really interesting and gave me the best appreciation for how life works. In regards to work, the psets don't take much time at all but there is a lot of material for each exam.",
    "I actually would. It was cool by the end to feel like you had a decent sense of how the body works and how enzymes and pathways regulate different processes.",
    "I would highly recommend this class! I'm a chemistry major, so this class wasn't required for me, but I really enjoyed taking it and it counts as an upper level elective for the major. I really felt like I learned biochemistry and the class is for the most part taught well and is engaging.",
    "No clue what 200 is like but if you're not MBB then who knows which is the better choice",
    "Absolutely! While I took the course because I'm an MB&B major, I would have taken it anyways because it really gave both a breadth and depth of knowledge of biochemistry that I can use in my future studies. I would definitely recommend this to pre-med students trying to decide between different biochemistry classes because the information is so well-taught that it will really help with providing a foundation in biochemistry and with studying for the MCAT.",
    "Yes! It was a good comprehensive introduction to biochemistry beyond what is learned in Bio101.",
    "I would definitely suggest that people consider taking this one instead of the Mcdb biochem. Although many people are scared off because this one goes more in depth, the teaching really helps a lot and it definitely did not feel overwhelming. Also, you get to drop one midterm which allows for slightly more leeway in terms of grading. The material is also interesting and, for the most part, presented well.",
    "Yes. You are likely deciding between this biochem and the MCDB biochem to fulfill premed requirements. This course has a cumulative exam, unlike the MCDB course, but besides that, this course seems much more logical and with better instruction than the other. Having 3 (instead of 4) midterms is much more reasonable and short weekly psets provide some other assessment that offsets just exam grades in the final grade calculation.",
    "Yes, if youre studying something related to biology. I am a neuroscience major, so it was good to learn the fundamentals of cellular processes for a deeper understanding in my own research, but it also wasnt the most interesting subject for me.",
    "If you are interested in medicinal chemistry, I strongly recommend that you take it as it goes over all the basics with binding sites.",
    "If you have to take biochem then this course is fine! Definitely not the worst class to be required!",
    "Yes, super interesting material taught very well!",
    "Absolutely, without a doubt! This class certainly takes time to learn concepts and be able to apply them but it's definitely a nice challenge that offers rigor. Problem sets are respectful of your time, giving space to focus on the class in the way that you find most conducive to your overall learning.",
    "If you're an MCDB consider taking this biochemistry course instead of the MCDB biochem. This course has better structuring and the teaching is very good.",
    "Yes, I definitely found the content very engaging, and the instructors are genuinely invested in your education.",
    "Yes. Its the best.",
    "Yes. While this class has an insane amount of information, the three midterms break it up into manageable chunks. If you attend lecture and clear up confusions as they come up, it's not that difficult to learn the material. More importantly, at the end of the course you will be equipped to understand the mechanisms underlying metabolic and other cellular processes. The course emphasizes concepts rather than details, and while you will memorize a lot of important facts during this class you will come away with an ability to use these facts to explain biochemical concepts like protein folding, protein modification, enzymatic kinetics, and the intricacies of metabolic regulation to name a few. The most rewarding part of this course is that things you accepted at face value in past biology courses will no longer be axiomatic assertions, but logical conclusions that follow from the principles learned in this course.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this class over the MCDB course. From what I understand, this class is much more systematic and a little more rigorous in the material - well-worth any extra effort! I finally felt in this class that an introductory STEM class at Yale has given me meaningful, structured content that I can move forward with; not just random tidbits of disparate information that I regurgitate for a test.",
    "Yes. This course is well taught and provides an excellent foundation in biochemistry, essential to understanding biology and medicine.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that needs the course for med school or for the major. It is a lot of work, but a lot of content is learned if you can keep up with it.",
    "Yes. Good course.",
    "Yes, I thought it was much more interesting than the prerequisite courses. I have found it helps me understand real life things more.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to all biology students and all premeds. The knowledge from the metabolism section is not only useful in terms of understanding diets and nutrition but also interesting.",
    "Yes! I loved it and learned a lot",
    "Yes, take this course! The professors are great at explaining material and have clear slide printouts for each lecture.",
    "Any student wishing to pursue a career in science research",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it builds on the principles of molecular interactions that have been introduced in chemistry and physics, then applies them to understand the events that make life possible.",
    "I would recommend this course because the professors are very clear lecturers. The course has a lot of interesting information that the professors regularly connect to real world examples.",
    "you only take this course if you have to",
    "I would definitely recommend this course: it was such an exciting course to take! Challenging at times, but I am amazed at how much knowledge I learned! I feel well prepared for the medical field, but also well prepared for biochemical research. This course is just an interesting course, juxtaposed with an ecology and evolutionary biology class. Many of you have to take it, but it was genuinely interesting to me, and so coming in with the mindset of enjoying the class will be a MAJOR piece of advice."
