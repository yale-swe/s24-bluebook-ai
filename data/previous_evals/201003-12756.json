   "comments": [
    "Definitely its a must take. Before this class I didn't know much about Latin America but after this class I definitely feel much more comfortable and knowledgeable about the region.",
    "It is an interesting application of economics principles to cases in Latin America.",
    "Yes, for a deeper understanding of Latin American economies, and for a general appreciation of economic policies and basic economic theory too.",
    "Great class. Very interesting - problem sets are varied between short papers and questions. Should be called economic policy in Chile though (the prof and the TA are chilean). Don't expect to hear about Brazil!The exams are easy. Too easy. So easy you feel annoyed that you studied for them. If you have a handle on basic algebra that is all you need. Hopefully that will change because its nice to actually be tested on the material that you've learnt.",
    "i would definitely recommend this class. previous completion of intermediate micro and macro will make things much easier, as the material touches on the basics of both classes. the class was well taught and the workload is very reasonable.",
    "Econ policy in Latin America was the best econ course I've taken at Yale so far. Professor Engel is a very engaging lecturer, and the material is incredibly relevant--even if you don't have a background in Latin America. Readings and assignments are totally reasonable. You'll leave with a better idea of how concepts learned in micro and macro apply to policy design. Definitely recommend this course.",
    "It's a good class on a topic on which there is VERY LITTLE at Yale (Latin America). Take it!",
    "Definitely.Take it if you have any interest in the region, or want to understand the current situation, economically, of any nation in the region!",
    "Economic Policy of Latin America is a class that you should definitely take. Yes there are some high levels of economic theory involved, but the main focus is policy. You learn about so many areas (education, social programs, trade liberalization). If you want a class that focuses less on theory and pays more attention to real historical case studies, then this is the class to take. Lots of hard work, no doubt, but the knowledge you take away from the class about Latin American economics is just fantastic."
