    "If you're passionate about mathematics and are ready to dedicate the time, then definitely take this class and not a lower class for introductory college mathematics. The problem sets take upwards of 15 hours per week, and group study is encouraged.Professor Hadari understands that the material he is teaching is difficult, and in doing so, he is readily available to help and augment class time with office hours.The difficulty in this class lies in the problem sets, not the exams. So, overall a great portion of your grade is reflected by the effort you put into the class. If you're ready to make the time commitment and love to learn about math, this is the class for you.",
    "It was a challenging math course intended for prospective math majors.Yes if he wants to major in mathematics and no if otherwise.",
    "Rigorous course in Multivariable Differential Calculus and Linear Algebra (with sprinklings of point set topology, algebra, and analysis) - not meant for students who aren't used to proving things for themselves. If you think you're ready, take the course, but if in doubt, take one of the linear algebra courses instead (and then vector analysis , Math 250); either way, you'll learn the same material, but definitely not as rigorously if you don't take 230.You'll see most of your classmates getting together into study groups to work on problem sets; if you're really stuck, I would go to the professor himself to ask for a hint (and only a hint) - don't let other people solve problems for you. Even if you understand their solution, you won't be able to replicate their thinking, and the point of this course is to get students to think on their own. None of the problems are meant to be inaccessible, and you'll get a lot more out of the course struggling on your own than copying down solutions.",
    "THE class for freshman math majors. Expect to do work, but you will learn a lot. Asaf is awesome.",
    "I loved Math 230, but like many things I love, I often hated it and wished it would disappear. It will define your semester. People might know you as that kid who's in 230 and is therefore crazy. To be specific: 25 hours of work per week is not a joke. It takes a very particular kind of person to enjoy Math 230. It's not enough to have been a math whiz in your AP calc class. More likely, you were so addicted to math that you snuck books of college-level problems out of the library, whiled away hours on Wolfram Mathworld, and tried to prove impossibly hard theorems just for kicks on the occasional napkin. Shop math 230 and it should be apparent within an hour whether this was the course you've been waiting for your whole life (it was for me).",
    "This class is very hard and takes a huge amount of time. It is also all proofs. Do not take this class unless you love math and want it to be what you spend most of your time doing. I am not exaggerating at all and would not suggest this class to a very well rounded person. Also if you start in 230 it is hard to switch into another class in the spring if you are interested in being a math major, so don't take it unless you're really sure.I have learned a lot, but will not be taking it in the spring. I like a challenge, but did not find the amount of time I spent on homeworks worth it because I was not able to devote time on other interests.",
    "MATH 230 is a way of life. It is a huge time commmitment but at the end it is extremely rewarding. I would only recommend this course if you have done some proof-based math. Background in linear algebra and multivariable calculus is not required for this course. The problem sets are the essence of the course and are the main difficulty too: every week they take forever to finish. But the course is fantastic: we covered a huge amount of material: we have touched on linear algebra, topology, multivariable calculus and many other interesting topics in either lectures or in homework. As long as you do the homework, the exams will be relatively easy and the grading is very fair.",
    "This class is very difficult, especially if you have never taken a rigorous, proof-based math class before. Be warned--problem sets are extremely long (this cannot be overstated), and the course has a very wide range of material to be covered. Many students will probably find it necessary to sacrifice a lot of time that might have been spent on other pursuits for this class. That said, the grading is quite fair and if you really do put in the time and effort, you can learn a ton and come away with a much deeper understanding of several areas of mathematics.",
    "I would recommend Math 230 only for a student who has a very strong interest in math and is willing to put in the required time. For any such students the course will be very rewarding.",
    "For people who really like math, MATH 230 is the obvious choice. It's stimulating and rewarding--it covers a broad range of topics with an unparalleled completeness and depth. Nothing is left unproven: it begins with the most basic definitions and ends up at some really important and beautiful results. Professor Hadari has a very complete knowledge of and earnest enthusiasm for the subject, and his enthusiasm is contagious. Go to his office hours; you'll learn a lot there.There is a lot of work for the course, but it is enlightening. The problems Professor Hadari creates are both challenging and rewarding. His tests are less difficult, which reflects his focus on the subject material rather than the exams and grading. You will work hard though (maybe 10-20 hours of homework a week). If you're really interested in something besides math and you're just taking this course because you think it wouldbe a good background in math, I would specifically advise not taking this course. You're only going to get something out of this course if you put in the (extensive) time and effort, and you're only going to do that if you really are interested in math.",
    "As someone who really enjoys doing rigorous proof-based math and who had taken both MVC and Linear Algebra in high school, I thought that this class would go well for me. I was wrong. If you take Math 230, expect to spend hours upon hours each week doing your problem sets and struggling to understand the material. I would say that you should only take this class if you are deeply interested in calculus and linear algebra in particular, otherwise the workload isn't worth it.",
    "The hardest course in mathematics that you will ever take (probably) - or definitely the most work per week. I would highly recommend it if you plan on being a math major, or if you are in love with math.",
    "It's an intense way to learn mathematics a little beyond what math 120 has to offer. I would recommend it if you really love math.",
    "Only take math 230 if you are seriously considering being a math or physics major, and even then, think carefully. This class has on average 20+ hours of homework each week, hence 80% of the learning takes place in the homework. If you don't love math, don't take this course. If you love math, only take this course if you're willing to put in the hours necessary to do well.That said, the grading is definitely generous. Hadari recognizes that the material is hard and he isn't deliberately trying to squash your gpa. He only expects you to do the work and learn as much math as you can. If you do this, the lowest you'll get is a B.I came into this class with a good math background (up through multivar calc, but no linear algebra) and still did fairly well. There were many late nights and problem sets that devoured my spare time, but I definitely don't regret taking the course. Hadari is a very good lecturer and is quite helpful during office hours (you definitely want to take advantage of office hours in this course). Reach out to others right away to form study groups; chances are there are people in the class who are much better at math than you. Ask questions and ask for help, even at the expense of your ego, otherwise you'll regret it later. Math 230 is a very rewarding class, but it has a nasty reputation for very legitimate reasons...",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any prospective pure (not applied) math major who has some basic knowledge of proof techniques, and has perhaps done some problem-solving\/competition math. The class is really a rigorous treatment of the topics in the course title and introduces concepts from peripheral fields as necessary. We've worked with non-trivial results in analysis, topology, and algebra, among others.The course title doesn't include it, but the latter half of 230 is more-or-less dedicated to manifolds, so I would recommend getting some additional reading for the course.Bottom line, if you know you love math, you can be sure to love this course.",
    "This is a really hard, advanced course. Be prepared to put in a lot of hours outside of the classroom. That said, Hadari recognizesthat the class is hard and if you put in the work he is very relaxed with grading.Be prepared: the title \"Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus\" is a bit of a misnomer; the course would have been better called \"math.\"We went through proofs in a zillion different areas of advanced mathematics, from algebra to topology to functional analysis.",
    "Very rigorous intro to linear algebra, with some other stuff thrown in. Expect to spend 10-15 hours on most p-sets. Don't let the workload deter you, though, Asaf is an excellent professor, and though homeworks are difficult, exams are very fair, and the grading scheme is not at all harsh. Also, once you've gotten through this, you can get through pretty much anything (except maybe some of those programming classes...) and you will have learned A LOT.",
    "This course has big p-sets, but it isn't abnormally difficult material. He does cover the material really fast, though.",
    "Take this class if you really enjoy math, not just if you're good at it. The workload is enormous (although it's often exaggerated, and is totally manageable if you work steadily on a problem set all week) but you'll solve a lot of really cool problems and learn a whole lot of math. Best class of the semester.Ignore the recommendation to take this with Physics 260 if you want a math class that will be helpful for physics, because this won't be.",
    "No one will deny this is some tough stuff.",
    "It's a lot of work, which is awesome if you like math but wouldn't be much fun if you don't. The first few classes are a good representation of the kind of work you'll be doing (although it's toned down a bit for shopping period), so definitely shop it if you think you're interested.",
    "MATH-230 will be your life. It is definitely worth it, but choose wisely. Also, it does not cover the simple multivariable topics needed for PHYS-260, so be prepared to learn them on your own. Problem sets take a LOT of time, but are very rewarding and interesting.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. While it is challenging and fast paced, Professor Hadari was articulate and helpful. His office hours were of great assistance. The problem sets were long and difficult but helpful and interesting. It felt like it was a comprehensive introductory course for math lovers, though others may have a different opinion. Besides, it's a great chance to become a part of a community."
