    "Learned more about different aspects of land use",

    "This course gave a comprehensive overview on various topics related to land use.",
    "I gained a great deal of insight into land use planning and the cutting edge areas worth engaging in now and in the future.",
    "This was a very useful survey of how and where land use planning is getting done. The fact that we had lectures from a variety of practitioners meant that we could go more in depth about specific areas of land use. It also meant that we got a glimpse of what is coming next from the inside.",
    "General walk through issues in land use",

    "Very well",
    "It was aligned with my expectations.",
    "The course aligned well with my expectations and often exceeded what I thought I would gain.",
    "Expectations were largely well aligned. Kevin Dwarka's lecture exceeded expectations. He gave a great amount of context, depth, and potential. The best lectures covered these three thoroughly. Occassionallly depth was lacking.",
    "well",
    "The class incorporated many different and diverse topics in land use which I appreciated learning about. I also appreciated the varying perspectives of the presenters."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some presenters didn't leave much time for questions",
    "The strength of the course is the variety of speakers who presented throughout the semester. An incorporation of class discussion would deepen the experience of the class.",
    "There is never enough time in class. However, presenters that allowed time for questions had the most engaging presentations because of this time. We might be able to learn more from presentations and from each other if 15-ish minutes were given to discussion of speakers and their topics after guest lectures. It was very interesting to learn from practitioners in the field, but some time to debrief each presentation with each other and talk about what we thought of it would be extremely helpful.",
    "Strengths- variety of topics, speakers from various workplaces, reasonable amount of work Weaknesses- none",
    "A strength of the course is the fact that it is a relatively low lift as far as student effort, and the level of engagement is really defined by the individual student. Regardless of one's level of effort, by just attending seminar, you gain exposure to a wide range of land use issues in an effective way that builds over the semester.",
    "The seminar served its purpose. Strengths were that we were introduced to a broad variety of land use subjects. The readings were also interesting, and useful to better understand some of the legal nuances and opportunities not always covered in class. It could be improved by having speakers come in from communities that have gone through comprehensive planning. Discussions could be more nuanced and informative this way.",
    "It is a seminar with different speakers each week",
    "The presenters often spoke for the entire class period leaving little time at the end for discussion\/questions"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking it, and recommend doing readings beforehand",
    "It is a laid-back class experience and worth taking if you are interested in getting an introduction to working on sustainability issues on local levels.",
    "Great introduction class to Land Use and city planning topics. This, or an equivalent, is a requirement for the Land Use Clinic.",
    "Attend every lecture, engage with the speakers",
    "I would advise students even vaguely interested in land use planning to take this course! It's a great opportunity for exposure and learning.",
    "This is a good class for anyone interested in an introduction to land use planning. Multiple speaker's mean that you can reach out to individuals for more information if you are interested in a particular avenue. Work load is light, largely just enjoying lectures each week. But don't skimp on the readings. They are interesting, useful, and cover material not covered in class most days.",
    "It is a great course to start learning about land use",
    "I would advise students to engage with the presenters and to ask questions about topics you are interested in, as our class had some very insightful discussions when questions were asked."
