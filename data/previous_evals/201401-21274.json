    "This class was a really fun way to read a lot of different texts that dealt with various issues in biographical writing (authorship, factuality, bias, audience etc.). There's a good mix of English and French texts (read in translation), all of which touch on important ideas or subjects. Each week is a bit different than the last. Workload is manageable. Aside from weekly readings, we had two essays and a final class project on Joan of Arc. But mostly, this class was great because of Professor Butterfield and Joe who created a good class dynamic and kept discussion going.",
    "I would summarize Medieval Biography as a wonderful way to receive a pre-1800 requirement; but even beyond that the course was a wonderful way to learn about a time period that seems so long past. This is a lovely seminar environment in which Professor Butterfield and Joe Stadolnik inspired discussion on topics that are in the end relevant for any English major or person interested in language, history, translation, and, of course, the medieval period."
