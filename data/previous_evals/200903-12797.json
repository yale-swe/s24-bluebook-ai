   "comments": [
    "yes. Definitely take it if you want to take a language course. it should be better than the other languages courses as far as i know.",
    "yes i would recommend it because it is taught at a fast pace but manageable to most students",
    "I enjoyed this class, but the videos they use to teach you is pretty sexist and can be useless and uncomfortable. My advice is to read the transcript of the lesson before you go to CLS, because otherwise you'll be kind of lost.",
    "French 110 is an intensive, and effective, introductory French class. A highly structured curriculum, especially the weekly tests, ensures you stay on top of your studies, which is good, because I felt the regular practice ensured I picked up the language more than I would have otherwise. The French in Action curriculum is full-immersion, which seems daunting for a first-timer, but miraculously, I stayed right with it the whole time. I took this course with the goal of learning French (my language requirement had already beencompleted) and I can't imagine a more effective way to learn a language. Also, it's not too difficult!",
    "I would definitely recommend French 110. It started with the very basics and logically developed the ideas of the language. Be ready for the weekly oral exams, but once you can look past the tediousness of them it becomes clear that they are actually helping you speak the language.",
    "It's a bit of a pain. Class everyday. LOTS of workbook homework, and it is annoying to take the tests every week. HOWEVER - as long as you actually do the workbook work and keep up with the material day by day you should be ok!",
    "You will learn French in this course, but you likely won't enjoy it. Weekly tests and mind-numblingly repetitive homework assignments will make you frequently wonder why you decided to take French at all. That said, finding that you are beginning to understand a foreign language is an exciting experience and having a good instructor, like Aaron Schlosser, can make getting through L1 relatively painless.",
    "Absolutely. The class is fun, and it actually works. Things move really fast at first, but once you figure out how French in Action wants you to learn, it's not unmanageable."
