    "I gained a comprehensive knowledge in the history of US and Latin American relations from the early 19th century up to the present. Additionally, I gained experience researching and writing an historical research essay.",
    "This course introduced me to a field of history that our high school curriculums lack. The weeks were well divided to cover an immense history. This meant that many events and regions were overlooked, but Professor Rutkow did well in including as much information as was necessary for our understanding and discussion. I also enjoyed working on my own research.",

    "The course covered a vast range of material in a way that was manageable while also giving a lot of depth. Discussion was interesting and informative as well as well-led. All of the reading material was interesting and relevant.",
    "The readings chosen were good. However, sometimes we had too many unrelated readings to touch on all of them during class. I know the subject of the course is very broad, but I think the course would have been improved had each class been more focused on one subject."

    "I strongly feel that everyone should take this course. This class has had more impact on my world view than any other class I have taken at Yale. None of the material discussed is covered in high school history courses (including AP), and you will get a unique perspective on world history outside of the Eurocentric view usually taught in history courses. Professor Rutkow is also amazing and knows everything about the subject matter. Take this class!",
    "Great class! There's a high amount of reading (usually between 100-200 pages a week) and the class discussion is interesting. Would strongly recommend BUT my one problem was the organization of the class in the culmination of the research paper. By the end of the class, students are expected to write an approximately 5000 paper. The paper itself is not only challenging (but definitely doable), but it is expected to be on a topic of original research on the part of the student and must be selected fairly early on in the course. I know this was difficult for myself and several other students in the class because we lacked a lot of the background necessary to do so and were even considering changing topics in the last week of class.",
    "absolutely take it",
    "Yes, the class gives a comprehensive and accessible introduction to Us and Latin American relations.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Latin American history or any history major. The course covers many crucial events that are forgotten in U.S. common knowledge. If you are a history major, this class is a good opportunity to engage in first-hand research."
