    "I reviewed the statistics I learned in high school and learned how to run more complicated statistical tests, such as ANOVAs.",
    "Gained a basic understanding of psychological statistics.",
    "Basic understanding and application of stats",
    "I learned how to finally understand statistics!",
    "ANOVA and SPSS: not much else since I had already taken AP Statistics.",

    "I learned a lot about how to run statistical tests via SPSS data. In addition to learning what tests to run, I gained knowledge of how to analyze the results from SPSS to make sense of data and its significance.",
    "I learned how to use different statistical tests in order to interpret data.",
    "I learned a general introduction to statistical analysis and how to write up statistical findings",
    "I have never taken a programming, statistics, or computer skills class in the past but this class really made it easy for me to learn and feel like I genuinely understand the program. I think that both the TAs and the professor made it easy to learn. I loved this class.",
    "I learned about statistics for psychology!",
    "Honestly this course taught me to live again. Professor Gee was the absolute best and so engaging. The curriculum was well structured and made sense, flowed logically. Would 10\/10 recommend to anyone in any field with any vague interest in anything.",
    "We learned how to run statistical tests in spss and analyzing them.",
    "I learned a lot about how to look at statistics as more than just numbers and apply it to real world situations and problems. I also learned how to use SPSS software.",
    "Statistical knowledge on how to perform tests and read papers in which statistical evidence is presented.",
    "I learned about what types of statistical analyses to run depending on what kind of data set and what sorts of relationships between data sets I'm looking for. Professor Gee focused a lot on the practical applications for the material we learned, which made the class interesting, and I'm sure it will also be helpful in the future.",
    "Learned stats.",
    "I think the main thing I took away from this course is that you can BS your way through most of statistics just by looking at if a test was significant or not in SPSS.",
    "I developed an understanding of everything you would need to know statistics-wise as a Psychology major.",
    "This class will make you learn Statistics in an applied manner. You will use theory to understand when to use what test and statistical measure in real psychology research world. Great class, easy QR. Highly recommend.",

    "I learned good use of the program SPSS, which I hear isn't as difficult as R, but I think SPSS does the job just fine and helps you a lot with analyzing data you might encounter in the future in doing any kind of research that has data. I took AP Stats in high school but this was definitely more advanced since we cover one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVAs. I also learned about biases and how to set up a study since our final project is to conduct research on Yale students via a survey.",

    "class is incredibly boring and incredibly easy.",
    "This class is a fun, easy, interesting QR credit. If you can take it with Dylan Gee, do so!! She is young and hip and makes lectures really enjoyable. She also cares tremendously about her students and knew people by name (and not just those who went to office hours--I never went, and she knew my name)! I highly recommend this class! It's a great one to take with a group of friends all looking for that infamous QR--hello, project partners!",

    "Basic statistics in the context of psychological studies.",
    "This course taught me how to interpret data in a number of ways. I became familiar and comfortable with SPSS, the software that allows statisticians to run various tests, and gained an understanding of t-tests, correlation, regression, and ANOVA (among others). I feel as though I gained a solid grasp of the material and will have a healthy dose of skepticism as I come across statistics in articles and papers in the future.",
    "I gained a solid perspective on the importance of statistics and how to understand them. I entered the course with no idea how to read the numbers and charts in social science papers, and I left the course with a lens that helps me evaluate academic legitimacy and comprehend what I'm consuming. The course also made me more skeptical of statistical findings.",
    "I learned many skills on this course. I learned how to use a statistics program SPSS to run tests using raw data and how a analyze the results of those tests i an advanced and detailed way",
    "I learned to use SPSS",

I used SPSS for the first time, and learned how to analyze statistical data, which I had no experience with prior, but feel completely comfortable doing now.",
    "This class was my first introduction to statistics. I learned how to interpret studies that use statistical analysis. Now when I read \"standard deviation,\" or \"statistically significant\" I understand what those terms mean. I also learned really practical uses of SPSS and how to run my own statistical tests and analyze data.",
    "How statistics is relevant to my daily life and how I can conduct\/run my own studies",
    "I learned how to apply statistics and use SPSS to analyze data. I also learned the theoretical framework behind how SPSS works to generate results (formulas and equations).",
    "I learned how to do statistical tests in SPSS, including ANOVAs, independent samples t tests, etc. Learned how to evaluate different statistical measures and to determine which tests to run for which kind of data. Learned more about how to read and write research papers for statistics.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was easy to follow and I appreciated how straightforward it was! It was engaging, even though it was a large lecture.",
    "Low workload, but unneccessary time commitment. Her lectures finished in 20 mins so I would have rather attended one long lecture once a week than two half-finished lectures.",
    "Easy but important material. Weakness is final project",
    "I wish that more emphasis could have been given as to how to use the class concepts on SPSS, but this was greatly improved in the second half of the course! I think it was a great format and well executed.",
    "Strengths: very approachable and friendly professor and TFs. Weakness: it's a polarized class. Some people do excessively well, others just don't. So it makes for a tough place for everyone to actually learn something.",
    "An earlier emphasis of APA formatting, as well as providing context for the lab sections. I think that the chart containing the list of independent variables, dependent variables, and the statistical test indicated could've been provided earlier to give students a more \"big-picture\" view of what they were learning.",
    "The course was very organized. Sometimes lectures went quickly so it was hard to ingrain the material, but Prof. Gee goes through the material many times and does a good job clearing up confusing information.",
    "I think the lectures could be improved to relate more to the homework but I liked that lab sections were extremely helpful in how to do the problem sets. And the lectures were still very informative.",
    "A lot of theoretical material with very little information that you really need to know. Maybe explain some of the math behind what we're learning?",
    "The sections for class were really helpful! I wish there was more in the lectures about how to run the stats tests",
    "Professor Gee is fantastic. She was so helpful especially for a social science major. I struggled through the semester, but she and all the TFs were extremely helpful! Definitely take this course, SPSS is really useful for social science",
    "I really loved this class and I think that this was definitely cultivated by the professor and the TAs. The p-sets weren't easy but the information on the p-sets was covered in sections so you were able to finish them, do well, and really feel like you learned something. I also really liked how the midterms were set up to be similar to psychology papers so that we can actually apply this knowledge in the future if we do decide to do research.",
    "I thought participation through the clickers and sections was an effective way to keep students engaged with the course. I think the course would have been better-suited for a 1pm times slot, though.",
    "Strength - Professors, lecture flow, curriculum. Weaknesses - TAs, not all labs created equal, not all labs helpful, labs often confusing regarding what was expected and what was not.",
    "Strengths- This class does not involve a lot of math even though it is a QR course and the prompts are interesting and relatable since they are psychology.",
    "This corse is very well taught by Professor Gee and the structure of 10 problem sets following what was learned in lab that week is great. It could be a little more reflective on the earlier parts of the semester by the end. APA could be taught earlier if it was going to be tested.",
    "Professor Gee is amazing! She and the course TFs were super helpful in reviewing the material and keeping it fresh in our minds.",
    "This is an amazing course set up, the only issue was at the beginning we covered topics very quickly.",
    "I really enjoyed how this class had lab sections that were basically like practice runs for the homework so that I could learn how to run the analyses we were learning. I also really enjoyed that Professor Gee reviewed course material frequently. Her exam system was also really great (we got to see the exams a day before the actual test day, but she didn't give us the data sets we'd be analyzing until the test time) because it modeled how we will actually be running statistical analyses in the real world. One thing I would change would be using a different program instead of SPSS to run tests. I didn't really like SPSS because I felt like both the graphics and the way everything was laid out were kind of clunky. Additionally, most companies and labs don't use SPSS, so it isn't the most practical program to learn.",
    "Strength: great professor Weakness: section was confusing at times",
    "Good balance of psets and exams, not too much work but still challenging enough.",
    "It covered A LOT of material which was great to give me a good basis on the subject. The labs were also well structured so that if I didn't understand a concept in lecture I could understand it better when I put it into practice.",
    "The assignments were helpful for learning application but we didn't learn much in the course in terms of information.",
    "The course really did well in focusing on the applications of statistical methods, which is the goal of the course. However, the trade-off is not as much emphasis on the mathematics behind what we were doing, which can be confusing. Though sometimes we would go over formulas, it often just made things more confusing.",
    "The pacing was slightly faster than preferable",
    "This is a fine class for students who have absolutely no stats background, but I would highly discourage a student with any stats background whatsoever from taking this class. More focus should be put on the theory behind each of our units.",
    "The course is well set up. Concepts are presented in lecture, then there are labs, and then homework is due, which you can get feedback on. It is very structured and helps reinforce material.",
    "This was a really strong course, especially after the improvements made after the midterm with more SPSS incorporated into lecture and a preview of the discussion section. I don't always think that there was enough time during section to get through the entire handout, but they were always very informative and helpful. I think lecture could incorporate more section stuff, especially by getting rid of some of the conceptual\/math stuff. I know that's important and some people really like it, but if this course isn't focussed on the theory and math, then there isn't really a point in spending a lot of time on it and I think it might even confuse people. I understand some people probably like that stuff though, so it's fine to keep and wasn't really a problem for me because I was able to distinguish between what I needed to focus on. I was honestly very hesitant about this class and taking a QR, but it ended up being completely worthwhile and manageable. It's not easy by any means, but if you work hard and go through the annoying APA details, then the work definitely felt manageable. The assignments were sometimes a bit long, and the differences between TF's could maybe use some work. I definitely feel like I lucked out with my TF compared to what I heard from others, but honestly I have no real complaints with this class because I overall really enjoyed it and am just being nitpicky right now. I loved it. I almost forgot to mention -- PIAZZA WAS A LIFESAVER. I feel like I had so many small nitpicky questions about APA that I would have definitely gotten points off for if I didn't have the opportunity to ask on piazza, because I would feel embarrassed to email about little things like that. Thank you so much for the piazza.",
    "Weaknesses: Hands down there were inconsistencies with the TA's. I know some people got marked off on HW more than others (often times for petty little things). Some TA's caught minot APA style errors on students' HW while others never got marked off until finally it caught up to them on the midterm and they lost points for having not done APA right. Strength: PROFESSOR GEE. She is amazing! One of the kindest professors I have ever encountered. She has her own office hours (pretty rare in my opinion in these large classes where TA's are already holding their own office hours). She cares so much about her students. You can tell by how beyond she goes in remembering your name. You go to one office hour and she will always remember who you are. She also makes the power points fun with modern examples and even memes which makes the material that would've been very dry manageable. Please take this course if she is teaching it!",
    "Incredibly taught. The lab sections are helpful. It's just not all that interesting of a class.",
    "Strengths: Not very difficult course, lots of opportunities to improve your grade Weaknesses: Lectures were sometimes very boring, also discussion sections varied greatly so there were 1-2 TFs who did a great job while others not so much. There needs to be more consistency across sections to ensure that students are learning at the same level",
    "The final and midterm should be take home!",
    "I did not go to a single class because when I did I learned nothing.",
    "Only weakness was section was not too engaging but at least section was useful for assignments. Amazing professor though!",
    "Fun lectures, section is a bit boring.",
    "Strengths: Outstanding professor, well-organized, reasonable expectations, fair examinations, fair and engaging final project. Weaknesses: More of a broad survey course that did not really describe the math behind some of the statistical analysis, but that is a product of the course design rather that I knew about going into the class.",
    "It's an excellent course if you are a beginner in statistics. Also, amazing staff always helping.",
    "Goes too fast over material sometimes. That being said, this is a pretty good course for basic computer-programmed statistics and APA-formatted paper-writing.",
    "The course is set up pretty nicely, really, I don't see many weaknesses apart from the fact that some lab sections are so late in the week\/close to the weekly assignment being due that it pretty much becomes necessary to teach yourself how to do the SPSS task that week in order to not procrastinate the pset, but then lab is just redundant since you already taught yourself. Not ideal, but this is a logistical issue more than anything.",
    "The course was very interesting and accessible. I enjoyed how many topics were tied into real life implications, which made them more interesting to learn. Sections did a great job in consolidating information taught throughout the week.",
    "Very clear lectures, supplemented nicely by lab sections. Slides were very straightforward and thorough, so even if I did not understand what we were learning in the moment, I could go back and teach myself. One weakness, however, is that there was no textbook so there was no additional resource to help make sense of all the info.",
    "more clarity in problem sets",
    "The strengths are that the course is very structured and promotes learning and understanding. Everything is pretty easy to follow as we are provided with good step by step demonstrations. The only weakness was the structure of section. I did not seem necessary to attend as we could access the labs online.",
    "This is a great course. Lab sections and assignments accurately prepare you for the exams. You really only have to go to class for the clicker questions. The course is very interesting.",
    "Can't think of any weaknesses. Fantastic course. Strengths are that it's very clear how to do well. Professor Gee gives you the tools to succeed you just have to use them",
    "i think the course is perfect as is. it teaches you the basics and how to get by in SPSS",
    "The TAs and Professor Gee were helpful; it'd be more helpful with more structured lab sections and scheduled meetings with TAs or professor to go over the material, and I think more group work throughout the class would be helpful too.",
    "Good lectures and online resources",
    "none",
    "Some of the lectures were very quickly paced, and the final project, to be frank, was a little more like busy work than anything else. It was interesting to do, though, I'll give you that. The TFs could use some straightening up, too (mine never came to lecture). Other than that, the course was great!",
    "Generally, very strong. Repetitive structure but not sure how to avoid that.",
    "It was very easy and pleasant, but I don't feel like I learned a whole lot beyond the very absolute basics. They are very reasonable\/generous about grades.",
    "One strength is definitely the lab sections. They provide a better understanding of how to run tests using SPSS and help reinforce concepts discussed in lecture. There honestly aren't many weaknesses, but it would be helpful to incorporate more review-type clicker questions before the midterm review lecture to catch where students are struggling earlier.",
    "Overall, I thought the course met its goals of introducing us to statistics in the context of psych and cog sci very well, but I sometimes felt like the day-to-day structure of class was without a lot of variety.",
    "Strengths were the use of relevant, compelling examples to apply material learned in class and the practical value of the curriculum; weaknesses were the relative lack of critical\/theoretical thinking or understanding, and the broad nature of the curriculum in a fairly limited number of class hours",
    "This course was a very painless introduction to statistics - the homeworks were rather easy, the tests weren't too stressful. I wish more material had been covered, and lectures were more fast paced. I often found it difficult to pay attention during lecture. I also wish that the project guidelines had been clearer from the start - it seems that different TAs gave different advice regarding the number of statistical tests before we got the announcement saying to use only two, and I ended up having to cut out many tests. I would have liked to write up a more ambitious projects with more tests since we had multiple interesting hypotheses to test. I also found the wording of the hypotheses on exam 2 confusing. But overall I enjoyed the course and enjoyed applying the tests to my project.",
    "Very fair grading, very practical learning material. Not very theoretical, which was a plus.",
    "The course was well taught with engaging lectures. The amount of material covered was good and sections were well structured.",
    "This courses strength lies in its structure, its exam format, and its professor. The class is well-structured, with 10 homework assignments fairly pinpointing the concepts from lecture that we would be expected to know going forward. I thought the first half of the course was better structured than the second, if only because before spring break, the lab sections would be about that weeks lecture material, whereas after spring break, the lab sections were about material from the week before, which made lab a little confusing. I especially appreciated the exam format, where we were given the exam without data 24 hours in advance, and had the opportunity to complete templates for answers before we got into the test; it definitely reduced unnecessary test-taking anxiety and put the emphasis on the material, rather than the test itself. Finally, Professor Gee was an incredible professor, who integrated student feedback throughout to continue improving the course. Her humor, kindness, and insights were incredibly valuable! Professor Gee addressed many of the courses existing weaknesses throughout the semester, but I think the course could be improved by teaching students APA format in lecture, as that is such a large emphasis on the exams, and oftentimes gets brushed aside during lab\/homework because we were too busy learning the concepts. Also, consistency with TF grading on exams would also be a way for the course to improve.",
    "The class is interesting and well taught. However, it is not very challenging.",
    "The professor is HUGE strength in this class. She lectures very well and does a great job explaining. She wants her student's to learn the material.",
    "Professor gans tried really hard it make it relevant and engaging. I never thought I'd enjoy a QR credit but I enjoyed this one.",
    "I think if the textbook were required I would be more engaged with this course. Sometimes it was hard to pay attention. However, Dylan Gee is such a nice, warm, and open professor and makes lectures fun as they can be.",
    "Great introduction, not much depth. Very applicable class. The way we were tested was great.",
    "Engaging topic because it relates directly to life and to understanding life...less abstract than pure statistics. Section and lecture also line up well. TA's could perhaps have a more consistent grading rubric?",
    "There are few weaknesses I can point to-- mostly strengths. Although the grading seemed subjective and students were docked for things that seemed highly unrelated to the concepts learned in the class, the professor was an EXCELLENT teacher. She and the TAs made themselves available to meet with students for discussion of the material outside of the classroom as well. The exam format really allowed students to prove their understanding of the material in a fair way. The final project provided a fascinating, personal way to interact with the material.",
    "Lab section was super helpful, the psets were fine. I mean I think I got what I wanted out of this course- an introduction to statistics that didn't require too much effort and time but still engaged me and taught me something.",
    "Truth be told? Easy QR. Prof. Gee is really great though, and if there is a chance I would love to be in a more advanced course with her.",
    "The course is well organized but it is a very basic course and could be improved by going into more depth about the reasoning for certain tests and the math behind them.",
    "Sometimes lecture was a little fast. Also I think it would be helpful to explain how something is done in spss or what the output would look like after giving the example in the lecture slide.",
    "The class is taught well and there is a lot of feedback.",
    "overall good structure\/breakdown of assignments, but I thought the lectures could explain the concepts and force us to walk through examples better, as it was easy to tune out for a minute and then be a little lost",
    "The course was absolutely fantastic. Professor Gee was kind, caring, engaging, and a fantastic professor. The workload was manageable and reasonable, and I felt like I actually learned and benefitted from each assignment we did. Honestly no weaknesses in my opinion. Fantastic course!",
    "I really enjoyed this class - Professor Gee is a great professor and made the class very engaging and fun",
    "This course was great! Professor Gee is an amazing lecturer and she presents all the material clearly. Her lectures were interesting and she was very engaging. The workload was very manageable and the class was overall a very positive experience.",
    "Professor Gee does a great job of explaining formulas and the math behind the statistics we learn in class, and the overall math is not very hard because you use SPSS to do it. I think the weekly sections did help a lot in actually applying what we learned in class to our homework. I also think the midterm and the final were fair. It was a great introductory course to statistics, and really covered a lot of useful stuff that you can apply to real world situations\/projects\/experiments.",
    "This is a pretty standard basic intro course. I liked how the class was structured overall with the weekly PSETs. I also like the midterm and final, although 50 minutes in class to do the whole thing was pretty stressful and it was kind of stressful to have only 24 hours to prepare the whole thing because I spent a lot of hours working on them. But overall I felt like they contributed to the learning overall, and having to choose which tests to use could be difficult. I think professor Gee did all she could to make the lectures more interesting.",
    "This class is very accessible to non-STEM majors and does a good job of explaining the material as it applies to social science fields. Lecture could be confusing at times and the labs didn't always match up with lectures. Towards the end of the course, (I think because of student feedback) the labs started to help me understand material that I wasn't quite understanding in lecture more."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes! You learn a lot about statistics - not just equations but the concepts behind them.",
    "It is an easy QR (with the help of some friends) but I don't feel like I walked away from a semester in that class with a solid understanding of much.",
    "Easy and helpful QR",
    "Yes. It teaches you how to understand statistics and demonstrates the real life implications of statistics, which is very important.",
    "Take this course-- the professor and TFs genuinely want to see you succeed and will go at lengths to help you. But you have to seek out this support on your own. Prof Gee's lectures don't really help unless you meet her individually; the TFs can't super help you out in section unless you meet with them individually. Otherwise, this class truly wants to see you win, and that feels really great.",
    "Not if you have taken another Stats course before. Otherwise, sure.",
    "I definitely feel that I am now more familiar with statistics and psychology. Would reccomend. Also it's pretty easy.",
    "100% would recommend, especially if you're new to statistics. Prof. Gee is great and the material isn't very hard to grasp. Also perfect for the psych requirement.",
    "If you want a stats class with interesting topics \/ information definitely take this course. The psychology basis makes the information very engaging and makes the problem sets more interesting and enjoyable.",
    "Yes if you need it for your major\/pre-med, probably not if otherwise.",
    "This was a really great QR course. It was challenging but manageable and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes! Professor Gee is AMAZING!",
    "This is a good course to take of you're a social science or humanities person but also want to take something that is legitimately useful; there are a lot of statistical claims out there and it is valuable to be able to look at them with scrutiny and understand how they work. It's also not a ton of work, the major thing is the project, which is actually sort of fun to do if you pick a topic you like.",
    "This class is absolutely fantastic if you want to take a fun class but also get a QR credit. Professor Gee makes this entire class worthwhile and fun. Her passion for the class will actually make you want to go to lectures and give you the encouragement to get through those difficult p-sets. Take this class!",
    "I would recommend this course to other students in the psychology or cognitive science majors.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this course to other students. I thought it was a great class that was not too difficult yet I learned a lot.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're looking for a QR that won't bore you but won't make you want to scratch your eyes out. Professor Gee is amazing and super engaged with the curriculum and her students. The p-sets won't be just numbers they'll be real situations in the real world.",
    "I would recommend it to students who struggle with hardcore STEM classes looking for a manageable QR credit. Those looking for a more intense, math-heavy statistics course are better off taking a different class and leaving this one to the psych majors.",
    "Yes! This class gives you the knowledge to read scientific papers and know what the data actually means. It also allows you to preform studies in the future and run tests.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It wasn't super stressful, and I definitely learned a lot. However, because the classes uses SPSS to run statistical tests instead of R, I don't know if it will be as applicable as other statistics classes.",
    "Good class. Not too much work. Very nit picky with grading on psets and exams.",
    "Yeah it's an easy QR.",
    "Would definitely recommend to a Psychology major because extremely useful stuff to know going forward.",
    "This class will make you learn Statistics in an applied manner. You will use theory to understand when to use what test and statistical measure in real psychology research world. 10 problem sets, one midterm, one final: very manageable. Great class, easy QR. Highly recommend.",
    "Yes, absolutely! I didn't think I would enjoy my QR credit so much. Professor Gee was incredible: she's super smart and caring and knew a lot of students by name even in the big lecture. I had a great time and felt like I actually learned a lot of tangible things. Absolutely take this class if you are interested in the subject! Or even if you're not! It's very well done.",
    "No; while the professor was amazing and did her best to facilitate learning, I feel like the course did not teach anything that can't be learned in a few days, and really did not teach any concepts. Other than that, the TA's seemed to be more focused on taking points off for irrelevant reasons rather than helping students learn.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in doing psychology research or anyone with some interest in psychology who wants a QR.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because you really get to see past the complex equations that often characterize the field of statistics and appreciate the merits of the science.",
    "Yes! Great QR. Professor Gee makes your time in the class worth it",
    "Easy concepts if you've taken AP stats, you learn how to use SPSS to apply statistical tests to a real study, workload is moderate and manageable. If you want more intellectual challenge, would recommend another class, otherwise good practice of applying statistical skills",
    "See my response above. Not a bad class for someone who is just beginning his or her stats learning.",
    "This course is very good for presenting an intro level of statistics that can be used in psychology. I personally feel that I can proceed confidently in my labs because of what I learned in this course. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Definitely take this course, especially if Professor Gee is taking it! She is the most understanding teacher, and constantly made changes that made the course more manageable and the grading more fair. If you put in the work, this class can be really easy to get a good grade in. You do have to put in work, but conceptually it's quite easy. Trust me, I dropped Math 115 and was scared about taking another QR, but this was very different. You're basically learning how to test your own ideas and write a properly formatted paper about the results, which is actually quite neat, especially if you want to publish something some day or have a chance to test out some preliminary experiment via the final project. I strongly recommend this class, particularly over the other Intro Stat Class, especially if you're not very mathy and would rather focus on write-ups and statistical tests performed in SPSS (you never have to do the actual math yourself). Great course, graded fairly regardless of what other people might say (I got so many extra points), and Prof. Gee is a lovely teacher. Hopefully you also get a good TF!",
    "YES Take this course if you either need to or just want basic knowledge of stats. You learn what you need to, and I know students taking STAT 100 feel more stressed than this course. Good for premeds and I highly suggest you at least shop this because chances are, once you do, you'll decide to take this over any other intro STATS.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, if you're looking for an intro stats class then I would definitely start here because they baby you through everything, which is what you need as a beginner. Also, I would recommend this for a humanities student looking for a QR course.",
    "A great gut.",
    "Yes, so useful!",
    "Good QR!",
    "No.",
    "Listen up kids because I am about to drop some important knowledge: Professor Gee is the greatest professor I have had at Yale. She is a wonderful human being, an extremely reasonable grader, unbelievably friendly, and well organized. I would honestly take this class again if she was the one teaching it. Every class was fun to go to because of her, so if she is teaching this class, take this class. You will thank me later. Also the material is interesting and certainly relevant if you are a psych or cog sci major. But Professor Gee takes it to a whole new level.",
    "This is an excellent course if you want to have a general knowledge in different statistical tests and how to use SPSS. The professor is great and the teaching staff was very helpful. Best course I could imagine for a QR credit.",
    "Definitely! Professor Gee is incredible",
    "Dr. Gee is amazing, would recommend to everyone interested in statistics!",
    "Yes, I would. This isn't quite a gut (some p-sets take a while), but neither is it a very hard course. I could see it being useful down the line for basic statistics analysis.",
    "It's a great QR if you're not a math person, but even if you think math is the best thing ever, I would still take this course if you plan on going into any kind of research career. SPSS is a pretty useful tool to know how to use, and this course will definitely help you get the hang of it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student looking to fulfill a QR, as well as a basic understanding of statistics. The workload was manageable, the midterm and final were straightforward, and the final project was actually quite fun!",
    "YES",
    "Yes! If you want to understand statistical reasoning a little bit better this is the prefect introduction.",
    "Yes!",
    "Easy to understand\/follow along even if you're \"bad at math\" like me. Classes were interesting and did not drag on at all. Homework took anywhere from forty to ninety minutes per week. Sections were short and very helpful, covering how to do the homework pretty much step by step in SPSS. Professor and TF were very helpful for such a large course. Recommend for your QR!",
    "Absolutely! It will help you get over your fear of statistics. Completely manageable workload and you learn a lot. Fantastic course.",
    "this is a great class. finally a useful QR credit. well designed, well taught, overall a great class.",
    "I might -- it was interesting, but I definitely think could have been improved.",
    "Yes, it's a good way to develop an understanding of statistics without too much work involved.",
    "yes",
    "This class is a fun, easy, interesting QR credit. If you can take it with Dylan Gee, do so!! She is young and hip and makes lectures really enjoyable. She also cares tremendously about her students and knew people by name (and not just those who went to office hours--I never went, and she knew my name)! I highly recommend this class! It's a great one to take with a group of friends all looking for that infamous QR--hello, project partners!",
    "Definitely recommend if you're looking for a fairly easy QR that will actually teach you statistics and has engaging lectures.",
    "If you just want basics, or if you just need something to fill a requirement, this is your course!",
    "Yes, this class is great! I would definitely recommend it to people that need to fulfill the QR requirement. It also fulfills the statistics requirement for premed.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student, not so much for the 'fun' factor but for the 'usefulness' factor. Prof. Gee is wonderful, and that made such a difference in my enjoyment of the class, too.",
    "Yes, very useful and informative for psych majors or anyone else applying statistical tests but who has no prior stats education",
    "This course is an interesting, relaxed overview of statistics meant for people who probably won't take further stats courses or just want an introduction to stats. Prof. Gee is wonderful.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially as taught by Dr. Gee. She kept it simple and really focused on practical topics that we need to know to be useful in temrs of lab research or other projects requiring statistical testing. It also helps get a feel for what (psychology related) academic papers are like, and practice writing in that style, which I'm sure will be very useful in the future. The workload was minimal, but enough to get good practice and a good understanding of the statistical concepts.",
    "This is a great QR for non stem majors. It is useful for research and general understanding of how statistical tests work.",
    "Yes! This course has a lot of talk attached to it: that its an easy QR, that its harder than people looking for an easy QR thought, that its an amazing class, that its a whatever class, etc. As someone who has generally had very poor relationships with math in general\/previous QR classes, I found the course manageable, incredibly interesting, anddare I say itenjoyable. If you take the initiative with your TF\/Professor Gee when the first few concepts start to not make sense, you will find yourself able to run tests that investigate some questions regarding human behavior that I certainly have always wanted to probe, but have never had the tools to do so in the past. While I do not plan on becoming a statistician, I appreciated the course and am grateful for its existence as my final QR.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student who is interested in getting an easy statistics credit and learning some interesting ways to analyze data with minimal workload.",
    "Yes! It's an interesting course to learn statistics while being challenging and teaching you how to carry out your own research project.",
    "Yes definitely for a QR credit",
    "Yes!",
    "It's an interesting course with a very good instructor.",
    "I would recommend this court to any student wanting a foray into statistics. The material can seem abstract at times but it is really quite fascinating, relevant and applicable to all disciplines--statistics are everywhere. I would especially recommend this course if Dylan Gee is the professor!!",
    "Absolutely. An interesting and very manageable QR credit, with lenient grading and a professor and TA's who are open and willing to help. Lab section is super useful (honestly more important than lecture because they teach you how to do the psets there). Psets take about 1.5 or so hours a week, and that is all the work you have out of class. It's nuts. I got out what I put in: I put in minimal time and effort but still engaged, and I got a solid intro to stats and understanding how they work in the world and how to make my own studies and evaluate others in SPSS. But yeah for sure take this class, it's very accessible and decently interesting too.",
    "YES.",
    "Would recommend for an easy QR, and if you want to be taught by a professor who really cares about her student despite teaching a large intro lecture course.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who needs an easy QR credit or who just wants basic information about statistical tests.",
    "The class is one that it is very possible to do well in.",
    "Yes! Professor Gee is an amazing instructor and will make the course a lot more fun than the topic may sound. The workload is also not very high, with material you can learn by putting in an hour or two of work a week. Overall a very solid course if you want to learn about statistics and about using SPSS!",
    "This course is a really easy QR credit. It's set up so everyone can get an A with not much work, and Professor Gee is great and really cares about teaching and helping her students. It won't be riveting, but what stats course is?",
    "good for a stats requirement, but for real statistics intro for future use in a more math-y way, would look elsewhere",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that wants to study psychology or learn the basics of statistics. Great QR credit.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course-it is extremely helpful and honestly essential to understand scientific\/psychological research. You learn and incredible amount of information and skills, and they are all very helpful. You are provided with plenty of resources to learn and do well, and although you might not expect stats to be fun, Professor Gee does make it fun and enjoyable!",
    "I would definitely reccommend this course to someone who has never taken statistics. I am interested in social sciences, not necessarily psychology, and I feel like I learned really relevant, practical uses of statistics for social sciences in general.",
    "Yes - this class wasn't extremely difficult but I still learned a lot!",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a great statistics class. I learned a lot and it was very well-organized. Professor Gee was amazing and this class was overall a very positive experience!",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are looking for an introductory statistics course. I think the grading is fair, and Professor Gee is really great at explaining things you might not understand.",
    "Yes!",
    "Well it's a pretty standard intro course. Most people are taking it for some reason--premed, psych majors, etc. If you're looking to get an overall overview of stats for your own practical\/intellectual curiosity, I'd say you learn a bit in this course (you use SPSS, which is pretty intuitive), but you might learn more in STAT 100. I think STAT 100 would be harder though. This class is probably a bit lower stress than that one would be. I spent a good deal of time on the PSETS, but if I really worked through them carefully I felt like I could mostly do them on my own. Take it if you want to learn SPSS and some basic tests\/analyses...the beginning of the course will probably seem like a lot of common sense\/stuff you knew from high school.",
    "I would recommend to someone who is majoring in psych or cogsci, or someone looking for a QR requirement. This class also gives you exposure to academic papers and research methods for someone interested in research."
