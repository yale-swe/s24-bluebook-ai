    "I would recommend this course only if you are extremeley interested in the topic. The weekly reading load is very big and you have to be prepared to dedicate them a fair amount of time. There are two book reports to write and a long term paper, as well as weekly forum responses and class participation, which is taken very seriously.",
    "Great Game to the Great Satan is a history course of Iran and Central Asia from the beginning of 1800s to today, with heavy emphasis on the 1800s. I would recommend it to a history major.",
    "Very interesting material! Central Asia is very cool, everyone should learn. The readings were often rather long, and it seemed pretty unreasonable for Amanat to expect us to read everything. Reasonable amount of work as far as the two book reports and final paper.",
    "This is a fantastic class. Not gonna lie, it's a lot of work. There are a lot of readings for each session, and there are a lot of writing assignments. You learn so much though, the work is worth what you get out of it. I wish I had more time during the semester to devote more attention to this class, because I feel like I would have learned even more and gained so much more out of it. Nonetheless, it was still great. Prof. Amanat might tend to lecture a bit during class, but this is fine if you think listening to him is a lot more fulfilling than listening to some of the things that come out of your classmates' mouths. Which it is.",
    "BORING BORING BORING BORING BORING!",
    "It's a history seminar about a really great topic, has a lot of potential. Just make sure you have time to do the reading, and hope that your classmates do too. It's always hit or miss with seminars.",
    "Take the class if you're interested in the topic because you'll learn an insane amount about everything. Be prepared to work for it, and to literally do all of the readings. It's a great class, but you might want to take it credit\/D.",
    "I would not recommend it. The syllabus does not reflect the workload at all, Be prepared for significantly more work than you expected, which was already a lot to begin with. You will not even know where you are in terms of your grade until after the class is over. Professor Amanat is very intense.",
    "This is a good class - definitely of the 'broccoli' variety - it's not a fun course, but you will learn a lot. The readings are very well selected to provide a broad exposure to the topic (though there are A LOT of them). I felt often as if the class were simultaneously an introduction and a more advanced class, teaching us concepts for the first time, but expecting us to have a grasp on them as though we had thought about them for years. This style, though demanding, provided a very in-depth exposure. Prof. Amanat can be rather dry, but is very knowledgeable. Overall, I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes, if you are interested (or think you could be interested) in the history of Iran and\/or Central Asia then you will love the class.",
    "This is a fascinating topic, and pertains to an area of the world that is not covered by many classes at Yale (even though the United States has been so involved in it since the 1950s). Professor Amanat is very knowledgeable and urges students to be critical. The range of sources is extremely rich and involved; the core textbooks are all interesting (Hopkirk is especially exciting, although the class moves past his Eurocentric viewpoint) and present a variety of approaches to history. The problem is that there's too much to read; Professor Amanat seems to assign readings based on what is relevant rather than based on what makes sense for students to read over a week. My advice is to pick a couple sources to read carefully, write your responses to them, get the gist of the other sources, and pay attention to what is being discussed in class. The book reports are a minor assignment that mostly just add reading to your schedule; the final paper is very open-ended, so think ahead.",
