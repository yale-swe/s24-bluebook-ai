    "I really appreciated this class. I went in with a bad attitude because I thought it was just some requirement from the NIH. But I ended up looking forward to the class. It was stress free compared to all of my courses with heavy work loads, and the lectures were always pertinent to us. I wanted to write a special note to the lecturer that covered human testing. I believe he had a law degree. Regardless, his lecture was able to cover the concerns of both scientists and activists. There was little bias in his talk, and the historical cases that he described were astounding.",
    "It gives me the ethical knowledge in conducting the research, which is very necessary to learn."
