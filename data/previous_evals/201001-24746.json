    "Yes! Only if you're really interested in film studies though.",
    "If you're a film studies major you have to take it, if you're not you probably won't get in the class because its only offered once a semester. Not a lot of work but the essays are a pain in the ass.",
    "It's required for the film studies major, so take it if you have to. Otherwise, probably not worth it. Not a bad class, just not the most productive. Fun movies to watch, though.",
    "you have to take this class as a film major, and how much you'll enjoy it totally depends on your instructor. If JD ever teaches it again, make sure you take it with him. He makes what could be a tedious class incredibly interesting and dynamic.",
    "Amazing.",
    "It is very very theoretical, if that's not your thing, and you don't have to fulfill requirements, then don't take it.",
    "it's an interesting class and it teaches you to watch films in a more observant way."
