   "comments": [
    "An attempted collective consideration of what about war, specifically in the Civil War and WWI, and memory impact identity, not only of those involved, but those subsequent generations who inherit and interpret these memories",
    "YES YES YES YES. TAKE THIS COURSE. If you like memory studies, this is the best course ever. The readings aren't super connected to each other, so you need to already have a very strong background in WWI and Civil War history. However, having Professor Blight and Professor Winter ask you probing questions about war, memory, and identity and help you understand these topics better is such an incredible gift.",
    "I would recommend the class to friends with literary interests. I would not recommend it to friends who want very sustained discussions on the scholarship.",
    "I'd recommend without hesitation.",
    "This is a very good course. It is a history course that covers what it is that makes something history. I enjoy the different perspectives that two Yale professors brought to the subject, plus a visiting professor from Austria. The different areas of history and the two cultures that were brought to the subject made for interesting discussions. The professors also encouraged the personal experience and memory of the students be brought into the discussion. This allowed the students to see the first hand effects of different sub-culture upbringing on memory. The reading and writing was substantial but not unreasonable. I highly recommend that this course continue next year. I recommend this course to anyone interested in the last half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century Anglophone world.",
    "It's a course on historical memory, so don't take it if you want to learn about the events of the Civil War or WWI. Take this course. It doesn't get much better than the reading list and the discussions are always interesting.",
    "This was an incredibly nuanced exploration of the three main themes of the class. Absolutely take it. No reservations. Also, the final paper gives students more freedom freedom than I've been allowed on any other project for any other class at Yale.",
    "I would without doubt recommend this seminar to another student if they were able to take it. The teaching is the central reason for this, as such wonderful professors are rare discoveries!"

   "comments": [
    "A student of history for many years, this was my introduction to Memory as History. What a difference it has made \/ is making on my perception of history and its impact on the present!",
    "After taking this course, I am 99% sure I want to go to graduate school. Thank you. This course also helped me think about my senior thesis.",
    "This class contributed nothing to my dissertation or my research, but it did give me a head start for one of my minor fields (Modern European history)",
    "The course gave me both more insight and knowledge of the Civil War and WWI and a new way of thinking about memory and identity in terms of war. Also, the comparative and cross disciplinary approach in the course and the way it was organized was a terrific way to study, discuss, learn and practice.",
    "This course changed my interest in the direction that I want to take my studies. I my interest has now moved from political history to cultural history and from the 17\/18th century British Empire, to the civil-military relationship of Anglophones through the years.",
    "This course has helped me shape my understanding of my intellectual interests. I now hope to concentrate my study on the history of memory.",
    "It was a great introduction to the theory of historical memory, while being focused sufficiently on the Civil and Great Wars. Personally, it was a valuable introduction to the intellectual history of the early twentieth century.",
    "The course unearthed a true new passion for me in the form of my research project for the seminar. I will continue to work on this in future years, and so am incredibly grateful to this course for helping me discover that interest."
