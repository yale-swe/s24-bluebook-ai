   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This course really teaches you how to break down academic journals and truly understand different research studies even through lots of field jargon. Such an amazing course that covers a broad range of interesting topics, helping you gain knowledge in fields spanning from tectonic plates to chemical makeup of the Earth to renewable energy.",
    "I have a deeper understanding of the science behind climate change and the kind of work that geologists and geophysicists conduct. I can also read scientific material and effectively summarize.",
    "My skills that were developed: -collaboration with others.",
    "we learned about so many things different professors brought forward. It was motivating to see just what professors are researching and why it's important.",
    "I came into the class knowing very little about pretty much anything environment-related. The format is getting a little tid bit of many different environmental, geological, and geophysical topics through guest lecturers every week. This is a good way to dabble in a lot at the same time, and an especially great way to find something to specialize in if you are interested in finding a specialty.",
    "I learned how to tackle scientific papers, studies, and experiments by reading for the main ideas, methods, and conclusions. This made it easier to understand topics I'm not so familiar and as the course went on I felt much more confident in my understanding.",
    "I learned how to summarize highly technical scientific research papers, debate environment-related questions, and write my own scientific papers (the midterm and final papers). Since the course was an introduction to many areas of environmental science and geology, I learned a little about everything and developed a better appreciation of the environment.",
    "Most importantly, I improved in my ability to read primary scientific literature and to look through the literature to research a specific issue. I also got a basic introduction to a number of different topics within the geosciences.",
    "This class provided me with incredibly useful background on climate change, energy, and geology, while diving deeply into extremely specific topics, such as plate tectonics relationship to Cascadian volcanos. I also learned how to read and parse through a jargon-y scientific paper, which has completely changed the way i think about science and approach current events related to science in the news. I also learned how to write a scientific research paper, which Id never done before. Coming from someone who has not had a strong background in science, I learned a TON in this class and Im much more motivated now to learn more about environmental science.",
    "I got an easy Science credit.",
    "This class provided a broad overview of several topics within earth sciences, and really gave me more confidence in reading and understanding primary scientific research. We walked though articles that I might have previously avoided due to difficult language and jargon. It was also just a really fun class that provided a supportive and engaging environment for a first year student.",
    "In this course I developed the ability to efficiently and accurately evaluate scientific literature. Delving into a range of topics in Earth, energy, and atmospheric sciences provided me with a more thorough understanding of environmental changes that are occurring on aggregate. Although at first glance, subjects might appear non-sequential, I found that by the end of the course, topics covered at the beginning were factoring into my thought-process in evaluating new material. Perhaps most essentially, this class gave me the confidence to discuss science in much the same way I discuss the humanities. To this extent, I feel more inclined to ponder scientific questions in passing, knowing that I have the ability to properly debate ideas."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength is the professor for sure. ML is amazing and really helps fuel discussion and provoke questions. I wouldn't say there are any weaknesses of the course.",
    "I had difficulty in high school with working with other students. I'm glad that my partners were all well into the topics we went over in class and each did their own portion of their work.",
    "I thought the guided discussions always flowed very well",
    "Very fair amount of homework for it being a first-year seminar which enabled us to stimulate fun and intriguing discussions.",
    "The seminar format is wonderful. The class was only 13 people, and we all got very close, as the class is very discussion-oriented. Also, all homework assignments are partner projects, so you get to learn a lot about your new randomly assigned partner each week.",
    "Professor Timmermans is so sweet and very encouraging as was our TF Caroline Hobbs. I really enjoyed coming to class every tuesday and thursday. A rather light workload that allows you to really enjoy the class rather than stress about it. Attending office hours was extremely helpful!",
    "The breadth of the course and its format as a freshman seminar were strengths that really encouraged us students to explore and debate many different areas of environmental science. The weekly format of 1 day guest debate + 1 day discussion made the schedule more predictable and thereby less stressful. Prof. Timmermans was obviously good friends with the G&G guest speakers (she's the DUS of the G&G department, after all), so the classroom atmosphere was lively and relaxed rather than awkward. Feedback from the weekly research paper summaries was helpful. An improvement is that I would've felt more confident in class if Professor had spent some time before the first weekly research paper summary was due, to show us samples and tips on writing scientific research papers. I didn't get that opportunity in high school (I wrote Model UN policy papers which are entirely different from science papers), so I was lost in the first few weeks of assignments.",
    "Strengths include interesting topics, practical skills used, very accessible topics, and moderate workload. Weekly partners were hit or miss, but overall I though the writing the weekly assignment as a pair was a positive experience. The only small weakness of the class was sometimes the Thursday discussions were a little dull -- answering our questions got a little boring over time. It would be cool to have some more focused discussions about the background reading (and this would ensure everyone did the reading well).",
    "I think the strengths were the discussions we had in class and during office hours, thanks to an amazing professor and TA. I think a weakness was that, since all of our weekly homework assignments were done in partners, the experience doing those assignments depended so much on how good a partner you were with each week.",
    "Strengths: easy Science credit, pretty interesting Weaknesses: lots of really eco-friendly kids who know a lot about the environment Improvements: nicer grading",
    "Strengths: 1. Weekly assignments were concise but extremely effective in honing the skills they aimed to improve. 2. Both instructors were incredible facilitators, listeners, and aides in the learning\/discussing process. 3. Lecturers were engaging and each brought a unique spin to their talks, so that none were overly formulaic. Weakness 1. Sometimes criticism was unclear or contradictory between evaluations; and although I felt a clear improvement from beginning to end, I still felt I was guessing on some of the expectations close to the last assignment because of conflicting critiques."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you want a super amazing professor with super interesting class content. Just the right amount of work and you get to interact with everyone in the class.",
    "Yes, it is an amazing course in which you learn a lot compared to the amount of work that you do.",
    "Definitely take this class. Lots of people don't get in for a reason - so many people want to take it. It is very interesting and an overall great time.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Take this class if you like learning, but have very little time to do so! The format of the class is weekly partner assignments that take approx. 30 minutes per assignment, and 2 7-9 page papers (one in the middle of the term, one at the end). There are no tests, exams, or quizzes. Just friendly discussion and a lot of learning!",
    "YEs!! Great professor and a very interesting and fun class. All the other students were extremely friendly. The small number of students allowed you to really get to know your classmates and professors. I would recommend it to people even outside of science or environmental studies majors.",
    "This course is a great introduction to environmental science and geology. Professor Timmermans is very nice and knowledgeable. The workload is light; the work-to-fun ratio is just right. As a bonus, this course counts for a credit for Energy Studies, if you're considering it.",
    "Yes, for sure, for both STEM and non-STEM people. The reading in the class was difficult, so it is good practice for future work; the same is true with the research papers. That being said, the overall workload was not bad. Tuesday guest lectures were amazing, and Thursday class discussions were okay. Overall, I would totally recommend.",
    "Yes!!!! Especially if youre interested in science but not extremely confident in your skills. Theres a high intellectual gain for relatively less work. And its a great science credit for humanities-oriented people.",
    "This course is a really easy Science credit. Be prepared to get a B though, because there are a lot of students who are actually really interested in environmental science.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Timmermans is amazing. She is so kind and approachable, even though she's the DUS of the G&G department. She even took us bowling at the end of the semester. The class is very manageable -- weekly readings and one-page assignments with a partner, a midterm paper, and a final paper. However, the topics are so interesting that you'll want to explore them more on your own time (discuss with friends, read more articles, etc.). Our TF, Caroline was also awesome. Office hours was such a fun time to just talk about the weekly topics or environmental issues in general in a really relaxed atmosphere. I miss the class already -- take it!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone narrowly or even seriously interested in science as a discipline. Mary-Louise and our TA Caroline are among the best educators I've had at Yale. They make the otherwise daunting and seemingly inaccessible science track feel both personally achievable and globally relevant. Classmates were engaged and discussion was always exciting and lively. TAKE IT!"
