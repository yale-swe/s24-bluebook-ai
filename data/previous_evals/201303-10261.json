    "Yes. Somewhat disorganized, but Howe is a great teacher. I was hoping to learn more about the big theorems from 120 (Green's Theorem, Stoke's Theorem, etc.) but they were held off until the end of the course and not covered in an extreme amount of detail. Nevertheless, it's a good transitional course into higher mathematics.",
    "two midterms, a final, and a final project. psets take about 20 hrs eachextension of linear algebra and AP BC calculus from high school, somewhat difficult, most students in class are sophomore\/junior physics majors so dont expect a curve",
    "It's really quite a lot of work. Weekly psets that took an entire day to do. So 1\/7 of your life will be just PSets. Then factor in the fact that you need to spend 3 hours a week going to class, and study about 20 hours total for the 3 exams, and this class will end up being about 1\/5 of your life at Yale.",
    "A very difficult, but very interesting class. The homework assignments are hard, but the tests are usually very straightforward, and Professor Howe does a great job of explaining difficult concepts in class. GO TO THE PROBLEM SESSIONS. He sometimes teaches things in the problem sessions that he didn't have time to teach in class. So go to those.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking MATH 250. It's a rigorous analysis on vector calculus, and you start to understand things you have learned in Multi cal and Linear algebra from a more comprehensive perspective. Everything ties together very well. Roger Howe is one of the best math professors I've ever had. He is very clear about every concept and he is really good at explaining it. He puts a lot of work into the class: the proof practice, the problem set, the final project and the exam preparation sheets. The exams were very fair (midterms were actually quite easy but the final was challenging). The class is a lot of work, but I feel it's very rewarding and I liked it A LOT.",
    "Very demanding course! be ready to spend well over 10 hours a week on problem sets. sometimes even 20. But it is worth it because Professor Howe is very helpful and makes the course very interesting.",
    "250 was one of those classes that I feared at the beginning of the year, but slowly proved to be one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. The class with Howe was all about proving the things we learned in 120 at a more general and rigorous level. I learned some beautiful facts about functional analysis as a whole, and really appreciate the level of thinking I had to apply to get through the class.In my iteration of the class, we had 11 problem sets, 1 final project, 2 midterms, and a final. The problem sets were half book problems, half home-brewed questions that Professor Howe made, which led up to a nice little proof at the end. The problem sets were a little difficult, but we had a weekly review session where he answered questions, which made up for it. The midterms and final were very fair.I would definitely recommend that you take this class if you want to learn more about the theorems covered in 120. Thoroughly enjoyable.",
    "this class is A LOT of work. like 10-15 hours a week minimum. there are 2 midterms, which for us, happened on Sunday evenings because the prof didn't want to waste class time. the class also basically met during reading week. we had problem sets due every week, including weeks when we had midterms. there was a final project that was due the same day as the final exam. then there are review sessions, office hours, and peer tutoring hours, which you will inevitably need to attend because the lecture notes doesn't match up well with the homework, which doesn't match up to the textbook. like it or not, you will spend a lot of time on this class. consequently, you will also learn a lot.",
    "I am little bit on the fence about this class. Professor Howe is a great professor, no doubt of that. But there was a HUGE disconnect between lectures and problem sets. In fact, they seemed like two different things. Expect to put A LOT of work in the psets, some of them averaged more than 15 hours. This class is hard mainly because you have to self teach yourself most of the important concepts. The amount of work is truly unreasonable, Problems sets are non stop(even during breaks and exam \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and just fyi, they are NOT shorter.) You also have a final project due on the day of the final exam. The plus side is that exams are quite easy! But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether it is worth it. If you need it for your major, then you might as well take it with prof. Howe. But I really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how someone would want to take this for fun.",
    "Absolutely if you're interested in math but didn't take 230\/231. It's hard and rewarding",
    "This class was difficult conceptually, but it was exceptionally well taught by Roger Howe. The course consisted of weekly problem sets and proof-practices, 2 midterms, a final project and a final exam. The problem sets were very tutorial-like, often teaching you more material that wasn't covered in class, so keep that in mind (this makes the psets quite difficult sometimes). The Proof-Practices are exercises designed to inform you on the concept of how to write up a formal mathematical proof. They can be quite annoying to write-up, and are graded very harshly (but that's the point). The midterms were surprisingly easy enough to do, because we did them on Sunday night and so had 4 hours to do them (also each midterm allowed a lot of choice -- out of 12 questions one only had to do 4). The final project was really just another pset in style,applying vector analysis to some topic not covered in class. The final exam was more difficult than the midterms, requiring 6 questions to be answered in 3,5 hours. I liked the course, although the workload was quite large. I'd recommend you take this class because it not only teaches you vector analysis, but gives a deeper understanding of linear algebra.",
    "Yes, it gives a great introduction to the subject and introduces you to a lot of mathematical terms.",
    "This was a fantastic class with a fantastic professor, and I would highly recommend it to any student with a strong interest in math and a desire to see multivariable calculus formalized and generalized from the perspective of linear algebra. Professor Howe is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is an extremely clear and organized lecturer and, perhaps even more importantly, extremely caring and considerate toward his students. He absolutely went above and beyond to make the experience of his class as positive for students as possible, offering his own optional sessions often more than once a week (and multiple times in advance of exams) to provide an opportunity for review, to answer questions, and to help with problems. As an additional component to the weekly probably sets, he also assigned \u00e2\u0080\u009cproof practices\u00e2\u0080\u009d each week, which he himself graded and provided his own thoughtful comments, which I personally found to be a very helpful exercise in improving my own proof writing skills. He also really made a serious effort to learn the names of all of his students in the class, which I definitely appreciated and found made the class feel much more personal. Be prepared for a lot of work; problem sets were a large time commitment in this class but very worth it. If you put the time and effort into the problem sets and also into reflecting on the material, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll walk away with a solid understanding of the subject. Phenomenal professor and phenomenal class. Enough said.",
    "Very difficult and time intensive, but you learn a lot.",
    "As someone who enjoyed multivariable calculus and who likes proofs, I loved this class. That said, it's definitely not for everyone. Homework is generally reasonable, although a few assignments take a very long time. It's always good to start them early. Howe is really helpful and approachable and seems committed to making sure everyone understands everything. Go to office hours and participate and talk to him. Exams are mostly reasonable to easy, with an occasional tough question.",
    "Math 250 is a HUGE amount of work, but you'll get a lot out of it. If you don't have to take it for your major I wouldn't recommend taking it because soon after starting the class you'll probably start missing typical components of a functioning social life such as people, sunlight and beer. But if you're truly interested in math, you will learn a lot of interesting stuff and if you do all the coursework you'll probably get a good grade in the end.",
    "Multivariable calculus mixed with Linear algebra.",
    "A good class all around. Lectures can get a bit long and tedious (and almost never end on time so don't schedule a class far away right afterwards) but they are very thorough and Professor Howe always writes everything on the board so it's easy to copy into your notes. Lectures are informative but we often don't cover material on the psets so you have to learn it yourself. Problem sets take a couple hours each (I think an average of 5) and are challenging but doable. Each pset also has a proof practice in which you're supposed to be really thorough and if you're not you'll get a bunch of points off. There is a final project which is pretty much a more involved pset on some topic using vector analysis. There are two midterms and a final - all of the tests have multiple parts and you're supposed to choose one question from each part. Usually one question is much easier than the rest. Tests were fair and straightforward and not hard to do well on. I enjoyed the class overall and would recommend it.",
    "It's very rewarding if you stick with it. The workload is a lot but you do learn a lot, especially with proofs. Roger Howe is a fantastic teacher, and I am very happy to have taken this course. It's a good stepping-stone between computationally-based math classes like 120 or 222 and higher-level courses like 300 or 301.",
    "Math 250 is a great course to get a fundamental background in matrix functions, differential forms, and calculus of higher dimensions. It requires a lot of consistent work, and problem sets take a lot of time, but this work pays off.",
    "Take this class. It is a lot of work. If you are willing to put in 15-20 hours a week on the psets, then you will learn a lot.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Math 250, especially with Professor Howe. You'll be provided with both theoretical and applicative approaches to the material, and the subject is overall incredibly interesting and well-taught.",
    "This class is everything it's hyped up to be - you cannot do the problem sets alone. You will need help. You will need to go to the problem sessions with Howe. You will need to study a lot a lot a lot. It's manageable with Howe because the exams are easier and more practical than the problem sets (surprisingly so, I thought I was going to fail the hell out of this course walking into the first midterm because the problem sets had been so challenging). But it's hard - there are some kids in this class who are taking it before 300 for Econ Math because we have to, and then there are some pure Math and Physics majors who are acing every midterm - devote a lot of time and you can do well, it's not impossible.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoyed MATH 120 and is looking for a class to improve their proof-writing skills before taking a totally proof-based course. Professor Howe is easy to follow, writes everything out clearly, and holds numerous review sessions. On average the weekly homework took about 8 hours, but the exams were much simpler.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The problem sets can be challenging and take awhile, but they are by no means impossible. Professor Howe is a great teacher, and you will learn a lot throughout the semester. The exams are extremely fair (actually, quite easy compared to the level of difficulty of the psets). Take it!",
    "A TON OF WORK. A TON OF STRESS. BUT YOU LEARN A LOT. BALANCE YOUR EXPECTATIONS ACCORDINGLY - A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE OR A LOT OF STRESS? YOUR CHOICE. BEWARE.",
    "The graded part of the course is very manageable. The tests were completely fine (possibly too easy because he lets you choose which questions you do), and the homework was never a huge problem because of Professor Howe's helpful problem sessions. Professor Howe is a very passionate teacher who really wants everyone to do well. He makes that very obvious. My main problem with the course was that I currently have no idea how good of a grasp I have on vector calculus. I could do the tests and usually do the problem sets, but I certainly didn't understand Professor Howe's lectures. They were too abstract and confusing for me to understand them the first time around, and in the end I never really had to understand the lectures because the problem sets and tests usually didn't have much to do with the lectures. The content of the class is good to know (I think) and the workload isn't bad at all, so this class was fine to take. Just know that you will be frustrated and confused for many of the lectures, only to get a good result in the end.",
    "Though Dr. Howe was a great instructor, and offered a unique insight into the field of Vector Analysis, the way in which he introduced deadlines and assessments made the class more difficult than it needed to be. Three points illuminate this: First, we were not given a practice exam until the morning of the first midterm. He also scheduled the review session just 12 hours earlier, giving students notice of it on Saturday night (all midterms held on Sunday nights). Second, we were assigned a final project that was due the same day as the final exam during reading week. Review sessions, held on the same time and day as class, doubled as \"classes\" where we were introduced to new material. Third, we were given a practice final exam the day before the test. All this isn't to say that the class is impossible. The problem sets are hard, but upon completion provide a richer understanding of a class topic. The time required to complete them mostly stems from the fact that they introduce completely new concepts. Tests are \"fair,\" which is to say that they relate little to the theoretical class material and are mostly computational. A frustrating element of the class is that much of the material that is tested comes from learning gathered from the problem sets, not covered in the textbook or emphasized in class. It's up to you to extract what you need to know for the tests from definitions given in the problem sets. The most challenging part of the class is the ambiguity:the uncertainty about deadlines, grading, assessment coverage, and test structure."
