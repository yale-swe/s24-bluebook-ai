   "comments": [
    "Strengths:A lot of room for learning through readingsHowever I would have liked more student interaction-not just through the end of year presentation",
    "Very good",
    "Overall I really enjoyed the course and it was my favourite of the courses I have taken at Yale. However, I think that samples of each of the written deliverables really would have helped (ie. policy memo and the referee reports) in knowing how best to approach these.Although this may be spoon-feeding a little bit, with such a short course I think it would help students to have a greater appreciation of what is expected straight away and to be more confident about what they are doing. I had neither an economics nor public health background so I think this would really have helped.",
    "Strengths: Great instructor, interesting selection of papersWeaknesses: Inadequate feedback from the TAsSuggestions: Making the class more interactive",
    "Strengths: Open and inviting learning environment. Ach facilitates an environment where students feel comfortable asking questions, stating their opinions. This is really important and is often not found in the classroom.Weaknesses: Group work, although very important, was a bit too much. Perhaps fewer case studies and more referee reports would be a good option.",
    "A+",
    "Generally pretty good. Interesting topics. Well-organized lectures. Good readings. I would have liked for the class to be a smaller, seminar-style discussion. I didn't feel like I could ask too many questions or engage the professor in discussion in a class of this size, but that would have been ideal for learning the type of info covered in this class.",
    "The course was informative and interesting overall. The readings were very comprehensive, and the referee reports really helped me understand the readings better. The case studies were also fun and engaging at the same time. Perhaps there could a couple more of those, especially instead of having two sets of readings for a week. That was a lot of information to take in through the readings as well as in lecture. Additionally, maybe the course could require students to read the introductions of each assigned paper, but really go into detail for at least one paper (both while reading as well as in class). I know we did that through referee reports, but we didn't cover the readings in a lot of depth during class, and it would be interesting to discuss papers in greater detail in class.",
    "Liked the policy memo assignment and the case studies.It would have been very helpful to see an example of successful referee report.",
    "Very good introductory course to global health issues. Nicely structured (lecture and cas studies).",
    "If I can go back I would not enroll in this course and would chose a different class. Although the topics were very interesting to me and I wanted to learn about them, this class was not a good learning atmosphere. The lectures were based on just reading from a powerpoint and there was not a lot of interaction in the course. Also I did not like the fact that most of the articles and papers presented to us were based on Randomized controlled evaluations\/experiements only and we did not get a more well rounded background on the global health economics issues.",
    "Interesting topics but you necessary did not come away with any new knowledge since the presentations were mainly an overview. Emphasis was not placed on health economic, methods, techniques etc",
    "The organization of the class was excellent. I knew what to expect, what the requirements for the class were, how I would be graded, when I would need to submit requirements, etc. The material of the readings was linked to the lectures and the assignments. I really enjoyed the group work and the case studies. Preparing the referee reports was a good way to teach us how to critically read and assess public health literature. It was one of the best courses I have taken. Very well organized, a great overview of health issues in developing countries.",
    "It was a good run-through of all the important issues around designing interventions for basic health issues. I had expected more discussion of economics and the structuring of macro health systems. The name of the course is a little misleading in that sense. Still, I appreciated the developing-country, grassroots perspective.",
    "Great syllabus.The class needs more time.2 hours is never enough to cover the material. Perhaps, there should be two session per week - one for lecture, the other for case study.",
    "The strengths are that the course content does not rely heavily on previous economic experience so that students that have not taken several economics courses can understand the lectures and assignments. The course may be improved by having the assigned readings be enforced rather than recommended. A substantial portion of the lectures presented at least one of the readings and it is more beneficial if the readings were completed ahead of time in order to truly understand the topic. Another change I would suggest is to have one of the referee reports due around the time of midterms so that some students do not wait until the end to complete both referee reports and in this way can get useful feedback for the second referee report and even the policy memo.",
    "Great course. Strength: Great articles to blend economics and global health. Weakness: large class size.",
    "I enjoyed this course and found the topics very interesting. However, I felt we did not have enough in class time to cover the material. The class is only 2 hours a week, but I think we need a extra hour. I felt like the lectures were rushed. I really enjoyed the case study assignments. I wish we had more of them.",
    "Boring lectures, interesting case studies, pretty terrible assignments graded by the TAs, not the professor himself. I feel like the professor should have been the ultimate grader. The readings were extremely long and not necessary.",
    "I enjoyed this course. The topic is very interesting. The readings were very interesting and of a high calibre. The lectures focused on the main take home points of the readings. Most of the projects allowed students to be creative, which is different from many other courses. We had to work in a group for many of the projects, which was good in some ways and difficult in other ways. It was really nice to meet and get to know other people and we shared different talents. However, it was frustrating when other people didn't do their fair share of work or because others had varying abilities in writing English.",
    "great course to think outside the box and view epidemiology research and studies from a different aspect and it is very helpful in future study design.",
    "This course covered a wide range of topics in global health and many of them are at the cuttint edge of current research. The assignments are useful in helping students to apply the knowledge gained in class. I hope to have more discussions in class.",
    "The course provided a good overview however for those who don't have a background in economics or any previous exposure, some of the articles were a little difficult to understand. It would have helped in the beginning of the class to have had a brief tutorial to make sure that each student was starting at the same level.",
    "Overall, the course was wonderful. I enjoyed the structure of the course by doing group activities and having active class engagement. Also, I learned a great deal from the policy memo and referee reports. However, I would have liked an exam or two to more effectively measure the amount I learned and to reinforce the course material.",
    "The class was too large and there was little interaction between the students and professor",
    "I would recommend it to others.You get to cover a few topics in good amount of detail. This ends up being better than covering too many topics superficially.",
    "Excellent."

    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0The instructor was very knowledgeable and the class was pitched at an accessible level. The information seemed to be very well distilled and give a good overview of the generalizable results but also covered the subtleties of the context. I think he managed a good flow in class and responded well to questions. The structure of case studies wasvery helpful in assimilating the material taught in class by applying it to specific scenarios.I can't think of any weaknesses that need to be addressed to improve the instructor's teaching.",

    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Professor Adhvaryu was an engaging lecturer and provided helpful suggestions for the policy memo assignment.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Liked the instructor; he was very accessible and obviously passionate about the material. I also appreciated that he kept the course on schedule and we made it all the way through the syllabus as scheduled.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Very dedicated and open to class discussion.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0I appreciated that the instructor was very knowledgable on the course material. I would have liked more feedback on the assignments I turned in. Also we were not given any examples of the papers we had to write such as the Policy Memo or the Referee Reports which made it difficult to write a good paper when you have not had experience writing this particular type and also the professor did not give us any example papers of this type.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He was a good instructor and provided all the class materials. He was also very easy to approach if you had a question",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Professor Advaryu was an excellent lecturer, very concise and willing to discuss issues that students raised. He is very knowledgeable of health systems and how they work in developing countries. His presentations were well prepared and easy to understand.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0excellant teacher and very understanadble",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Ach is a very good instructor. He was very sensitive to our needs as a class and did his best to facilitate understanding. His own experience working with health issues was very useful to listen to as well. I enjoyed being in the class with him.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He knows the material.However, his tonation is flat. There is very little emphasis on points when he lectures. Thus, the student may lose concentration from following Aditya's trail.He spent most of the time reading from his slides, that may be as a result of limited time.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0The professor's lectures were very well organized and easy to follow. Presenting the case study in the last portion of the lectures allowed the topics of the lecture to be tied together at the end in a clear way. One suggestion I would make is for the professor to elicit class participation in a more forceful way. At times everyone in the class would want to participate but at other times no one would. I believe the lectures could be enriched by having more control over the participation.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Great instructor who has takes a lot from his field experience to make the class more informative.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Dr. Ach is very knowledgeable. However, the lectures were not as stimulating as they could have been. I felt like, he was always racing against the clock to finish the PowerPoint presentations.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He is extremely nice as a person, but not very in touch as a professor. I sought his help and advice on a paper, but he was more concerned with eating than with giving advice. Half of the class simply is on the internet through the whole lecture, which should be an indicator that people are not interested. Maybe finding a way to spice the class up and provoke more interaction would be helpful. I would also appreciate if the professor could respond to emails.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0I think Professor Adhvaryu did a very good job with this course. He chose interesting articles and his lectures focused on the main take-home points of the readings. He encouraged students to think and be creative in the written projects. He conveyed his enthusiasm and interest in the field.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0very clear and nice and with great humor.can convey the core idea of the class in a very leisure and easily understandable way with good logic.course design is great that it is well connected with the case studies.",

    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0He was always willing to answer questions, eager to teach, and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Prof. Advaryu was an excellent professor who did a great job at engaging the class and encouraging participation and feedback. His practical experiences and research background reinforced the material and provided depth to the learning experience.",
    "Instructor: Achyuta Rasendra Adhvaryu \u00a0Very nice guy.Easy to be around. Great slidesExpert in his field.His lectures could have been improved if he was a better speaker. Could cut out the verbal noises, pause for effect and use intonation. If this professor was an exciting speaker this might have been my favorite class.",

    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students.I would describe it as a course that teaches you about health development issies in developing countries through examining several studies in those areas, and learning how to think of a policy solution and determining whether policy recommendations haveproved to be effective or failed.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students with the minor caveat that examples of written work would have improved my experience with this class.",
    "Yes, but I would tell them that the majority of the learning is through reading of the assigned papers and working on the assignment. It hones many necessary skills but lacks in dynamism",
    "A very interesting course--you do not need a background in economics to be successful in this course. This was a worry that I had, but it turned out to not be a problem.",
    "The course gave a good overview of an economic approach to solving global health concerns. I do wish the class size were smaller though, so that there could be more discussion than lecture.",
    "We looked at a wide variety of health issues that affect the developing world. We focused mostly on evidence gathered in the field (specifically through RCTs), and there was no theory involved (i.e. we didn't build any economic models).I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Itwas an excellent survey of the current thinking about the economics of health in the developing world.",
    "A good opportunity to study different aspects and trends within global health from an \"basic\" economic perspective (no advanced economics knowledge is needed).",
    "If you are interested in learning health economics or an introduction to it this class does not meet those needs.",
    "This class is a very good overview of health systems in developing countries. It is an excellent base for anyone interested in working on health issues. I highly recommend it!",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student interested in development issues and health interventions.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student however I would also warn them that at times the coursework could seem never-ending. The assignments can be time consuming but they are useful for the lectures and for ultimately gaining knowledge about the course material. As long as the student manages their time well the assignments are extremely manageable; the problem is if you wait until the end to submit our referee reports.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class. I would advise the students to complete the assignments ahead of time and space them out. I will also advise them to get feedback from Dr. Ach and or the TAs.",
    "This is an interesting and enjoyable class that gives the opportunity to read some very interesting articles. Plus, it allows for a lot of creativity in the written projects, different from other courses.",
    "It's a great class to broaden your horizon in public health study and can combine the concept of economic and public health together. YEs",
    "This course provides a good overview. The articles are long and the reading required for the lectures is a bit heavy, but the topics discussed and the case studies are highly applicable to the current environment in public health and becoming familiar with the topics, tasks, and methods presented here is beneficial for anyone wanting to eventually pursue a serious career in public health especially in developing countries.",
    "Recommend it.1 policy memo - 35% of the grade -- Almost like a midterm.2 referee reports. Which means a comboof a summary and critique of a specific paper for a weekly reading.... 15% each1 group presentation - 10% at the end5 assignments worth 5% eachNo final examGreat amounts of group work...",
