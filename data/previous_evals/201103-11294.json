    "I wish there was a course that combined the science of climate change (this one) with a law and policy\/law course (Nic Robinson). In class, we frequently ended up discussing the ramifications of a particular finding - what kind of policy should be devised, etc. A team taught course next year? We do have one on sustainability.",
    "Class design was very good for rapid learning in a range of anthropogenic environmental issues. Inventory project was well intended but could be made stronger by including inventory analysis issues throughout the course, instead of just at the end."

   "comments": [
    "The fact that the lecture in a week was followed by student presentations. And other students had to do commentaries. That meant that I ended up reading the material every week, and participated in the class discussion (small class size - required this). So, I felt like I learnt a lot.",
    "Professor's strong knowledge of the topics and ability to encourage discussion.",
    "This course was established as a seminar format, and hearing from otehr students was a great part of the learning process. In addition, the instructor emphasized a wide array of topics and aspects of the course topic, and he had a deep understanding of those aspects.",
    "Present us with a comprehensive picture of the biosphere in climate system. The structure of this class is clear and its topics are interesting",
    "I liked the material. I liked the size of the class, which lent itself to a wonderful fluidity of discussion between lecture and student contribution."

   "comments": [
    "I wish we had dwelled deeper into the science\/state of scientific research on some of these topics.",
    "Sharpening the objectives of the final project.",
    "While the final assignment to critique an inventory method was useful (I'd been wanting an excuse to do this myself), the course did not lead into inventory projects at any point. I think what would have been more useful would have been a final exam rather than a project in order to reinforce some of the data and information that was presented during the semester.",
    "While I enjoyed the final project, and don't necessarily think it should be replaced\/modified, part of me wishes we'd had an exam. The course covered so much material, that an exam review and study process would have helped me consolidate the information and put it into memory more thoroughly. This could be more of a personal learning experience, than one that represents the way the rest of the class felt. And maybe there is another way, alternative to having exam, that could help close out the course through review, summary, and consolidation of key messages from each climate\/pollutant phenomenon."

    "My focus is forests and climate; this was my chance to gain a stronger grasp of the climate end of this spectrum.",

So, with that said, I am surprised that more students are enrolling in the class. On the other hand, I really appreciated that it was small seminar.",
