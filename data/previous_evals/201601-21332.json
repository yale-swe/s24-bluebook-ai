    "A class like no other at yale. Has no formal info you have to learn just experiential leanring",
    "Any student from any academic background or class year would benefit from taking this course. Prof Clark's teaching style takes some getting used to - but bare with the class past shopping period and you'll be rewarded. The workload is very manageable (you present and write about topics of your choice). The material is focused on Yellowstone, but applicable to any career. Don't be deceived by the \"EVST\"listing.. this is more like a PLSC\/PHIL\/EP&E\/ANTH\/SOC course all in one. Information about ecology and geology is mostly presented by students depending on their presentation topic choices (but still very relevant to the aims of the class). Field trip is GREAT - would recommend strongly and would love to go again!",
    "Absolutely loved this course - I thought it was an incredibly engaging and thought-provoking seminar, unlike any I have taken here at Yale yet, and that is saying something. My only criticism is I would have actually liked to learn a little bit more \"content-level\" information about Yellowstone itself, it's history, geology, etc.",
    "Absolutely. Go in with an open mind, and don't be scared away by some of the abstract concepts--this class will change the way you think about nature, meaning, and science, if you let it. And GO TO YELLOWSTONE. It makes the class so, so much better.",
    "Please take this if you can. My favorite class at Yale by far... led me to a semester of revelations that I am forever grateful for.",
    "Yellowstone and Global Change is not a conventional class! Be prepared to have your ways of thinking and even speaking challenged (and to maybe be a little frustrated). But also be prepared to gain some really great insights into environmentalism and working in the environmental field. The class got me thinking about a lot of important topics, the final paper was actually fun to work on, and the professor, TA, and classmates were all such nice people. Take it!",
    "This is a great class and everyone should take it. The principles you learn can be applied to any other field, and it changes the way you look at issues occurring in the news and your life in general.",
    "Yes- if you are interested in environmental studies of any sort, this course will change the way you understand your place in the world. The field trip to Yellowstone, if available, is an incredible supplement to the classroom learning. Shop it for a sense of the class environment, you will know if it is one you will enjoy.",
    "Best course of my life. Showed me a new way to think about everything."
