   "comments": [
    "I recommend taking it three days a week rather than two days. It was hard for me to stay awake when I originally took it twice a week since the class times were so long.",
    "Take this if you have to for your major, but other wise I dont see a reason to take MATH 112.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is a great way to learn and understand the basics of calculus.",
    "It is basically your regular calculus class",
    "Good class, covers fundamentals of calculus.",
    "Honestly, this class is fairly easy as long as you have a background in calculus. The description says that no previous experience in calculus is necessary, but the issue with this is that some of your classmates got 5's on the AP Calc BC test and they are in the same test curve as you. Personally, I did alright because my calculus background was decent but know that without it I would've probably not stuck through with it.",
    "It's a well structured course. There isn't really much to say; it's a standard intro calculus class. Make sure your section leader is someone you understand and like as an instructor because otherwise it'll be hard to keep attending section. (I had Dylan and he was great.) Really, as long as you just go to section and do the homework, you'll be in good shape. The midterms and final aren't hard if you do the practice problems and the exams they post online.",
    "I would say it is an essential class for anyone looking to start going into a math related field or interested in math. It's a class where you will learn all about the bases of calculus. I would recommend it for anyone that is starting to take math or needs a refresher on the pillars of calculus.",
    "Yes, it is the most basic calculus class offered by Yale. It will be a good start for an incoming student."
