    "The subject matter and, certainly, the teaching style of the professor. Her passion for the subject matter, engagement of students in class, references to her personal life (which added a great twist to the course and kept it exciting), and both the professor and the t.a.'s availability to students were all good features of the course.",
    "The readings were really interesting and enlightening. Also, I really appreciated Professor Carpenter's lectures on the material and thought her relation of the material to her experiences in the field really increased my understanding of the concepts."

    "NA",
    "The discussion section of class was too large to have an all-engaging discussion.",
    "could be more focus on how these concepts can be applied in real life actions",
    "The amount of reading each week is a little too much. Considering the entire work load, I think this class should be 4 credits.",
    "As written above, the instructor is an excellent teacher and an amazing person. I wish Carol can teach two separate courses, one for Phd students, particularly for joint degree students, for whom the attendance is compulsory, and one for master students. Although the quality of the discussion is generally very high, the two groups have different concerns and experiences. In case that is not possible, I would prefer the course not to be compulsory for PhDs, and to maintain a quota of master and undergraduate comparable to PhDs.",
    "nothing really",
    "The one change I'd suggest making to the course syllabus is to include a little bit of Foucault, rather than just authors working within a Foucaultian school. To illustrate, while I thought we did a good job of working through Foucaultian ideas in the course lectures and discussions, when it came time to write my final paper, I found myself wanting to cite these concepts, but I realized I didn't have any course texts to go back to to look for specific citations from Foucault. It's a small detail, but since this is now a required course for joint FES-Anthro doctoral students, it seemed to me like a bit of a missed opportunity to engage with Foucault's key texts in the context of environment\/development anthro.(That said, I DID like our use of the readings from Said, Scott, Gudeman&Rivera, and Mitchell -- these were exceedingly useful!)",
    "The reading requirements were, at least to me, too heavy. If perhaps only one article was mandatory to read, while two being optional, (and hence a thesis sentence report for only one article per week -perhaps the student gets to choose from the 3 articles) then it would probably have been more realistic to properly read everything that was required.",
    "There was a lot of reference to Foucoult in the course. Although challenging reading, I think it would have been useful to read some of his work."

That said, as my response above suggests, I do think that it might be worth doing some tinkering with the readings and course format to take into account the fact that this is now a required course for doctoral students (and that it will be covered on our comprehensive exams). I realize that this may be challenging, since it's a multi-level course, but I would've liked to have a somewhat meatier engagement with some of the ideas in the texts, or to have worked more systematically through their relationship to theoretical debates within anthropology (or, for that matter, environmental science) more broadly.",
    "It passed my expectations, mostly due to the instructor's method of teaching.",
    "I do feel I gained an understanding of the problems in development and conservation work. I feel, however, that the course focused a lot on the problems in development and conservation rather than the ways that it can be improved. I do feel that this better understanding of the problems will help me to more clearly identify important considerations when working on a development or conservation project."
