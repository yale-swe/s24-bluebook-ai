    "Very good course. would highly recommend it.",
    "The class for me was basically a way to open my mind about a new conception of history and social issues which are often 'left out' of our high school history classes. It did exactly that, which was awesome - I really got a lot out of the class on that level. However it really came a lot more from the readings than class time, which was really too bad. The class was composed of people from all over the world and I am very frustrated that there was not more discussion because I'm sure it would have been amazing. In that sense, I would say maybe just go see him on your own time - he's great and will certainly be willing to talk to you - ask him for suggestions or get the syllabus and do the reading. Taking the class is not a must.",
    "Yes. A fantastic course, especially for American Studies\/Poly Sci\/etc majors, but also for everyone at Yale. Enjoyable, hard work, lots of independent wrestling with some very complex theoretical AND practical ideas (hello, Marxism!). I learned so much; I would very much recommend this class to another student.",
    "Marxism and the Social Movements: 20th Century gives a broad overview of some of the most important thinkers of the 20th century writing in the Marxist tradition, with new emphasis on the Americas and especially South America. The course selections are excellent. Professor Michael Denning is one of the most intelligent and thoughtful people I have ever met. If one is at all interested in the critical investigation of ideas, theoretical methodologies, and how one can go about establishing an understanding of the world from a Marxist perspective--and I mean legitimately Marxist--then take this course. The last one requires a bit of explanation: you will not be indoctrinated. You will be asked your opinions and asked to read the works you are given critically. You will be asked to present two historical events or manifestations and you will be questioned by your classmates. It's a critical space, as it ought to be, but never hostile or doctrinaire. Professor Denning gave this quote from Marx at the end of the course. It has been a favorite of mine for some time now, so I'll share it here as well: \"We do confront the world in a doctrinaire way with a new principle, saying: Here is the truth, kneel before it! We develop for the world new principles out of the principles of the world. We do not say: Give up your struggles, they are stupid stuff, we will give you the true watchword of the struggle. We merely demonstrate to the world why it really struggles, and consciousness is something that it must adopt, even if it does not want to do so.\" -- Marx, Letter to Ruge, 1843 Theory and practice, comrades. Theory and practice.",
    "I would recommend it. It is not a simple history course though, there is a lot of analysis involved.",
    "This is a fabulous class, and one that I think is necessary for any student at a a school like Yale to take. The professor lets the students take the course wherever they want it to go: discussions can be very open to individual interests, and, as the Prof. said, he thinks of the two research projects students do as half of the class. This is much more than a history of the Left in the 20th century: there is a balance of theoretical, practical, and first-hand accounts of Marxist-inflected struggles for more than a century. The class ends with movements of the present day, and gave me tools to think through my surroundings, as well as see commonalities between them and others. It's like using Marxist thinkers as a window into a method of thinking that is strong enough to critique the world as it stands today. The class is, however, perhaps best exemplified by Prof. Denning's 'reverse final' at the end of the course, in which, instead of giving a test, we asked him questions and he have answers. Very,very, very highly recommended--you need to take the class."
