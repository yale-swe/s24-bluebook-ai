    "Take a lot of photos, and talk about a lot of photos. I definitely would recommend it to another student. I took it as a fun extra credit\/d class (I'm a senior and not an art major), but you want to do the work anyway so you might as well take it for a grade. Sometimes its a lot of work, sometimes not much at all - but it's not stressful if you manage your time and understanding photography is a nice life skill to have.",
    "This is a really fun class. It involves a lot of time (and money), but it's worth it if you can do it. It's great if you've never taken a photo class before and if you've taken a few (outside of Yale). Phil was really relaxed and easy-going, but he won't be teaching anymore, which is too bad.",
    "Intro Photo is a great class. It can be a lot of time in the darkroom every few weeks, but it all balances out in the end and overall is not too overwhelming, time-wise. I've never taken photography before and I feel like I came out of the class with a pretty solid (but always growing!) sense of how to properly use my camera and develop film, and what makes a good photograph. Crits with Phillip are helpful and can be pretty fun, and he's very enthusiastic.",
    "The class is what it says it is, an introduction to black and white photography, from the taking of pictures to the evolution of the medium.",
    "The course is awesome! Make no mistake, however: there is a solid amount of work, and it'll challenge you in different ways than most other classes you take (if you're not an art major). But you'll learn a lot and feel good about it. It's very free-flow and unstructured. And you're given free-reign and encouraged to photograph whatever you want. I recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who wants to get a better understanding of how they look at the world around him.",
    "Art 136 is a great introduction to black and white analog photography and I would recommend it to any student interested in the subject."
