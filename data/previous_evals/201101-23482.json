   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Material is useful, examples are good, problem sets really make you learn the material, group project was interesting.Weaknesses: Powerpoint is overrated, nobody can learn from reading 45 black and white slides every week. Group project had way too much weight.",
    "It's kind of a tough class....though I learned a lot.Loved the professor. Doug McKee rocks as a person and an instructor!",
    "This is required by HPA program, but many told me that it is not as good as Data Management, but I am not quite sure as I didn't take that one.",
    "Doug is very smart but by not teaching off his own slides he looses a lot of focus. The one day he did teach from his own slides was the best day of the course. He would do himself a service to take the time to make his own.",
    "The material needs to be presented more clearly and cogently. Classes didn't feel organized, and I found myself doing a lot of learning on my own.",
    "This course has room for improvement.",
    "I liked this course because it was an extension of biostats that went into new methods. The homeworks took time to work through, but I learned a lot going through them. I definitely think that the same data set should be used for all of the homeworks because that lets us build on work from previous weeks.",
    "Very beneficial overview of a variety of research techniques. Nice mix of assignments - good way to apply what is being learned in class. I enjoyed the focus on practical applications of research. Helpful to have a little background in SAS as that material is covered very quickly.",
    "strengths: great instructor; good mix of methods to test our knowledge of the materialweaknesses: needs more specific and concrete examples of the concepts",
    "The course teaches a lot about how to conduct your own effective research, which is crucial for students of public health.",
    "A necessary and helpful course. I like that we have this to compliment biostats (although, both is sort of overkill). Definitely took something away from this course.",
    "Great course.STRENGTHS: I felt that I left with a very practical skill set: basic SAS programming and a good survey of several research methodologies.WEAKNESSES: I learned a lot less in the second half of the semester: group projects just aren't that helpful. I was the SAS monkey so I did ALL the coding (which was a fun and good learning experience) but honestly: it took a few hours one weekend and that was the only work I put (in addition to some constant tweeking each week) for the second half of the semester. And I did more work than many of my groupmates.",
    "Generally a very good course, delivered through a variety of methods and with interesting assignments. Useful reading material running alongside the course.The class went well beyond the main textbook specified for reference.",
    "more difficult but very practical",
    "great",
    "The material covered in this course is dry and uninteresting. There is actually quite a bit of overlap with other courses, such as Biostats, but the material isn't covered nearly as in depth. About half the semester is spent on lectures, with the other half devoted to a group project. Your grade is very, VERY dependent on the quality of your teammates, which are assigned at random. If you have drawn a bad team, be prepared to either do a lot of the work yourself or take a hit on your final grade.",
    "It was alright. I did not like the randomly assigned group members business. Some group members were out of their minds.",
    "Strengths: assignments, Professor McKee's responsiveness to studentsWeaknesses: failure to return group project grades before final assignment was due",
    "Very poor. This was course was a questionnaire course with some applied SAS. VERY DISAPPOINTING.There was very little qualitative material that was covered. Nor was very much material covering ethics or theories surrounding information collection covered.",
    "The course was a fairly standard overview of research methods. Sometimes the classes were a little confusing--I think it would have been nice to have an overarching roadmap for the course and to place every class within that roadmap (e.g.\"Today will cover logistic regression, which relates to the subject of the last class in this way...\"). It was easy to pay attention to the specifics covered in a single class but more difficult to know when those specifics would be needed in research. For example, I knew how to do the different analyses but wouldn't know which analysis to apply to a given data set.",
    "Wish had two quizzes instead of one.",
    "The labs were done in ppt which is a weakness. Can't learn SAS on ppt.There is a problem when the night before the hw is due the lab is full with students asking the TAs for help. This means that the hw and the class instructions are not in sync. HW seemed very difficult when trying to do it on my own as the SAS things were not properly taught or we were expected to just figure it out somehow.",
    "This course attempted to address a considerable amount of related but disparate material lending to the course not being as cohesive as one would hope. While I would say each of the components was valuable, including all of it led to a considerable course load but not the gaining of any specific knowledge base. Part of this issue could be alleviated through better coordination between this course and the second required biostatistics course.Another thought is that additional, and potentially more assertive, guidance could be offered at the beginning of the group project, specifically regarding the population under study. Also regarding the group project, it might be useful to move the timeline up if possible, so that it is not so close to the individual assignment.Finally, the beginning of the class had a heavy emphasis on SAS which was useful for the project, but if this class is intended as a substitute for the data management course, it would have been useful to continue this emphasis throughout the entire course."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Strengths: Ability to illuminate difficult material. Willingness to hear from students.Weaknesses: PowerPoint is boring. Examples could have been better for some parts of the course.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Dr. McKee is approachable, non-intimidating, and thorough in his style of teaching.I really enjoyed him as a professor and think that most, if not all, of my classmates did the same.He's the right man for the job.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Nice, but seems not so familiar with what he is teaching.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Doug is incredibly nice and went out of his way to help students when possible. Overall, however, lectures were less than engaging, and I didn't think his teaching style was very effective. More preparation prior to class and a more clear idea of specific skills students should learn from each class might help with this problem.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0I think Doug was a pretty good instructor. He is obviously very knowledgeable about these types of research methods, but sometimes we went too fast without covering the basics of something or without having a concrete and clear step-by-step example (i.e. original data, SAS code, SAS output, interpretation, conclusions, all in a clear format). Overall though, I think the group project, the \"quiz\" (which should just be called an \"exam\"), and the individual project prosposal were appropriate applications of the material. When picking the members of each group, I understand why randomization was used but I think it is also important to take sex and concerntration into consideration (because an all girl groupwith all policy concentrations isn't very dynamic). Also, I come from a quantitative background and personally would have liked to see more math (derivatives, where things come from, etc.) but he seemed to avoid writing it on the board as to not scare us off (though I understand, since people come from such different backgrounds and really may have been scared off).",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Excellent. Dr. McKee is clearly passionate about the material and teaching it - very responsive to students' questions and interests. Very good at communicating complicated concepts and the pace of the course was nice.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0very prepared and encouraging",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Doug is a great professor and he's a great guy. I don't think I've ever had a professor be as responsive, understanding and helpful as Doug. He also knows his material well and is capable of explaining different aspects of research analysis is a clear and concise manner.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Prof was great. Definitely much improved over his course last semester. Better material that he clearly felt much more comfortable teaching. Really bent over backwards to make sure people understood stuff, open to suggestions (survey distribution methods excepted) and wanted to make sure people could apply what they were learning.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Such a student's professor. Extremely receptive, fun, used interesting examples. Great guy - a true privilege to be in his class and be one of his students.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Generally very clear, very approachable and responsive to comments and emails. There were one two occasions in class where the instructor needed to slow down and make sure the class was following the material, given that the meat of the class was about the application of tricky statistical methods assumptions in order to ensure that research is done well and reaches valid conclusions. It was difficult to keep up with the new concepts once the course material went beyond the recommended textbook.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0knowledgable. needs to explain students questions better",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0great",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Doug is great, he tried his best to explain what is really an incredibly dry set of lectures. Having him as the instructor almost made this class worthwhile... almost.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Douglas McKee is extremely intelligent and cares deeply about his students' learning. He sometimes struggles, it seems, to explain elementary concepts to students who don't understand them.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Professor McKee is a fabulous professor. He always made time to answer his students' questions and he also seemed to care about student's interests in and outside of the classroom.This glowing recommendation is marred, however, by the fact that he appeared to be constrained by his predecessor's material. Next year he should craft his own powerpoints and his own homework assignments.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Doug was a great instructor--responsive to students, committed to teaching, took the time to learn everyone's name, willing to help people outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Can be somewhat confusing during lecture. Better one on one. Could focus less on the math.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0Good.",
    "Instructor: Douglas McKee \u00a0The instructor was knowledgeable and clearly has an interest in the learning of the students. My main recommendation would be that if the material is better understood if the math behind it is explained, to explain the math completely instead of attempting to simpli"

    "You learn how to do a regression and some other basic statistical procedures. It's very useful for understanding the literature and what goes into a basic regression analysis. You won't learn much new stuff in SAS but it's always good to practice when possible.",

We learned a lot about various methods that are used in policy. I'm just wondering which policy elective is the most quantitive-based that would serve as a good continuation of this class.",
