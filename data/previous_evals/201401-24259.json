    "Interesting class, not too hard",
    "This class is a must take if it is offered next semester. You learn so much about an extremely relevant class. The professors are super cool and nice. You also get to take a trip to a prison!",
    "ya",
    "Interesting class, tough graders",
    "Only take it if you don't know anything about incarceration, which I didn't. Also, don't do the readings if it seems like nobody else is doing them.",
    "learn why prisons suck and what to do about it YES RECCCCC",
    "Take this class if you're interested in law, racial justice, and\/or meeting other people that are into those things. The field trip to a prison was a highlight of the course.",
    "This is a very well-taught class on an interesting and important topic. You will not view your country the same way when it is done. Professors Eaglin and Eisen are very knowledgable and have lots of relevant experience, and lead lively and interesting discussions. Be prepared to read a moderate amount most weeks, and a lot for a few weeks. The final paper took a long time (for me). If they have a prison trip again, go on it.",
    "Pretty good class. The material covered is really important.",
    "Must-take course on the greatest social injustice in the contemporary US.",
    "Too long of a class and too repetitive to recommend. Great professors though. And good if you know nothing about this stuff",
    "Definitely learn a lot in this course. A lot of reading but it's not necessary to complete it for section. You'll find that you want to complete the reading though because the conversations are great.",
    "I would definitely recommend this seminar if you have any interest at all in prisons or the criminal justice system generally. Mass incarceration is super relevant today, a good thing to have some background in, and just generally interesting. The class is taught jointly by two professors who usually switch off weeks. Your grade is composed of participation, a few tiny writing assignments, and then a 20-page paper worth 50% of your grade, although I'm not sure if the professors will keep this format in the future. Week-to-week the work is pretty much just readings. You get to go on a field trip to prison which is honestly an amazing experience - we got to tour the facility and at the end, we got to sit in a circle with and talk to real inmates, most of whom had been convicted of murder. Definitely a once-in-a-lifetime kind of opportunity for a lot of people and gives you a new perspective on mass incarceration and criminal offenders. There are also some cool guest speakers. My main criticism of the professors would be that they tend to teach the class like a small lecture rather than a discussion seminar - I would have liked more opportunities for the students to speak\/contribute in class. But overall, a solid college seminar."
