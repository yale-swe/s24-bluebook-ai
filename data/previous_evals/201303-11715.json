   "comments": [
    "Yes. A good way to get through intro micro to get into more interesting econ classes.",
    "If you want an easy intro micro class take 115. Udry does a good job but theres only so much you can do with a with a 300 person lecture class in SSS. The material has to be considerably dumbed down because the course doesn't use any Calc.",
    "No",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student because I think that a basic understanding of Economics is very important, regardless of one's major. Also, I think that the professor made Micro Economics easy to understand and to follow.",
    "Yes. If you're interested in econ, this is the place to start...even if you don't want to be an econ major.",
    "Workload is not too great but students get a solid foundation in microeconomics. Would reccomend",
    "Dry material that's not really applicable, only take it if you're considering a social science, or related, major.",
    "Economics 115 introduces students to microeconomics in a fast-paced but supportive environment. I highly recommend taking this class. It's an obvious choice if you want to major in economics, but for non-majors the information is equally useful. This is a must, and I would argue it is a better experience than the seminar version, especially if you are disciplined enough to handle the readings on your own.",
    "ECON 115 is the perfect introduction to Microeconomics. It is both theoretical and application based. I would recommend this class to EVERY Yale student.",
    "Great intro class.",
    "Everything you want to know about microeconomics. Good course but sometimes boring. Midterm was hard. Haven't taken the final yet.",
    "I would definitely recommend ECON 115. I hadn't taken an economics class before and Udry made the information accessible and understandable. He's a great lecturer--talks slowly and always goes through each step for graphs. You don't need to know much math, and if you form a good study group for the problem sets, those aren't difficult either. I found ECON 115 very rewarding and a perfect class to start off freshman year.",
    "Introductory economics is very intuition-based. If you are good with the material, you will not need to attend section, will probably end up skipping lecture a lot, and you will do just fine in the class by reading the textbook and the lecture slides. If you don't have that intuitive grasp, it'll probably be a struggle. The material isn't difficult, per se, but it often seems arbitrary and confusing. It also doesn't help that it's all just mind-numbingly dull. There is literally no math beyond basic algebra, so don't worry about that. I think that Udry is a good professor, but don't expect anyone to be compelling with this material to cover. Take it if you need it as a prerequisite to something more interesting.",
    "Take it only if you can't do anything else with your life.",
    "Good but not great. If you are looking for an introductory survey of economics, this class provides a valuable opportunity; however, the avoidance of calculus only made things more difficult and confusing.",
    "Take the class. It's a basic economics education that you can always use.",
    "Would definitely recommend. One pset a week, 2 hrs max, two midterms and a final. Psets are like 10% of the grade, and have a check\/check+ grading system. Curve is great, 80% get B's or above. Easy, interesting class worth taking.",
    "Most people take this course at some point. The curve is really not bad if you go to lecture and keep up with the problem sets. Udry goes slowly, explains clearly, and is a really likable professor.",
    "There are only 2 choices for Intro Micro in the fall. I actually pre-registered into the seminar, Econ 110 and dropped it to take 115. Honestly, both courses are equally boring and easy, it's really up to your learning style. Taking the lecture, I was able to skip most lectures and learn purely off of TA sections. PSets very manageable, tests are ok. Take it if you want to fulfill a pre-req only, no use in otherwise.",
    "Take it over ECON 110. Its not worth getting that slight extra material in the seminar for crazy hard psets and midterms and super intense people in the class. The lecture is chill, and you learn a fair bit. Good for a short intro to Econ, and if you're a prospective Econ major like I am.",
    "If you have taken AP micro in high school then you will be familiar with all of the concepts but you will be surprised by the new mathematical approach applied in this course. I recommend to take this course even if you have taken AP micro in high school for this reason. I think it will help knowing this in later stages of economics.",
    "Huge lecture with necessary information that you should take to find out if econ is right for you. Not too difficult, but could certainly be more interesting.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Hard problem sets and very dry.",
    "Tough class. Problem sets were difficult and there is a big workload with weekly problem sets. Although you don't need to have taken Calc, it would have really helped. Be careful, there are much easier QRs.",
    "Econ 115 is your basic Economics course. If you plan on majoring in Econ, this course is a necessity, but it won't be particularly interesting to most.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have little or no background in economics. The pace is very reasonable, the problem sets clearly relate to the lecture topics, and the workload is very average. If you go to lecture, section, and do the problem sets, you really won't have a problem with the midterms. Overall, a good, basic QR class and introduction to economics.",
    "ECON 115 is a good course for students who don't mind self-studying. There is very little daily or weekly effort for the class, aside from a short weekly problem set. That said, be sure to find a small group to meet up with weekly to work through the problems or at least go over answers. Collaboration is encouraged and SO beneficial. Udry is an okay professor, and the TFs are varied in their abilities to explain the concepts. Your biggest boon will be your fellow students, your own efforts, and the PowerPoints uploaded after each lecture with Udry's notes. Overall, not an exciting class, but not a terrible one... If you need it for a pre-rec, it's not awful, but it won't necessarily make you excited about economics.",
    "If you want to take an economics course then take intro micro with Udry!",
    "A bit boring, but worth it if you are interesting in econ.",
    "I came into the course with AP Micro experience, but I found my previous knowledge helpful only once in a while; the class itself covers much more than I did in high school, so I was glad that I took the class for this reason. However, the class itself isn't exactly a blast, but it's an overall decent summary of microeconomics, and great as a review if you've taken micro in the past.",
    "Introductory Microeconomics is a good basic course for anyone whose major or parent requires a knowledge of the subject, or for those genuinely interested. The lecture material is pretty cool information, although it can seem kind of disconnected from the rather difficult problem sets\/exams, since it's much more abstract. The class covers the material pretty thoroughly, and there's lots of room for extra research if you get particularly interested.",
    "Econ 115 is a big lecture hall that introduces the basics of microeconomics. If you can focus in a large lecture setting and want to take econ, definitely take this class over the seminar. It's not too hard to keep up if you actually pay attention in class and attend section. If you doze off or miss classes without following up with the lecture powerpoints posted online, you may have a hard time come midterm season. Entering college, a lot of people think they should take economics just because. This isn't true. If you genuinely want an introduction to economics or if you actually like it , then take it. Don't do it if you don't have a real reason to.",
    "Take it if you want to have a basic idea of how markets operate. If its a requirement (as it was for me), then there is no discussion but I honestly enjoyed the class. I hear the lecture is easier than the seminars so that is something to take into account.",
    "The curve isn't great, but if you want to learn how to perceive the world through an economic lens, you should take Econ 115.",
    "The lecture is very slow and tedious, yet the problem sets require a lot of thought and work. If you have not taken an Economics course before, you may find this class more difficult. It's not horrible, but you really should like Economics if you plan on taking it. This is also a class where having the right TA can either make or break you.",
    "Yes. The class is huge, but the curve is generous. Udry is extremely clear as a teacher and makes the class worthwhile.",
    "CON115 was a very solid introductory course into Microeconomics, helping build a framework for both potential majors and non-majors. Professor Udry was also a great instructor for ECON115--enthusiastic, lively and very articulate. His African shirts were also an added bonus.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "Necessary evil. Not fun but interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're looking for a solid introduction to econ and a manageable QR credit. Definitely find a good group of people to do the problem sets with. Most lectures are good, with some veering toward the dry side (but what can you expect). Professor Udry is very kind and approachable and a great lecturer. Overall, I had a good experience in ECON 115 (as a person who definitely doesn't intend to be an Econ major).",
    "A run-of the mill economics course, but if you are interested in Econ, you will be interested in this class.",
    "Good intro course. I went into it never having taking any economics before, and I came out of it feeling like I had learned a lot. Udry was great (he goes slowly and reviews material so everything is very clear, and it is obvious that he really loves what he teaches). The weekly problem sets were reasonable, as were the exams. Overall, I am very glad I took the course.",
    "Good class. Problem sets are pretty challenging but just find somebody to do them with. 2 midterms and a final that are pretty hard, but not absurd. You definitely will put in your time, but the curve helps.",
    "I recommend it if you want a basic economics class but not if your looking for deep and engaging learning, or like to ask questions to understand the depth of the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if Udry is teaching it. You'll learn a great deal of economics, and the course piqued my interest in the Economics Department at Yale.",
    "Yes interesting micro economics course which covers not only theory but application.",
    "Don't take it if you can help it...but I do think everyone should have some understanding of economics.",
    "Econ 115 is a just a class in which you memorize a bunch of slides in order to ace the tests. Don't expect to have learned anything substantive by the end of the course.",
    "This was your traditional introductory micro class. Not the most interesting class, but necessary to understand the basics before going on to future econ classes. I liked the lecture format, and Udry was a pretty good professor.",
    "Econ 115 is a solid introductory econ course and also a good course to take if you want to experience having a big lecture class. It's not extremely difficult and your grade ultimately depends on the effort you put into it. I would recommend the class because ultimately I learned more than I knew before and the professor is cool.",
    "Yes.",
    "Standard intro micro course. I would recommend it, although you may want to look into a seminar. The curve is definitely tougher in a seminar though.",
    "I would not recommend it. Lecture is often so dull that it's hard to take notes",
    "Would definitely recommend if you're not a definite econ major. It's a great first exposure to the subject if you're considering majoring, and if you know you're not but just want exposure to economics (like I did) this class is great for that too.",
    "Take it if you want a relatively easy introduction to microeconomics. It's a good fifth class. However, if you have the time and self-discipline to study it on your own, I would just do that using a textbook or online program.",
    "Don't take the class unless it's for your major. Much better QRs.",
    "Kind of bland, picks up at the end. Try to get in the seminar if you can, you'll learn a TON more. But if you can't, this class is still worth taking. Just have fun with it.",
    "ECON 115 is an interesting class. It provides you with a good foundation of intro micro. Professor Udry is a good lecturer - some things could be explained a bit more clearly. He really cares about teaching his students and he is willing to explain things during office hours. The TAs could be better though, sections aren't very useful but office hours could be if you come with very specific questions. The workload isn't too bad: weekly psets, two midterms, and a final. Overall, yes I would recommend ECON 115.",
    "This class is very easy if you have a basic understanding of logic and algedra. It can therefore be hard to pay attention. Udry is a good lecturer, but the course can be painfully slow at times.",
    "If you consider yourself a talker, do everything you can to get into the seminar. The material is stuff that I think you must learn, but the lectures are nothing worth writing home about. I always found myself waiting for them to end. Udry seems enthusiastic, and while this is good, it doesn't always help the student. His explanations of graphs and algebra are prone to going awry and his handwriting on the slides sometimes verges on illegible. The problem sets are difficult and sometimes purposely include material not covered in lecture.Workload, overall, is manageable**, and the grading scale works like this: 40% of the class gets As, 50% Bs, and 10% Cs, Ds, and Fs.",
    "Take Economics 115 with Professor Udry if you can, because he brings in his interesting research of experiences in Ghana which makes the material not only more engaging, but also easier to understand at times. The course can be boring at times, but is absolutely worth taking while at Yale.",
    "Basically you go to class, do one pset a week, and learn economics. It's great for Econ majors and future business\/finance students but shouldn't be taken if you're simply trying to learn about how to be better with your money. I would recommend it to those who would find it useful.",
    "Generally a good survey of micro-economics. It isn't exactly a riveting course, but this is as best as it can get for something dry like introductory micro.",
    "Despite the reviews on this course, econ 115 ended up being an interesting and thorough look of microeconomics, at least at the introductory level. The weekly problem sets can be annoying but ultimately useful, given the fact that they keep us accountable in a large, lecture-style class, in which it is otherwise easy to disappear and not pay attention.",
    "I would recommend ECON 115 class and section to another student, because it presents important basics of microeconomics to its students. Although the class maybe sometimes tedious due to the basic nature of its material, it does its best considering the circumstances.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student as a standard intro course.",
    "Intro Micro is pretty much required for everything. Although it wasn't my favorite course that I have taken at Yale, it is necessary and I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I was expecting to.",
    "It is a great introductory course for microeconomics. Professor is good,",
    "Take the class if you want to be an Econ Major or want to understand more about economics. Workload isnt too bad, and material on tests can be predicted easily.",
    "This is a solid introductory course and is a necessary foundation. Be aware, however, that many students in the lecture will have already taken comparable AP courses in high school. If that wasn't the case for you- as it was not for me- just know that it may be normal to spend a bit more time on this class than do your peers in it",
    "Take the class with Chris Udry! The workload is pretty light, the exams are extremely fair, and Udry is one of the clearest instructors I've ever had. He has an incredible passion for teaching, despite the fact that it's an enormous lecture. He goes at a slow pace, but by the end of the course, if you've gone to the lectures and stayed on top of the work, you feel like you have the ability to think like an economist.",
    "I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANOTHER STUDENT. IT COVERS A LOT OF MATERIAL, BUT WORKLOAD IS VERY MANAGEABLE AND IT IS EASY TO FIND HELP FOR HOMEWORK. IT SETS A GOOD BASIS FOR FURTHER ECON CLASSES.",
    "It's an intro course and isn't terribly fun. If you pay attention and do well on the problem sets it isn't too challenging.",
    "Econ 115 was a really great introduction to microeconomics. It was a very solid lecture course and I learned a lot. You should definitely take 115 if you are interested in economics because it will provide you with a solid background and its taught very well.",
    "Introduction to how rational firms and households act. Good course that seems to prepare you for amazing ones.",
    "It is a BIG lecture and it gets very boring at points, but overall it was a good course and i learned a lot",
    "If you want an interesting QR without an overwhelming amount of work, take it. Although it doesn't seem particularly applicable to economics in real life, it is still fascinating to study. Explaining the world through simplistic algebra questions is truly interesting, at least to me.",
    "Econ 115 teaches a lot in one semester. It is fast-paced and requires a fair amount of learning to be done outside of lecture. I would recommend Econ 115 if you can work independently to teach yourself some of the more complex problem solving methods. It is a pre-req for a lot of things and a good way to get a QR credit.",
    "I would NOT recommend this class to another student. I took the class because I wanted a better understanding of how the economy works, but it failed to do that. I dreaded the lectures - they were horribly boring and section was a waste of time. You end of not learning any material until you have to cram for the midterms\/final in a haze of stress\/panic\/confusion.",
    "Econ 115 was a good course to get a background in economics, which is why I would recommend it, although I'm not sure if it would have been better in the seminar.",
    "This class meets twice a week, plus one section a week that provides an overview to Microeconomics. It covers topics starting with demand and supply, then moving to budget constraints and utility from the consumer's side, firm's decisions, Pareto efficiency, oligopolies, present discount value, etc. I had never taken Microeconomics before and learned a lot through this course. The teaching fellows are helpful in going over examples in section that teach you how to do the problem sets. I would recommend this class for students interested in majoring in Economics and for those that are just interested in the material. The work is a fair amount, depending on how much work you put into the weekly problem sets. Old practice exams are helpful for prepping for the exams. However, the curve makes it very difficult to get an A.",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone who has interest in Economics. If you don't have interest, you're going to hate it because you're going to find it boring and as a result, difficult.",
    "The resources are there -- so if you having trouble take the time to find help.",
    "This is a very simplified version of economics. There are weekly problem sets, but not too much other work. Going to lecture is enough- no need read the book as well. Udry is an interesting professor because he brings some of his own work into the lecture, which is fun.",
    "I took Econ 115 because I thought it would make me better able to read economic news and would acquaint me with some basic financial terms. However, the actual function of the class is to teach people the basic models they will need in order to understand higher-level economics classes. Professor Udry does a good job, but if you are just looking for a useful QR, do not take this class; it is too uninteresting.",
    "I would suggest this to any student because it is good to have experience with basic economic theory regardless of what you want to do.",
    "Econ 115 really is the basics to microeconomics. I would recommend the course because it gives you a basic knowledge of economics, which is always applicable to life.",
    "I would recommend for a solid introduction to economics. I took it even after getting a 5 on AP Microeconomics, but still it was very interesting and informative. It covers all the topics in detail, including some calculations.",
    "Basic introduction to Economics. Not a huge time commitment",
    "I would summarize Econ as a challenging yet manageable introductory course. I would recommend it to a fellow student because it was an interesting and useful course.",
    "Good QR, and actually a useful class!",
    "Definitely would take it because it provides a foundation of economics learning.",
    "Econ 115 is a solid introduction to microeconomics. Don't expect it to be scintillating because it won't be, but expect it to be regular and consistent and expect to do the work and you'll be fine. Also, don't freak out if the exams are really difficult because the curve is deservedly generous.",
    "Good to take as an intro to macro course.",
    "Economics 115 is a good introduction into basic microeconomics. It teaches things that are important for college students to know, and I would recommend that all Yale students take it early on in their college careers.",
    "I think Econ 115 is a good intro course. We cover a lot of material pretty fast, but its not that hard to keep up with. Its a long lecture and can get a little tedious, but if you keep up with the work and study for the tests you'll be fine. If you want to do anything econ related, I recommend it. I wouldn't, however, recommend it to do just for fun.",
    "I would, but with the recognition that it may not be one's favorite class, but it is often a necessary step to more engaging and advanced courses. The curve appears to be more generous than in the seminars.",
    "I would recommend it in the sense that it taught me how to work independently and in groups with my peers, which is what a lot of college classes are. It also does provide you with a basic foundation of economics that I am sure will be useful later down the line.",
    "I would recommend trying to get into a seminar. Personally I learn better in a smaller setting with more hands on teaching.",
    "Challenging but helpful",
    "A great course to take",
    "I would because it is good to take an Econ class but I would warn them that it won't be easy",
    "I really liked the course, and the wide variety of material introduced. I took AP in high school and worried that I wouldn't get anything out of 115, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quantity (and depth) of additional topics and perspectives that were not introduced to me in Advanced Placement Economics.Even if you think you know Micro already and especially if you don't have a substantially strong calculus background already, 115 is absolutely the right class to jump into Economics at Yale. In lecture, if we adequately took notes and comprehended in-class examples, we essentially knew what to expect in the Problem Sets and exams, which was really nice.The book, while not required, provided a really interesting supplement to the course material and cleared up any confusions I had.A really strong Intro course at Yale that wasn't too much work, and when there was work, it was interesting and relevant.",
    "It is an important and good class to take - if you attend lecture, the material makes sense, and the professor is very good. It offers a good introduction to economics and is taught at a good level - some review of AP Econ but much more in depth and several new topics.",
    "Take it. It's not going to be the best or most interesting class ever, but you'll learn.",
    "Yeah take it to learn Econ. It's good to know.",
    "Econ 115 is a fine class. It's not the kind of stuff that gets your heart pumping, but it's fairly interesting and Udry is a great professor. It's a little bit frustrating that while the concepts are fairly simple to grasp, the exams are very tricky. But all in all a good class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was very interesting, although challenging, but definitely worth taking.",
    "I would think that this course helps weed out potential Econ majors. The courseload is manageable and the concepts are not too difficult. I would recommend it for both Econ majors and students looking to complete the QRdistributional requirement.",
    "Introduction to the basics of micro Econ. ;)",
    "YES take this course! If you're hesitating because you think it might be dry or boring, that is not the case! Prof Udry is amazing, he makes the material completely interesting, and you'll even come away knowing the economics behind a lot of the current policies\/global poverty situations we face today.",
    "I would recommend Econ to another student, but I can't tell how much like actual economics this is. I've heard that further economics courses differ greatly from this course. I enjoyed the course overall.Econ 115 gives an introductory glance at several microeconomic concepts such as supply and demand, elasticity, supply and demand side optimization.",
    "I would recommend it to another student. However, it was difficult for someone who would say math is a weakness. The math was hard.",
    "I would say that it is a good introduction to Econ. Although I found it to be difficult and sometimes not that interesting it is a good basis to have for economics so I would recommend it.",
    "I would not recommend Econ 115 to another student unless it was a choice between 115 and 110. I only took intro Econ as a prerequisite class, and I think most people take it for the same reason. I think it's too needlessly confusing of a class to take if you don't have to.",
    "Econ 115 is a good introductory course to microeconomics, and provides a solid foundation for further economic studies. The concepts are covered thoroughly in lecture, and supplemented well through the problem sets.",
    "Economics 115 01 is a good class if you have never taken economics before. It allows you to learn the basic ideas and get a taste of it to see if it is a subject you would want to pursue. Even if you don't plan to major in econ, I see suggest you take this beginning class because you will have at least some knowledge about how markets work which is applicable to many job fields.",
    "Yes, although not to someone who didn't have a grasp of Maths.",
    "I would recommend taking Economics 115 to another student. It gives you a fantastic basis in beginning to understand economic theory. It is also very applicable to a future career in business. While there are many students in the class, it does not feel like a big class by any means. The professor was fantastic.",
    "Economics 115 is a good introductory microeconomics course. It is not always the most captivating, but it gives a good preview of what Economics is like.",
    "It was long",
    "I would recommend it because everyone should have a working knowledge of Econ and it leads to more interesting classes.",
    "It is an introductory Microeconomics course that goes a lot farther than one would learn in high school. I felt like I learned a lot throughout the course. Sometimes the lectures are a little slow, but there is a lot of material to be learned. Problem sets are not extremely difficult, and they cover mostly what is going to be on the test. Overall, I enjoyed the class.",
    "Udry is awesome. This class is a great introduction to Microeconomics.",
    "I thought Professor Udry was a fantastic lecturer - he explained things in a very clear, slow, simple way. Though sometimes it can be dry, I think taking notes throughout class makes it a lot more engaging and easy to pay attention. This class didn't exactly spark any passions for me for econ, but it was a good intro.",
    "I would summarize it as a great intro course that allows for an understanding of some basic and intermediate concepts, and would recommend it as a great practical course that offers all potential students a great set of useful day to day concepts.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 01 to a student if they're interested in economics and aren't looking for a very time consuming class.",
    "The course is structured well and the textbook is very well written and easy to follow. Although lectures are not as comprehensive as one might hope, they provide a strong foundation for further research and learning on an individual basis. Also, Professor Udry is a fantastic instructor; he's engaging and effective as a lecturer and just a great guy on a personal level. He is extremely knowledgable about the field and often uses his own research to provide insightful examples for the class. I'd highly recommend taking this class from Udry. BE AWARE, though: he says the textbook is purely supplementary at the beginning of the course. If you hope to have a solid understanding of the concepts presented in the class (and get an A- or A in the class), the textbook readings are absolutely vital. Make sure you don't fall behind!",
    "Econ 115 is a good intro course--definitely take it if you're interested in economics.",
    "I would recommend this course because it provides a frame of thought that is new to many incoming freshmen.",
    "The class is tough and requires hard work and attention. It's not a class you can overlook. However it is certainly interesting and a great class to start Econ study. I would recommend it.",
    "It's necessary if you want to major in Econ or take more Econ classes",
    "it is a great class to take in order to understand the basics of micro economics. Would definitely recommend",
    "It's a relevant, basic introduction to micro-economics. Take it to expand your view of the world.",
    "It was a great class that I would definitely recommend. The problem sets and midterms were not too difficult and the lectures were interesting.",
    "I would recommend the seminar.",
    "A necessary evil. Udry does the best he can to keep the class engaging, but for students with no prior exposure to econ, prepare to put a lot of effort into this class.",
    "I would only to fulfill prereqs... to learn economics... no.",
    "A great course to start off economics. It helps to have a strong math background, but it is not necessary.",
    "A good intro course on economics, especially if you've never taken econ in high school. Udry is very good with explaining concepts and going through example problems using the equations. Problem sets are very manageable -- go to the weekly sections, they're super helpful!",
    "It is a great introduction to microeconomics. Sometimes it can be hard to pay attention in lectures, but the sections are better. The tests and problem sets are doable. Take it if you want to learn more about economics.",
    "The textbook and lectures do not follow the problem sets. A lot of self-studying or asking TA is needed.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who is interested in learning a general understanding of microeconomics.",
    "Very hard but you learn a lot.",
    "Decent class. Udry is a pretty good lecturer and makes the material easy to grasp. The tests fairly reflected things we learned in lecture and did on psets. Fair amount of work- one pset a week and if you go to TA office hours, they always go over the questions. Reading the textbook is not necessary but can help.",
    "Take this class if you want to see if you're interested in economics at all. Udry puts a really cool developmental perspective on economics. Definitely find a study group early on to work on problem sets with, and show up to class!! Even though the lectures can sometimes be boring, it's so easy to fall behind if you stop showing up (trust me).",
    "Udry is so great!!! What a charmer.",
    "Only take this if it's a requirement for your preferred major or if you really are interested in econ. It's a big lecture class about a topic that I don't find interesting at all, so I was miserable.",
    "I would definitely recommend Economics 115 to students who want to pursue an economics\/math major in college, but it is definitely challenging and requires a lot of work to get good results.",
    "It is a course that expects us to teach ourselves more than what we learn in class.",
    "I would recommend Intro to Micro to another student.",
    "If you are interested in (broadly) exploring economics or if you need a QR credit, it is a great course.",
    "Highly recommended. Even if you're not thinking of majoring in Econ, this class might help change your mind. The lectures are very logical, easy to understand, relevant, and quite enjoyable. Udry is a great man.",
    "Take it! You learn a lot--much of which is quite practical.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. I would describe the class as something that you get out as much as you put into it. All the resources are provided to you, the lectures are really interesting, and the professor and the teaching fellows are wonderful. However, no one is going to force you to go to lecture or section, so you could easily sink if you don't have some self-discipline. But if you go to class and do your problem sets, you will do just fine and really enjoy the course!",
    "Huge lecture with pretty interesting material that everyone should know. Sometimes gets slow and we spend a lot of time reviewing material. And often, kids aren't enthusiastic - it def hurts atmosphere when classmates aren't very excited about the material. But material is worth learning and Udry is solid. Light workload but strict curve (very doable if you work, but not it you don't)",
    "This class is fast paced for students new to economics. Requires a lot of outside of class effort.",
    "I think Econ 115 is a class that anyone who hasn't taken an econ course should take. It really makes you think about the world in a different perspective. Just keep in mind that the curve is really difficult and the subject in nature is very hand-wavy so it may be hard to get that A even if you really know the material.",
    "It's a very introductory econ course that should not be considered easy by any stretch. You need to work hard even with some previous experience.",
    "If you're interested or think you might be interested in economics, this is the perfect introductory course. Classes move ata reasonable pace, and the problem sets are challenging enough to be engaging without being too difficult. The only weakness is that sections can be pretty hit-or-miss, so if your TA isn't a good match, it's worth going to another section.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Go to the sections or read the textbook. Lectures are helpful mostly for telling what content is being covered, but not for too much else.",
    "A fine intro to Microeconomics. Does not really need to be taken before intro Macro (if taken after, it will probably feel really slow and dumbed down with the slow teaching of models). Fair tests, fair professor, and the TAs know what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about. If you're interested in how individuals and companies make decisions, it's a great place to start thinking about contributing factors.",
    "Important concepts are covered and Econ 115 is a solid course to take if you're interested in an economics major. I recommend it to anyone interested in how markets work arbitrarily.",
    "Basically just a general overview of economics in a semester long course. You learn how a producer and a consumer thinks and makes decisions. I would recommend the course to another student because it's good knowledge to have for anyone thinking about business or some entrepreneurial type job.",
    "Econ 115 is a solid introduction to microeconomics. If you pay attention and study for the class, you'll definitely gain a strong foundation for future classes in microeconomics, or just generally have a better understanding of the importance of economics in real-world contexts. Weekly problem sets are fair and the TAs are generally pretty good at explaining what you need to know. The readings are a helpful supplement to what is covered in lecture.",
    "Yes. The class is straightforward and clear when it comes to the introductory concepts for economics. It is not unnecessarily difficult.",
    "yes.",
    "An intro class for Micro economics. A class that helps you get a good understanding of the basics, and give a sense of how to approach economics problems.",
    "It's an introduction to microeconomic theory. It is a big lecture and a lot of the learning is individual. I would definitely recommend the class because I discovered that I actually love economics.",
    "Good class overall. You learn a bunch of basic microeconomic concepts through the utilization of basic 9th grade algebra.",
    "overall a crowded but informative class that I would recommend taking. sometimes very challenging but if you pay attention in class and take notes it is certainly manageable and you learn a lot.",
    "I recommend this course to everyone who wants a base knowledge of econ. You will probably learn more in the seminar, but this course will get you a better grade.",
    "This was a great introductory Micro Econ course. Lectures were very interesting and always included good review from the previous lecture to make sure that students had a strong foundation of concepts before moving forward. The sections could be greatly improved however. The TA's were great but often section just felt like a shallow review of what we had learned in lecture. it would have been much more helpful to go over practice problems applying the concepts, especially because we could have done much more problems was a class than would have ever shown up on a pest\/test, just as an intellectual exercise and way to challenge our understanding. But overall a good course! And I would definitely recommend taking it with Udry!",
    "Not fun but necessary.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Econ 115. This class provides a basic insight into microeconomic concepts and how to address real-world issues in terms of these concepts.",
    "For God's sake don't take this class if you don't like Econ. Just don't. WHY would you? Seriously. I took it because of my parents, and also because I thought learning about Econ would help me understand the world better.NOTHING CHANGED. Nothing changes after learning Intro to MicroEcon... It's a whole semester of learning and memorizing and test-taking that will not change you in the least. If you don't like Econ, just take a class you would like..There's really no sense in taking this class, if you know that you don't like Econ.",
    "Easy intro econ course, not math based at all. Very conceptual and slow moving",
    "A class about microeconomics that covers good foundation material but it's up to you how much you want to put time into understanding the material.",
    "If you have taken AP Econ in high school, be prepared to get used to a whole new set of terminologies for the same concepts you have learned.",
    "Intro econ. Not fun or helpful or interesting. Only take if you're seriously considering majoring in econ",
    "A comprehensive introduction to economics with clear teaching. Udry is a great teacher.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is at all interested in Econ. It has absolutely no calculus (which can be annoying if you know calc, but if not, you'll be fine). Udry gives a very decent lecture on most days, the PSets are usually not too terrible, and overall, I had fun.",
    "Engaging lectures, interesting and useful subject material essential to understanding all decision-making. Udry is a dynamic and clear lecturer, responsive to student questions. Overall, the course is well-taught, useful, and interesting!",
    "Very solid, informative intro class. I took it not as a ECON major but just to understand ECON more in general, it definitely helped.",
    "I would reccomend this class to another student. The things that I learned from this class are readily applicable to life and I think having a basic understanding of economics is a skill everyone should have.",
    "I would strongly recommend it as a great intro to Economics. It really shows the base of economics in general.",
    "Since there isn't really an option if you're an econ major, this is a course you must take. It's harder than you think and not as fulfilling. But a good course overall!",
    "Chris is probably the best lecturer you can get for this course. He's a great lecturer, yet his lecture notes may not be enough to prepare for the problem sets.",
    "A really clear overview of microeconomics, specially based on graphs. I would recommend it because it is covering concepts you need to know in the real world.",
    "Great introduction to econ if you want to continue, and important general knowledge if you want to understand current events and follow the news. I took it as background for a future journalism career, and it was a great course. There are a lot of other people who have already taken econ, so if you have literally zero background like I do, be ready to put in a little extra time studying because the curve can be high. That said, I took it Cred\/D and I was always surprised that the curve wasn't as high as expected. So if you put in the time, don't let the high-ish curve deter you.",
    "Summary: Most students did not find it interesting but I did. A lot of repetitive supply and demand ideas, but they can be applicable to every day life.Recommendation: I would recommend this class, as it is one of the core courses that can lead to more interesting economics courses."
