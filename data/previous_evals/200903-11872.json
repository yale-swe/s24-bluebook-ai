   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. The readings are great, and the workload is not too much.",
    "I would defnitely recommmend this course to another student. Classes are always fun and interesting - just make sure you stay on top of the reading to get the most out of the class. The workload itself seems fairly light (one midterm which doesn't really count toward your grade and a final paper of 3000 words) yet the reading can really mount up. After a slightly slower start you read one book a week, so it is a good idea to get ahead. The reading list is amazing - all books are ones you would want to read in your free time!",
    "This class is relatively easy compared to other Yale courses; the workload (besides occasional chunks of reading) is very light and the material is enjoyable. This is a great course to take your first semester if you want to relax and learn something interesting.",
    "The class overall is an overview of how epidemics affected human history and social structure. However, because the class was not focused, nothing really new was learned. Overall then, I would not recommend the class to another student.",
    "I do not recommend taking this course. There was too much reading. If you do decide to take this course, get to know your fellow classmates, so it won't be as boring. (Oh, and you do not have to actually do the reading in order to make a decent grade).",
    "This is an interesting and easy on the workload course that is a good class to take as a freshman. If you like history, biology and disease then you will most likely enjoy the course but at times the class is more like an English class because you spend a lot of time evaluating the books. You become very close as a class through the field trip you take to New York which is really fun.I would recommend this class to another student. The material is interesting and its cool to have a prominent professor in a small class setting freshman year.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Professor Summers is absolutely amazing. Each class was incredible because Professor Summers is not just an expert on this topic but he seems to know pretty much everything, and he would always share his knowledge with us. The texts we read and the topics we discussed were also interesting. I've definitely gained in interest in public health after taking this class.",
    "Take it if you want a fairly easy class with interesting readings. I think it would be best if you were interested in the medical\/public health fields. The class gets boring. Best thing, though, is the field trip to New York. On this trip you get to bond really well with the other students in the class.",
    "If you're a Freshmen and you're vaguely interested in disease or like to read, take this class! This class was completely different than I expected in the beginning. At first, the discussions were quite dull though the books and articles we read, such as the The Immoralist or Smallpox in India, were quite interesting. As time went on, discussions improved and because Summers is a very easy going professor, you won't hear the same intense debates that you'll hear in other classes. On the contrary, our very last class consisted of half of the class making an indestructible disease and the other side (think CDC or WHO) naming it the Fluffly Bunny Rainbow virus and devising ways to combat the epidemic. Our class trip to New York was also a great way to bond and it was only the only class that I knew everyone's name. It was a great way to meet new people from other colleges and more importantly, learn more about disease in the most interesting way (reading). This is a low stress class and the two papers, 1000 and 3000 words are not as difficult as you might expect. Summers gives you the room in the final essay to explore a topic of your own interest and is accessible if you need help. If you can bear through a few boring lectures, and can come on time to classes, you shouldn't have a problem with this class.",
    "Interesting professor but a boring class with not so interesting readings. I would not recommend this class because there are so many other classes out there which are more intellectually engaging.",
    "The material is interesting and you definitely learn a lot, however the discussions are lacking and attending class may seem like a chore at times. But the class itself isn't much work and again, the activities are enjoyable. If you are interested in public health and medicine at all, it's a good class. The intimate nature of the class fosters a very nice community as well, great connection for freshman.",
    "Yes - it's honestly an amazing class to be in as a freshman. He shows a really good movie, takes the class to New York, all expenses paid, and there are only two papers for the course. That being said, there is a lot of reading and it is very easy to get behind. And grading in the course is very vague, but otherwise a great freshman seminar.",
    "This class consists of reading a bunch of novels, having discussions in class, and writing two papers. I would recommend this class if you are interested in the topic and like an interactive class. If you are on the shy side and do not like to talk a lot, this class is not for you. The students become pretty close to each other and you can make genuine friends, especially after spending a day in New York together for a field trip.",
    "Humanities 076 focuses on epidemics and their effect on the population. The class also looks at the government's response to epidemics in the form of public health organizations. The class involves reading accounts of epidemics. Some works are fictional but most are historical accounts of epidemics such as Spanish Flu and HIV\/AIDS. I would recommend this class to another student if they are looking for a relatively easy freshman seminar. The seminar is a nice way to meet other freshman and has a good professor. There is a also a chance that you will get to go to New York City with the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students. It is a perfect balance of the science behind an epidemic as well as the social, political and economic factors. Professor Summers is a great professor who allows plenty of room for his students to expand their thoughts and is eager to listen."
