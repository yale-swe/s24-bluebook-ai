   "comments": [
    "I think I would have got more out of the class had I had a better background knowledge of the subject, so I would recommend it for someone who already knows a decent amount about the topic.",
    "Great class, a little unorganized and open-ended by the professor is fantastic and really cares about his students. I'd definitely recommend if you're interested in the time period \/ region, and it's a good ROW seminar",
    "The course offered more than a survey level introduction to the Islamicate Empires of the Ottomans, Mughals, and Safavids. It provides a comprehensive introduction to the religion, government, economy, social and intellectual dynamic of these Empires. I have come away from the course with a better understanding of these contemporary empires, and a better understanding of the foundation for the modern Middle East.",
    "I would recommend it for someone with a foundational background in the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal empires who wants to discuss these empires and ideology behind \"empire\" more in depth. I have taken other History junior seminars which were easy\/manageable to follow even without having a strong background in the material \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is not that kind of class. The readings are dense, VERY dense.",
    "Take this class if you want an insight into the connections between Islamic polities and want to debunk all preconceptions about the supposed discourses on the rise of the west and the demise of the west."
