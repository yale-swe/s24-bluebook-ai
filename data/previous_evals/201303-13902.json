    "Recommended! Very laidback but enjoyable class that teaches you important lessons.",
    "Definitely take this class, but make sure to do the debate. I did the final project and got stuck with a bunch of lazy people and did all the work. The debate people get it out of the way early. Easy exams. Barely any hw. This is the way to go.",
    "This class is really interesting if you're into studying poverty lines and different welfare programs etc. It isn't very hard so its a good addition to your schedule if you've got some really tough classes already. I would recommend it because the small lecture format means that people can participate without the intensity of a seminar. Also, Professor Jaynes is really cool and lively.",
    "yeah take it",
    "Relatively easy class, no section",
    "Poverty is a fairly interesting, not terribly quantitative Econ class. It's in the AFAM department but doesn't really touch substantially on African-American poverty. There was a midterm, a short quiz a few weeks after, and a group project instead of a final exam.I would definitely recommend this class if you're interested in the subject matter and are willing to do the readings and go to class. But if you take this as \"an easy 5th class\", especially if you don't have quantitative skills (like me), this won't be a gut. The lectures for me were pretty dry and boring but I'm an art history major so I feel that way about most econ classes I've taken.Basically, take the class if you will do so seriously. If not, don't bother and take something you actually are interested in.",
    "Easy",
    "Economics 280 gives you a great overview about a simple topic like poverty by introducing various nuances to the subject. Sometimes, the pace of the close is extremely slow, making it hard to stay engaged. The course material is an application of what you learn in intro micro and econometrics to the subject of poverty. However, it is a course I got a lot out of by opening my eyes to various flaws in dealing with poverty, and the workload is extremely manageable. I would recommend taking it if you want a relatively low key economics credit as a 5th or 6th class.",
    "The course is a bunch of lectures which are posted online, and there are five grades (2 exams, 2 easy homework assignments, and 1 final paper or debate). The lectures are easy to understand, but the grading for the exams is unclear\/inconsistent (which was disappointing). I would definitely suggest taking this if interested in the course material. Also, do the debate. It's a fun experience and less work (presumably) than the paper.",
    "Chill Econ credit.",
    "Chill class, very little work. Professor Jaynes is really cool",
    "Yes. Take it if you're an Econ major.",
    "This was an interesting and very useful course. It did a great job integrating policy analysis, socio-economic issues, and quantitative economic concepts and utilization of models. Whether you are interested in economics, politics, or social issues, I would recommend this course!",
    "Strengths: A great introduction to poverty, inequality, and welfare policy through economic and some political lenses. Professor Jaynes is an engaging and helpful instructor. If these issues matter to you, I would highly recommend this class.Weaknesses: It's easy to think you can miss a couple classes. Be aware that near the end of the term, your attendance will matter because there will be several small group projects to listen to.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone looking for a good econ seminar that has a manageable workload.",
    "Econ class on poverty that is heavy on analytics and less on history.Recommended!",
    "I do not recommend Econ280. Very little is learned from the lectures or the problem sets. While it may be thought of as an easy econ credit, the grading is so arbitrary that you have only a vague idea of what your grade might be.",
    "A low-stress econ class. You learn a good amount about how poverty is measured. Only two assignments, two midterms, and a group paper or debate. It therefore helps to have people you can trust in the class with you. Although some lectures can get dry, Jaynes is a good professor who keeps things interesting. I found taking this class to be a great experience.",
    "Pretty chilled. Gaynes is kinda strange. Very average class, but gets me an econ credit.",
    "Definitely a must take as a 5th class or a credit D if you need a easy credit. Light workload, learn a good deal about poverty and not hard. Best part is that it is an Econ credit.",
    "The class is a mystery. You can try hard and get a poor grade because the TFs are looking for very specific answers in problem sets and on the midterms. If you floor them with terms then you'll be fine but if you elaborate (correctly) on a question but don't happen to mention a specific term you can be punished unnecessarily, which is rather disappointing.Somewhat interesting material, but Prof. Jaynes is not a great lecturer. Classes go by slowly but you'll walk away with exposure to a new academic focus.",
    "I took this class thinking that it would be an easy credit. Certainly wasn't hard, but the final paper requires much more work than you imagine it would.",
    "Take it! Great class and little work."
