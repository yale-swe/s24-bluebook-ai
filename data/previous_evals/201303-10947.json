    "English 115 02 is a fantastic class. I definitely recommend it to any student who enjoys reading and wants to improve their writing skills in a comfortable environment with fun material. The reading can be time-consuming, but it is worth it. I feel that my analytical skills are exponentially better and I have gained a whole new outlook on the fairy tales I grew up with.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It never disappointed me. Each class was fun and engaging, and I had a great experience. The workload was fair, although you do have to be prepared to read A LOT. I think anyone who loves literature would benefit from this course.",
    "I LOVED fairytales with Megan! It's a significant amount of reading outside of class, but if you keep up with all the work you will have a lot more ideas to incorporate into your writing. I definitely came out of the class feeling like my writing was on a completely different level than when I came in - in the best way possible! Megan is amazing and will provide you with so much feedback, and she helps you talk through your ideas so that you can clarify your writing and explain your thought process in your papers. Class discussions were always super interesting, and if you take notes you'll have a multitude of ideas for your papers. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "I feel that all Yalies should take an English 115 course at some point. As for this particular section, I would highly recommend it; learning about fairytales is a lot more important than people would think. It helps broaden your perspective and see the cultural impacts of something that reaches almost every single person. More guys should take this class!!",
    "Take Fairy Tales! Take Fairy Tales! Take Fairy Tales! This class is so wonderful and Megan is wonderful and my writing improved so much. It is a large time commitment and the readings can occasionally be overwhelming, but the topic material is very interesting and I think comes to the heart of our values as a society. Great class for a freshman to take! Also, you make friends with a lot of the people in the class since it is so small. And there are film screenings! With food!",
    "Yes, take it!!! An excellent class to develop your analysis and writing skills, with a very interesting topic of study.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, if Megan Eckerle is teaching it again. The texts we read were engaging and fascinating, Megan was good at facilitating really productive class discussion -- I always felt as if I'd learned something from our conversations. This class also improved my writing significantly, and the peer workshops we held were very helpful in receiving feedback. We only had four papers, and the amount of reading for each class wasn't too overwhelming. Definitely take it!",
    "Fairy Tales is a fantastic seminar, especially for those fond of the supernatural and beautiful prose (Angela Carter, Charlotte Bront\u00c3\u00ab, John Keats!). Readings and essays were always a pleasure. Discussions were also quite enjoyable, as Megan is an excellent instructor, insightfully guiding the dialogue while ensuring a welcome environment for student participation. Megan provides excellent feedback on essays, and is always available should students need to discuss ideas or seek advice on English classes! Overall, a delightful and unique course!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who thinks they can handle the overlap of papers and midterms. As with many writing courses at Yale, four papers can be tricky to juggle when tests are around the corner. Start early and get a rough draft as soon as you can. For slower readers, like me, get comfortable with skimming larger novels.",
    "This is an amazing class. You don't have to like fairy tales to take it; I just took it to make myself a better writer and got so much more than I bargained for.",
    "Definitely take this class. Your writing will become so much better and you'll have a lot of fun too. The readings are great; they do not feel like work at all. I loved the class discussions and even the papers were a lot of fun to write. Megan's the best, nicest professor (and maybe person) I've ever met. Am going to miss this class.",
    "This is a great introductory english! There is a lot of reading, but that's to be expected. I would take it! Good writing credit.",
    "Take this class! All the materials were interesting and Megan is so nice and a great instructor. Sometimes the amount of reading we had was pretty heavy but since it was so interesting, it wasn't too hard to get through. My writing definitely improved as well."
