    "Absolutely wonderful course. This was exactly what I was looking for: a thoughtful examination and analysis of Austen and Bronte (two of the foundational authors of their time) and several other women writers whose works were a response to the oeuvres of the former two. We read a novel every one or two weeks, and had two 10-page papers, so the workload was far from overwhelming. If you don't enjoy works of this genre, I don't guarantee that you'll love the class, but I think the course is great both as an introduction to the 19th century novel and as a more in-depth examination of the genre if you're already familiar with it. Aside from that, what made this class so fantastic was Professor Trumpener. She is one of the most understanding and supportive professors I have ever encountered. Our class discussions were organic and we really got to contribute our thoughts, but she also made sure that we covered the points she considered important. She helped me discover my own ideas about these texts that I didn't know I had, and when I was having trouble with a really overwhelming time in the semester, she worked with me on adjusting deadlines and helped me stay sane. I cannot recommend her (and this class) highly enough.",
    "Would 100% recommend though it might be hard for non-senior English majors to get in if it's still a senior seminar and the discussions occur at a fairly high level so it might be hard for non-majors.",
    "Austen and the Bronte sisters are incredible novelists. I came into the course with doubts about the nature of such novels--the assumptions that they were \"lightweight\" or \"fluffy\". This could not be further from the truth, and I encourage you to take this course to learn why. The readings are dense but enjoyable, and professor Trumpener does an incredible job of facilitating discussion while adding formidable wisdom of her own. If you have the opportunity, please take this. It has been one of my favorite seminars at Yale and a great capstone to my experience within the English major",
    "Fantastic senior seminar! Prof Trumpener is brilliant and insightful, and excellent at guiding discussion. It's a lot of reading, but the books are enjoyable! Take it!",
    "This was an excellent class, I can't say enough how much I enjoyed it. The reading list is incredible, and even if you have already read some (or most) of the books in other classes, you will still learn so much. Professor Trumpener is a uniquely gifted professor, and very brilliant. This was the perfect senior seminar for an Austen-loving English major.",
    "FABULOUS course!!! Very manageable writing, amazing syllabus, and a kind, caring, and quirky professor. This class felt like an indulgence in the best way. I read wonderful books, talked about them with smart people, and wrote a couple of mid-size papers. A truly remarkable class, as shopping period demand would suggest!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student. The books we read were really fascinating and provided a lot of material for deep discussion, even if they were books we had all read before (like Pride and Prejudice). Professor Trumpener is an excellent seminar leader who guides the discussions without pushing it any particular direction; she is very willing to let the conversation run its course while students still find the topic interesting. The courseload is also very reasonable. Overall, this was an excellent class that helped me appreciate the place of women's novels in the English literary canon.",
    "Terrific reading list. The class discussion was often stilted and unfocused -- this isn't as rigorous of a class as it could be. Still, the novels are fantastic and Professor Trumpener is incredibly kind and understanding as a professor.",
    "This course was a survey of Austen, Bronte, and their later influence on women's novels. It allowed for some breadth beyond textual discussions (e.g. film viewings) but did not depend on them. Although two papers are required for the class, the class is primarily a discussion course: it centered on intense, analytical conversations among students from a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and opinions.",
    "Take this course if it is offered again. Professor Trumpener is a wonderful, wonderful teacher: very very erudite but also very kind and affirming. You'll learn quite a lot in this class, but the reading schedule and workload are both eminently manageable. It is good to know beforehand that, although the syllabus is quite heavily weighted towards Jane Austen, you will be appreciating her for her sharp wit and acid-tongued social commentary, not fawning over her descriptions of dresses and balls and square-jawed squires. You will come to appreciate Austen greatly, but this class is not at all book-club-y, or any sort of Jane Austen Adoration Society. The same goes, of course, for Bronte. If you like Bronte's psychological introspection and porto-feminism, this is the class for you. If you like Bronte because you think Rochester (or Heathcliff!) is dashing, then I'm sure there are other options for you besides this course.",
    "A fantastic course that will cover the feminist literature trajectory from Austen and (Charlotte) Bronte through more recent novels such as \"Rebecca.\""
