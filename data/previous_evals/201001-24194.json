    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in filmmaking and\/or screenwriting. It's a huge time investment. Be prepared for technical problems and working things out last-minute. Failure is not an option under Sandra's tutelage.",
    "I would definitely recommend art 142 to another student. It is a great way to learn about film, yourself, and how to look at the world in a different way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the Film Production Track.",
    "If you want to make some movies, hang out with people who love making movies, and have a great break in your week- take it. But not for the feint of heart.",
    "You make video projects. You think you'll work extra hard on them, but you end up filming the day before its due because you're busy and everyone else does the same. Take it with good people in your class or you won't be motivated. And if you just want to learn Final Cut, do it yourself--this class is trial by fire, so you don't get beyond the basics.",
    "A life-changing class. You'll either hate it or love it, and you'll probably feel both of those sentiments at certain points in the class. Sandra is completely honest, and if you show up with a sh*tty movie, she will call you out and tear it apart. She's a very interesting person, however, and if you think you can take it, you should sign up. The way you look at the world will change. So will the way you watch movies. Just be aware you'll be spending all of your Sundays in the DMCA, cursing at the monitors and resisting throwing the dinky cameras they give you out the window. Actually, I'd recommend renting the HD cameras from the little equipment booth because they are so much easier to use, they put their info on the comp 100x faster, and the quality of the picture is a lot better. Boom mics are good too.",
