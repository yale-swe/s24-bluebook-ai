    "I thought that individual teaching moments that included showing techniques were useful. I liked the informal, conversational format of the class very much.",
    "Learning the different techniques for surfaces - wood, brick, and pattern, was very interesting. I also gained good information about color, paint mixing, and preparing surfaces.",
    "The exercises and discussions were both valuable. I appreciated the focus on managing the painting process\/crew as well as the technical skills needed to effectively reproduce various design elements.",
    "Painting in class while having Ru there was extremely helpful. Doing the various projects focused on different techniques that are commonly used.",
    "The open dialogue and discussion about what we were preparing to do was great. It was good to hear about how to do the technique and why we would do a certain technique before practicing it.",
    "The projects we did this semester were great. I have already put some of the techniques we learned to use. I just wish we had more time to work in class so that as we are painting there could be more 1 on 1 demonstrations and suggestions for Ru and other students in the class.",
    "The loose structure of this class allowed me to explore the tricks and techniques of scenic painting on my own, while Ru was always there to answers I had. The semester of both smaller and big projects skimmed the surface of the most sought after paint treatments, which was very valuable for both students very interested in scenic painting and students looking to gain a few skills to increase their spectrum of knowledge in all aspects of technical theatre."

   "comments": [
    "I think the class was too big in terms of the number of students allowed. I think it should be limited to no more than 8-10 people. I felt that the amount of personal guidance and education I received was less than ideal due to this large class size. Also, the class should go back to one 3 hour block, rather than one 2 hour block. It is difficult to find time outside of class to work on the projects, so more in class time would be better.",
    "I sort of wish we had done additional surfaces (stone?) instead of the last project.",
    "I would have appreciated the full length class as opposed to having class for 2 hours and needing to find another time during the week to come on and make up the extra time.",
    "I would like to have more time in class to paint because when I would come in out of class, Ru was not there to give suggestions. We spent a lot of time talking at the beginning of each class that I felt was not fully necessary.",
    "I wish there was more in class time for practice. I found that trying to find time outside of class was challenging with all the other engagements I had. I would love to see this class be twice a week for 1.5hrs.",
    "More time to work in class"
