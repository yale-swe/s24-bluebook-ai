    "Although the specifics of this class largely depend on your teacher, the bottom line is that this class is a free credit (and usually a GPA boost) that really shouldn't be a full credit. There really isn't a catch, so steal as many of these credits as you can. It'll be a BIG waste of everyone's time if you don't put any effort in though.",
    "Voice lessons for credit. You fill in the rest.",
    "Voice lessons are one of the best decisions I've made while at Yale. Scott is so knowledgeable and supportive. He knows exactly how to convey what he wants you to do, and my improvement has been astounding because of him. Every week I look forward to taking these lessons.",
    "I would highly recommend this as a course credit.",
    "Take voice lessons if you want to improve your singing. It only works if you treat it as an academic class and give it the appropriate time."
