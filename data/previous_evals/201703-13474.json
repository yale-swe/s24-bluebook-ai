   "comments": [
    "This course is excellent. It brings together numerous (and very different( ways to look at infectious diseases and does it in a very holistic and thorough way. To my knowledge, this is the only course of its kind that does this.",
    "The issue with this course is that it is a survey of challenging modeling topics that cumulatively do not get the attention they each deserve. An improvement would be to focus on just three of the methods presented so that students could become confident in a smaller number of techniques, rather than have a shaky understanding of 8 different ID epi models.",
    "Excellent course for learning new methods being developed in mathematical modeling of infectious diseases.",
    "I think that the class teaches a lot of interesting concepts and builds real quantitative competencies. I do think it would be useful to be more explicit in how the concepts relate to each other\/contextualize each class throughout the course.",
    "This course is very difficult but rewarding and offers many insights into technical quantitative methods used in epidemiology.",
    "The course is great for learning advanced topics in infectious disease epi. The course is challenging, but I feel that I have learned more applicable skills in this course than in any other course I have taken at YSPH.",
    "excellent course in studing the method of modeling work in solving infectious disease problems",
    "This course is pretty difficult. The concepts went way over my head at times. The pace could be slowed and one or two topics eliminated so that students can fully grasp whats being taught",
    "Strengths: Learned very interesting and very cool methods to analyze infectious disease data, learned more about coding in R, enhanced my understanding of infectious disease behavior, took away tangible skills I hope to apply to my future career, instruction was clear, assignments were reflective of course content, exam was difficult but fair, helpful feedback on assignments Weaknesses: Perhaps this is in the control of the registrar, but having two hour lectures plus a two hour lab made it difficult to concentrate for the entire lecture and lab. The professor attempted to help by giving us a couple minutes break at the hour mark. Sometimes it felt like there was too much content in one sitting.",
    "The professor and TF were extremely helpful, but this is a difficult course.",
    "Very useful and informative course.",
    "I like how this class allowed us to utilize the knowledge we'd had from Ted's class and to practically build an infectious disease model based on different kinds of approach. I also really like every week's lab session. I hope there could be one lecture (probably the first?) reviewing basic concepts for infectious disease model (probably from Ted's class?) I hope during the lab session, we may have about 15 minutes to review the concepts during the lecture.",
    "Strengths: This course is a great introduction to cutting edge methods in infectious disease modeling and quantitative methods. It is well taught. The lab sections were informative and fun. Weaknesses: Material introduced can be overwhelming or difficult to understand. I would recommend anyone taking this course to be a regular at office hours.",
    "Very good course! Teach us cutting-edge knowledge on quantitative methods in infectious disease. I am amazed by what I learned from this class. This course is very helpful for study design.",
    "I enjoyed this class far more than I had expected. The workload is reasonable. I appreciated working in small groups for the problem sets!"

    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny is nice, and handles conveying the material well.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Very good at explaining the material and designing the course",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0I think Ginny is a really intelligent person and approachable to those who ask. I do think it could be useful to have instructor office hours in addition to just TF office hours, since Ginny teaches in MATLAB and the TF teaches in R (and therefore can't always answer MATLAB-specific questions).",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny was a very good teacher and managed to get through lots of material over the course of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Dr. Pitzer is great and receptive to questions during class\/outside of class. Class can be a little overwhelming sometimes but she does a good job of making sure everyone understands the material before moving on.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0excellent!",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Good feedback and very helpful in office hours",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Wonderful. Knowledgeable. Engaging.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Dr. Pitzer is an excellent instructor. She was very receptive to questions and did a great job explaining quite difficult concepts. Her powerpoints are very clear and provided great information for us to look back on. She's also funny! I love that she incorporated recent research and real world examples.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0She was very kind and helpful. I truly enjoyed her lecture.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Very attentive to students' needs\/ concerns about the course.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny is very helpful in making sure we understand the complicated concepts introduced during the lecture.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Ginny is a great lecturer. She is clear and knows what she is talking about, she has effective powerpoint slides, she even throws in jokes and cultural references for us, which is awesome. I appreciated it when she would slow things down and explain things thoroughly. I think it can be intimidating (personally) to speak up and ask questions in class, so group work or time to discuss the material in small groups would be an interesting activity to try.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0Professor Pitzer is a great instructor. She explains everything clearly. When the concepts are complicated and difficult, she will explain them step by step and make sure that everybody get it. She is very patient on answering student's questions, and she always encourages us.",
    "Instructor: Virginia Pitzer \u00a0You can tell that Ginny is trying to be as accessible as possible. Any questions are welcomed. A friendly instructor!"

    "I would recommend this course to everyone. I know I will use things from this course for everything I work on for the rest of my career. It was really helpful!",
    "The course teaches a lot of interesting concepts pertaining to infectious diseases (estimating transmission, time series data, vaccine effects, etc.). It is difficult and quant-heavy, but problem sets are done in groups. The final ties everything together, and it is manageable by yourself. I would recommend the class to all EMD people. If possible, take Ted Cohen's transmission dynamics class first, but I know that people who are first years now won't be able to.",

    "It is a very difficult course, but you will learn a lot.",
    "A highly recommended course that will not disappoint you.",
    "This is an excellent course if you are interested in infectious disease model building, and it will allow you to learn practical skills. In addition, this course also allow you t",
    "I would recommend this course. Even though I am in no way versatile in the methodologies presented in this class, I think it's good to have an introduction to these methods as an infectious disease epidemiologist and to know about the unique challenges in studying IDs. I learned a lot in this course and I thought it was worth my time. It is challenging, but ultimately a good experience.",
    "Strongly recommend it to everybody!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. While the problem sets can be challenging, they are well worth it."
