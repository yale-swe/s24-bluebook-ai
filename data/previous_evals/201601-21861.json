    "241L had a very large facelift this year, as Josh Johnson took it over from Mary Klein. While I can't directly compare the two labs having only taken Dr. Johnson's, I can say that the lab remains a great choice for any MCDB major or pre-med to fulfill their requirements. The course has a lot of interesting experiments, which usually are multi-week projects with interesting and useful results. As this was the first year that the lab was taught, there is a pretty large chance that the list of experiments will change, but I did enjoy Dr. Johnson's picks and thought I learned a lot from them. The course is structured as a once-weekly lab with very little necessary background preparation. Projects are usually accompanied by a couple primary lit papers for students to read, and bi-weekly quizzes are given on the material. There are also 2 non-cumulative exams (one at midterm and one in the last week of class) that have content questions from the course as well as practical data-analysis components. They aren't particularly difficult, though the exams do tend to last the entire 4 hour lab period, so be prepared. Weekly lab reports are not present in the traditional sense, but the course utilizes a very cool sort of research tool called a jupyter notebook (aka iPython notebook) to organize data from each lab. Jupyter notebooks are online platforms that split the sections of a lab report into \"cells\" containing either markdown (for presenting text) or python\/R code (for doing data analysis). The entire project, code and all, is audited by the TAs and used for your lab report grade. Coding experience isn't required, and you spend a lot of your time just googling things you need to do. Through this, I was actually able to teach myself a good bit of R, which I had never used before. This may sound odd or like a lot of work, but I cannot stress enough how great of a change this is from other types of lab reports. The skills you build with the jupyter notebooks are real and can be transferred to your own research- for instance, I presented a poster at an international science conference, and I was able to use a jupyter notebook to organize my sections and conduct my statistical analysis. If you're looking to get any sort of experience in useful research methods, take this course.",
    "A lot of work but if you like computer coding then do it",
    "I don't think I would recommend MCDB 241L to another student if they were looking to get a lot of hands-on biology lab experience. I feel like the work we did in lab (discussing papers, coding, learning from powerpoints) could be done in a lecture\/section class. Lab time should be dedicated to actively doing things in lab. The one thing we did that was pretty cool was the RT-PCR experiment, and I wish we could have done more experiments like that.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course as I did not learn much.",
    "MCDB 241L is an unorthodox lab class, but it's a good one. It's sort of like working in a research lab on a group project, but only once per week. As a class, you design your experiments, collect all of your own data, and decide (within some bounds) how best to analyze it. The exams are not just rote memorization and felt like really fair tests of knowledge and skills taught in class. Do NOT take this lab if you don't like working with others, or if you just want to read a protocol and follow step-by-step instructions (like Orgo Lab or something). If you do take this lab, do yourselves a favor and walk through each lab together as a class before you start. You can save yourselves time by working as a class and dividing up tasks, rather than having each pair or group do everything individually.",
    "Take MCDB 241L if you need a stand-alone bio lab (just ask the professor before the class starts) and you want to learn programming alongside your biology. The R (or Python if you want) skills I learned will probably be very useful in the future, but just be wary that the class itself may not teach it to you very well. Instead, you'll have to rely on your own motivation and problem-solving skills, which can be frustrating. Still, Dr. Johnson and the TAs are nice and try to be helpful, if sometimes frustrating in their lack of clear expectations.",
    "This is unlike other biology labs. Be prepared to gain a basic understanding of coding in R or Python, but that was probably the best part of the lab. It's a good lab that was less hands on than anticipated but overall very good.",
    "Enjoyable class, would take for a pre-med lab. Overall, there wasn't too much work, but expect to stay for the entire time slot. Most of the work is self-contained within the lab, which is nice. You get to learn how to code, which is a plus, but you also don't get to do as much hands-on stuff as you would think. To be fair, the lab is in its first year because the professors switched, but Dr. Johnson and the TAs really care about the class. Overall, would recommend!",
    "try to take an easier lab for your requirements. This was too much work for .5 credits."
