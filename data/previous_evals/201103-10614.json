    "Would not recommend it! For reasons above.",
    "Economics 546 is a pretty good graduate-level Macroeconomics course. I would recommend the course to anyone who has an interest in a basic as well as an semi-advanced understanding of macroeconomics.",
    "This class might be interesting for those who have hard time reading academic literature on their own.However, I would not recommend this course to another student since I could learn very little from this lecturer.Asking friends to obtain the power point slides and not taking this class is something that I would do, if I were thinking to enroll in this class.",
    "Yes, learnt a lot. not very difficult, but very different from undrgraduate level of macroeconomics.",
    "It depends on the background, I don't think it would be a good first approach to macroeconomics, but it could be interesting for students with already some background in it.",
    "Good to see new models.",
    "I would not recommend this course, as I felt overall the lecturing was not very good.",
    "I would say it is a course that covers high-level material and is perfect for Master students.",
    "very useful course.",
    "I would recommend it.It is a great introduction to prevailing Macroeconomic models in money supply, labor, finance, etc. You will work hard as there is a problem set due every week",
    "We did learn a lot cutting-edged macro economic theories.",
    "Yes. it's an essential class for basic economics."

    "I understood one way of thinking in Macroeconomics based on Microeconomics. This helps me deepning my understanding both in Microeconomics and Macroeconomics.",
    "Exposed to some new stuff.",
    "It covered models such as Solow and Growth Accounting that are necessary for studnets in my area. Also, she covered models such as DMP and Time Consistency of Policy that are contemporary and interesting.",
    "Yes it did.",
    "It did not really contribute to anything that I might do.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge well."
