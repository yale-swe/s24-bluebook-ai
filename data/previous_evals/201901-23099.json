    "The syllabus of the course is incredibly rich. I would spend more time on literature than ballet personally, investigating the history of the theater from 1900-1930 a bit more closely.",
    "The course strength is its interdisciplinary approach that covers many art form often neglected in other courses. The course weakness was its vast time scope, which made it difficult to equally engage with all the materials."
