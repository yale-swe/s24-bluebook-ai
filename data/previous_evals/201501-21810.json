    "A intermediate Chinese class with a heavy workload. It depends on if the class is the right level for the student, which varies a lot so it probably depends on the placement test.",
    "Highly recommend. It's a fun class, and you will learn a lot. It's incredibly well structured.",
    "CHNS 140 is a course geared towards having students learn a number of new grammar structures and vocabulary words while also becoming more familiar with Chinese culture along with a variety of potential scenarios one could encounter when studying abroad in China. I would absolutely recommend this course in that it definitely helps one take the next step in becoming more comfortable with using the Chinese language."
