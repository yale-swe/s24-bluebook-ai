   "comments": [
    "An account of major works on colonialism and postcolonialism, with readings from both literature and the canonical theorists of postcolonial studies, Said, Spivak, and Bhabha. Excellent mix of literature class and intellectual history.",
    "A survey of non-western writings and difficult theory.",
    "Very important material. Everyone at Yale should at least encounter some of those readings. Professor Miller is incredibly knowledgeable and supportive. He is able to balance between leading the class discussions and encouraging everyone to speak. The class is very organized.",
    "It is a lot of reading and professor Miller expects you to do all of them, which can sometimes be difficult to do. On the other hand, I personally found most (if not all) of the readings were super interesting and fun to read. I recommend this class if you're interested in reading postcolonial literature. Some of the readings can be tough though, especially Bhabha and Spivak.",
    "Definitely take it. The theory is challenging but Prof. Miller makes it a little bit easier to understand. The novels are fantastic! Prof. Miller is a great teacher and person. If you like reading and not",
    "You don't even really have to do the reading if you don't want to. Still, if you're interested in the syllabus and are willing to ask yourself questions independently, you could get a lot out of it. I definitely learned some things; I just feel like I could learn more.",
    "This is a good overview class of some of the basics of Postcolonial Theory. I think everyone should have a background in this area, whether from this class or not. Miller is an interesting guy who cares for his students, though does not often let them talk in class. The project is chill and pretty fun to do as you can relate the theorists we are talking about to your own interests. The readings are interesting but sometimes a lot. Overall definitely take a postcolonial theory or lit class and this one is not bad. Also Miller is really open to feedback so there is a good chance the class has really improved."
