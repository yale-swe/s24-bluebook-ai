    "English 126 is designed to make you into an English major. In some ways that's good--you'll definitely know how to analyze a text by the time you're done--but it's also frustrating, since you're reading, like the course says, Major English Poets, yet often spend more time talking about analysis and writing techniques than you will about the actual poems.",
    "I might, but only if they had background with the Iliad and the Odyssey.",
    "The readings in the second semester of Poets are actually very interesting and tie together nicely, but only take this course if you know you'll be able to stay on top of your reading because falling behind makes this class very unenjoyable. Professor Reed took a few weeks to settle in, but was an excellent professor and handled our somewhat difficult section very well. He is a very methodical grader\u0097which can be both comforting and frustrating\u0097but all in all he led discussion very well. Also, Reed has you read Walcott for the last poet, which was fascinating and summed up the course well."
