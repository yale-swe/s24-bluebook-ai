   "comments": [
    "I learned the basics of music theory (intervals, chords, triads, harmony, keys, scales, etc.) I also learned how to compose simple songs and how to analyze music.",
    "I developed a vocabulary and method of thinking to relate to the music I hear and sing almost every day. Both my ear and piano skills improved, my ability to read both clefs, and my ability to describe the music I hear.",
    "I learned a lot about the foundations for music. I knew a lot coming in but I really enjoyed learning about chord progressions, and why certain things sound certain ways to me.",
    "Learned about the fundamentals of music, from notes to rhythms. Mostly focused on notes and pitches. We learned about the circle of fifths, intervals, triads, seventh chords, and functional harmony. In terms of aural skills, we did lots of ear training for recognizing intervals, major and minor scales, triad quality, and cadences. I also learned how to sing and at the end, we did some special units about film music, pop music, and protest music. Also lots of analysis which was awesome",
    "I gained a better understanding of the theoretical aspects of music and learned to identify different patterns\/styles of music.",
    "I came into this course with very little music theory background and completed it feeling extremely accomplished. There's a huge learning curve and Laura facilitates that really well."

   "comments": [
    "This course was arranged very well. Most weeks built on knowledge from previous weeks, so it was not hard to review at the end. The small size of the class also made it easy to ask questions and to discuss. The workload was reasonable, and the material was interesting. I think that maybe a little more time could have been dedicated to tougher subjects or to train students' ears more (learning to identify modes, chord qualities, intervals, etc. was one of the most difficult parts for me).",
    "The strength of this course are in the applications of the theory. Listening to songs once you've learned the musical mechanisms a work is a wholly enriching experience. The weaknesses of the course are in the more abstract moments, when you aren't sure how what your learning applies to the music you encounter.",
    "Strength: Very comprehensive and good pace Weakness: Assignments took me a very long time Improvement: N\/A",
    "I think this is a good overview course, and it was accessible for musicians of all levels with little theory background. I can see how this course could not be as rewarding with a bad professor, but Professor Brown made the syllabus very engaging and took our interests `into account.",
    "It was a very hands on course which made for better learning. However, the homework assignments did not always cover things that were discussed in class.",
    "I definitely almost psyched myself out in the beginning of the course. Music seemed like a new language, and I wasn't sure I'd be able to handle it. But I think the biggest strength of this course is its organization and the progress students made because of that. I'd say one weakness is that there are a couple composition assignments toward the end of the semester, and it sort of feels like you're just thrown into those. That being said, Laura is a very fair grader and I realized I had a lot more tools than I thought when I first read the assignment prompt."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. If you've ever wanted to know how music is made and how it works, this is a great class to get you started.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! For anyone with an appreciation for music, it will be enlightening. It would be difficult coming in with no prior musical ability though, so I might only recommend it to musicians.",
    "Yes, I learned a great deal, I just wouldn't want to do the monotonous assignments again.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested at all in music, and definitely try to take it with Professor Brown. She's fantastic and very encouraging. She doesn't make you feel intimidated at all. There can be a lot of people in your class who've taken music before, but by the time you get to the midterm, you'll be on an even footing with them. Additionally, you learn a lot about theory and how that applies to classical music, but also how it has been challenged.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of music fundamentals.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Absolutely -- even for non music majors! Although I probably won't major in music, I found this course not only enjoyable but also really helpful in helping me understand the building blocks of music. Especially being in an a cappella group, I think this course is fantastic. And Laura is very knowledgeable and encouraging."
