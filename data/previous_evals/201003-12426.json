    "Good class. covers too much in too little time though",
    "I would definitely recommend it, but I'd say the problem sets will make it one of your more intellectually demanding courses. Just because this is the\"easier\" alternative to MATH 244 does NOT make it easy! Plan to spend significant time on those psets. And enjoy.",
    "This is the worst course I have ever taken. To sum the course up, it\u0092s a bunch of loosely connected topics, all poorly taught, with frustrating problem sets that use information not covered in lecture that you need to find either on Wikipedia or buried somewhere in the professor\u0092s homemade wiki. The lectures consist of James Aspnes doing incomprehensible proofs that he doesn\u0092t bother trying to explain to people who aren\u0092t math majors, and not only are the lectures incomprehensible but they are very superficial as well, since the course covers so many different topics. For example, if you, like I, have taken a course in linear algebra, it is amazing both how little he covers and how poorly he covers it (I wouldn\u0092t have had a clue what was going on if I hadn\u0092t already taken a linear algebra course). Furthermore, the professor never bothered giving any indication how anything was related to computer science until the final lecture when he talked about encryption. The course is all proofs, so while Math 244 is probably no more accessible to a non-math major, you might want to check it out anyway since 202 is so poorly taught. Not everything about the class was bad, though: Prof. Aspnes is hilarious, which slightly distracts from his inability to convey information to undergraduates, the midterm was fair (I haven\u0092t taken the final yet though), and occasionally some of the homework problems were fun puzzles to solve. But basically, I feel like I have learned nothing this entire semester and the class was a complete waste of time, which is a shame since it\u0092s required for the CS major. Oh, and one of the TA\u0092s just quit halfway through the semester.",
    "Scattered topics, really tricky problem sets, only take it if it is a requirement.",
    "This class not easy. I felt like I was barely keeping a grip on the basic course material all semester. This is because the professor expects you to understand everything he says and writes without explaining it, probably because he knows it so well himself. Therefore, it is stressful. That said, you can do well on the problem sets by going to the peer tutor for help, or the TA's, or just by working together (obviously combined with thinking about it yourself). You really don't spend too many hours on this class. The exams are also hard, but manageable. (Some people will tell you they're easy, though.)",
    "Discreet mathematics is just not fun. Don't take it unless you need it for a requirement or really think you'll need it. That being said, I found Professor Aspnes to be a good lecturer. He was entertaining and got his points across. Furthermore, his online notes are EXTREMELY helpful. They are a great resource. The TAs are also great, and everyone is nice in open hours.The problem sets don't take a lot of time, they are just annoying because they are impossible to do without a TAs help. While you understand the material better at the end of them, I literally think no one could do it without going to open hours, which is frustrating.",
    "The class covers useful topics, but is sometimes very hard to follow. Aspnes is amusing, but has trouble staying on task. Go to the zoo for extra help on problem sets- it really pays off!",
    "Only take this class if you absolutely have to. it's pretty damn hard. i'm an app math major - i thought i was good at math, till i took this class. it's just a completely different way to think. maybe i'll appreciate the way it made me think\/more analytical at some point.Problem sets are really really hard.. short but hard.",
    "Take only if you are a compsci major or HIGHLY interested in abstract mathematics. This is not an easy course.",
    "Take it if you're a CS major, but be prepared for the material to go by fairly quickly",
    "This class is helpful as a prerequisite for future computer science classes. Prof. Aspnes is entertaining but I found his lectures to be kind of confusing. They provide a lot of extra outside help like office hours and such, which I very strongly recommend you make use of. It is the type of class that is difficult for people who don't already have a strong background in discrete math or in the general area surrounding these topics, but, if you put in an appropriate amount of work and get help, then you can finish it out so that you can both learn some of the material (and probably continue to be rather fuzzy about the rest of it) and feel positively about your experience in the class.",
    "Good introduction to discrete math. This is class is of non-trivial difficulty. Be warned: the first couple of problem sets are deceptively easy compared to later ones.",
    "CS 202 is an introduction to a variety of topics in math that are presumably useful tools for computer science. I would recommend the course to another student. The material covered is very interesting and Professor Aspnes kept lectures entertaining with lots of math jokes. It also made me want to take other math classes in some of these areas, and feel like I had the background to do so. However, the class goes very quickly and I sometimes felt lost. Also the problem sets are very different from examples we do in class. If you do take this class I highly recommend really taking advantage of office hours. They will save your life.",
    "CS202 was difficult, but an awesome course. It's obviously required for CS majors, but I'm sure it's also applicable to anyone going for Applied Math or with a passing interest in the _science_ of computer science. I could even apply some of what I learned to Econ. Take it when Prof. Aspnes teaches it!!",
    "Some fun math concepts and enthusiastic professor.Very disorganized.Take it if you have to, otherwise maybe skip it.",
    "CS 202 is the first actual math course that I, and many of my classmates, have ever taken. It is a whirlwind tour through many aspects of math which are relevant to CS, including logic, probability theory, set theory, number theory, linear algebra, and a little abstract algebra and graph theory. Since there are so many topics, none of them are covered in all that much depth, however. I would definitely recommend it, especially if Professor Aspnes is teaching it--it's interesting, and the problem sets make you think.",
    "If you're a comp sci major, you have to take this class, in which case I tell you that Aspnes is funny although disorganized, and that he keeps a very good set of notes on the class webpage. (I wish I had discovered these earlier). Going to class may not be that helpful, although it is sometimes entertaining. If you don't need to take this class, but are interested in the topics, I would consider trying to find a class that goes into more depth on a few specific topics. CPSC 202 covers a broad range of mathematical ideas but doesn't go into huge depth on any of them.",
    "This is, hands down, the worst class I have ever taken. And that includes every class since preschool.Lectures don't make any sense, and Professor Aspnes, though entertaining, is terrible at teaching and explaining things. The problem sets are designed so that only absolute geniuses can do them without the help of a TA. This sucked because it meant that the entire class bombed the first two, and then everyone started going to office hours and everyone got 100s on every other problem set because people were so lost that the TAs basically had to spoonfeed us the answers. So the curve sucked because everyone got 100s every time.Also, this class calls itself \"Math for CS,\" but really it's just super abstract math. When in computer science are you going to need to prove the existence of natural numbers? I'm pretty sure you and any computer you'll ever use already believe in natural numbers. All of the math that could be useful for CS (linear algebra, graph theory), was covered too abstractly or too quickly to be of any use. I learned more \"linear algebra\" doing matrices in high school pre-calc, and we talked about graph theory for less than one lecture. You basically don't learn how to solve practical problems in this class at all.My advice:-Only take this class if you have to, or if you're naturally REALLY good at abstract math and enjoy it a lot.-If you take this class, go to office hours FOR EVERY SINGLE ASSIGNMENT, and be thorough so you know you'll get 100s on every pset. That means you'll have a few extra 100s before eveyone else in the class catches onto the fact that psets are impossible without help, and you'll be ahead of the curve.-When studying for exams, use Aspnes's online notes. They are infinitely more helpful than his lectures.-Take up kickboxing to vent your anger and frustration about how this class is organized.",
    "The course was interesting. I learned a lot, without spending tens of hours per week on problem sets. The professor is a good lecturer, and the TAs were very helpful. I would recommend this class to anyone thinking of majoring in computer science or applied mathematics.",
    "It's an introductory discrete math course, so expect to learn something new and expect to be challenged to think in a different way.",
    "The professor is a very good lecturer and understands the material well. Going to class and office hours really helps one grasp all the material. If you're not getting it, seek help sooner rather than later although the material doesn't strictly build on previous topics, they get combined on homework and midterms.",
    "If you like math, are good at math, are an applied math major, or CS major, take it. If not, dont. Its too hard to just randomly take it.",
    "For computer science majors: take it only if you don't feel comfortable about the materials in MATH244. This course is probably a lot less rigorous, but as a consequence, you'll come away with a broad survey of math topics rather than an extensive education in one or two."
