   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning more about American history. You don't need to be specifically interested in women's history to take this course. It's super fun and you learn a lot! And the work is not horrible.",
    "yes, take this. you learn so much about women and society in general. men, don't be afraid to take this course just because it has \"women\" in the title! you'll be a better person because of it",
    "Great overview of Women's history. Fantastic readings, interesting lectures.",
    "The class covers women from before the suffrage movement to the present. The modern stuff is very interesting and allows you to question the assumptions that you had about the women's movement and women's place in the United States. The work was not overwhelming and the class was very enjoyable.",
    "Definitely take this course!! It's fascinating - even for someone who wouldn't typically take this type of course. It's also empowering.",
    "Great survey class on the history of women and America. A lot of reading, but the lectures are very thorough, clear, and interesting.",
    "DEFINITELY don't miss this class! The lectures, the readings, and even section were all interesting. Even the final paper on the topic of your choosing was kind of fun to write. This class made me decide to pursue the history major.",
    "It is basically a historical account of the different waves of feminist movements in the 20th century. You also deal a lot with sexuality, gender, class and race also. You learn so many different things about the feminist history of America, it can be overwhelming, but it is well worth it. Take it. Especially if you want to be an American Studies major.",
    "This was a great course. The workload is very manageable and the material was very interesting.",
    "History 171 is a good class where you learn a lot about the history of women. There is not just a history class, though. It is very much also a WGSS class. The lectures were great, but some of the readings were a bit tedious and not completely worthwhile, in my opinion. Still, though, I got a lot out of this class and would recommend it.",
    "This is a fantastic class which more people should be taking, especially guys (there were only a couple in the entire lecture) as the material is hugely important and relevant, beyond being fascinating in its own right. Professor Meyerowitz is a great lecturer, very witty and genuinely an authority on the subject. The readings are wonderful and very enjoyable, and the workload very manageable, so I can't think of a reason why you wouldn't take it!",
    "Women in America was a great overview of the women's movement in the past century. The lectures were super interesting and I feel like I learned a lot about the women's movement. The readings did get a bit tedious at times, but you didn't really need them for anything but section, so you could get away with skimming them. I would definitely recommend the course!",
    "definitely would recommend, great class, interesting material, great professor, learned a lot but it wasnt stressful.",
    "Yes. Great class. Take it.",
    "Yes. Good class.",
    "YESYESYES",
    "Fun class with interesting lectures and a fairly light workload. I would recommend this class.",
    "Great lectures, readings from the books are pretty good, document readings are hit or miss. Very interesting class, not too difficult, but you must attend lecture and be ready to take a lot of notes.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Meyerowitz is an extremely engaging, fantastic lecturer, and she synthesizes the complexities of the women's movement very well. The course requirements are about the same as any other course. I learned tremendously from this course and consider it one of the best I have taken here so far.",
    "Definitely! You get to learn so much about how women struggled and realize that we still have a long way to go.",
    "History of women's and gender movements in America in the 20th century. I would recommend it to both men and women. It's history that's very relevant to our lives today. The lectures and readings really are interesting and engaging. The paper based off of original sources is also a good introduction to writing papers like that.",
    "A lot of reading but most of it is interesting and some of the books I would definitely read on my own anyways.",
    "Overall, this was a great class. The lectures were well-organized and very interesting, and they went with the readings very well. I'm considering switch my major to WGSS because of this class. Take it.",
    "take it if the topic interests you...you will learn a lot",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student--not just history majors either. It covers a lot of interesting information and issues in history. Work-wise, it's not that bad--a midterm, paper and a final. The readings aren't terrible either--there's like a medium amount but it's totally doable. The professor is amazing and if you get a TF, it could be a spectacular class.",
    "This class is great. The themes covered--the roles and status of all different kinds of women in 20th century America--are so relevant to many other subjects, and hopefully to your life as well. The class has the typical amount of work for a lecture--one paper, some short reading responses, a midterm and a final. The lectures are super interesting--you can tell Professor Meyerowitz is really passionate about the subject--and the reading is good too.",
    "Women in America is an examination of 20th century through the lens of gender and women's experiences in the workplace, sexuality and family. I would definitely recommend this class to any man or woman, and if I wrote the graduation requirements it would be required. The reading was all really great, I did it during free time, I loved it so much. Sometimes the primary sources seemed a bit unrelated but never felt like a waste of time. IDs on exams came out of left field sometimes, but the tests were never impossible. Lectures were really interesting. And the assignments don't really ask too much of a student, but are enriching and never took me too long. The final paper on primary sources was fun to write! All in all, a wonderful, wonderful class.",
    "I would recommend this class because it touches on a number of very relevant issues.",
    "Take it! I really, really think this course is excellent. Prof. Meyerowitz is so, so great. If you're a WGSS major, or a History major, or an American Studies Major, you really should take it. It's a survey class--but will surely add something to your study of American history\/Women's studies\/etc...",
    "Women in America is SUCH A GREAT COURSE. I shopped it thinking I would never take a class like this but Professor Meyerowitz is AMAZING and it really paid off. Lectures are always great, readings are usually interesting, and the research paper was really fun to write because you get to pick your own focus.",
    "Excellent intro course for Women's Studies. More boys should take this class - the material is not super feminist.",
    "Certainly! Professor Meyerowitz is extraordinarily knowledgeable and exposes her students to more than the standard historical narratives. It is clear that she is an active thinker in the field and that certainly makes its way into her classes.The readings were generally interesting and the time commitment required for the class is totally reasonable--not a pushover but also not crazy. You will have weekly readings (primary documents, articles, and occasionally excerpts of books or an entire not-very-dense book). During the semester, you'll also have a couple of magazine article assignments, in which you go to Sterling and find an interesting article from a certain era. At the end of the year there is both a final research paper and a final, but neither are too strenuous (you'll get the final questions ahead of time.)Your experience in the class will probably depend on the TA you have, but my TA was great and it seems that other people with different TA's thought the same.",
    "I enjoyed taking this class, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in taking an American history class, but who is interested in studying American history from a slightly different angle. Professor Meyerowitz is a very organized and thorough lecturer, and the readings are very interesting.",
    "American Studies 271, Women in America: The Twentieth Century, is one of my favorite classes that I have taken so far. Though the title of the course is pretty self-explanatory, the class offers more than just the history of twentieth century American women. This course helped me to gain a much more complete view of American history. Most American history classes neglect the roles of women; women are either overlooked or overshadowed by \"more important\" male historical figures. Women in America: The Twentieth Century finally told the story of those typically-forgotten women. Because of this, I think that this class would be beneficial to ANY student, male or female, interested in American history. You cannot fully understand American history without looking at all sides of the story. In addition, this class was so very interesting. I looked forward to each and every lecture. If I had to choose this class all over again, I would not hesitate."
