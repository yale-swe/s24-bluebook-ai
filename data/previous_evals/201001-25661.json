    "Absolutely. Reading the advanced texts that we do really provides a solid basis for any work with Arabic in the future.",

    "This course really solidified and further deepened my understanding of Arabic grammar. In addition to learning more vocabulary and common usage patterns, this course has helped me develop a keener sense of how different linguistic patterns can be used to convey the same (or different) meanings depending on context.",
    "I felt that reading the novels was particularly helpful in improving my ability to read. I would have preferred more speaking and listening exercises, since these are the skills I will most need in my field, rather than reading texts.",
    "Obviously, since it's a language course, it deepened my knowledge a lot."
