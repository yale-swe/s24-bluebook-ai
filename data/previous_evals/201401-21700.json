   "comments": [
    "yes if you are interested in macro - it's a nice continuation of intermediate macro and micro; personally really enjoyed learning more about the topics; workload is definitely manageable and material is very clear and well taught by prof arkolakis. i also found the final project deepened my understanding of research and the material.",
    "Okay course. Taught in a lecture style rather than a seminar, so attendance can be easier on a senior.",
    "Absolutely!! You learn so much about the financial markets.",
    "Take this seminar! It is interesting and not that hard. Professor know a lot and is very, very willing to help",
    "I would strongly recommend this class. The concepts covered in international finance are, in many ways, an extension of intermediate macro. They help you to contextualize the world within a rigorous economic framework and provide greater insights about how economies function. Anyone can benefit from these ideas. The work was graded very fairly and, provided you work hard, it is entirely possible to do well. The professor and the TA were both extraordinary: they taught the material very clearly, were willing to meet regularly to provide extra help and feedback. Furthermore, exams were graded fairly. Therefore, in summary, an interesting class taught by an excellent professor. You can't ask more from any course.",
    "It's a challenging but interesting course on international macroeconomics, such as international trade. Yes, because the material is interesting and the research part of this course is also interesting."
