   "comments": [
    "PHIL 315 was an interesting survey of truth and relativism topics, with one philosopher covered in each clearly-outlined lecture. It was a bit difficult for a beginning philosophy student but still understandable.",
    "I would recommend this course to a friend. Workload is not overwhelming, material is interesting, and lectures are well-organized.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to a philosophy student. It trains analytic philosophy skills really well.",
    "I would recommend Truth and Relativism. I was sometimes frustrated by the conclusiveness of the material, I have a much better understanding of the possible views of truth. I loved Szabo's lectures, he vas very captivating and presented views well, but sometimes in office hours he was unable to work through ideas with me.",
    "Very rigours and analytical. Not for the faint of heart.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Professor Szabo is wonderful, the material is fascinating, and the course is extremely well designed. It's always interesting and challenging, but never overwhelming. As good a class as you'll find anywhere.",
    "Truth and Relativism had a huge turnout on the first day due to its grandiose title. The crowd gradually thinned out over the course of the semester, however, with people dropping the class as late as the first couple weeks after Spring Break. This is because the class was considerably more technical than one might expect. The material had a significant Philosophy of Language bent, which means that discussions would often revolve around issues that can seem rather trivial. Where the class was really able to shine was in the connections that Professor Szabo made across the readings. The overall arc of the course, too, rewarded those who stayed on board with the material, as we saw technical issues in language explode and transform into grander metaphysical, ethical, and political issues that more than justified the grandiosity of the course's title. Much of the credit for this is due to Professor Szabo's lecturing style, which is accessible enough clarify thorny technical issues and engaging enough to ease the trudge through those issues. I would not necessarily recommend this as a first philosophy class for a few reasons. First of all, the technical nature of the issues may be a turn-off to newcomers and certainly does not inspire the same sense of wonder as foundational texts by the likes of Plato or Kant do. Second, we only wrote one real philosophy paper the entire term, which was our final paper. Otherwise, we did three \"short assignments\" in which we wrote briefly on minor, sometimes not particularly riveting facets in the philosophers' broader arguments. These were great exercises in milking the analysis of a particular point for all its worth, but they did not inspire the kinds of thoughts that keep you up at night or that provide the spring in your step. For these reasons, I would recommend that those who want to dip their toes in the subject look elsewhere. On the other hand, those who have a few philosophy classes may get frustrated by the lecture format of the course. The class was small enough that sometimes I wished we simply ditched the lecture and have a round table discussion. As it stood, Professor Szabo often appealed to us and encouraged us to ask questions, but we never got into the habit of building off one another's comments. For the more advanced student, then, a seminar might be more appealing. If you do choose to take a class with Professor Szabo, whether it be this one or some other (or one of his seminars, where he probably really shines), you will find his passion for even the smallest issues infectious and his insights, more often than not, really thought-provoking.",
    "While the subject material seems interesting, the class is actually very dry without much discussion or class participation. You get straight summaries of a lot of different views on truth.",
    "This was a great class. Szabo is great at explaining the different readings, and also in engaging with questions in class discussions. In terms of coursework, there aren't a lot of readings, but they can be difficult to get through. Overall, I recommend this class, especially for those who want an introduction to analytic philosophy."
