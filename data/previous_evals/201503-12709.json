    "I took Physics 260 without taking multi-variable calculus in advance. Although I coped well and really enjoyed the course. However, I would like to suggest to others students to learn Math 120 first before taking Phys 260.",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics 260. If you have taken AP Physics C or a similar course in high school and have a reasonable grasp of multivariable calculus, 260 reviews the necessary material while also including interesting topics that are not addressed in a standard \"introductory\" freshman physics course, such as special relativity and Lagrangian mechanics. At times, I've wished that some of the topics were covered in a bit more depth, but that would mean loosing the breadth that makes 260 so interesting. Professor Baltay is clearly quite knowledgeable and has a wonderful sense of humor. The workload is quite manageable - weekly problem sets plus one midterm and the final exam. Anna Kashkanova's weekly problem sessions provided extra practice with the material as well as some interesting examples not discussed in class.",
    "Physics 260 is a rewarding class, and moves through the timeline of AP Physics C in one semester but while spending significant time filling gaps in the material that we previously didn't have the math background to understand (Lagrangians, special relativity, path integration over vector fields, divergence and curl theorems in electrostatics\/magnetostatics, etc.). Keep in mind - this class is straightforward and relatively simple as it explores mechanics up until the first midterm, then elevates significantly in difficulty when it starts E+M. Earlier psets take 3-4 hours, but increase to 6-8 by the end of the semester. The room is full of freshmen geniuses fresh out of AP Physics, so the seemingly average difficulty ratings don't necessarily accurately describe how hard this course is - it's not overwhelming, but the topics are significantly conceptually harder than Physics 180\/200.",
    "The department needs to rework this class. For most of the class, 260 will be very easy and 261 very hard.",
    "Overall good course. Prof. Baltay is interesting (enough), the workload extremely manageable, and the material a tantalizing teaser to the beauties of physics. (And I'm not even a science major!) MATH 230 not required at all, but do have a good understanding of Stokes' theorem (and the like) for E&M. The midterm was literally a joke (could have taken it without taking the class), while the final was much more challenging (but still doable). If you haven't had AP Physics C, though, you might struggle...",
    "This course is a very fast pace and mathematically advanced review of both mechancics and E&M, in addition to a brief look at special relativity. Given a solid background in both physics and mathematics, I would recommend this course. However, if one does not have an adequate grasp on E&M or mechanics, this class may be quite challenging as is it progresses very quickly.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. Baltay's a good lecturer and the workload is very manageable. 260 is not too challenging if you're comfortable with the material covered in AP Physics C, and it's a good refresher and also goes into some interesting things not covered in high school.",
    "PHYS 260 01 is an expansive, and intensive review on the most difficult physics concepts in addition to the new teaching of fundamental ones. It focuses on three areas: mechanics, relativity, and electrodynamics. In mechanics, students learn the fundamental laws of motion, energy, rotation, and oscillation. In electrodynamics students learn electrostatics, currents, magnetic fields\/forces, in addition to the introduction to gauge theory.",
    "If you are taking this course without previous knowledge of multivariable calculus, you will sometimes find yourself not haveing the slightest idea of what is going on. Not all concepts are taught fast enough in 120. But if you practice enough to became comfortable with using volume intergrals (and maybe curl, divergence) you will be fine.",
    "Only take this course if you have at least taken AP Physics C level courses and have some familiarity with multivariable calculus. The professor does try and scare you into not taking the course if you do not know things like curl and divergence, but a few hours of review caught me up to speed for this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who would like to have a deeper understanding of introductory physics! I was shopping 180, 200, and 260--I immediately decided not to take 180 when I walked in on the first day and there was a ppt lecture about sig figs done in comic sans. I didn't take 200 because I didn't want to watch extra hour-long videos outside of class and I also accidentally skipped class during reading week on the day of a pop quiz. When I shopped 260, I immediately liked Baltay's teaching style; hearing him explain particle physics made me understand why there was a major called Physics and Philosophy. I was initially super scared of enrolling in 260 because all my physics knowledge is self-studied and I didn't take AP Physics C E&M in in high school (I didn't even place into physics 260 to be honest) so I assumed I would be the dumbest kid in the class. I studied a ton though and the TA, Anna, is SUPER helpful and I learned so so much. If you're unsure about which introductory physics to take definitely take physics 260!! The homework assignments and exams are all very fair.",
    "The class was OK. I found the teaching to be rather dry, and for me, the material was almost all review. The bits that were not review were very straightforward to learn. Don't be afraid to talk to the DUS during shopping period to skip this class if you feel confident in physics--my suitemate did, and I lowkey wish I had too. More generally, I don't know of anybody in the class who is actually struggling. The midterm was absolutely ridiculously easy--the average was literally a 96--and the final exam was not too bad either. The problem sets were usually pretty quick, and I completed them all the night before they were due without much stress.",
    "I would definitely recommend PHSS260 for prospective physics majors but even for people who probably will not study physics further, 260 will be an enjoyable class and gain them a solid understanding of the fundamentals of classical mechanics and E&M. Regardless of your physics placement if you've taken AP Physics C and Calc BC, 260 shouldn't pose a problem if you want to take it.",
    "Physics 260 is by no means easy but is undoubtedly a good course. I took it concurrently with Math 120 having taken no multivariable calculus in high school and managed just fine. Most of the multivariable stuff really starts coming up in the latter (E&M) half of the course, so if you can do a little self-help and pay attention in Math 120 you will be fine (don't be freaked out by the equation sheet he waves in your face if you ask about Math 120). Baltay is a clear, entertaining lecturer and rarely goes too fast. The problem sets are manageable. I recommend the course if you are interested in physics and have space in your schedulemy friend, who also took AP Physics C in high school, took Physics 200 and spent the semester bored out of his mind. I will probably not be a physics major but am still glad I took the course.",
    "The class very heavily emphasizes physics theory rather than actual physics. Don't be discouraged by Baltay saying the class is hard because if you have what you think are the necessary prerequisites, you'll be fine. If you are good at physics, you should take this class. I learned a lot about the advanced theory that I've never learned before.",
    "I LOVED this class. Charlie makes this very understandable, and he is a great professor. Very funny and personable. Although sometimes he feels unapproachable, he is not. He sometimes assumes you know advanced stuff and then ask if you have seen pulleys before. But, he will go over the advanced stuff if you say you haven't seen it before. The first classes during shopping period are very \"touchy-feely\" and the class is very math intense, but it's not crazy math like MATH 230. It is definitely doable with MATH 120... I mean I barely remembered any vector calculus, but there is a formula sheet with vector calculus in different coordinate systems, and after doing it a while, you get the hang of it. The midterm and final are actually really decent if you do the review. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone with a strong interest in Physics. Don't worry if your math isn't necessarily up to par or if you haven't taken AP Physics C E&M yet (I didn't). If you're willing to do the PSets and pay attention in class, you'll make up for the deficit.",
    "I would definitely not recommend Physics 260 to a student who had not previously taken AP Physics and at least single-variable Calculus (preferably multivariable Calculus as well). For such a student the class can be very interesting, and it introduces several new topics. It focuses on conceptual physics more than on applications and practice problems, and it is therefore probably more useful to a physics major than to an engineer.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course to anyone who did well in AP Physics and wants to learn more. It gives a good overview of interesting topics in physics at the beginning, and moves on to new topics quickly. Special relativity and Lagrangian mechanics are some of the cool things we learn in addition to what's covered in AP Physics. The homework is difficult but actually pretty short.",
    "Take the class, I'm pretty sure we don't have a better intro physics course. Read the section on 4-vectors when you get to Special Relativity, and learn to appreciate the Langrangian.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student interested in math, but not physics or engineering.",
    "Physics 260 is a great course. If you have taken AP Physics C and have some background in multivariable calculus then this course is perfect. It is in depth and interesting.",
    "The greatest strength of Physics 260 is that it covers very interesting material. Prof. Baltay has done a good job of choosing the best and juiciest topics from classical mechanics, special relativity and E&M. The problem sets are challenging but not overly difficult, and the exams aren't too bad either (especially the first midterm, for which the lowest score in the class was 84%). This is more than a review of AP Physics C, and by the end of the semester you'll have a better understanding of the math behind mechanics\/E&M than you did before. I didn't realize how much of the math behind physics requires multivariable calculus to understand! Also, you'll learn two new topics - Lagrangians (which are an awesome shortcut\/cheat for solving complicated mechanics problems) and special relativity. The lectures are interesting, and Professor Baltay has a wonderful, dry sense of humor. However, the material can be hard to follow, because Prof. Baltay doesn't always have a good sense of which topics we find easy and which are hard for us to understand. He doesn't really encourage questions, but if you're confused, ask them anyway! He won't mind, although you won't always get the clearest answer. I have found that the best time to ask questions - especially questions that are slightly beyond the scope of the course - is at the end of class. At the beginning of the year, Prof. Baltay will attempt to scare away all of the students with an insufficient math\/physics background, including those who have not taken multivariable calculus. I was one of those students, and I think I did well in the class, so if you're taking Math 120 with this class instead of Math 230 you'll be fine. You will have to work a little harder at the beginning - you'll probably have to teach yourself triple (volume) integrals, gradients, Stokes theorem and divergence theorem because you need them in physics before you get them in math. (You don't need a really good understanding of Stokes\/divergence for this class, though, so really the only things you'll need to teach yourself are triple integration and gradients). One the whole, however, it was actually a good arrangement. I was using the same material in two classes at once, and it made Math 120 much much easier. Overall, if you really like math\/physics and have taken at least AP Physics C and BC calc, this is probably a good class for you! (Make sure, though, to take Math 120 with this class if you haven't yet taken multivariable).",
    "I would recommend PHYS 260 for any prospective physics major. It provides a useful, advanced look at classical mechanics and electromagnetism and is pretty understandable for students with sufficient backgrounds in physics and multivariable calculus.",
    "Prof Baltay is an engaging lecturer and makes math derivations understandable. 260 is basically all of AP Physics C, with special relativity and Lagrangians thrown in. The class is an overview, which has its upsides and downsides- you get exposed to a lot of physics, but learn little more than before. Probably won't recommend for people who have never taken physics before, unless you can imagine the inner workings of electric fields from math derivations alone. However, for a freshman class and transition to college, its more rigorous approach to an AP Physics review works well. As for work: midterm was a lot simpler than the problem sets; final was fair; don't leave the Griffiths E&M problem set to the last night before the deadline, the potential along the axis of a solid charged cylinder is not to be trifled with.",
    "I would only recommend this class to students who are very comfortable in physics and math. Problem sets are very challenging and will require a significant time investment. Lectures are useful but it can be hard to focus, and exams are surprisingly forgiving. Overall, the class does what it sets out to do, and teaches students a comprehensive overview of introductory physics, but it demands a lot of effort on the part of the student to keep up with the material.",
    "Goes through mechanics, lagrangian mechanics, E&M, special relatively, and little bit on gauges. Reasonable workload, the problem sets are fine. Dr. Baltay is a baller, I definitely recommend this class, even if you could get away with 180 or 200. He will try to scare you early on about the background required, but in reality plenty of people just start multi at the same time and do fine.",
    "If you are comfortable with mechanics and electromagnetism, this is a good course to take because it goes over both pretty quickly. Professor Baltay is a good lecturer, just watch for his occasional mistakes when writing on the board. Also, math 230 is not necessary! Math 120 is definitely enough despite what the blue book says.",
    "For those who've taken AP Physics C or some higher level equivalent, this will be a good course for those interested in physics or who have a good understanding of it. If your physics is a little rusty but you still want an intro physics course, this might not cover enough or go too quickly.",
    "This is an AMAZING introductory physics class. Professor Baltay is absolutely wonderful, and the selected topics and problem sets help reinforce the knowledge gained in class. It is a primarily lecture course, and it goes through a lot of material very quickly. I would highly recommend it for anyone considering a major in the physics\/engineering fields, or if you are curious about the sciences! Professor Baltay definitely tries to scare you out the first 2 weeks - don't be deterred! I didn't know all that much multivariable calculus beforehand, and I still survived :) It is recommended to have taken AP Physics C or IB Physics HL, and Professor Baltay will frequently skip over topics that are deemed too easy. However, he makes sure that all of the fundamentals are well versed. If you want to do well, I highly recommend going to the problem sessions and speaking with Anna! She is a wonderful TF and helps out a lot. Don't be scared to email her with additional questions. Bring a sweater to class - the room is absolutely freezing. The midterm is not very scary. Don't sweat it! The final is slightly scarier, but not by that much.",
    "The first half of the semester is spent studying Newtonian mechanics (including special relativity) from Taylors Classical Mechanics, an excellent and enjoyable textbook. If you got a 5 on the AP Physics C Mechanics exam, then PHYS 260s take on it is not any more difficult; its impossible to make mechanics any more rigorous than Newtons Laws already do. The derivation of special relativity was pretty cool, though. The second half of the semester is dedicated to electrostatics and magnetostatics from Griffiths Introduction to Electrodynamics. The textbook is again quite good, though a bit harder to follow than Taylor, but this time our treatment of the topic is much more rigorous than it was in high school. Using multivariable calculus, we can express Maxwells Equations in their prettiest form and derive some interesting facts using Stokes Theorem and the Divergence Theorem. Getting to build electromagnetism from the ground up was the best part of this class. However, the problem sets are necessarily more boring (E&M questions just cant get as creative as mechanics ones) and many just involve ugly integrals that take way too much time to do. The problem sets are not that difficult, though I would recommended checking your answers with a friend in the class before handing them in since they are worth 25% of your grade. The first midterm, also worth 25%, was incredibly easy: most people got 98 or 100 on it according to the TA. The final, worth 50%, was more challenging and had one impossible question, but other than that all the questions were fair and generally from the textbook or practice problems. You could have gotten by in this class without attending lecture and still gotten an A by reading the textbook very carefully and doing all of the practice problems. But he did ask one question on the final that was based on material only in the lectures, so if youre worried about it dont skip lecture and take good notes. Dont worry if you know zero multivariable calculus at the start of the class as long as you are taking MATH 120 concurrently. The first midterm only tests mechanics, and the only multivariable calculus you need is taking double and triple integrals for center of mass \/ moment of inertia calculations. By the time you take the midterm, youll definitely have learned how to do those in MATH 120. You only really need the more complex multivariable theorems for E&M, but youll only be tested on it during the final exam, by which time youll obviously know them extremely well anyway for your MATH 120 final. Study hard for the final, and make sure to reread the relevant Griffiths chapters very carefully until you understand exactly how everything is derived.",
    "This is a fascinating course and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has an appreciation for physics and adequate preparation. Professor Baltay is great. He has a great sense of humor which brightens up the class.",
    "Interesting material. Make sure you study for the midterm. There's only one!",
    "Intro to mech\/E&M. Moves somewhat quickly, but should all be review. I hadn't really taken E&M before but still was survivable. Midterm is SUPER easy, final not so much.",
    "PHYS 260 01 was sometimes boring in lecture, required lots of time for the homework, but overall was probably worthwhile. Baltay's funny and that helps make the class less boring, but as a whole, you cover a lot without realizing how much you learn because you feel bored most of the time. I would recommend the class since it covers more than the other intro physics classes, but I don't think it gives you a very deep understanding or sure footing with the subject of physics. Since so much material is covered, we had to move through topics quickly, so the information was never very well reinforced.",
    "You whiz through Mechanics and E&M with an old-school badass who will throw in bits of history and digs at engineering. P-sets get infinitely harder in week 9 or so when E&M begins. Until then, not at all heavy workload.",
    "Physics 260 is essentially accelerated high school calculus-based physics for people with multivariable calculus knowledge. I would recommend it for anyone interested in a major in the physical sciences."
