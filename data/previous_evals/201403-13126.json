   "comments": [
    "English 120 as a course is brilliant - you read essays and discuss them. You also write a bi-weekly essay (the first draft due on the first Friday, then you get comments and hand in the next draft the following week,) which rapidly improves your writing skills. A couple of times during the semester, it will be your turn to have your paper workshopped by the class, which is very useful. This was Professor Sharlin's first year teaching this class and she was brilliant - very supportive, gave great comments, facilitated interesting discussion and brought sweets to class!",
    "At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to take this class because the first few classes in reading period were a bit awkward. But I am so happy I decided to take it. By far my favorite class this semester. The readings are wonderful and Professor Sharlin is simply brilliant and amazing. It is a lot of work, but the work is rarely boring. Know that this is a HARD class, and writing a good essay will require more than just completing the assignments. But I think my hard work paid off and I've become a better writer. If you are looking for a writing credit, do yourself a favor and take this class instead of Women, Food, and Culture. You're here to LEARN, not to fulfill requirements.",
    "English 120 was a very enlightening and fun class, and I felt my writing skills grew a lot. The open-endedness of the class was sometimes a bit overwhelming and I wasn't sure how exactly to write, but this also made it much more creative and fun than high school English.",
    "An intensive essay reading and essay writing class that challenges a writer to break boundaries and to change.",
    "You learn how to write essays New Yorker style. It is a fun class because your writing can be personal and you learn how to incorporate things in ways that you never thought possible. I would recommend this class to another student because my writing improved and I enjoy writing more now too.",
    "English 120 was great fun, although demanding - there was always an essay to think about or write. I felt that nonacademic nonfiction writing was a new genre to venture into, somewhere between a typical academic essay and a creative writing short story. Besides growing you as a writer it also grows you as a thinker, since writing is one means by which we make sense of the world... Prof Sharlin was really encouraging and very approachable. We had one consultation per essay at least and she was willing to spend an hour with me each time, which I felt was a precious gesture of her sincerity in developing each of her students. She was gentle with her suggestions for improvement, and very respectful of our writing decisions. If anything my only thought was that she could have been a little more firm or instructive in her feedback, given her extensive experience as an instructor; then again I know that writing is such a personal and subjective endeavor, so I can see why she hesitated as well to appear to be too certain about a 'better' way of doing things."
