   "comments": [
    "The class is a lot of work, and the tests are pretty difficult.",
    "Math 115 is a necessary course. Its basically an in-depth version of AP Calculus BC. If you are deciding whether or not to skip Math 112 and dive straight into Math 115 I would advise against it. Math 115 material is very comprehensive, and adjusting to the difficult content and a college-level teaching style will likely place you at a disadvantage. Also, if you have the option to take this class credit\/d\/fail I highly recommend it.",
    "I hate math 115. It's terrible.",
    "I would recommend math 115 with hesitation to another student. I would tell them to make sure that they get the best instructor and that they will have to put in a lot of outside of class time every week with the videos. I would not recommend the class if a student just wanted to take a math class. But if a student wanted to work their way up to high level math I would tell them that this class was necessary and the information learned would help.",
    "It was really fucking hard. I just didn't understand things as needed a tutor to even attempt keeping up.",
    "Basic calculus class that has a manageable workload.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it. A lot of success in the course I think depends on having an instructor who can explain concepts in multiple ways. I don't recommend taking the video course because at times it seems like those videos were meant to replace teaching and not supplement it. An unreasonable amount of hours are expected for this course and if you don't have the time to put in you may struggle in the course.",
    "You should take this class. I really liked the help of the videos and it is great having these fundamental math skills.",
    "I would not recommend Math 115 at Yale to another student. They are unorganized and don't effectively teach anything to the students. You're better off taking this course at a state university and transferring the credits to Yale. The math department here is a mess. Coursera was not efficient and was a waste of time. I am very disappointed in the course overall.",
    "I would take it because it is a class that helps with a lot in other subjects. It is also required for a lot of majors and can fulfill a QR requirement. I would choose the a class that uses the video format.",
    "A straightforward Cal B class that isn't necessarily intellectually stimulating, but is still taught in a fun environment.",
    "More calculus, mostly integrals and series.",
    "Not particularly well taught or interesting. take it if you have to"
