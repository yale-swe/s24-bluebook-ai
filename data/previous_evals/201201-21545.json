   "comments": [
    "Foundations of Modern Social Theory with Professor Sadia Saeed was a really wonderful experience. Professor Saeed is very warm, very approachable, and a very talented lecturer. The reading list is incredible (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, Smith, Freud, Durkheim...) and really foundational to understanding the way people think about the world. Lecture was engaging, the readings were interesting, and the class was small, so there was a lot of professor-student interaction, which was rewarding.",
    "Take it if you need the requirement for sociology. Otherwise, do not take it.",
    "I would recommend this class only to students interested in doing a great deal of independent reading and work. The lectures are stilted and the sections are somewhat ineffective, so the greatest gain from this class is exposure to the great foundational social theorists.",
    "Take it if you like reading and if you don't know much about classics of political economy and sociology. It is a good class.",
    "A basic overview of the main themes and theorists in sociology",
    "I really wouldn't take this class unless you are a sociology major or Professor Saeed is teaching it. And if you are a sociology major, try to take it with Professor Saeed. Even though I had a great experience in this class, the material is just so dry unless you are really interested.",
    "A really good, manageable class that will teach you a lot about different famous theorists.",
    "Sociology 151 01 is a lecture course that covers the works of the central figures of modern social theory. I would not recommend this course to another student although the content is interesting, it is presented in a very dry manner.",
    "I recommend the course because the theories are the foundation to Western thought and social structure. The content elucidates the source of the concepts and values we take for granted as normative to our society. Also, it covers the thread of capitalist thought since the ROmantic era quite well.",
    "It's a good chance to read some works of varying interest and importance in the field of sociology and political science, and that's about it. Taking the course didn't add much to my experience of reading the texts; I think that if I had read them on my own I would have gotten about as much out of them. The material and discussions for the individual texts were interesting on occasion, but rarely felt connected to any of the other texts, and the course ended up feeling more like a book club than anything else.The amount of reading can be substantial, but over half of your grade consists of easy multiple-choice quizzes, so it's not a tough course.",
    "Yes, take it if you are a person who thinks a lot about how\/ why the world is the way that it is.",
    "A survey that covers the expected theorists and introduces fresh voices. I recommend it.",
    "YES. it teaches you about all the authors youve heard of but dont know much about. you'll learn a ton because you're engaged in the class. there's a bit of reading, but dont let that discourage you, because you learn alot too :)",
    "Sociology 151 01 is a course that summarizes well multiple philosophers throughout history, and provides the proper resources to have a base understanding of a multitude of works. It's a course I'd suggest all to have to broaden their horizons. Also, the course inadvertently pushes for reflective behavior, where the students look into themselves, and evaluate their life choices based off of what they have learned. As a student, by the end you have a new understanding of what is going on around you, and make new choices to lead a better lifestyle. Even if the students major isn't in the humanities or social science, I feel this course should be universally taken.",
    "A glance at the great minds that led up to the development of modern social theory.",
    "Sociology 151 01 is an overview of of how deceivingly familiar elements of Western social structure came to be. It is revealed through the highlighting of 'classic' texts that are handled roughly in chronological order and that together knit a rather interesting outline of the progression of Western law and order and truthiness.And YES, I would recommend it so any student with an interest in history, philosophy, or living on planet Earth",
    "The course is not too demanding and the material is presented in a very straightforward way. The tests are extremely simple and the take-home final (two five-page essays) can be very broad and uncomplicated to write. The syllabus is especially interesting for those who want to have a better idea of western intellectual history - all the texts are basically classics of modern social thought - but it might not be the best option for those who want to know what the contemporary practice of sociological research is. I have personally decided to take this class because of the syllabus, but I must say that the format was definitely not a plus for me. The lectures offer a broad overview of the significance of the texts and the authors, and the the sections try to get the central concepts down, which most of the times is not very engaging. I would recommend people who want to engage in a more active discussion of these theorists to take a seminar course that covers similar subjects.",
    "I would recommend the course for those wanting to be exposed to a broad range of theorists, but the lecture left something to be desired."
