   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking ENGL 114, but would not take it with Timothy Robinson. Granted, I found his feedback on my first paper very helpful, and the process of writing and revising this paper definitely helped bring my writing up to the college level. However, I feel that I got very little out of the course after this first paper. On subsequent papers, Professor Robinson gave me very little feedback or suggestions on how I might improve my writing. Moreover, I was very much disappointed by class discussions. While the discussions in the first few class meetings were engaging, later discussions were dull and repetitive. Writing the papers was, perhaps, a valuable exercise. However, I feel that I learned nothing from the readings or class discussions.",
    "ENGL 114 is a great class to introduce students, especially freshmen, to college writing. It provides a space to work on your own writing skills while learning about material that may be relevant to other parts of your life.",
    "Good class if you are not too comfortable with writing but would like to improve",
    "I would recommend this course solely for the purpose of getting a writing credit, not for the purpose of learning how to write. Professor Robinson is a really nice professor, but he does not do much to teach students how to write. The class is mostly a discussion of articles that students are assigned to read out of class. The workload is front heavy; there is a lot at first and then very little toward the end.",
    "Great, simple section. Subject material can seem dull but he makes it really interesting."
