    "Loved this class, a lot more than I was expecting. As it is required I was concerned that it may be dry. But it was very interactive and pushed me to think about the bigger issues associated with being a scientist.",
    "Excellent coarse. There is a nice balance of lecture material and proposal writing. The lecture material was well chosen, and presented in a good order. The librarian WOS lecture was less useful, but was already familiar with the resources.",
    "Thanks to Os for his careful and thoughtful presentation of the material. Clearly a lot of thought and time went into this class. Very well structured, and clear even for students new to this field.",

    "n\/a",
    "The readings were long and numerous. They were useful and the teacher always referred to them in lecture. But I spent most of my time working on my proposal.",
    "This course was a great introduction to the practicalities of producing science at the master's level. There are some things that were addressed in a cursory fashion, and I have some critiques about class format, but overall, it was a fanastic experience. I had a place to refine my ideas and get feedback, to think critically about the questions I want to ask, present my ideas, etc. The readings were really only so so and did not contribute significantly to my understanding, although I liked the main text and the flirting with the philosophy of science. I wish that it was actually presented slighly more rigorously, in addition to our own workshopping of ideas.",
    "My general dissatisfaction with the course is due to the course organization and not due to the instructors.",
    "It enabled me develop my research proposal ahead of time",
    "Q1: Readings were long and conversational; I didn't find them helpful in terms of content, and had plenty of reading of denser articles relevant to my proposal to more than occupy my time.Q2: I gave a 4 because the assigned readings were not helpful; however, the lit review, outline, etc. assignments WERE very helpful, especially the feedback.Q10: Os could have been more organized, especially toward the end of the semester when the content lacked organization and powerpoint lectures seemed slapped together at the last minute. He wasn't present for as many sessions as I expected from him.Q12: I know Os is a terrific scientist and can be a good, patient teacher, but he needs to be more involved in the breakout (lab) sections of the course meetings, and dedicate more planning to course content, balancing that with the students' ability (and time) to delve deep into literature related to their proposals."

A few students also seemed to be torn between the two courses at the start of the semester (including myself). The students in the social science research methods course would equally benefit from discussion on the role of scientists and some of the courses are already the same (e.g. library and citation software tutorials).
