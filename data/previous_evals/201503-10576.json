    "I would say -- Be prepared to do a lot of reading and understand that you will be expected to make significant contributions to the conversation. It's a lot of work, a lot of reading, but you will learn a lot and come across thinkers who greatly expand your understandings of topics that are really important and interesting. Highly recommend!!!",

    "I came in thinking I had to think about cultural identity in a certain way and I left with a completely different understanding of those same concepts. In that way I think the class was hugely successful. In my own research this class helped me tremendously.",
    "This course exposed me to theories and material that I had very little contact with before this semester, which was very exciting and informative. I feel that cross-cultural artistic and aesthetic practices will continue to inform my research and study throughout my time at Yale."
