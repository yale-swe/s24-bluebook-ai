    "I would recommend English 115 as a first english course if you enjoy reading and analyzing literature. Whether or not you have written analytical or argumentative essays before it serves as a good introduction.",
    "I would recommend it to another person who wants a good introduction to English writing in college. It might be a challenge for people who did not have a good English department in high school or did not focus on English previously - but it will be helpful.",
    "An amazingly interesting class with an awesome instructor! The discussions and readings are so interesting, and Andy is just an awesome guy. You'll have to put some work into the papers and can't get away with any BS, but it teaches you to challenge your ideas and find something really meaningful to say.",
    "Its a class for developing literary analysis skills in your writing by working on several pieces of literature that fall along a general theme.",
    "I would highly recommend English 115 for a fellow student, and describe it as a course (above all else) about learning to read literature and learning how to write about literature. The choices of texts in English 115 is second to none, and worth taking.",
    "Not too bad, but grading was pretty unpredictable. Pretty good amount of weekly reading, got to watch cool movies and discuss them in class, and Andy was great. I would recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It definitely helped me grow as a write.",
    "Yes! This was a really interesting topic and enjoyed all the books a lot.",
    "It's a great class! Take it if you feel comfortable with your writing style and have a love of literature. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has any interest in English. If you don't like talking about themes and literary devices then it'sprobably not for you--take one of the essay writing courses!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking a class with Andrew Heisel at sometime in your Yale career. He made literature, a subject that I usually shy away from, really interesting and fun. I actually enjoyed writing my essays by the end of the term. I learned a lot from this class and it was really rewarding.",
    "It's a great intro English class. If you are a freshman, it's an amazing way to meet other freshmen. The class mainly consists of reading books and then writing about them. There were four essays. We also watched four movies. Two of the essays had first and final draft processes. This was my favorite class this semester and I highly recommend it.",
    "I highly recommend English 115 to any incoming freshman. Unlike 114, you read and analyze great literature and use that to structure and create arguments. You get to write essays in a similar sense to those written in high school, but while simultaneously learning the Yale method of writing. Andy is so funny and nice, so you should definitely take it with him!",
    "This is a great class to take. The movies are interesting, the books well written, and you come out stronger as an English student.",
    "A great english class if what you're looking for is lots of reading and long class discussions. I would recommend it if you're interested in a basic english class and have a particular interest in discussing the ideas of control and judgement.",
    "A great course for those who enjoy small class discussion.",
    "It's a great course to take for the writing requirement. Just make sure to run paper ideas by the instructor beforehand."
