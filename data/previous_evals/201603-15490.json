    "Through this course, I really feel like I was able to refine and enhance my Spanish skills. By covering reading, writing, as well as speaking, I feel like I was able to get a well rounded learning experience from the course and increase all aspects of my language ability.",
    "I learned different ways to study the language and what works best",
    "A better Spanish grammar and vocabulary foundation.",
    "I feel like this course is mainly just a continuation of every Spanish class you've ever taken, simple repetition. But that's language learning for ya.",
    "A lot of vocabulary, new tenses, and how to refine my writing.",
    "I was able to continue and further my learning of the Spanish language. I feel like my abilities to converse, understand, and write Spanish were improved. This course did a great job of using what we were learning at the time to give insights about the cultures of other countries, and even the challenges that the people there face on a daily basis.",
    "I am able to comfortably conduct a conversation in Spanish. I developed a more extensive vocabulary, honed and reinforced grammar, and greatly improved by Spanish literacy."

   "comments": [
    "The main strength of this course was that it was very consistent. You were given the syllabus within the first week which outlined the daily activities and homework. Therefore, you knew what to expect everyday without surprises. Also, the fact that it was everyday definitely helped the language acquisition process.",
    "there is a decent combination of grammar and vocabulary practice, but it could use more culture lessons",
    "Great focus on grammar and vocabulary mixed into interesting stories. Major weaknesses in fluencyso much more could be done to improve students' speaking. Also, there could definitely be significantly more cultural analysis built into the course.",
    "Strengths: kind and engaging professor, lots of feedback, accessible professor Weaknesses: Emphasis on oral engagement without penalization for speaking wrong, homogenize how redaccines and writing samples are graded across the department,",
    "Limiting the amount of students per class was definitely a strength of this course. This made it easy to engage in conversation and stay focused during the class period. I do wish we had at least one more opportunity for oral practice to prepare for the final oral assessment.",
    "The course is extremely organized and reasonable. The review was intertwined and very helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wishes to improve their Spanish. Especially with Maria Vasquez as the instructor as she is a wonderful professor.",
    "Yes - pretty normal Spanish course and not too much work",
    "I would recommend it simply because it is a necessary step in the Spanish curriculum, however it is not at the level of intellectual and thought-provoking worth that other Yale courses are at.",
    "Yes, but it is a lot of daily work to keep up with.",
    "It depends on whether the student wants to focus on grammar or speaking.",
    "For someone who is looking to improve their Spanish like I was, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes but I would tell the student that need to be willing to put in the work. All spanish sequence courses at Yale demand a great deal, but they are very worth it."
