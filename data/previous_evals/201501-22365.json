   "comments": [
    "Beautiful language and it's always fun to learn a new language. Make sure to take it with Anna, she's incredible.",
    "Highly recommend. It really brings the language into focus and allows you to analyze it more deeply with the intention of putting it to use. You learn the remainder of the verb tenses and tack on a decent amount of grammar and new vocabulary, all of which aid in one's ease of use and interest in the Italian language. This class is definitely worth it (especially with Anna Marra)",
    "ITAL 120 is so much fun! Italian is one of the most beautiful languages taught by one of the most amazing departments at Yale! Take it!",
    "Italian level two I would say is the course where you learn almost all the rest of the grammar that was not covered in level one. It is tough because we don't have enough time to really focus on each tense. But, I am assuming the levels above Italian level two are made to put all the things we have learned together.",
    "Very highly recommended! Probably the language class with the happiest students from what I've seen!",
    "Okay, folks. So you want to learn a language? Italian is a lovely language to hear and to speak. I would definitely recommend this course. The class really varies depends on who your professor is, though. Mine was amazing and it made all the difference. It helps if you know Spanish or Latin beforehand, but isn't too difficult to pick up. Buona fortuna, studenti futuri! I hope you have as much fun as I have.",
    "Italian is a fun language and this class is a fun class. If she's teaching it, you should really try and take it with Anna Marra because she's amazing -- a gifted teacher, a really caring and funny person, and just a lot of fun to be around. Having her as a teacher made 925 every day worth it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to any student at Yale. It is fun and you learn so much of the language."
