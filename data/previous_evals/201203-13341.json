    "Great class. The stories in the Oxford Anthology are amazing and definitely worth a read regardless of whether or not you decide to take this class. Prof. Jackson is a wonderfully kind professor and incredibly approachable. (psst) You also don't have to know any Portuguese to take this class too! I heartily recommend this class!",
    "The short stories that we read in this class were really interesting and professor Jackson has great knowledge of Brazilian literature and culture. You will definitely learn a lot if you take this class! The workload is very manageable, you only have to read a couple of short stories per week, write three short papers and a take-home final. The only drawback of the class is that lectures could sometimes get a bit boring.",
    "This was a good course with great stories. Awesome class if you want an introduction to Brazilian literature.",
    "Great class if you want to learn more about Brazilian literature or the Brazilian short story."
