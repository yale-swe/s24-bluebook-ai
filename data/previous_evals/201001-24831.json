    "A great class where you can really improve on your Japanese.",
    "I would recommend it to another student, as long as they were committed to studying Japanese. It's a lot of work, but it's also enjoyable. This year we worked through SuraSura and learned a lot of Kanji.",
    "take take take. my favorite class at yale",
    "Highly recommmended.",
    "Definitely worth continuing, you know exactly what you're in for and 2nd year japanese is definitely more relaxed and enjoyable than 1st year.",
    "It's a really chill class. You learn a lot, and by the end you'll be thoroughly shocked at how you start thinking in Japanese. Definitely recommended.",
    "This course definitely makes it worthwhile to keep learning Japanese, even beyond what you're required to learn.",
    "Yes! If you've taken L3, that's only the beginning; don't quit now. I know this class isn't required for most people's distributional requirements, but this is the point when all those hours of study begin to pay off.",
    "I am going to sorely miss this class. It was absolutely fun, even on the days that I felt very limited in what I could say about the day's material. Both of the sensei are really great and I enjoy both of their teaching styles. 2nd year really helps you learn more about Japanese culture through the readings for class. And the topics presented sometimes evolve into discussions about world issues, from the minuscule to the grand scheme of things. I would most definitely say that students take 2nd year. I am so glad that I decided not to do study abroad for this year - I would have missed an awesome year with this class."
