    "This class is pretty different from most physics courses, but not in a bad way. Rather than focusing on learning formulas and applying mathematics, the course tries to give students a conceptual overview to gain an understanding of the foundations of nuclear physics and current experimental work in the subject. I would recommend it; you'll learn a lot, and if you're even considering nuclear physics, or just interested in it, you would gain a lot from it.",
