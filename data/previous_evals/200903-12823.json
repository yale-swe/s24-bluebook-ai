   "comments": [
    "I think this course is necessary in the program to helpimprove some students' digital design expertise.",
    "This course was great at the beginning of the post-pro curriculum. I may have avoided engaging the shop equipment and many of the programs if I weren\u0092t forced to, but I feel very prepared to use them next semester for the advanced studios.",
    "Yes.",
    "It was appropriate for first year of post-pro students.",
    "Course is sequenced well.",
    "I do not understand why this course is a requirement.",
    "I think that the course occurred in proper sequence within the School's educational program \u0096 in the very beginning, because it equips the students with the extremely necessary tools without which they would be unable to perform, or extremely limit their design process.",
    "It is necessary to introducethis course in our program because some of us have never used those tools nor the software programs.",
    "The class, a requirement for incoming Post-Pro students, is intended as an introductory class to various types of digital techniques and fabrication methods. Properly placed in the first semester of our education here, it gave us immediate access to the tools in the shop and the applications on our computers.",
    "The class occurred at the right time to teach the MArch II Students the newest in programs and technology so they are able to utilize and practice the skills for the remainder of their time at Yale.",
    "Yes, I believe that it is correct to have a mandatory class teaching 3D computer modeling and fabrication to attempt to equalize students' skills\u0097or at least familiarize students with the school\u0092s resources and aid those with no computer background\u0097 enough to be able to use the available software and equipment in their studies.",
    "Since the course is required for the incoming Post Professional Students, it is nice that it occurs in the first semester of study.",
    "I don not think this course should be mandatory. There should be exemption for those with more experience on the subject matter.",
    "I thought that this course did not occur in proper sequence within the educational program. The course material focused on advanced subject material with the assumption that the basics were already known to the students. However, for some students this was not the case. If the subject material is geared towards advanced students then the class should occur later within the program.However, I believe that the course is of value to post-pro students and should definitely occur at some point in the program."

   "comments": [
    "I hope that this course can be integrated with studio. It took a lot of time, but it's like one week from class mid-term, everybody worked so hard, but after that, nobody even talked about it. If the syllabus worked better with studio, I think everyone will benefit more. Assignments has been good and helpful.",
    "I thought the material presented was good. Mr. Eberhart puts a good deal of time into writing tutorials and structuring his presentations. That\u0092s very commendable.",
    "Felt very fast with limited time on each program learned.",
    "These were clear and easy to understand.",
    "It was very helpful to me to go through all the digital software and fabrication techniques.",
    "Material was all important and relevant. It was difficult to tackle two studio-caliber design problems in one semester, but also a great opportunity.Instead of having two projects, maybe it's better to spend the first half the of the semester designing a small pavilion or installation, to select a winner, and to spend the second half producing the piece. Even for small scale designs, knowing that the project will never have to be realized allows for a disengagement from understanding material behavior, durability, cost, properties etc. Only by needing to produce a work of some size can students really begin to understand the benefits and drawbacks of digital fabrication",
    "The scope is too large for one semester, and therefore nothing was really learned. The assignments were too large in scope and expectation for a 3 credit class. Either one of the 2 projects would suffice to explore all the themes of the class -rendering, modelling in 3d, scripting and fabricating.",
    "The syllabus was divided in two essential parts:1. Design of the Starbucks interior centerpiece,meant to unfold functions of Rhino.2. Design of the Pavilion on the New Haven Green,meant to introduce parametric software: Grasshopperand Generative Components, as well as familiarizeus with the fabrication techniques.There also was a Revit introductory seminar.The course was very comprehensive and let us learn the cutting-edge important software and fabrication techniques.Most of the students were familiar with the 2-d programs and were looking to learn 3-d and parametric applications, which this course offered.I also want to point out that each assignment was extremely interesting.",
    "The exercises were effective, but there should have been a diversity of examples.",
    "The class revolved around weekly computer tutorials which attempted to introduce us to the vast number of computer programs. They were quick and rudimentary, simple tutorials that collectively exposed us to the most basic functions.",
    "Eberhart followed the course syllabus nearly exactly. I was excited about the offerings but was fairly disappointed by how they were presented (which I will discuss in later questions).",
    "If one considers the amount one student pays for tuition\/room and board per semester (roughly $25,000), and the number of teaching hours per semester (about 200), one can figure that, ultimately, he or she pays about $125 per hour of direct teaching. I am appalled by this figure only when I think of Professor Eberhart\u0092s class. I would never pay anything close to this amount for the class instruction outside of this school, and I am concerned by its level of teaching in relationship to all other classes I have taken at Yale. Here, students were instructed to \u0093teach yourself\u0094 the programs as if it were not the instructor\u0092s duty to teach even the most basic of them\u0097- this comment was made in reference to Rhino, the ubiquitous 3D modeling program.I feel that this semester the students were kept busy designing and building things to divert attention from the fact that they were not being taught to use the software. An instructor that is younger and has used these technologies in a more integrated way would be very useful.Furthermore, our first class project was in the service of Starbucks. We were promised that the winning design would be built and that the others were not. At the final review of this project, we learned that Starbucks would be taking all of our computer files and would now own our designs. Furthermore, the designs that were not chosen would perhaps be implemented in a cheap, castrated way in Starbucks stores throughout the country. I do not believe they own this material or have the right to riff on it. On top of this, the Starbucks representatives have not taken any action to build the designs they chose except to postpone them over the last two plus months.When our class took on the first project, we took it very seriously. As time went on and we saw how we were being used and the instructor treated the material as a joke, we treated the class in the same way. This is obvious when one looks at the work produced across the board for the second project.",
    "In the beginning of the semester I was led to believe that the main focus of the course was to present technologies and software applications relating to CAD\/CAM design and production, as it applies to the field of architecture. This has been covered fairly well, although not in considerate depth. Despite a few informative discussions that took place in the beginning of the semester, I feel that little attention has been placed in critically understanding the computer aided technologies that we use.Instead, I think that too much energy and to many resources have been placed in the two fairly serious assignments that were given during the course of the semester.",
    "These were all good and the technology presented was up to date.",
    "As already stated the syllabus concentrates on advanced material and attempts to cover a multitude of programs. I would have preferred if it had done the opposite - a syllabus that concentrates on learning a few programs well.The assignments were interesting but were perhaps more suitable for a studio environment. This was also reflected in the final review where the design of each pavilion was discussed more than the digital technology involved.There seems to be some misunderstanding on who should be teaching\/assisting students in the shop - the fabrication TA\/instructor or the shop assistants. If the assignments are such that they must be fabricated in the shop, then half of the classes should be spent learning how to use the machines in the shop."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this course and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "I have to admit that I was hoping for a more challenging course. It's quite OK because I think the primary goal is to help students to get sufficient skills for digital design, not to further improve students who are already familiar with these knowledge.",
    "I expected to become familiar with the computer programs and the digital fabrication equipment, and I feel comfortable with all of them now.",
    "To learn Rhino and Brazil well while also becoming capable in grasshopper. My expectations were nearly met but I would have liked to had more time for in class questions and not design crits.",
    "I expected to learn the way of using machines for fabrication as well as 3D software such as Rhino and grasshopper. This course encouraged to acquire these skills.",
    "I am satisfied with touching the all software; however, I could not go deeper because of the design and production parts of this course.",
    "My expectations were to be able to delve deeper into the software we studied, but it's impossible given the the astronomical scope of the course (it's actually 4 or 5 courses in one).",
    "I expected to learn more about scripting and did not.",
    "This course completely suited my interests.I had an opportunity to work and learn recent generation 3-d and parametric applications to which I didn't have access working back home.Although being just tools, these applications are extremely important, since they transform the design process itself, greatly expanding its potential.I think, that what I've learned with the help of Professor Eberhart will change my research in design for the near future. In the next semester I'm definitely planning to utilize parametric tools in design studio.",
    "In reality, the material covered in the class should be divided into two larger classes, one focusing on computation and the other fabrication. As a means of introducing a large number of students to a large number of programs and tools however, it served its function. All the tutorials were basic at best and lacked any substantial depth. The large class size stuffed into the small computer lab on the 6th floor made it difficult to properly learn the programs; often the computers would not work and some of us had to sit and watch.",
    "My expectation was a course on technology, computation and fabrication that involved graduate level discussion and enough program training without being a community-college level tutorial course. My goal was to have a firm grasp of the programs and the tools in the shop to be able to expand on each for the rest of my time at Yale.Unfortunately, the course was not as informative as I had hoped. The majority of the learning came from teaching ourselves and we really only had one enriching class discussion (which is really great). As an elective course, I had expected we would do charette assignments allowing us to pair different programs with different machines\/tools (ie. the robot, mills, waterjet, etc) to get a base level understanding of each. However, we instead had two fairly developed projects limiting our usage of many of the offerings.In summary, the course did not meet my expectations as my undergraduate technology and fabrication course five years back taught more programs in more detail in the same amount of time.",
    "I expected to learn to use new 3D modeling programs in depth. I was disappointed when I realized I would be learning this from my classmates.",
    "My expectations for this course were to familiarize myself with the available software technologies and fabrication methods available to us at the school. I think that I have acquired a fair amount of knowledge in this respect. It would have been great to use the fabrication equipment that is available in the school in a more informative academic way.",
    "I was expecting a more advanced level of discourse on computation and a more critical approach.",
    "I thought there were going to be workshops with invited experts on some programs and digital techniques, like some MArch I classes have. This course should be more about an individual's thorough exploration in the digital field. Exploration was sometimes limited because of the lack of knowledge necessary to advance into more complex problems.",
    "I expected to be proficient in various software and fabrication technologies that I did not previously know. Although this did not occur, I did receive a broad introduction to the subject."

   "comments": [
    "It's a nice course and Mr.Eberhart is a nice person and instructor. It helped me a lot on getting familiar with the fabrication tools in the school and digital design methods that I can apply to other works.",
    "The course was useful, particularly at the beginning of the curriculum.",
    "Very valuable.",
    "It was valuable course because I could learn not only computation but also how to fabricate in real world.",
    "The course was incredibly valuable in prepping us to use the fabrication equipment in the school and as an overview of parametric and fabrication software.",
    "This class should have been broken down into different classes. Since everybody has different levels of knowledge on each subject, at some point in the class, the time spent was wasted. What I wanted to learn did not receive enough time, so I barely benefited from it.",
    "The course was literally invaluable to me.I have talked to ProfessorEberhart, and he agreed to consult me in future as I will work individually on some of the things I'm still interested to learn in computation, especially in grasshopper and Revit.",
    "Going in, the course was of extreme value of me. As a post-professional student, one of the reasons I came back to Yale was to catch up with modern thinking about technology and to broaden my vocabulary regarding digital fabrication. In the end, I feel like the course turned into a mini-studio requiring a huge amount of work and often leading to the whole class pushing studio aside for sometimes a week at a time.",
    "I learned how to use the majority of the shop equipment from Tim, Josh, and Taylor. I learned that Rhino is a clunky program that I will not be using again in future studios. I learned that Generative Components is a parametric design software. None of these things do I value highly, other than learning to use the shop equipment. I thought this course was a waste of time and money, and more importantly, a wasted opportunity for the school to put students on the cutting edge.",
    "I believe that I have learned a fair amount during the course, since I had not been familiar with many of the technologies and fabrication equipments prior to my studies at Yale.",
    "The course was valuable in that it allowed a forum for exploration, but the course lacked instruction in advanced content necesary for more in depth work.",
    "The course was of a certain amount of value to me in that I have learned more on the subject matter. However, I would have preferred if it had been taught in a different way."

   "comments": [
    "Both the instructor and TA Zach has been helpful and effective. They are really good.",
    "Both the TA and professor were knowledgeable, laid-back, and willing to help.",
    "Strong instructor - just very fast through a lot of material. TA was great.",
    "Their explanations and critics were helpful.",
    "I think the Professor knows about lots of computer programs but not about structural issues.",
    "John had a well-organized sequence of classes, good tutorials written, and was able to put in extra time outside of class to help with questions.Zach the TA was great, extremely knowledgeable with all machines, and available beyond required timeslots.",
    "Not useful, and unclear about expectations. (as became evident in the project review)",
    "Thanks to Professor Eberhart.Not only he conducted great classes, he responded to all of our e-mail questions and came to the studio to consult us individually on every single questions.I also would like to thank our TA, Zachariah Pursley, who was also always available to answer any questions, and greatly helped us with mastering the robotic arm.",
    "On the surface, John was quite knowledgeable about the various programs and fabrication methods. At times however, particularly when asked in-depth questions about a particular function, the answers would often come up short. Instead of trying to teach all of the programs himself, it would\u0092ve been better to have someone with more expertise lead the class. Because the tutorials were so sparse, it would have benefitedto have more workshops.",
    "TA Zach Pursell was very good and was willing to help us inside and outside of class and at any time.While I firmly believe Professor Eberhart knows the programs and is very knowledgeable, I felt a majority of the classes involved him following a tutorial book that any of us could have followed on our own.",
    "The instruction was not effective because the instructor lacked a thorough knowledge of the software beyond what he found in online tutorials. We were taught a handful of showy and rarely-used commands while never having been taught the basics. Of course, those unfamiliar with the programs ended up learning the basics by teaching themselves or from classmates, admittedly a valuable resource, but when ALL of ones knowledge comes from outside sources, there is an obvious problem. This is not what we are paying for.Class TA Zach was very helpful and patient. Although both Professor Eberhart and Zach tried to be available outside of class time, the two weeks when they were needed most\u0097before our first project was due and finals week\u0097they were either out of the country or completely unavailable. Students were encouraged to find strangers in the school who were good at the programs and pester them to share their knowledge.",
    "The professor has presented the material quite clearly.He has been informative and concise. The TA for the class has been great in helping withthe teaching process. His knowledge of fabrication technologies and CAD\/CAM software has come in very handy throughout the semester.",
    "Both the instructor and the TA had a general knowledge of the course material, but not in depth knowledge in any particular area.",
    "The course instructor was effective in giving brief overviews of the multitude of software. This provides an introduction to the programs but does not provide time or scope to develop an in-depth knowledge of the subject. This style of teaching seems at odds with the assignments given. We were expected to have an intimate knowledge of the software and fabrication machine in order to complete the assignments but were not provided with this knowledge and were not taught how to use the machines.I thought that if the assignments were shorter and presented as digital problems to be solved, the class would have been far more beneficial.Both the TA and the course instructor seemed to have an in-depth knowledge of the subject matter - it was just unfortunate that this was not conveyed to the students."

   "question_text": "Suggestions you may have for course improvements:",
   "comments": [
    "I hope this course can teach us more details on the software and fabrication issues. Right now it seems the course focus on so many different topics and didn't really dig in on one of them.",
    "There were a few pieces of equipment that I found no need to use and was too worried to use without more help (the robot, the water jet cutter, the plasma cutter, etc.). Everyone will learn to use the laser cutter and the mill, but maybe having a small assignment where we must use those more advanced pieces of equipment would be helpful. The design component to the projects is important to understand fabrication in context with design (because this is a university and not a vo-tech), but some processes are so complex that it\u0092s important to learn them start-to-finish before you can integrate them with design properly.",
    "Fewer design crits more in class computer question answer sessions.",
    "This is an incredibly important course, but because of its scope is only the quickest and most glancing introduction to rendering, parametric design, and digital fabrication. I wouldn't suggest many alterations in this course itself, but rather the introduction of follow-up electives. Although I realize that most learning, software included, is done by self-motivated study with help from others, Yale does need some straight-up, nuts-and-bolts Maya, scripting, or rendering\/visualization courses to produce students that can compete at top firms with graduates from more technical schools. For post-pros especially, who have worked in the field and taken up to 10 design studios, grad school should be an opportunity to delve deeply and with focus into certain ways of working, filling in technical blank spots along the way.There was no field trip this year; John had tried to organize one to a boatyard, but it fell through. One or more field trips would be extremely helpful to the course aims. Fabrication is not a uni-directional endeavor; it's about the relationship, interplay, and back-and forth between computer drawing and production tools and methods. The only way to learn this is to spend some time away from the computer in the shop, fab lab, foundry etc, to see how machines work, behave, and treat materials.",
    "course divided into different parts (taking into account the knowledge of people coming in) One project is sufficient to explore all the themes of the course. (2 projects dilute and reduce ability to develop a more complete project)",
    "I think that such an important course should last at least 2 semesters.Thanks to Professor Eberhart who agreed to consult me in future, but without him it would be extremely difficult to learn everything on my own.Therefore, I really think that extending the course to two semesters would give students opportunity to learn all the tools they need in the future practice.The time was extremely limited, but I appreciate Professor's effort in giving his personal time on the Thanksgiving week to lead the Revit seminar with us.Thanks to the School for this invaluable course.",
    "Though the two projects in class were both interesting and valuable exercises in testing ideas, the workload was equivalent to a class with double the credits. The comments from the panel for the final project all focused on the fact that though the work was good, it seemed much more like a midterm review than a final. This is because of the sequencing of the semester and the short amount of time given to produce a project which required more time, effort and concentration than it was allotted.The first half of the semester should have dealt with a number of smaller exercises or tasks which were not as big as the Starbucks competition. The class tried to deal with too much in too short a time period.",
    "I had two major criticisms of the course.The first involved the initial Starbucks project. While the workload was extensive, the main idea of the project was fascinating and interesting. My group was more than willing to work hard to get nice results. We were told later on in the project that we could get supplies from Starbucks for the 1:1 scale fabrication of our idea. When we approached the gentleman from Starbucks, he told us they could actually not get us any supplies forcing us to scramble at the last minute. I also have an issue with the class working for Starbucks for no compensation (not even a free cup of coffee) and an even larger problem with those selected being asked to fabricate their design for no compensation (fiscally or otherwise). This sets the type of precedent in architecture preventing designers from being fairly compensated for this skills.While the criticism of the first project is fairly minor, My major criticism occurred at the final review. For the second project, we were asked to parametrically come up with a panelization system for a pavilion on the New Haven Green. Both the pavilion idea and the site were fairly abstract and just served as an object to test the software and fabrication tools. After having a very successful midterm review with Eberhart and one other reviewer, we continued to the second stage of the project where Eberhart asked us to actually fabricated two or more panels. My partner and I did just this fabricating the system based off of our mid-term review. However, at the final review, the large panel of over 8 jurors criticized our overall structure. While I can completely accept positive, negative and constructive criticism I thought it was absurd that John failed to step in and inform the reviewers that the point of the assignment was not the entire structure of the system. In fact, over the course of two additional desk-crits, Eberhart encouraged us to not take the project two far aneven said we could spray-paint cardboard instead of using the actual material. The structure-focused reviews continued to be the case for each of the groups that followed. My partner and I actually only finished 10 of our 18 slides preventing us from getting any feedback on the detail and idea we developed.It is fine to have a full design review, but if this is the case the class should be more than 3 credits of our time and the assignments should be presented as such. Having such huge demands for such a small class prevented us from getting any feedback from which to work from and left a bad taste in my mouth as well as the rest of the class.",
    "I would suggest that the school hire a younger instructor with more intimate knowledge of the programs to be taught. Furthermore, the class should concentrate on one or two programs\u0097Rhino and Grasshopper, say\u0097and totally omit the one-class \u0093intro\u0094 of Generative Components and the (cancelled) fieldtrip to Goetz boats. The frequency of requests for out of class assistance is a sign that what should have been taught IN class was not being taught during that time.Why equip the school with the most cutting-edge, expensive software and fabrication equipment only to hire an ill-equipped instructor to implement its usage?",
    "It would have been very nice if we would have had one project for the semester instead of two. It would have also been very nice to work in larger groups. Fabrication takes a lot of planning and effort, and I believe that larger teams would have been able to deliver much more satisfying products of research.The load of the course has been a little too great. As Post Professional students, we were part of a very serious and engaging architecture studio project; the Fabrication class felt sometimes more like another advanced studio. Perhaps it would be beneficent for this course to take on certain aspects of the architecture studio project and elaborate them in the fabrication curriculum.",
    "This course should be an elective and if it remains as mandatory, the school should seeks to integrate more with the Post Pro studio agenda.",
    "Here are my suggestions:1\/ divide up the class into strata of knowledge on the subject2\/ determine teams by combining different levels of expertise3\/ treat the course as an exercise in fabrication and not a design studioIf assignments were less design-oriented and more problem-solving in scope, I believe I would have learned more.It would have also been more beneficial if more class time was spent in the shop."
