   "comments": [
    "I will highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Chinese philosophy and ancient Chinese history. Proficiency in classical Chinese and Mandarin Chinese is a must. Some remote knowledge about the history of the Warring States period in Chinese history will definitely help. Also one learns a lot about writing through the course; it really trains you to write concisely and logically, with elegance and precision.",
    "Absolutely - I would recommend it both for both beginners and more experienced scholars of Chinese thought. There would be something for everyone, and the papers are a great challenge.",
    "It is an intensive reading course on the main text and commentaries of three early Chinese philosophers. Allows students to engage deeply with the original text, as well as the collected commentaries of later scholars. Be prepared to put in the hours, as the readings can be very difficult to grasp at first."

   "comments": [
    "It helps me to get a fuller picture of ancient Chinese history and Chinese thought. The things I've learned in this class speak to the eternal ethical issues mankind has been struggling with in the whole world. The ideas of Mencius, Xunzi and Zhuangzi really have a global applicability. It deepens one's understanding of history, of continuity of ideas, of time and place, and of the universality of humanity.",
    "Quite simply, I will look upon the Chinese past very differently now that I have dipped my toe in the water beyond Confucius himself. I hope this will be the start of a serious engagement with Chinese intellectual history. I'm not sure what the precise impact will be for my research, but I am already reading about late nineteenth and early twentieth century China through slightly different eyes.",
    "It gave me a good foundation\/background in some major texts from the Chinese classics, which, although not directly related to my field of specialization, is an important foundation to have nonetheless for students working on any aspect of East Asian history.Through working on my final paper, I was able to review the historiography of a key time period which relates to my dissertation project."
