    "I learned all about the basics of chemistry, and how they apply to everyday life through cooking.",
    "By taking this course, I gained knowledge regarding the fundamentals of Chemistry and further insight into how it relates to food and cooking.",
    "I learned how we can use chemistry to understand and improve cooking.",
    "- An understanding of some basic chemical principles and processes",
    "I learned how to connect chemistry concepts to how they show themselves in cooking techniques and food composition. In many ways this was a basic chemistry course that was lightened by not needing to know much in-depth, vast knowledge -- it focused the chemistry on basic concepts that could be related to food.",
    "It was a nice refresher of chemistry and even broader general science concepts I hadn't really dealt with since high school at all, and a deeper investigation into the parts that were most closely associated with cooking. As someone who enjoys making food, the class was the perfect science credit in that it was at an appropriate level of difficulty and depth, but also relevant to the topic at hand. I've already incorporated takeaways from this course into my cooking, and learned some great simple recipes along the way.",
    "The class is more or less a standard chemistry class that every once in a while uses food and cooking as an example."

   "comments": [
    "This course does provide a helpful learning environment for non-science majors. It was relaxed, yet I learned a lot. I would have liked for more consistency in how the material was taught. In certain units, we would be presented one topic, study it, and then get tested on that topic in a different form. That did not seem fair.",
    "Strengths: This course is especially well designed for non-STEM majors and does a phenomenal job at catering to the needs and skills of people without an extensive science background. Weaknesses: The lectures were occasionally dry and the pop quizzes were rather disorganized. There were also times where the homework solutions did not match up with the lecture slides.",
    "The course was disorganized at times, particularly with regard to assignments. Expectations and grading was often very unclear.",
    "It is a fun class, you learn interesting things, and it requires a low level of engagement. However, there are many assignments involved, tests, quizzes, projects, which may be tedious but honestly not hard at all.",
    "This is a great course! I really liked the different assignments such as the cooking demonstration, the problem sets, and the quizzes. It works much better than other science courses centered around exams.",
    "- I thought that the sections were great at helping us understand the questions in our homework, but I thought that Prof. Yan tried to cover too much ground in the lectures, so much so, that we were covering new material in the section instead of just reviewing. I also didn't feel that the lectures were presented in a very interesting or engaging manner.",
    "Strengths: Professor Yan tried really hard to engage students in this course, the cooking demonstrations were fun Weaknesses: most of this course's material was tangential at best to food or cooking. I learned very little about the chemical relavence of the topics learned to the culinary arts. The lectures were confusing and often disorganized. The grading system was VERY unclear and even when I received all positive comments, I received substandard grades without explanation. Grading protocol seemed haphazard and never was outlined clearly before assessment (especially for group projects, final presentation and final paper). Sections rarely related to content learned in lecture, yet students were expected to know both. There were no review sections for exams! Pop quizzes were erratic, unnecessarily stressful, and often irrelevant to the material learned in course. Plus they often didn't provide time for students to review and retain material.",
    "The course's strength was that its content appealed to the students' minimal interest in chemistry and greater interest in food. There wasn't much time spent on difficult chemistry concepts, and many of the classes were spent doing cooking demonstrations or talking about how the chemistry related to food. The weakness of the course was that the lectures didn't quite find the right balance between being too focused on chemistry and not rigorously scientific. When food was discussed in the lectures, it felt too easy.",
    "Its biggest strength is how unique it is as an accessible chemistry course that has actually practical value, which isn't something that can be said for a lot of other courses out there for non-science majors. The group cooking demonstration project was an effective way for students to directly engage with the material that was novel and fun to watch as a spectator as well. I feel the course would work better in a smaller classroom when it's just a standard lecture as the lecture hall that we were in was much too large, and people at the back were basically checked out."

   "comments": [
    "If you need a science credit, then take this course. It won't be the most exciting course ever, but it does its job in a relaxed environment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, particularly those with a limited background in science. As a non-STEM major, I was hesitant about finding the right science credit that would be intellectually stimulating yet not overly challenging. This course definitely fulfills both; it's covers the essentials in a manner appropriately tailored to my skill sets without dumbing information down. There are multiple ways in which this class caters to non-STEM majors i.e. a generous curve, dropping one of three non-cumulative exams, etc. In terms of workload, there are no required readings and the bi-weekly problem sets are relatively simple. The material is not boring if you're interested in the fundamentals of Chemistry and how it relates to food and cooking -- a topic that is incorporated rather well through lecture, section, homework, and group food demonstrations. The food demonstration might deter some, but they are not bad at all. Professor Yan and Ying Ying are both incredibly generous with their grading and always willing to help. I strongly recommend this course if you are looking for a fairly simple yet exciting science credit.",
    "Not a great class - not very hard, but pretty disorganized. If Professor Yan were more clear with expectations for assignments and managed to incorporate food into the chemistry we learned in a more organized fashion, it could have been a lot better. As it was, it seemed like a basic chemistry class that tried to mention food\/cooking a few times per class.",
    "This is an easy Sc credit, so yes. The material is not very exciting, but it is easy and applicable to cooking, which makes it fun.",
    "Take it! Great way to get a science credit. Many different assignments worth small percentages of your grade so it's not all riding on a couple of tests. Fairly straightforward, good section for clarifying concepts, fun cooking demonstrations. Highly recommend if you are interested in cooking and how chemistry plays into cooking and baking.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Despite the sincere efforts of Professor Yan, a good prof whose time is being wasted here, it is a terrible casualty of Yale's annoying distributional requirement system. It is mostly a basic chemistry class with some applications to cooking, and is far more work than it appears at first (for a non-science major obviously). It is neither easy enough to be a worthwhile gut nor in-depth enough to be an interesting science.",
    "I think I would not. There was not enough feedback throughout the semester, and, as I mentioned before, the lectures were not very engaging.",
    "The course seems cooler and more interesting than it is. If you take it, understand that it will have little relevance to food or cooking, and will probably be incredibly stressful because the class is poorly taught and the expectations for grading are very unclear. I'm honestly still unsure at the end of the course what sort of grade I'll receive--it could be my best at yale, but it's also very likely it will be my worst. Yale really should do a better job developing science credits for non-science majors. This was my best option, and also by far my worst course at yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to a senior who likes science but wants an easy science credit. You need to have some chemistry savvy to do well in the course, because some of the problem sets can have difficult elements to them. But the workload is incredibly light -- drop 1 of 3 exams, no cumulative final, a 3-page paper, a group cooking demonstration, etc. It's a good 5th class to be tangentially clued into and interested in what's going on.",
    "Yes! Most definitely take it if you're looking for a rewarding science credit as a non-science major.",
    "Professor Yan is a beauty."
