    "Good way to get credit for doing research. Your experience depends on your lab\/PI\/postdoc\/grad student you're working under.You'll end up putting in more than 10 hours a week. Don't take this as an extra class on top of a 4.5 or 5 credit schedule. Make sure you have blocks of time that you can spend at lab (its hard to take 471 alongside a lab that meets 2x a week, for example).Professor Garen is cool, offered to read a draft of my paper before I submitted a final version, and I didn't even ask him!",
    "If you have the time to spend on this class, then take it. The final paper is quite a pain though.",
    "If you enjoy research, of course take this class. It is better than working in a lab informally, since it keeps your thinking more rigorous and incidentally improves your scientific writing a good bit.",
    "It's just research for credit - your experience with this course will entirely depend on which lab you work with and your supervisors in that lab. The actual work required for the class itself is minimal - a short project proposal at the beginning of the semester, and a final paper and lab meeting. It can be frustrating that it's hard to get significant results to actually write up in a paper in one term, but other than that it's a good course.",
    "Its a great way to do research during the summer and get something for it, but be warned that getting much accomplished typically requires more than 10 hours a week.",
    "This course is pretty much what you make of it. The harder you work, the more you learn. That doesn't guarantee results for your research project, but that's not the point here. The point is to experience real lab work hands-on. Take the 2-credit variety if you can--you really ought to spend that much time in lab anyway, and it lightens you outside course load."
