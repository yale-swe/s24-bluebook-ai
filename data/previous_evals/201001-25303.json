    "If you are trying to brush up on your spanish but aren't looking for anything too tough, this is the class for you. There are a lot of problems with this class, such as the fact that it doesn't review grammar and there is too much emphasis on reading comprehension instead of talking.",
    "I think that unless your spanish REALLY needs improvement, you should take one of the specialized spanish classes. Apparently the ones that are more ISSUE based are not THAT demanding (even though they may seem intimidating at first). This course did not really improve my spanish, which was too bad, but it was nice to do light reading and talk about it. The professor really makes or breaks this course, and Barbara Safille is INCREDIBLE.",
    "Conversational spanish is a great way to improve your speaking skills, it's a fun class, not too much work, definitely worth it.",
    "Yes I would if you want to improve your Spanish and take a class that isn't ridiculously difficult.",
    "It's a good class for speaking but it is very rigid in its requirements and uniform across classes"
