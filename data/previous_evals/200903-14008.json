    "Awesome class led by students. I learned a lot. At time, because the class was led by students, some of the concepts discussed were not as concrete as they could have been had there been a little more structure.",
    "I liked the format of the course. The reading was informative and creative, the speakers were interesting, and I really enjoyed participating in the sessions.",
    "Overall, this course was excellent. We had some great discussions in class on a variety of topics related to aging in addition to a nice mixture of guest speakers. The class really helps students examine the process of aging and the different stages of life. Each student, in partnership with another student, was in charge of the class one week and had the opportunity to lead the discussion. The readings were excellent and our response papers allowed us to interact with the readings.",
    "Very interesting class. I learned a lot from the readings and lectures. A good class to learn more about the aging population. Also, guest lecturers were also very interesting and offered great insight into aging from different fields (policy, clinical, etc).",
    "Prof. Levy is a great instructor, but in some classes she let the students do too much of the teaching; her insights would have been appreciated. Maybe she should provide an overview or wrap-up in addition to the student-led part?Also, maybe restrict enrollment. The class seemed a little too big at times.",
    "Great class! Great discussion.Material was broad and interesting.",
    "This is a great class that is heavily discussion and reading based. The topics covered are very broad and encompassing of many different issues surrounding aging and the elderly population. The instructor is very helpful and you learn a great deal in this course.",
    "When I was trying to figure out my schedule, I knew I needed another course, so I went to the first day just to shop it. I didn't particularly want to take it, as I've never been interested in aging, and after looking at the syllabus, I really worried that it was going to be extremely depressing and hard for me to handle. But I ended up going the second week, and it ended up falling into my schedule.In the end, though, I am SO GLAD that I took this course. It really wasn't depressing at all. I learned a lot about a subject I knew nothing about, and now knowing what the aging distribution of our populations will look like within the next 20 or 30 years, it's information that I am so glad I now know! I appreciated the seminar-style -- it kept us involved, forced us to do the reading (this is not a bad thing), etc. It was by far the most dynamic class I have had in my time at YSPH.Of the three speakers: the one who presented the driving research was a dynamic lecturer, but it wasn't enough material for an entire class. Too specific. I reallydid NOT like the woman who lectured about diabetes -- I felt she talked down to us and frankly, I learned absolutely nothing. I LOVED Mark Schlessinger's class -- I appreciate Mark much more having a class with him here and there rather than an entire semester.",
    "I particularly liked that this course engaged students heavily. Though I would have appreciated more of Dr. Levy's insights, particularly in classes where she would be considered an expert in the field, I felt that she urged us to consider the material in new and creative ways. I also liked her inclusion of guest speakers for a few of the lectures, because it changed up the flow of the class and allowed us to review the material from a different perspective.",
    "strengths - great discussions and very thoughtful readings.weaknesses - It only met once a week, which meant that missing a class was very burdensome."

    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Awesome",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy asks good questions, structured the class well, and was very responsive in class and outside. She did a wonderful job.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Excellent. I really enjoyed the course and wouldn't change anything.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy really cares about her students and truly desires for them to interact with the course material, share from their own experiences, and develop skills in leading class discussions. She added to the class discussions from her research and experiences.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Becca is a great professor. She is very approachable and knowledgeable in this area.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Kindly see above.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Wonderful! Professor Levy was so receptive and helpful. She met with me several times over the course of the semester and was just so genuinely interested in making the class a better experience for all of us. It was a great introduction to public health seminars at the graduate school.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0The instructor is very helpful, tremendously bright, and it is great to hear about her research directly in the class. The readings she has chosen for the class are appropriate and interesting and really stimulate great class discussions. She is very willing and available to meet outside of class and stimulate the class with a variety of subjects and activities.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy is obviously one of the top aging experts in the country. That intimidated me a bit (and still kind of does, knowing that she's reading my final paper right now!), but she's very nice and easy to talk with about class material. I also appreciated the fact that she really could have put a ton of her articles on the syllabus, and she didn't. The papers she wrote were all central to whatever the theme of the week was. Definitely no problems there AT ALL -- which is great, since so many professors in general now like to write the textbook for their class.I do wish, however, that she participated more in class. It's great that she turned it over to us, but during our last seminar class (on death and dying; the last class before presentations), she contributed some questions while still letting Sean and Melody lead. This was the only week that she did have some input, and it was great. She was a bit of a micro-manager in terms of preparing us to lead class for our respective weeks -- so I think in the future, it'd be nice to ease up a bit on that but also throw some questions out there as the discussion calls for it.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy really cares about students, as demonstrated by her thoughtful and complete feedback to each of our response papers, research proposals, and paper drafts. I would only recommend that she contribute a little more of her research experience particularly in early lectures when many of us are not familiar with the field. Otherwise I felt she did a great job encouraging our independence and thoughtful discussion of the material.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0strengths - always very thoughtful with her feedbackweaknesses - I would've liked to have received more feedback on specifically how to improve my work."

   "comments": [
    "This class covers issues related to aging and health in a safe environment. I think it was awesome to explore a topic that often goes without discussion in most classes.",
    "I'd recommend this class to a student who is interested in aging. If s\/he does her\/his readings regularly and participates in the discussions, s\/he could learn a great deal. The readings include studies that take novel views on elements of aging and some out of the box perspectives as well.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It was excellent. It is very dependent on the students in the class since it is a seminar course and consists almost entirely of discussion. I enjoyed hearing other student's perspectives.",
    "This is a great course to become familiar with the topics in aging.",
    "We examined the social, cultural, psychological, and biological contributors to the aging process.Yes; Dr. Levy is a great instructor and the readings are interesting.",
    "This is a great course to understand many of the issues and research surrounding health and aging. The course is heavily discussion based and there is a great deal of reading for each class. It is a really fun course with challenging assignments.",
    "This is a seminar-style class. If you're not prepared to do the readings every week, keep track of how many response papers you've turned in, and stay ahead of the game with your final paper, don't take it. If you don't like class participation, and plan to stay silent all semester, consider something else. It's pretty easy to get away with staying quiet for a class here or there, but definitely NOT the entire semester.If you think you're not interested in aging, keep an open mind. This class is extremely diverse in topics. And if anything, you've gotta learn about the elderly population. They are going to be a huge percentage of our society.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. The material is relevant regardless of whether the student plans to work with older populations or not. It is particularly interesting for students in social and behavioral sciences, but could be relevant for students from any field.",
    "I would recommend it."
