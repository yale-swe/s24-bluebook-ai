    "Very lab-based, but the labs are pretty easy to catch on to.",
    "yes yes yes yes yes - take it. you do actually have to read the papers, though, so don't let anyone tell you otherwise.",
    "This was a great class to take as one of my E&EB electives. There was a cap on it this year, which meant that if you weren't a junior or senior you didn't get in; however I appreciated that there was a preference for E&EB majors. Each class was composed of two components: a presentation on the topic followed by a lab period. The readings could be a bit dense at times, but the discussion each week helped to make the subject more approachable. In addition, Professor Sargis is a great professor and I would highly recommend taking this class.",
    "Great class for non-science majors. Engaging, relevant, and Sargis a gem",
    "Yes--take it if you can get in. Professor Sargis is great. May be a little advanced if you don't have background in the subject but not so much so that you get completely lost. It's great to have lab every week and get to actually see the physical variation in specimens rather than just reading about it in a textbook. Honestly this course isn't too much work and let's be honest if you aren't specializing in the subject matter you will probably forget most of the specifics you learn within a year, but Professor Sargis also emphasizes the importance critiquing the analytical frameworks that the authors of the papers we read in class used to come to their conclusions (i.e. the authors excluded a lot of characters from this data set, maybe they were cherry-picking), something that will probably stay with you longer and I thought was really cool.",
    "Great course. The papers you read are very interesting and relevant to the lab portion.",
    "Cool labs and interesting subject! Professor Sargis can be dismissive if you are a beginner."
