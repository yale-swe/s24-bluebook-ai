    "Wonderful seminar for anyone who is interested in critically engaging with Nothing(s), as it has emerged alongside Western philosophical and literary history. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in these questions.",
    "A course on the idea of Nothing in western history of philosophy. Some of the texts are very, very challenging. And like its title, you might very possibly feel you got nothing out of it at the end of the semester. But take this course nevertheless, just for the sake of getting to know prof. North and start thinking about nothing in different ways, if you are interested in fundamental philosophical questions."
