    "Theory wasn't fun enough for Yale, so they made Musi 211.",
    "I would only take this class if you a interested in a very specific time period of classical music theory. The scope of music felt way too narrow.",
    "I found this course very interesting \u0096 I was intending on saving it for next semester, but after shopping I was very intrigued and wanted to take it right away. The material is, in my opinion, more expansive and more interesting than that covered in previous theory, and you learn much more sophisticated aspects of musical structure (on microscopic and macroscopic levels). I'm a bit of a music nerd, but this was definitely one of my favorite classes this term. I nearly always enjoyed the assignments, and Jonathan brought enough enthusiasm to teaching the class to make everyone excited about the material.Relative to other major prereq classes, this is not bad at all.",
    "Music 211 is a course in musical\/harmonic concepts and techniques used in the late classical and early romantic periods (we start with Beethoven and move on to Wagner and Chopin). It integrates listening to real music and looking at scores with learning about particular theoretical concepts, and it does so very well. Students have to complete a model composition of a lied as well asa final project (an essay or a composition). It's an extremely enjoyable class - one of the few classes that doesn't feel like a struggle all the way through, but leaves you feeling like you've learned a lot at the end. I loved the course.",
    "MUSI 211 is a really applications-based class, which is great because we didn't often talk about obscure theoretical concepts in the abstract, but instead spent a lot of time actuually listening to music. I felt like I learned a lot in this class, and enjoyed the experience even though I'm not a huge music theory person. Be prepared to spend a few hours on the homework, but the graded work for this class is generally manageable.",
    "Music 211 is for the student who wants to dig deeper into the harmonic vocabulary of 19th century music. of course, it's also a pre-req for the music major. :)",
    "Take it, it's a great class. And not too much work either (in my opinion). Try to take it with Jonathan - he really is a fantastic teacher. I've heard McCreless is good too, but I can assure you Jonathan is great!",
    "If you're taking this after 210, 211 has more complex material and more broad concepts but I loved all the music and topics we covered. The hw was often challenging and took some time, but help was always available if you needed it. The structure of the class was very organized and easy to follow, and the expectations for the week were always clear. This was one of my favorite classes this semester."
