    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Most fun and most i've learned in any EAST class.",
    "YES because the material is fascinating. Your readings will make you go WOW. Who knew the history of beef-eating in Japan had its roots in social Darwinism? Who knew that the Qing Dynasty employed extremely effective famine relief measures?But, if you're looking for an excellent seminar experience, I would look elsewhere. This was my first seminar, so I'm not sure how they work in general, but the seminar experience was OK. Every week different groups would present on the readings and then we would discuss them, except I got the feeling that most ppl didn't do their readings and so the discussions weren't that great.",
    "Yes, especially for history majors looking for a class on a subject that is not typically taught.",
    "Good class that demonstrates food containing historical significance in Asian cultures. Really makes you see food in a new light. The major assignments are geared towards the final paper and you have to do weekly reading responses. Good ROW seminar to take if you can get in.",
    "Yes, absolutely, especially if you love sushi, kimchi, dim sum, beef noodles.. and the likes of those. A great introduction to the discipline of food studies in itself, ranging from historical to contemporary topics, on the social, political, economic, national, intranational and international aspects of food. The two compulsory source notes will help you to ensure that research and progress on your term paper is consistent throughout the term, which sounds annoying at first, but proves to be really really helpful at the end for consolidation and providing a kickstart for your word count of zero, when you realise you have 3 or 4 term papers to work on that are due within days of each other.",
    "Yes, this was a great course for anyone who's interesting in East Asian history or food studies.",
    "Take it if you love Japan.",
    "This clas is not a gut it is filled with intense Asian girls. So beware",
    "Good but not a coherent class"
