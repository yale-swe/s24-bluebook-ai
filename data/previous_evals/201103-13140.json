    "Brilliant course. Blight is one of the all-time greats, the material is constantly fascinating, and the readings are excellent. Huge amount of reading, but do as much as possible - it's well worth your while. Two papers and a final exam.",
    "Absolutely take this class. I know lots take it Cr\/D\/Fail, but even if you do make sure to do the reading (not because you have to, but because it's incredibly interesting) and go to the classes. Blight is one of the best lecturers I've ever had and the class was by far my favorite so far. I was actually always excited to go in the mornings! The work load isn't too much and the papers are very fair. The final is a lot to cover, but the readings do a very good job of explaining everything.",
    "Take this course if you have way too much time on your hands-- the reading will keep you occupied. the essays arent too bad though.",
    "Take it. Take it now. Be prepared to reconsider what it means to be American, and more broadly, be exposed to the humanity of history. My god, what an amazing coure. I would take it a hundred times if I could. As a first semester freshman, a good history course to take in the sense that the papers weren't too stressful and fairly graded, but I wish I could retake it later in my career; I feel like I would get more out of it then. Lots and lots of reading, but much of it could probably be skimmed. I did about 95% of it, which was definitely unnecessary and totally stressful. Blight is amazing. When he whips out quotes from Moby Dick or Emerson you're just left in awe. He does lose steam by the end of the semester, but great course. One I would recommend to everyone.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone and everyone. The civil warera is such an important time in US history, and this class really made me understand the social and political complexities of the conflict. (This class is very light on military history, which was a huge plus for me. However, someone looking for a class on detailed battle strategy of the Civil War will be disappointed).",
    "Absolutely take it",
    "God, yes--everyone should take this. Just amazing. The Civil War is, of course, fascinating and fun, and David Blight is one of the best lecturers at Yale. He quotes Melville and Whitman regularly. He has appropriate reverence for books and beauty. He lets no facts escape scrutiny. He does a great Southern accent. And the readings are great, though there are a lot of them. The stuff in this class is important, and I can't imagine a better way to learn it. I'm very sad the class is over. I would keep going every day for the next five years if I could, even though the class is early in the morning.",
    "Definitely a Yale class to take. The lectures are amazing. There is a lot to know for the final and a ton of reading.",
    "Yes. Great American history class.",
    "This is an incredible class--you've got to take it.",
    "Civil War should be renamed Story Time with David Blight. His lectures are captivating. Also the reading is (mostly) engaging. I loved the class. Go ahead and take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone at Yale. It is AWESOME. One of my favorite classes ever.",
    "sure",
    "Do not take this class if you have taken US history in high school, or middle school for that matter. Also, this class is singularly social history, and fails to delve into military or political history. Too broad of an overview to learn much new material, and the reading list was way too long! The essay topics are also incredibly large, and cannot be narrowed very easily into five pages. Books have been written on the same prompts we are given. If you do take the class though, take it with Andy Horowitz. Best TA I've had at Yale!",
    "Civil War was very highly recommended to me by people who had taken the course previously. I was pretty underwhelmed. Although it is in part my fault for not putting enough time into the course, I thought there was an unnecessary amount of reading, to the point where most people in the class seemed to be doing nowhere close to the majority of it. I had heard Blight was a superb lecturer, and though he was fun to listen to, he mostly gave an anecdotal, broad brushstrokes version of the material.",
    "Highly recommended! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Be prepared for a lot of reading though (but it's all interesting).",
    "Great survey course on Civil and Reconstruction history. Starting with antebellum America, specifically after the Mexican war, the course makes its way through the war and reconstruction years also addressing the legacy of the Civil War today. The readings are interesting but their are a lot of them. Their are two papers and a final. Overall a great course.",
    "Keep up with your readings, and you should be fine.",
    "YES!!!! TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! Its awesome!! Even if your not necessarily interested, professor blight will open your mind. I heard from various people that because of this class they were becoming history majors. If you like or love studying the Civil War and Reconstruction take this class!! Even if you think you know everything the lectures are worth it alone!!!! ITS AWESOMEEEE!!!!!!",
    "Civil War is a survey course that covers from about 1846 or so until 1876 or so. Even if you took AP U.S. History and think you know what you need to know about the Civil War, I would say definitely take this class, whether or not you are a History major. Professor Blight is an amazing lecturer, the teaching assistants are great, and it's a very well-run class.",
    "I would recommend it, though be prepared to do a lot of reading. While the readings are not necessarily imperative to do well on an exam, they greatly add to the depth of the class.",
    "Civil War and Reconstruction and yes I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "It's great. Take it.",
    "A really interesting class--section is especially fun. Grading of the papers was a bit tougher than anticipated, but that probably varies by TF. There is a lot of reading, but it isn't at all necessary to do all of it. Overall great class that is worth taking.",
    "YES. take. interesting not too hard and Blight is great.",
    "Take it if you have ever been at all interested in the Civil War. Blight is a great lecturer... make sure you are paying attention so you can get his jokes! There are often awesome TA's for this class, so make sure you find one of them. With that said, its a pretty standard history courseload but I really enjoyed this class without being a history major. If you're looking for a good history class, take this!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who thinks they have a great understanding of the civil war. While there are a large amount of readings, do not let that deter you from experiencing this course.",
    "Yes, it you're interested in american history its a must take yale course.",
    "I recommend this class for Yankees who didn't go to high school. The lectures are filled with liberal propaganda and utterly devoid of historical facts. You can learn more facts about the Civil War from an AP US History review book, and more about the historical debates about the Civil War (which, despite Blight's assurances to the contrary, do exist) from just the reading list.",
    "This course should be titled \u0093David Blight reads from his favorite Civil War books.\u0094 Seriously, that\u0092s what the lectures basically are. Blight\u0092s a marvelous speaker\u0097he\u0092ll remind you more than a little of Abe Lincoln. And this course is great if you want to know how the Civil War has been interpreted over the years in American memory. But it assumes some knowledge of the facts of the war coming in. That wasn\u0092t a problem for me having taken AP US history, but if you know absolutely nothing about what happened in the Civil War, this isn\u0092t the place to learn it. Think of it as a class that takes an already fascinating subject, and makes it more fascinating, not a survey of Grand and Lee\u0092s battle plans.",
    "Great course- lectures are always good. ridiculous reading, but you don't really have to do it all",
    "Yeah take it, history major or not. one of those yale course you just sorta have to take",
    "This is definitely not a gut. There is a lot of work that you need to put into this class, but Blight and the TFs make it really interesting, so it's worth it.",
    "Excellent course - highly recommended.",
    "This is a very basic covering of the Civil War and Reconstruction and it is fantastic. Seriously if you have any interest in this time period take it. Or really just take any class with Blight.",
    "This is a good class, but doesn't fully live up to the high expectations. The reading is immense but you don't need to do any of it to succeed on the final exam. The TA's are on the whole amazing, but depending on who you end up with will determine your grade for the course. A student can get an A or a B depending entirely on who is grading their paper, and not at all on how hard they work in the class.",
    "This is a general overview of the Civil War and Reconstruction. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Very informative, not too stressful.",
    "The Civil War and Reconstruction. The course also focuses on the legacy of the Civil War and how people remember it.",
    "The Civil War is the most important subject in our nation's history. Blight is a good lecturer, and he does a good job covering the different aspects of the war (social, political, and legal). My only complaints are that we didn't spend enough time on the military history of the war and Blight definitely takes a Northern perspective",
    "An amazing survey of the Civil War. You will LEARN from this course.",
    "Great lecture course. Read as much as you can. The readings are all interesting. Blight is a great lecturer.",
    "This course is great for anyone who has a minimal knowledge of the Civil War and Reconstruction era., and interesting for those who have a base but want to learn the social history aspects. Shouldn't graduate without it if you aren't a history major.",
    "I would recommend if you are interested in American history",
    "Great course, definitely take it",
    "great class, take it",
    "Without a doubt. A fascinating subject, with great course reading, and the best lecturer at Yale.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to those who want to know more about the Civil War and want to do some reading",
    "Take it if you'd like to learn a little bit about the Civil War, or even as a fifth class. It's a fun class, and Blight is entertaining. But it is not the deepest class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Interesting course although Blight mumbles a lot so I found lecture a bit annoying to follow. Reading can be a bit much sometimes but obviously you don't need to do it all. If you already know a lot about the civil war it may not be worth taking, but still Blught does manage to provide a fresh perspective on some aspects of the war.",
    "This class covers in detail the causes, progression, and consequences of the Civil War. It is much stronger as a political and social history class than a military history class. Blight is a really engaging and inspiring lecturer but sometimes dwells on primary sources or historical memory issues at the expense of more concrete discussion, which was frustrating at times. There is a fair amount of work but the readings are wonderful. Try to get Brian Jordan as your TF.",
    "A survey course of the Civil War. A good course, at one point a lot of reading that becomes impossible to accomplish, but still very worthwhile. The course has changed the way I view emancipation and its legacy. Blight is a wonderful man who cares deeply about what he teaches.",
    "I guess you should take it if you are especially interested in the period. Some people love it, but I found it a little boring. I didn't gain a lot from it and I pretty much stuck to the bare facts for the exams. It does have some pretty passionate fellows and Blight seems very nice. Unless they revamp the course, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Yup, it's a Yale classic, and for good reason - Blight is a fantastic lecturer and the Civil War is a fascinating period in American history. Before going in, I'd advise a potential Civil Warrior a couple things: 1) it's a LOT of reading. And unless you read at superhuman speed or don't do extracurricular activities or sleep, you won't have time to do it all. If not being able to get all the reading done for a class bothers you, be aware this class might make you frustrated. 2) it is very much a \"social history\" class, not a class where David Blight tells you all the events in chronological order start to finish. There are a few central themes he will refer to, lecture after lecture - KNOW THOSE, but also don't forget the facts for the final exam. 3) Make sure you get a good T.A. - although, as far as I know Civil War always has amazing ones.Overall, though, I'm so glad I took Civil War - it's really one of those courses people come to Yale for.",
    "A history lecture with a legendary professor, too much reading, and hit-or-miss sections. David Blight is a god (listen to his voice just once, and you'll have to agree). His lectures are a pleasure to listen to.That being said, the course can be frustrating for two reasons: one, there's too much reading, as much as 800 pages plus 4 hours of film in some weeks. And two, the sections are uneven. I had a pathetic section that made me resent the course; anybody with Brian Jordan loved every moment of it, so try and get him as your TF if he sticks with the class in future years.",
    "I'd recommend this class on its subject matter alone--I quickly came to realize how foundational the Civil War and Reconstruction eras were, and how much they still matter today (and I say that as a non-history obsessed person). Prof. Blight is good, but make sure you're okay with lectures that don't involve easy-to-follow Powerpoints. A lot of reading, but not a bad workload: two short papers and a final. My TA was fantastic but I have no idea what the others were like.",
    "Skip it - there are much better history classes at Yale. Find other Civil War offerings.",
    "This is an American history course based on primary and secondary sources, including films, novels, and histograp\/hies. It explores the causes, course, and consequences of the Civil War (there's the crux of the final exam!). Lectures are colorful and entertaining. Section is surprisingly helpful. If you want to know all about the Civil War and its relationship to the trajectory of American history, then this course is perfect for you!",
    "Fantastic history course! Take if you have any interest at all in US history or slave history.",
    "Take it. Great course. One of those must takes, I think. Blight is a fantastic lecturer who makes the era come to life. He's just tremendous.",
    "Imagine how any civil war class would be taught. You learn about the causes, course, and consequences of the war. You probably won't learn that much. I would recommend it for non - history majors. History majors should just be prepared not to be wowed.",
    "History 119 is an in-depth analysis of antebellum, Civil War, and reconstruction U.S. history which focuses on the ideological conflicts leading up the the war. I would recommend the course to any student, regardless of one's major, because it provides a careful examination of human nature and morality.",
    "Yep. Great class. More work\/reading than a normal class though.",
    "Survey course of the Civil War and Reconstruction. A class to be taken before graduating Yale. Blight is a great lecturer, the reading list is good (if too extensive), and especially if you get Brian Jordan as a TA you're sure to learn a lot.",
    "Take this class, it's an important subject.",
    "Great class for anyone interested in American history. Quite a bit of reading, but a lot of people are able to get by without doing a lot of it. Essays and the final raised very interesting questions. Don't assume that this is a gut though: you will have to put in time if you want an A. Also, if you want to take a class with a fantastic professor who really embodies what you would expect from a professor in the movies, David Blight is your guy.",
    "This is the kind of class I came to Yale to take. I would enthusiastically recommend it to all Yale students.",
    "Yes, take this class! But be prepared for a lot of reading.",
    "Great class, but the lectures are used more to bring the material to life, using a humanities approach to the historical moment than to provide dense historical material. So readings are very necessary. Two papers are cartoonishly general and short--difficult for that reason.",
    "History 119 is a study of the Civil War, with a focus on its long and short-term causes and consequences. The class then goes into Reconstruction. It is not a class that really focuses on the military aspects of the war.",
    "This is a course that you shouldn't miss! Makes you care about the civil war and american history even if you didn't before! Lecture is like storytime, super entertaining and Prof. Blight is great. Take it!",
    "This is a great class in general. The readings and lectures are interesting, the papers aren't too onerous, and the subject is something that everyone should really understand well. Civil War made me realize just how important the war not only was, but still is.",
    "Great class. It's very interesting and the work isn't egregious. I would definitely recommend this for those looking to fulfill a humanities requirement.",
    "Take this class. Professor Blight assigns too much reading, but you don't actually have to do it. The essays, lectures, and final are all thought provoking, and the class does an excellent job of probing a well-known period of history in manners that are interesting even to those who are afficionados of the period.",
    "Yes, definitely take it!",
    "Did you take AP US History? Then you probably don't need to take this class. There's too much reading a week to actually do, and even though Blight is a great lecturer, ultimately there isn't that much more you're going to pick up from Civil War than what you learned in high school.",
    "History 119 studies the period between the end of the Mexican-American War and basically Rutherford B. Hayes' withdrawal of troops from the Reconstruction South in 1877. There is a lot of reading that gets very hard to keep up with, but I would still recommend it--this is a very important period of American History, Professor Blight is a delight, and from my experience and what I hear from other people, the TAs are all top notch.",
    "Legit class if you've got time.",
    "Yes. A must.",
    "Great course! Even if you not that interested in the Civil War or history has never been your \"thing\", Professor Blight does an excellent job making the material interesting. Moreover, he weaves the Civil War into a semester long story that is hard to put down.",
    "Great course outlining the causes, course, and consequences of one of the most important episodes of American History. Great professors and TA to top it all off. Reading heavy, but luckily the 2 papers and final are roughly equivalent so you have a few opportunities to salvage your grade.",
    "Without question. If you like history and are yearning for an inspirational history experience, you'll find it in this class. If the material Professor Blight speaks about so eloquently really touches you, it will motivate you to look at the Civil War in even more depth, or at least definitely motivate you to take more history classes = just so you can find an era that touches you as much as it seems to touch Professor Blight.",
    "I would recommend it to any student, even a non-History major because it was interesting, had incredible readings, and each lecture was worth going to.",
    "A very good and interesting class that I would recommend to anyone, whether a history major or not.",
    "This is a great class. You should definitely take it, since you get to learn about the Civil War, which is one of the defining moments of American history, and Reconstruction, which had legal, social, and political effects in the South even to this day. And you get to learn it from David Blight, who's kind of an eccentric guy, but very funny, and very great. The workload isn't bad either, there are two 5 page papers and a final, that's it. The reading gets a little heavy at times, but let's be honest, you don't have to do it all.",
    "yes i would recommend, although its a lot of reading you do not have to do them all, and blight is a really great professor",
    "Excellent course! Blight is amazing. Tons of reading, though, so be prepared. If you have any interest in the era--or even if you don't!--take the course.",
    "This is a goodclass, but not a great class. In my opinion, it doesn't quite live up to the hype. There isn't a lot of graded work (2 papers and a final) but there is a LOT of reading. Because of that, this class is about as time-consuming as you make it. Still, this is a pivotal and crucially important period in American history and in general it is probably good to have an understanding of it. For that purpose, James McPherson's \"Battle Cry of Freedom\" often is a more organized substitute for Blight's lectures. Still, Blight is entertaining, and the positives of this class outweigh the negatives.",
    "Absolutely take this course, although there is a lot of reading it is all interesting and not all needs to be completed for success. Super interesting and a really important time period to learn about if you want to understand America's values!",
    "YES. Such an interesting subject matter, and Professor Blight was one of the best (if not the best) lecturer I have encountered. His lectures were the perfect combination of cold, hard fact, anecdote, and humor. I looked forward to every lecture. Though the final covered a lot of material, I thought it was very fair. Section was great, too.",
    "Civil War was an excellent class. It's a lot of reading (although not all of it is completely necessary), but Blight's lectures are fantastic and, from what I've heard, most of the section leaders were really excellent. If you're looking to take a single history class at Yale and are at all interested in American history, I'd definitely recommend this one: it offers everything a great history lecture should offer (a great professor, interesting readings, good discussion sections, and meaningful assignments), and then some.",
    "Civl War and Reconstruction begins just before the Civil War and continues to the end of Reconstruction. This period is essential to understanding the rest of American history, so if you enjoy American history at all, you should take this class. If you're not convinced that the subject matter is for you, take the class because of David Blight--his enthusiasm and expertise will make you interested in the Civil War. Blight is an amazing professor. He is engaging and subtly hilarious, and every last lecture was enjoyable. The only down-side was that there was quite a bit of reading. That said, the readings were great--among my favorite readings were Frederick Douglass's narrative and several writings from Abraham Lincoln.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the Civil War! If not, there are other cool lectures to take.",
    "Blight's voice is fantastic and his lectures are captivating, even if he sometime only attends to two or three of the five bullet points he means to address. There's a good deal of reading, but it's all quality. Shop your section to find the best one, but you should already do that anyway.",
    "Big lecture, really easy, as deep as you want it to be.",
    "It is a great history course with not that much actual work that you are graded on but a lot of reading that you need to pull from for your work.",
    "A very good course.The meat lies in the readings, which are hefty but which add up to a coherent picture of Civil War scholarship (as far as I can tell).Blight is a captivating presenter who effortlessly weaves together scholarship, philosophy, and personality. A few of his more abstract tangents were too vague to be meaningful, and he occasionally dwelt just slightly too long on excerpts from literature and personal writings, which were otherwise deeply appreciated. They also often caused the lecture to run as much as 20% overtime almost every time. But I appreciate that he emphasizes the philosophical and ethical meanings of the Civil War and its memory over the bare facts, which, in the Civil War mania of the past two decades, have occasionally served as a smokescreen concealing deeper questions.My section in particular was good. Civil War scholarship is especially fascinating and precarious because so much of the early scholarship is tainted by racism and politics. A good part of the discussion in our section involved (essentially) arriving at a clearer picture of the war than successive earlier generations of early scholars have offered (not, I think, that we were particularly \"revisionist\").Recommended, especially if you are willing to put in the effort to ingest and chew over the substantial amount of reading and other outside media, including the Ken Burns documentary.",
    "Yes I would recommend it! This is such an interesting and important time in US history, and here is the place to learn about it. Blight's lectures are fantastic, even if you're not always sure exactly what he's talking about. Be warned that the amount of reading is ridiculous, but you can get away with not doing most of it. And you'll realize a lot of other students are in the same boat whenever section is pretty quiet. But overall, great history course!",
    "Take it. Even if you have a fairly well rounded background with the American Civil War this class exposes you to a more \"People's History of the United States\" perspective, the TAs do an excellent job of teaching how to write history papers (extremely helpful for a freshman), and David Blight's lecture's can be considered no less than mesmerizing.",
    "This is a truly great class. Professor Blight is an amazing professor. The material is also fantastic. The primary sources and secondary sources in the course really helped me to understand such a pivotal moment in United States History.",
    "This was a FANTASTIC course. The material deals with a very shaping period in American history and is presented in an eye-opening way by Blight. TAKE IT!",
    "Definitely take if you want a great understanding to American culture",
    "No, there are more interesting history classes out there.",
    "I took Civil War credit\/D, which is a great choice for a non-history major looking for an interesting and engaging lecture course who doesn't necessarily want to do a lot of reading. However, because I wasn't taking it for a grade, I enjoyed lecture but didn't feel like I learned a ton of new things about the Civil War. I'd still recommend it.",
    "I would say that History 119 01 is a necessary class for anyone in Yale to take. Everyone who lives in the USA should have a clear, sound understanding of the Civil War. ON top of this, Professor Blight is by far the best professor I have had at Yale thus far. At an institution of Yale's caliber that speaks to the quality of professor Blight.",
    "One of the three greatest classes I have taken at Yale, and David Blight is the greatest lecturer I have ever encountered. His lectures not only attack the material in eye-opening ways, he does a stunning job of making it relevant to the modern period."
