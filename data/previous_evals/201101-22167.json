    "Good continuation of L3. Appropriately difficult for L4.",
    "A painless, low-key way to fulfill the language requirement. If you're interesting in seriously pursuing German as a field of study, it'd probably be worth it to skip to L5 (L4 is not a big step up from L3). Manuel is a friendly, enthusiastic, and receptive teacher, although somewhat unstructured and occasionally seeming unprepared.",
    "Easy syllabus, a very easy transition from L3 (if you took it at Yale). Topics can get interesting but because it is not very challenging you need to put your own time to learn the vocabulary you want. At this level and beyond, one needs to define their own need from a language.",
    "Highly recommended! The literature, articles, and films are worth it on their own. But this course is wonderful, especially if the teaching fellow is good--so definitely shop sections.",
    "It is a good course - improves your writing, reading, and especially speaking skills, and gives you a nice sense of the German culture and literature.",
    "good class",
    "Would definitely recommend it - I feel as though the amount of discussion in the class was great for developing my German skills, and it was really good to solidify certain points of grammar that we learned earlier. It was also great to be reading works of literature, finally!",
    "German 140 01 is a good class, with interesting resources. Not too heavy on grammar, some of which is review, and is perhaps more focused on readings, writings and discussion. I would recommend the class because I learned a lot and I feel closer to being \"proficient\" in German."
