    "Not a requirement.",
    "As to me, the course occurred at a very appropriate time.I intended to become familiarized with the fabrication techniques that had beenunavailable in the country where I had received my previous architectural education.The course gave me an opportunity to gain skills that will be extremely useful in the following studios here."

    "It would be better if the seminar was geared towards a single final project rather than two separate assignments.",
    "As with other fabrication courses, what was gained was highly correlated to the work each student put in. I felt that Kevin did a good job keeping us motivated while also being very understanding of equipment availability issues and other conflicts.",
    "Good summary of contemporary fabrication techniques. Well-paced. It's a great opportunity to work with materials and production from the very beginning through the duration of the semester. The first phase assignment was reasonable and well-directed; the second phase allowed broadly for any kind of continuation or addition of complexity, but might have also benefited from putting forward a more specific agenda. Surfacing projects can be compelling, but it is also worthwhile to make an effort to jump to developing complex 3-dimensional sculptural pieces\/fixtures\/building elements etc.",
    "The advantage of the course was, that although it had a well formulated syllabus and assignments,It was flexible enough so that each student could concentrate on the I was interested in mastering technical skills of direct and indirect fabrication first, to then go on to develop a design.Other students with previous background in fabrication preferred to start designing at once.",
    "I found that the majority of the information presented in the course has already been well absorbed into contemporary discourse. Rather than discussing these well known technologies, a look at more advanced uses of those technologies or those on the horizon would be more beneficial."

   "comments": [
    "I expected to have creative freedom to pursue my interests. Kevin was more than encouraging of that.",
    "The course allowed me to further develop a series of interest under the supervision of Kevin.",
    "I expected to learn more about about contemporary CNC fabrication techniques through doing and through lecture, which was the case.A field trip could have been a great help as well.",
    "I think that my expectations were completely met,because I became really comfortable in the consecutive fabrication process, which includes:computer modeling, creating the negative, milling of the negative, preparing the flask for casting, casting.",
    "I expected the course to be an in depth exploration of the integration of digital and traditional methods of fabrication. I expected greater expertise of digital methods of fabrication and the software used to interface with such methods. I also expected a more critical evaluation of methods of production and a developed criteria for evaluating the work of the class."

   "comments": [
    "The course was valuable, but I think everyone would benefit by Kevin pushing a little harder. Some of the students took advantage of his understanding attitudinize and came up with projects that could have been developed further.",
    "The course is valuable in understanding up-to-date techniques for making and for questioning the effect of CNC fabrication on hand-craft, specialized labor, and design.",
    "The course was extremely valuable to me, because from the experience of the previous studios I realized that a presentation supported by a well-made fabricated artifact significantly increases its strength. Now that I have mastered some important techniques I hope that my studio projects will improve accordingly.",
    "I was able to familiarize myself with fabrication tools, such as CNC machines and Vacuum former, and casting process."

   "comments": [
    "Kevin's demeanor encourages exploration and personal expression. He is a wonderful person and an invaluable resource but occasionally I wished he would be a bit more forceful.",
    "Kevin has a great grasp on the subject matter. I wish we would have talked more in-depth about specific aspects of fabrication and perhaps had trips to local shops as opposed to talking about a variety of methods that are tough to grasp from afar.",
    "The instructor was sensible in pacing the course and timing organizing lectures. He was successful in conveying and classifying present-day CNC technologies. He made himself available to meet outside of class time.The TA was helpful and fulfilled his role.",
    "I sincerely enjoyed working with Professor Rotheroe.I think he is a very knowledgeable scholar and practitioner. Our assignments were accompanied by the presentation of the development of the fabrication techniques and their role in contemporary creative process.That gave us a better general outlook on the subject as we worked on the concrete assignments.I\u0092m looking forward to having Mister Rotheroe as a professor in future.I also would like to thank Harvy, our TA who provided a lot of assistance, especially in milling and was always available to answer any questions.",
    "The lectures tended to be rather repetitive and focused too much on industrial precesses and workflow."
