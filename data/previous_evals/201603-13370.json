He is obviously brilliant but was always very responsive over email and open to meeting to discuss the final paper. He always provided very helpful insight and guidance and was instrumental in making this a great course.",

They are both so open to getting together to discuss the course material and passionate about the subject. I was blown away by how much of their personal experience they contributed directly to the course and how invested they were. I am so grateful for their time and energy.",

    "This course improved my critical thinking and policy analysis skills, as well as my capacity for self-assessment.",
    "The readings for this course were always phenomenal and I gained so much from them. I was also grateful for Tim and Susan bringing detailed examples of how they apply the theory we learn in their work to lecture.",
    "-Susan and Tim worked to create a friendly, growth-oriented class environment. The class was very discussion-based. -I know that I will use the information from this class in every future job\/position, and that it will help me to be a more effective leader in the environmental field."

More exercises\/mini case studies like this could really aid my understanding and comprehension of the framework.",

    "I unfortunately did not have a great experience with my group and as a result did not get as much as I'd hoped out of the course. We had a group of three and one member simply refused to show up. I became frustrated with needing to corral everyone and honestly gave up towards the end of the semester. However, when I met with other groups, it was a fantastic opportunity to learn how they were processing the theory-heavy material in the course and I always appreciated the discussion.",

    "Take it",
    "Meet with Tim and Susan early and often. I left writing my final paper too late and had a very tough time pulling it together. Tim and Susan were incredibly helpful throughout the semester as I digested my research and applied the policy sciences to a concrete case. They are also generally open to discussing your other coursework and trajectory at FES. I was so grateful for how generous they both were with their time.",
    "Take it, even if you don't like theoretical studies at first. The beginning few weeks are harder to follow than the rest, but stick with the readings and absorb as much as you can from the theory so when the practical knowledge starts in the second half, you'll hit the ground running. It was my favorite course this semester."
