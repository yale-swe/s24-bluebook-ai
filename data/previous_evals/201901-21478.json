    "Politics of nonviolence",
    "I have taken classes that focus on political theories of nonviolence, but never classes that explored two theorists in particular depth. The fact of being able to do extended analyses of King and Gandhi allowed in-depth examination of two specific thinkers in a way that many classes might ignore in favor of comparing several at once.",
    "The politics and strategies of nonviolence.",
    "This was my first class in social organization and the theory of nonviolence, and I really appreciated deep-diving into a lot of the philosophy behind the practice. I learned a lot about collective action and social movements and their context specificity.",
    "In-depth inquiry into the theory of nonviolence. Truly loved it.",
    "Learned about the theory and practice of non-violence in Gandhi and King, Gandhi's satyagraha campaigns, and King's non-violent direct action campaigns during the Civil Rights Movement. Specific focus was on how King translated Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence to the context of US racial inequality, as well as the philosophical, political strategic and political tactic elements of Gandhi's and King's non-violence.",
    "N\/A",
    "I learned about the lives of Gandhi and King. I learned about nonviolence as a philosophy, strategy, and tactic. The professor taught us about the major campaigns of both the Indian independence and Civil Rights.",
    "I learned about the philosophy of nonviolence and the history of the Indian independence movement and civil rights movement.",
    "This class focused on how the political philosophy of nonviolent direct action, evolved from its history of practiced nonviolent protest through the Indian Independence Movement Gandhi led, and the Civil Rights Movement that King was a leader within. I really enjoyed the amount of primary texts that we read from Gandhi and King, through speech transcripts, journal articles, and excerpts from their philosophical literature and that of contemporary critics.",
    "I learned a lot about different forms of nonviolence. The course was very interesting, especially in light of the political climate in the United States today.",
    "the history of King and Gandhi and the root of their beliefs and their movements",
    "Understanding the history of nonviolence and civil rights as it pertains to MLK and Gandhi",
    "Learn more about the movements of Gandhi and learn the deeper truths about MLK and his movement",
    "I learned about nonviolent politics",
    "I learned a great deal about the campaigns and protests of Gandhi and MLK. Very informative and im glad I took the class",
    "I learned more about the relationship and connections between Gandhi and King."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "lectures related more to movements than to ideas",
    "The lectures are not well organized, content is interesting",
    "Professor Mantena has deep interest in and broad expertise in her field, and is able to give lectures that effectively illustrate the readings. This benefit can be expanded upon by including participation in lectures, even as participation is included in sections. The course could also benefit from incorporating a greater degree of contemporary analysis and political commentary, even as it might in some cases be a deviation from what other Political Philosophy classes at Yale do.",
    "Readings were very interesting. Also, the chronological\/split flow of the class was good.",
    "The material is good, but the lectures and sections weren't amazing. Professor Mantenta does not make eye contact with the class when she speaks and her lectures can be hard to stay invested in.",
    "Many of the readings from the second half of the course were hardly touched, in lectures, sections, or exams. This was frustrating when I allocated lots of time to understanding these readings, but it was rewarding. Sections were great. (If possible, try to get Nica as your TF!)",
    "Lectures are rather dry and it's hard to focus your attention during lectures. Sections are very helpful, but the TA's focus was often quite different from the focus of Prof's lectures.",
    "N\/A",
    "The lectures were not very engaging. I felt like I understood more from just the lecture slides and the readings than the actual lecture itself.",
    "The strength of this course are its excellent professor (Prof. Mantena) and TAs (especially Nica Siegel) in addition to its clear structure of the material. A weakness of this course is that the lecture format does not allow students to ask the professor questions during class, but discussion sections make up for this.",
    "The greatest strength of this class was our engaging facilitated discussion sections. My teaching fellow, Matt Shafer, gave us the creative freedom to question the rhetorical strategies Gandhi and King used to formulate their narratives, and also provided different small group activities that changed how we learned and worked with the material on a weekly basis. One improvement of this class could be doing more large writing assignments outside of class, as I feel like one of the most important assignments that applied my learning was the 5 page essay we did near the end of the course, and I felt more invested in it than weekly reflections.",
    "Lectures were a bit difficult to follow at times. I did not like that the lecture slides were so bare in material. The material, however, was very interesting.",
    "the readings did not match up with what she talked about in class really, just felt like she was going through a historical timeline and not really going into details on how the readings related to the class material, my TF did way more for me than lectures did",
    "Would have been helpful if lecture notes\/slides in more detail were posted online.",
    "Great selection of readings. Great TAs. Tough lectures to follow though.",
    "Lectures are boring",
    "Structured and organized. The two individuals intertwine together",
    "The readings were really interesting, but the lectures were not very engaging."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the subject matter is important given the climate of this university and the fact that EVERYONE should know the basic events of the civil rights movement...this lays out those events comparatively with Gandhian principles, focusing on the politics (and not politics in the partisan sense, either.) Take this class, and actually make an effort to learn from it! It's fairly easy to keep up but don't let it just pass you by, and you won't regret it.",
    "Not really",
    "Yes if the structure is improved (2 midterms, an essay, and a final worth 30% is a lot).",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who look for Political Science credits (particularly in the Political Philosophy concentration) or Humanities credits in general, as the specificity of the class is actually conducive to closely examining the broader implications of King's and Gandhi's analyses of political nonviolence.",
    "Yes, the reading are very interesting and the lectures are very informative. Matt's a great TA.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in the history of nonviolent organizing\/present organizing tactics, take this class! Anyone interested in those things should go through the reading and process outlined by this class.",
    "Maybe, if you are curious about the material and going to do the readings on your own, but probably not if you aren't",
    "Yes. The theories behind nonviolence are fascinating, and also under discussed in other classes. This is essential reading.",
    "Would recommend if you're interested in learning about the theory of non-violent action, but it's probably not going to be offered again because Prof Mantena is leaving.",
    "PLSC 424 was an enjoyable class. The material is quite interesting, the workload isn't particularly demanding, and the professor is an engaging lecturer. If you have any interest in the strategy and ideology of Gandhi or King -- or want to understand nonviolent action more broadly -- then this is a perfect class for you.",
    "N\/A",
    "Yes, although this class was more work than others, I enjoyed the material we learned about.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the philosophy of nonviolence or Gandhi and King as political and spiritual figures.",
    "Yes, this is an accessible class for students to learn political theory, and it provides a detailed understanding of the power of political nonviolence that clears many mainstream misconceptions of Gandhi and King's works.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they are looking for a class that is both relevant and not super difficult.",
    "yes it's easy and pretty self explanatory it is essentially the same thing over and over again just applied in different contexts",
    "Yes the content is extremely important and gives a great outlook on social justice",
    "Yes, its interesting",
    "I would recommend the reading list to another student. The lecture itself wasn't particularly captivating, but the readings for this class are some of the best I've had since coming to Yale.",
    "Yes. It is helpful to learn more about non violent protests and the organization it takes.",
    "Yes, the material covered in this course is valuable from a historical and present-day standpoint."
