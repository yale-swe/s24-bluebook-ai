    "I learned a great deal from this class, and it has helped me decide to become a chemical engineering major. For the majority of Freshman year, I was \"on the fence\" with regards to chemistry vs Chem. Eng., and Dr. Taylor helped dispel my anxiety about the course schedule. Dr Taylor was awesome in giving us insight into the basics of real-world chem-E jobs, and the class was a very comprehensive introduction into the various common processes, equations, and the behavior of different materials.",
    "I learned the basics of Chemical Engineering. It is helpful in deciding if this is a major you want to pursue.",
    "This course definitely improved my problem-solving skills and helped me to recognize efficient ways of tackling problems. The overall material was not too difficult or new, as I have taken fairly high level chemistry courses, but it was presented in a way that was accessible to real-life problems in a way that I had not previously encountered.",
    "I learned how to think like a chemical engineer, the basics of mass and energy balances and other fundamentals of chemical processes such as how to deal with multicomponent systems.",
    "It taught me to become more independent since the teacher was so awful that I had to rely on myself to learn the material instead of relying on the lectures.",
    "This course gave me the basic skills needed to go forward in chemical engineer. It taught me how to approach mass balance problems and apply graphs and given information to difficult problems to solve them.",
    "Gets you thinking about mass and energy balance techniques, flow rates, how to deal with systems that react as they flow through a process.",
    "Introduction to basic balances on material, energy, equilibrium, and many other skills and calculations used in everyday engineering calculations. Very useful.",
    "My greatest takeaway from CENG 210 was how to think like an engineer-Dr. Taylor emphasized the flexibility, creativity, and confidence needed to work through engineering problems, skills that allow one to view problems from multiple approaches and make fair assumptions when information is incomplete.",
    "We did not cover very much of what Professor Taylor wanted to cover. He had a syllabus at the beginning of the semester of what would be covered, but it was not followed. We covered a fraction of what he wanted to cover because he would often go off topic. For an example, the first few lectures were spent doing introductions of all of the students in the class.",
    "I learned the ability to deal with complex problems and create systems of equations from them and solve them.",
    "Basic understanding of what chemical engineering is, what a chemical engineer does, and energy\/mass balances of systems.",
    "I developed more insight into the work of engineers in general and chemical engineers specifically. I learned for instance that the principles of engineering could be applied to other fields like business and finance."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is great as a small class size, and helps the flipped classroom function really well. You feel more comfortable answering questions.",
    "The material in the course was noticeably dry compared to other chemical engineering\/STEM courses, and is often seen as a \"weed-out\" course at other schools to show who has the desire to become a chemical engineering major. However, Dr. Taylor made sure at every opportunity to show us the applications of these processes in real-life, and enabled the class to be interesting. In terms of strengths, the course is comprehensive in using chemistry and physics concepts in order to design process plants, and serves as a solid basis for other advanced engineering courses.",
    "Teaches well the basics of Chemical Engineering.",
    "This course is a pretty standard mass and energy balance course. I felt that there was a lot of unnecessary \"fluff\" assignments that wasted my time. For example, there was a pre-class quiz online that we had to take before class every day, but it was not available for long enough, so it was always inconvenient. I personally learn better from reading than listening, so the lectures were kind of boring for me. I wish that clickers had not been required. Also, I feel like the majority of the clicker questions and some quiz questions were worded so poorly that you could make a case for multiple answers, and that is incredibly irritating.",
    "I really enjoyed learning through doing problems, and Dr. Taylor always took the time to explain things that people were confused about. The pre-reading quizzes were sometimes really time-consuming and a source of anxiety, but hopefully any grade-related concerns don't affect your opinion about the class.",
    "The course is poorly taught and with so much information covered it becomes very difficult for the students to learn the material. Essentially this becomes a self-study course because you can't rely on Prof. Taylor to teach you anything.",
    "The strengths of this course were the clicker questions that Professor Taylor used, the TA Doug, the homework assignments through sapling and the practice tests that were given before each midterm. Clicker questions helped us review basic topics before applying them to more difficult topics, Doug was extremely helpful and one of the best resources for this class (if you are free when recitation is held I would definitely recommend that you go!!), homework on sapling emphasized concepts taught in class and gave us immediate feedback, and the practice tests gave us a good idea of what to expect on each test. The format of pre-reading quizzes could be improved. Since it is testing us after just being exposed to the material, I think it would be fair (and would help us to retain more information) if we were given multiple chances to answer questions on the pre-reading quiz.",
    "The good: Often a quite applied class. The things you learn in this course can be taken and used directly in process development internships (I still have to get one--RIP). Some of my friends in other engineering majors are jealous that I have an intro class that seems to relate this directly to actual chemical engineering work. Feels like most of the work done in this course is now done by a computerized SCADA system, but it is good to know the fundamentals and how everything pieces together. Provides a pretty wide overview of all the things people who do chemical engineering can do\/have done, including recent\/near-future trends in the field. Group work with clicker questions is a plus, and helped me get small concepts that I was messing up on before we progressed to the real-sized problems. Professor Taylor really shows that he likes the teaching component of his job, and students can tell. He brings in candy to class. He even brought cookies and Gatorade for the final! The bad: Easy to lose interest in the class after you do the 25th material balance problem that month. They're all sort of tricky, but for some reason, they all feel a little dull. Things pick up again after you get into energy balances, though. I couldn't make recitation with my class schedule, and the attitude was sort of, \"Well, too bad.\" This becomes a problem when you encounter the point below. The REALLY bad: Prof. Taylor, contrary to basically the universal convention at this school, absolutely refuses to post worked-out solutions to tests or problems of his on the Classes V2 site. This becomes a problem if you run into a recitation problem you can't solve (since you can't make it in your schedule), or want to review how he works out one of the problems in his practice tests (that he also won't post). Really, Professor Taylor, let's be real. You're a great guy, and you care about teaching. Help me study better by being able to review solutions to your test. Reactive system problems are long and complicated, and when I completely screw one up on the test, 10 minutes crammed into the end of class to throw up a messy answer on a board isn't going to help me get it. Also, this course is taught at every school that offers chemical engineering. It's not like this material is top-secret. Just help us study. It just comes off as unnecessarily annoying.",
    "Introduction to basic balances on material, energy, equilibrium, and many other skills and calculations used in everyday engineering calculations. Very useful. A really confusing class because it's never defined exactly what needs to be learned. Just comes with the kind of knowledge we're learning, but Andre does a great job making things straight forward and fair to us.",
    "I think this course's strengths were the content and class dynamic-I came out of CENG 210 feeling very confident with basic chemical engineering concepts (namely process flow diagrams) and ways of thinking. The smaller class size also made for an engaging seminar-style setting in which discussion and participation were encouraged. My only criticism is that it was sometimes unclear which parts of the textbook reading were most pertinent.",
    "The course can be improved by not having Professor Taylor teach the class.",
    "Strengths: Flipped classroom was effective for a good amount by making class more interesting. Clicker questions were helpful. Reading quizzes were helpful. Sapling was also fairly helpful. Weaknesses: Lecturer didn't lecture much and often made material more confusing and inconsistent. Exams were often ambiguous and left much to be desired.",
    "I personally am not a fan of the flipped classroom style that was used during the class. for this reason I believe that the lectures could have been more engaging and could have been more in depth, but besides that I liked the the other techniques used in that class a lot."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend. The professor made it very enjoyable and really got you to start seeing all the possibilities of a chemical engineer.",
    "I would recommend this course if that particular student is considering a possible chemical\/environmental engineering major, as the course will use a solid basis of chemistry and physics to solve problems related to yield, reactor processes, efficiency of a system, and methods of distillation. In addition, I would recommend this to other STEM majors if they are interested in manufacturing, or understanding the economics behind bulk production of essential goods and materials. I would NOT RECOMMEND this course to someone who has not taken at least two semesters of physics and chemistry, and a solid understanding of high-school algebra, without which many of the underlying principles will not be understood.",
    "If you're reading this, its probably because the course is required for your major. Not a bad class though.",
    "YEs, if you are thinking about the Chemical Engineering major, take it.",
    "You probably have to take this course as a chemical engineering major. If you aren't a chemical engineering major, the course is probably a little dry and inaccessible. However, for prospective engineers, I think this course presents a lot of real-feeling problems and allows you to get a feel for the sort of data engineers pull (from tables, equations, etc.) to solve problems in their field. The class is really not that hard. If you learn well from reading textbooks, you will be just fine. If you require instruction to do well, it may be difficult as the class as a whole was not engaged to create an environment in which solving problems in class was helpful. I never went to the optional section, but my guess is that that would be the better place to have questions cleared up. The professor is difficult to learn from, and I was usually more confused when I left lecture than when I entered.",
    "I would definitely recommend trying this course, even if you are not set on becoming a chemical engineer. The principles you learn could easily be applied to other areas, and it was a very rewarding class.",
    "I would only recommend this course to CENG MAJORS ONLY. This is an introductory course but do not put yourself with the frustration of having a terrible professor along with understanding and memorizing several equations.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in chemical engineering. If you put in the work you will understand the material and come out of this course feeling more confident going forward in chemical engineering. Take advantage of the resources available to you (office hours with the TA and weekly recitation are very helpful!) and attend lecture and this class is not terribly difficult. Homework assignments on sapling aren't too time consuming and Professor Taylor and the TA are always fair in grading and setting due dates which really helps relieve some of the stress of the class!",
    "You're probably taking this because you have to. Not many people who have the flexibility to browse through YCPS and highlight every course they might possibly want to take are going to rank \"Intro to Chemical Engineering\" next to \"Kafka: Transformations of Gender and Class.\" (----- completely made up humanities class name) Anyway, the point is, you're probably taking this course because you have to at some point, and you probably have already decided you want to do chemical engineering early, since if you don't, you likely won't graduate. This course is a good enough introduction to chemical engineering that shows how the major doesn't have to necessarily be a funnel into oil-and-gas jobs. Professor takes course material that is pretty fundamentally dry and makes it as interesting as he can.",
    "Introduction to basic balances on material, energy, equilibrium, and many other skills and calculations used in everyday engineering calculations. Very useful. A really confusing class because it's never defined exactly what needs to be learned. Just comes with the kind of knowledge we're learning, but Andre does a great job making things straight forward and fair to us.",
    "While the course was interesting, I would only recommend the course to someone considering chemical or environmental engineering simply because the material is so specific to these fields of study. I would want other students to know that this course is definitely a flipped-classroom model, something not all students seemed to fully internalize (myself included); you will be teaching yourself most of the material through textbook reading and external sources, while Dr. Taylor will reinforce and apply that material in class and on problem sets. I think most of the criticisms of this class stem from the fact that it is designed for autodidactic learning.",
    "Do not take this course if it is taught by Professor Taylor. I seriously considered switching majors because of this course. The course is not necessarily hard, but Professor Taylor is the worst professor I have had at Yale. Talk to upperclassmen in the chemical engineering major on how to survive his class.",
    "What does this have to do with Chemical Engineering? Frustratingly enough, a lot. While this class needs to be taken for the major, it's also... how should I say... a pain at times. Professor Taylor is super chill and nice, but sometimes doesn't run the class as well as it could be. Expect a typical intro level engineering class type stuff, but with a few questionable moments.",
    "Yes. Prof. Taylor and the small class size made the class fun. It will probably be a prereq that you have to take anyways, but at least it's engaging. The class is somewhat flipped so you will be responsible for reading ahead but the textbook is clear so if you do read ahead, it's not that hard to follow and do well."
