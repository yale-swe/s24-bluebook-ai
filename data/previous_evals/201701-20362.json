   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of new experimental methods in Biology.",
    "I learned a lot about one specific science experiment and how to read a scientific paper. Otherwise, I didn't develop many skills.",
    "I was worried going into the class because I had not taken bio since freshman year of high school but it ended up being a great class that I developed a nice basis in biochemistry in. I learned not to be intimidated by classes because of a lack of previous exposure or preparedness.",
    "I started with very little background in biochem and biophysics, so this was quite a crash course in almost everything. I learned much more about the function of HIV, about protein structure, about DNA and RNA.",
    "I gained knowledge about biological models and how they interact with each other. We brought together knowledge from chemistry, biology, and physics to understand life.",
    "I have started to develop an understanding of how science works at Yale, and how to read official scientific papers. By taking this course, I have also refined my study habits to be better suited to the rigour of college work.",
    "Regurgitation of content and complex application of content. Was a challenging course that developed my studying techniques.",
    "I learned a lot of biology.",
    "I gained some knowledge in how to cram for a fifteen minute quiz all weekend. I learned more about reading scientific papers.",
    "Basic understanding of biology: proteins, enzymes, DNA",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of the chemical and physical aspects of biology.",
    "Through Biology 101, I think I mostly reestablished skills of scientific thinking and analysis (through reading papers and having \"journal club\"). I think I also developed a more in-depth understanding of biochemistry and biophysics while also cultivating an interest in molecular biochemistry.",
    "I learned how to apply basic biology information, such as vocabulary and theory, to real life situations. I was also introduced to reading and analyzing scientific papers, something which I had never done beforehand. This was perhaps the biggest takeaway from the class for me.",
    "HIV drug development, kinetic control vs. thermodynamic control.",
    "A lot about proteins",
    "I learned about the chemical workings of cells and the macromolecules that they contain. I also learned about some of the experimental techniques by which biologists study these macromolecules.",
    "Basic concepts of biology\/biophysics, with a discussion of HIV function\/treatment in the end to tie everything together. It's not incredible detailed, but you learn enough to have informed conversations about the subject matter as well as apply what you know in other areas of science.",
    "This course was both less informative and less skill-building than my comparable course in high school, so I developed very little in the way of skills. The only skill I began to develop was the ability to read scientific papers, but there was so little emphasis on this that I never really developed this skill.",
    "I developed an understanding of fundamental principles used in biochemistry.",
    "I developed good study skills that will be applied to future courses. I also gained a deeper understanding of biology and the world surrounding me. It has taught me to appreciate even the simplest processes of life.",
    "I learned how to study Biology at a college level, and I learned how to apply memorized knowledge on theoretical application questions. This is a skill that I continue to work on and am very glad that BIOL 101 challenged me in this way.",
    "Because I took AP Biology in high school, most of the material was review. However, I did learn how to read and analyze scientific papers.",
    "I reviewed my biology knowledge, learned about important historical experiments",
    "I gained understanding of some laboratory procedures as well as mindsets in how to approach lab work. After learning some basics of biochemistry, I learned how to connect concepts and apply them.",
    "Not much that I had not learned from AP Bio, but I am now better at reading primary scientific literature.",
    "I acquired a basic knowledge of biochemistry and biophysics. I acquired good study skills. I got to know a few members of the biology departments at Yale."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the discussion sections could be more relevant. Often times I feel like the way they were structured, they weren't really helpful to the material. I really actually liked the weekly quizzes. It forced me to stay on top of the material.",
    "The strengths are few. It covers a lot of material. However, the Discussion Sections were not useful, the quizzes were too advanced, and the grading was unfair.",
    "While the material was interesting, as a student who took AP Biology in high school, almost all (90%) of the material was review for me. I think the placement tests were unrealistically difficult and many people who should have been able to place out of this module were unable to. As a result, many people were bored during lecture and only showed up to take the quizzes.",
    "I think that there is a disconnect between what is said in lecture and the quizzes, There needs to be a better way to show us how to apply the knowledge because the lectures didn't help with that and the homework was not at quiz or test level",
    "I think a strength was the organization and the study guides and slides available from each lecture. A weakness would be that the reading was difficult and seemed to be beyond the scope of the class in some cases.",
    "Strengths are the structure\/even courseload and clear expectations in syllabus. Weaknesses are the quiz content that frequently jumped ahead of where we were in lecture, or heavily favored those who had a background in AP Bio as opposed to those who simply took notes on lecture\/reading.",
    "The class is very high pressure because of the structure, but I still believe it was run very well. Dr. Koleske was an engaging lecturer and brought the opportunity for students to bring their concerns to him. Sections were also run very efficiently.",
    "This course is incredibly challenging -- especially for people like me who come from very little biology background in high school. Perhaps, the introductory biology sequence could be further subdivided into more levels in order to accommodate students who come with such diverse levels of preparation.",
    "I was not able to dedicate as much time to this course as I would have liked. I also never took AP biology in high school so I had no background knowledge. I took enrichment which helped a lot.",
    "This course was taught very well. But the quizzes were graded in a manner that was fairly arbitrary and unforgiving, which sucked",
    "More practice applying concepts to scenarios would be nice.",
    "I think that the professor was really engaging and made the lectures interesting. I think that the quiz structure was hard to work around, but the dropped grade was nice. I overall think it was a good class, and it helped that I had taken AP Bio so a lot of it was review. There are a lot more details than before, though, so don't slack off.",
    "The weekly quizzes are very stressful as a lot rides on them and the time limit is intimidating. The elimination of those could create for a class that receives better reviews, but if that isn't a priority, then don't.",
    "The quizzes are stressful due to the time constraint and don't always feel reflective of the emphasized topics in lecture.",
    "The biggest problem with this course is the quizzes. I always felt like I knew the material, but frankly 15 minutes wasn't enough to convey what I knew on the quizzes. I don't think it was enough time to thoroughly answer the questions with the ability to reflect more beforehand. Also quizzes were often handed back more than a week later, which made it hard to gauge what you were doing well at and what needed improvement. Prof Koleske, though, was an engaging lecturer and definitely put a lot of effort into making the course engaging. If I hadn't taken biology in high school, I definitely would have struggled a lot in this class. The concepts can be challenging\/advanced and we move through the material very quickly.",
    "Strengths: very great professor Weaknesses: extremely stressful with all the quizzes",
    "One weakness is that the sections often cover material that was already gone over in class.",
    "I thought professor Koleske was great in keeping the class engaged and attentive. He was very good at presenting the information and his lessons were clear and structured.",
    "I think the way discussion sections are designed are a very positive aspect of this course. The lecture-based review and discussion of new concepts was very helpful throughout the term. The homework assignments also helped to build on lecture topics in more detailed and specific terms.",
    "One of the weaknesses of this course is that everyone comes in with widely different levels of experience. In my own case, all of BIOL 101 was review from what I had previously learned in high school. But I know that for others, this class was the first time that they had ever been exposed to college-level biology. For that reason, there were some students who did very well in the class without much effort. I think that this weakness has for the most part been addressed through Professor Lin's enrichment classes. I think that this was a great way to assist those who did not have been biology experience. It just goes to show how much the professors really wanted for their students to succeed. A strength for this course is what a great lecturer Professor Koleske is. He really tried to make us see what a blast biology can be, and his lectures are some of the best I have attended at Yale. Another strength is the Piazza website. Anytime that I had a question, I could visit Piazza and see if someone had already asked it\/answered it. If not, I could always ask and I would get a response by the end of the day (at the very latest). A great resource that was very useful throughout the semester.",
    "Weekly quizzes are stressful.",
    "Some of the questions on the quizzes\/homeworks\/tests were vague and occasionally made answering the question difficult. Otherwise, course was well structured and taught.",
    "Strength = small assignments that keep people on pace, make testing less stressful. Weakness = unhelpful sections",
    "The quizzes were a little hard. Section should help us learn the material BEFORE the quizzes, not after.",
    "The only problem I had with the course was the style of quizzing. The way quizzes were done was not a reliable indicator of how well students understood the concepts. The quizzes consisted of multiple questions crammed into a 15-minute time limit that led to students making inevitable mistakes, not due to a lack of understanding but because they had to rush. A better structure would be to reduce the length of the quizzes to one or two good questions. This way, students have time to think about their answers and really show that they understand the material.",
    "The course seems to value breadth over depth, even with such a selective focus. Readings, homework, and discussion sections did not emphasize the level of critical thinking required for the course. The quizzes were unreasonably stressful and there wasn't much time to really work through and apply knowledge at any point in the course with how the quizzes were scheduled.",
    "This course is great in that it is thorough in presenting the fundamental concepts of biochemistry\/biophysics and gives a great picture of how all the subsets of those fields are related. It's also organized remarkably well for a large lecture class, with TAs, peer tutors, Piazza, and the instructors themselves all being readily available for help. My biggest gripe is that this class misleads you into thinking it's all about concepts (with a \"we're not like those other memorization based freshman science classes\" attitude), but ultimately it heavily tests memorization over everything else. We were even told before the final exam that it would be ~50% memorization.",
    "Strengths: Good emphasis on lab techniques (though without supplementing this course with a lab, I'm not sure if that's any help) Grades are not punitive--they are fair. We did a good job of breaking down and facilitating understanding of the two scientific papers we did read. Weaknesses: Lectures were boring and irrelevant. Sections were mostly busy work and memorization-focused; there was no skill-building done there. Vastly different skill levels of entering students mean that the course teaches to the lowest common denominator, boring students who are ahead. Textbooks are poorly written and non-informative. Campbell's Biology is vastly superior. Emphasis on lab techniques is irrelevant without sufficient detail in the foundations of biochemistry. Never learned any biophysics.",
    "The material covered in section and the way section was structured was not very helpful and insightful at all. Section did not increase my understanding of the material in any way and did not introduce any new material.",
    "I am very pleased with the ability of such a large lecture to facilitate learning. I know some students may complain about this, but the fact that this was not simply a regurgitation class is super important. There was such a strong focus on relating the material to actual real world research and technology that is just as relevant to a scientist as the other biological concepts. I think the weekly quizzes were an effective measure of making sure students keep up with the material, I highly recommend keeping them in place.",
    "A strength of the course was the engagement that lecture and discussion section required, it made learning more interesting.",
    "The strengths of this course were that it tested our knowledge and encouraged us to think deeper about the concepts in biology. The weaknesses of the course are that it seems as though the vocabulary is more advanced than what they required, it would be easier to understand the material if the vocabulary were at a lower level.",
    "The major issue with the bio sequence overall is the disparity among students in previous biology exposure. Moreover, grading on quizzes often seemed to reflect emphasis on minutiae rather than fundamental understanding of concept.",
    "Some strengths of this course include: the immediacy of answers to questions on Piazza, and the enrichment sessions of this course. Weaknesses: I would have liked if anyone who feels unprepared and confused about the material could attend enrichment, as I believe the sessions have been extremely conducive and helpful to my understanding.",
    "I really did not feel that section was helpful. Everytime, I was anxious to attend, as I never fully grasped the concepts well enough to apply them. This may be just because I am stupid, but I wish it was less student interaction, which only served to further confuse me, and more TF telling us about application. The TF's know the material better than the students do, and I'm not really interested in hearing another student's half-baked take on the material. I'm sure that my input was mediocre at best as well.",
    "BIOL 101 does a good job laying the foundation in Biology, and it would be a great course for anyone who have not previously taken AP Biology. However, most students who scored a 5 on the AP Biology exam should have the choice to go straight into BIOL 102.",
    "Quizzes got harder as the course progressed; they seemed to be more about being able to answer the questions in a short amount of time than really analyzing the material.",
    "A lot of the content in this course is covered by biology courses that students may have taken earlier. For students with some background in biology, this can lead to some lack of engagement, as a lot of the content is repetitive from previous courses.",
    "This course, though taught well, is fundamentally a series of disjointed facts, and despite the emphasis on applications, did not teach wider concepts very well. Professor Koleske is a huge strength, but the course is surprisingly disorganized, and the homeworks and quizzes were riddled with mistakes that no one even bothered to point out to the instructors.",
    "The strengths of this course are that Professor Koleske is a very good professor. This course also offers enrichment which is very helpful if you do not have a strong background in biology. The weaknesses of this course is how specific the TAs and Professor Koleske want you to be on the answers to the quizzes and the final. If you do not say a specific word but you understand the concept, you will not get the points. This could be improved by allowing the grading to be more lenient."

    "Yep!",
    "Only take this course if you need to for your major. Not worth it at all.",
    "Yes.",
    "Take it only if you need bio as a requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I think exposure to biology is important in a lot of fields and I also think that if you put in the effort and stay organized that it is not too hard to do well.",
    "If you can take Enrichment and are not afraid to reach out to your TF for extra help. And if you have time to read the textbook.",
    "I don't think anyone would take this class for enjoyment but instead for major prerequisites. That being said, the class was interesting and had a small homework load (besides studying.)",
    "If you intend to study biology at Yale, then yes I recommend it. However, if not, I would not recommend it.",
    "I would recommend for pre-med.",
    "You'll probably learn some things",
    "Yes, it is a good introductory biology class.",
    "You really only take the bio sequence if you have to.",
    "If you have to take it, take it.",
    "I mean mostly if you're taking it its because you need it as a pre-req for some other biology courses so you'll just have to deal with it. It's not the greatest class, but it's not the worst either. If you are just needing to fill your science credit, though, know that this is not an easy class. Although there is some interesting content, I think you can have a more interesting biology based science class that isn't as taxing.",
    "Yes",
    "Biology 101 was not particularly interesting but it is a good introduction that strengthens the concepts learned in AP biology courses.",
    "Yes. This course gave a great introduction to biology and I think it's a great way to solidify any interest you may have in the biological sciences.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students as a basic science course (for graduation requirements or intended major) because it does a very good job of covering some important concepts in an approachable way.",
    "If you have to complete the BIO sequence, do everything in your power to take it with Professor Koleske. He is such a great lecturer and I was sad to have finished BIOL 101 just because I wouldn't be listening to his lectures. He genuinely cares about his students and truly does want them to learn. If you have taken AP Biology or the equivalent before, this course is basically a refresher on the four macromolecules and it won't require all that much effort. I think that it is also a great way to get a science credit out of the way, that is if you have taken a Biology course in high school. But all in all, it was a great course and I only wish that all of my courses could be as low-stress as this while still learning. TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR KOLESKE!",
    "Only take if need to, not particularly interesting by itself, more of a gateway course.",
    "Only take this if you need it for your major",
    "This course is successful in instilling a strong foundation of knowledge in molecular chemistry.",
    "It's a widely required course. I wouldn't recommend it for fun or to spark an interest in biology.",
    "As someone who took AP Bio in high school and the pre-med chem sequence, I don't think I learned anything new until like the 4th or 5th week. If you've taken orgo and are willing to do some online reading on how genes are replicated, just take a 200-level MCDB class instead (nobody will check if you took the placement test). Seems like it would be a good class for freshmen and non-STEM majors though. I am also somewhat ultimately glad I took it because it establishes good fundamentals and puts everything you know in a broader context. Quizzes\/tests can be tricky, but the workload is extremely low and the class takes a minimal amount of your time with a ~1 hour problem set and no more than 2 hours of reading\/studying per week. Also can't complain about Professor Koleske, he's a fantastic lecturer and has made more effort to engage with students in a large lecture course than any other professor I've ever had at Yale.",
    "You probably have to take this, if you're pre-med or a bio major. If you can, I would try my hardest to place out of this (and the whole Bio sequence). Koeleske is probably better than most instructors for the sheer quality of his instruction, but the course isn't designed to engage you or teach you anything beyond a low-level biology course (not quite AP level).",
    "Yes Biol 101 with Koleske far exceeded my expectations, and even if you're not a biology major I think it would be a worthwhile half semester course to give you a good feel for the material.",
    "I recommend this course because of the good understanding it gives of biochemistry, important knowledge to have and apply for working in a lab.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student especially if they are planning on taking any science courses at Yale. BIOL 101 is a very foundational course and I believe that it would be advantageous to have a basic knowledge of the subject.",
    "Seeing as the course is a prerequisite for a good number of classes, its recommended by its being mandatory.",
    "Because this course is the first module of BIOL 101-104 sequence, it is required for majors in Biology and is a pre-med requirement, so it is necessary if the student intends to follow any of these tracks. It was a difficult course, but it challenged me and required me to take my understanding of Biology to the next level, so I'm glad I took it.",
    "Not unless they were a STEM major. It was extremely fast-paced, and as a humanities major I struggled tremendously. Though there is enrichment and office hours and tutors, nothing beats preexisting knowledge, and the students who had already taken Chemistry clearly had the upper hand, especially since this was a Biochemistry class. I wish this was the final sequence of Biology, so more students could have a chance to take chemistry prior to entering.",
    "BIOL 101 may be redundant for those who have taken AP Biology, but it is a good review course and teaches you some new skills, such as reading scientific papers.",
    "Yes, this could be relatively easy (compared to other Yale courses) if you have experience in AP Biology. This is definitely due to the amount of review and preparation that the professor and the TFs provide; with the weekly quizzes and lecture notes posted online, the students really get to reinforce the material. I appreciated that immensely, but I think the quizzes were too stressful towards the end.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who plans on taking higher level biology or who would like to ensure a good foundation in biology. The concepts in this course may be things that students have covered before, but they are still essential.",
    "Take it if you have to. Professor Koleske is good, and the grading and workload are fair. The instructors are understanding, and the material isn't bad, but it is like a watered down version of AP Biology with harder assessments.",
    "I would recommend this course to others if they want to take more advanced biology course. The material that was taught was good, but sometimes the grading did not seem fair."
