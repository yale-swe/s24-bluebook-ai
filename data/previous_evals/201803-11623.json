    "In this class, I learned more about the Arabic case endings, and I learned a TON of new vocab!",
    "I improved my Arabic vocabulary and skills generally.",
    "We went through chapters 1-5 in Al-Kitaab Part 2, and learned all the vocabulary, grammar, and cultural lessons present in the text. We also had the chance to practice speaking with a native Arabic speaker via the NaTakallam program.",
    "I learned a lot of Arabic vocabulary and grammar, but the greatest area of improvement was probably in my speaking.",
    "I l armed Arabic",
    "My speaking ability improved tremendously, learned a lot of new vocabulary and important grammar, and really practiced my reading comprehension. A really important skill we learned was how to identify words from roots and patterns which is incredibly important when reading anything in arabic that has words you don't know.",
    "Arabic conversation, comprehension, and writing",
    "I learned a lot more vocab and nuanced ways to use the vocabulary.",
    "Arabic language to be used in a real life and society.",
    "Oustatha Sarab was one of the best teachers I have had in a very long time."

   "comments": [
    "The course is well-designed. Prof. Al Ani does a fantastic job with the course, and spends a good amount of time on each chapter before the biweekly tests. The course was definitely a step up from L1 and L2, but with Sarab, I felt comfortable. One thing I like that Sarab does is that she includes a lot of components that add up to determine the final grade, so if you mess something up, you can still do extremely well. There was always a lot of material to learn for the tests, but spending two weeks on the material really helped me absorb everything really well. I just wish there was a little more emphasis on the vocab, since there was just a lot to learn. Also, one of the coolest things we did in class was talking to native Arabic speakers from Syria\/Lebanon over Skype every week. That was really cool, and I actually befriended the person I talked to! I think the one weakness is the Arabic tables, since they were required, but this was never stated in the syllabus.",
    "I wish that the class improved my speaking skills further.",
    "I wish we had had more time to practice speaking. I felt like this course was easier to cope with than ARBC 110 and 120, but also that I learned slightly less. But overall it was a good course, and Sarab is a good teacher, I think it's hard to tell what could be improved and what is just part of the normal growing pains of being in this intermediate stage of learning a difficult language.",
    "Sometimes there was a little confusion with the technology we used- it was hard to use and access voicethread for example, and sometimes the online textbook would delete my work.",
    "Great class Sarab is terrific and you get access to so much help.",
    "Sarab is an amazing professor and I she does a great job of teaching this course. One of the highlights of this year's course is that we used a program called Natakallam and were each given a native speaking partner. All of our partners were refugees so we learned a lot about their experiences but also were able to speak to them for 30 minutes a week which allowed us to improve our speaking.",
    "Should have less online work",
    "This course covers a lot of material. I wish more of the class was conducted in Arabic and less English was used during the semester.",
    "no weaknesses. amazing class!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! You learn so much in L3. You start to appreciate the root based nature of Arabic a LOT more, you start reading more, you read quicker, you start learning a lot more vocab, and so on. It's awesome.",
    "Yes, if you have already taken L2 Arabic, please continue and take this course.",
    "Arabic is a wonderful language, both intellectually interesting and globally relevant, and so far all the faculty in the department have been talented and helpful. It's not an easy language by any means, and probably not worth the workload if you're not willing to put a lot of work into it and have no interest beyond fulfilling your language requirement.",
    "I would recommend it. The teacher was amazing and just a kind person in general.",
    "Yes if you can do the work",
    "Great course, especially if you're really looking to improve your reading and writing. Your speaking will also improve tremendously. The one downside is there are not a lot of opportunities to speak in Shaami in this class.",
    "yes because the department is amazing"
