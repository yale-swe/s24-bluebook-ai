   "comments": [
    "Great class worth taking. The bi-weekly responses are easy but the readings behind them are many and long, though not usually dense as they're journalistic. The amount of knowledge and the interestingness of the thoughts and ideas you leave this class with are directly proportional to your willingness to do the readings. They are the backbone of the class. The papers aren't too hard but very open ended so think sharply.",
    "A fascinating course if you're interested in interpreting and evaluating how journalism is done. The readings were great and Wood asked thoughtful questions trying to keep discussion going, but the discussions were often dispassionate and meandering. Would still recommend for Wood and the readings alone.",
    "The readings for this class were very compelling (and very heavy). The discussion was much less compelling and often felt too broad and directionless. We talked about reporting technique (broadly), the dynamics of the specific conflicts (Bosnia, Soviet Afghanistan, Israel\/Palestine, Rwanda, the Gulf War, etc), and general questions regarding ethics, the journalist's duty, etc. There's a midterm paper, a final paper, and reading responses (that you write for every other class). The midterm and final had no prompt, so if you don't like that type of openendedness, beware. Grading style seemed to be harsh written feedback, lenient awarding of the actual grade (which is definitely better than the reverse). Then again, none of the reading responses got written feedback or grades, which was not helpful. All in all, this course is good if you want to read cool things and interact with a very cool working journalist, but don't expect much substance in the discussions (and probably take it Credit\/D just in case).",
    "You should definitely take it. This class goes beyond just focusing on the nuts and bolts of writing journalistic pieces, and forces you to talk about the larger questions behind those pieces. Wood is really thoughtful, has first hand experience in war reporting, and knows an incredible amount about the subject material. If you take it, definitely send him drafts of papers before submitting them he's not the easiest of graders, and you'll want to get his thoughts before turning in the paper."
