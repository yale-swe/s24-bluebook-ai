    "A great workshop class with fantastic discussion and leadership. With consistent input and screenplays to look at, this class is beyond amazing. With a solid group of committed writers this could be the best class you take at Yale. A must take!",
    "Yes, if you're interested in screenwriting.",
    "Yes! Some people really want to write screenplays, and by all means, they should pursue this. Most important thing is to make sure every draft reflects your best effort, because you'll get a lot more out of the class discussions.",
