   "comments": [
    "I gained insight into the ways that the criminal justice systemfrom policing to courts to prisonsis largely rigged and detriments Black and low-income communities. It also taught me about what kinds of policies can be used to improve the system. Professor Harris's emphasis on social science also made us think about how we might test or evaluate policies and interventions to improve the criminal justice system, which was highly valuable in engendering an understanding of how social science papers are structured and how their studies are built among our class.",
    "I learned about social science research design and about the operations of our criminal justice system",
    "I LOVED this course. I learned a lot about the criminal justice system and various actors that have a role in it.",
    "From this course I gained a better understanding of the workings of America's criminal justice system and its many actors. I improved my social science writing and general knowledge about how social science studies are conducted.",
    "I learned so much about the criminal justice system and how the system is both systemically racist and ineffective. We talked not just about who is targeted under this unjust system but also the beneficiaries who profit from mass incarceration.",
    "Through taking this course, I learned a lot about the relationship between political decision-making and various outcomes within the criminal justice system. I also learned a lot about research design methods, which was very helpful for me as a political science major.",
    "This course was an interesting survey of common issues in the field of Crime and Punishment. I enjoyed the sort of \"historiography\" section of the course where we talked about the policies that came out of the War on Crime, and the politics that shaped our criminal justice system. The second half of the course focused on more recent popular issues such as policing, bail, and felons' rights."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course is the materialit's very engaging, informative, and often, shocking. I've learned so much about ways that the criminal justice system carries out the exact opposite of justice, and am so thankful to have this knowledge. The readings are very interesting and engaging, so I was very grateful for that. I also really enjoyed the policy exercise we did at the end of class. Professor Harris built a curriculum that toes the line between theory and practicality very well, and shows how those intersect at times and clash at others. A weakness of the course was engagement with the material. Seminar often felt very student-led and lacked direction from the professor, which made the class feel a little robotic and lacking in fluidity\/substantive value at times. While I believe Professor Harris wanted to create an environment where students largely led discussion and participation, I think it may have left too much up to the students in terms of teaching themselves and each other. Student presentations would often go on for longer than an hour, leaving Professor Harris with 20-30 minutes to teach\/carry out discussion. When she did engage us, I really really enjoyed it and learned a lot from it, but the time in which she would do so was very limited. Even with 20-30 minutes left, she would often end class 10 minutes early. In general, I think this left something to be desired in terms of in-class learning.",
    "Strengths: the readings were all interesting and the load was manageable so I could complete each reading every week. Weaknesses: the presentations were sometimes too long and too surface level.",
    "Each week we had student presenters who discussed the readings and often had an activity for the class. I generally love this type of assignment, it's nice to have the readings summarized by peers and it is a good metric of how well students understand the material. The one downside was that in this course the presentations often took over half of our class time. Although this shows that we were engaged, I would have loved to hear from Professor Harris more. Whenever she moderated the conversation, posed questions, or introduced her own opinion it was always fascinating and I definitely wanted to hear more. For these reasons, I would suggest capping presentations at 30 minutes.",
    "Strengths: The syllabus was great in that the readings were engaging, but it was a reasonable amount to read each week. This way, most, if not all, students were able to do the readings and participate in discussions. When people made incorrect points or misinterpreted readings, Professor Harris would step in to help guide the conversation or politely but necessarily correct people. Discussions in the class were exciting and interesting.",
    "I loved the readings and discussions we had! It wouldve been great to hear a little more from Professor Harris though.",
    "Almost everything about this course was a strength, I only wish Professor Harris lectured a bit more.",
    "While this course has a lot of potential, I think that the readings could have been better organized to facilitate learning and I think that Professor Harris could have interjected herself into conversations a little more. Ultimately, the format of the seminar was largely comprised of student presentations and follow-up discussions, so Professor Harris herself did not spend as much time teaching us as I would have liked.",
    "I think this course could be a little bit more rigorous. As a senior seminar, the course wasn't that challenging. A lot of seniors come into a class like this with a lot of existing knowledge about the issues. I think by assigning some more difficult texts, especially ones that argue more conservative viewpoints, the course could challenge students more. I think Professor Harris could also participate more in the seminar discussion, and ask challenging questions or offer an alternative opinion. Otherwise, the course had very interesting material. It was very helpful when Professor Harris would explain social science experiments! I think more emphasis on that would really challenge students. Students were mostly very engaged in discussion, although I'm not sure if they had always done the reading. The assignments were reasonable and I thought the policy paper was a nice change of format from what we usually get.",
    "This course was amazing! I love how Professor Harris balanced the amount of teaching and discussion in seminar. I wish we could have gone over the criminal justice system as a whole when class began. I didnt not know as much about the criminal justice system so it wouldve been nice to make sure everyone starts out with the same background knowledge."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if discussions and in-class content were more fully led by the professor in a future iteration. If presentations were kept to 15-20 minutes (or the student presentation aspect of class were eliminated as a whole), and class was led more wholeheartedly by the professor, I think this would be a really fantastic class. The material and assignments were very engaging, so I think it's just a matter of making in-class time more productive.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to people interested in the criminal justice system",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely! The content and readings were fascinating and Professor Harris is an amazing instructor.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to all students, but especially to those looking to get a better understanding of how social science works. This was the first course I have taken at Yale that genuinely helped me understand what social science is and how people conduct research in this field. The readings are engaging, but not overwhelming. The regular assignments were helpful in writing the final paper so that when reading period rolled around, I felt prepared to write my final paper for the class. Overall, exceptional class with an amazing professor.",
    "Absolutely. MUST TAKE!! The course material is fascinating and super relevant to issues today.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course, primarily because Professor Harris is a very down-to-earth instructor who cares about her students and knows the material very well. I'm sure if you wanted to dive more deeply into an issue she would help you!",
    "Yes, Professor Harris is great and you gain amazing insight into the criminal justice system and political science research.",
    "Yes!!! I LOVED this course!! The readings werent just some boring articles over 100 pages long. Professor Harris made the reading workload manageable and provided a mixture of articles, books, and podcasts. I really liked how we were allowed to simply speak in class and if you hadnt developed your thoughts yet, Professor Harris would continue asking questions until you understood what you wanted to say"
