    "Basic Spanish course. Can be terrible if you don't get a good instructor, so if you don't like the teacher in shopping period, leave and find a better one. It's make or break.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student interested in learning spanish.",
    "One of my favorite classes this semester!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The professor is great and class time is generally fun. If you give the class enough attention, you will do well and improve a lot in spanish.",
    "If you have never taken any Spanish before, this will be a very difficult class. It moves very rapidly and it conducted mainly in Spanish very early on. This can make understanding topics difficult when they are explained in Spanish. However, this class will teach you Spanish. By the end of the semester you will basically be able to communicate anything you want in Spanish as long as it is in present tense. If you want to learn Spanish, taking it at Yale is a great option. There is more work than a typically 1 credit class, but it a 1.5 credit class and has about average work for 1.5 credits.",
    "A good way to learn another language. The five day per week clas helps establish the foundation for spanish.",
    "If, like me, you had no prior knowledge of Spanish, this class will get you reading, speaking, and understanding Spanish in a matter of weeks.",
    "Yes, but recognize that it's a mass-market course and that the rigidity can be frustrating."
