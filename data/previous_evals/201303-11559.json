    "Just know that you will be responsible for putting together an insect collection with specimen that you collect on cool field trips. But you will spend a lot of time outside of class on your collection. The weekly quizzes are super challenging and required lots of study time.",
    "Take the lab! It makes the class infinitely more interesting and meaningful. You get to check out an iPad for the term from the library, plus there's a trip to Florida over Fall Break! Warning: this is soooooo much more than 0.5 credits worth of work. That's okay because the class is not nearly so much, but be prepared to spend 50 hours on your collection.",
    "This was one the best classes that I have taken at Yale. It is also one of the most work intensive classes that I have taken! BUT, you learn so, so much and it's just really fun.The hardest thing is keeping on top of the quizzes each week as well as finalizing the final project (your own bug collection). But Marta is amazingly enthusiastic and helpful and kind and encouraging. It was awesome getting to know her, and it was refreshing to see such passion in a professor.You also get to go to Florida for the class. It is optional, but really fun! It was also a tad exhausting, but worth it.If you are willing to take the time, this class can be one of the best that you take at Yale.",
    "I wasn't sure what to expect at the beginning of the semester--I took this class mostly because it was the only EEB course that fit my schedule--but this was a fantastic class. Take the lab if you can, it's really one of the best unexpected surprises I've had so far at Yale. That said, I can't really recommend it if you're a fall-season athlete. There are two field trips for the lab (one to Florida over fall break) which are optional, but it's not really possible to complete the main assignment of the lab without going on one. I couldn't go due to athletic obligations. Marta gives you opportunities to make up for it, which was appreciated, but there's not much you can do.",
    "Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Take it!",
    "If you have the time for it and don't mind indoor labtime, absolutely do it! The bugs are so cool and the professors great! Plus you get to travel!"
