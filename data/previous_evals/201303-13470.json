   "comments": [
    "Workload not too great but effective in teaching the basics of writing",
    "Take this class! It's rather interesting. I was surprised by how many different facets and aspects of mental illness I hadn't considered, and learning through the readings and films of the course really opening my mind. Additionally, you will learn writing strategies for essays that are not solely literature based, which I found incredibly helpful for the remainder of my college career.",
    "This course is a discussion of insanity in our society in both the past and the present. We read materials about psyche and insanity in our culture, and then we wrote four papers on different topics. This is a great class as well as great section. The material is very interesting and it made me more confident in my writing ability.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the fascinating topic of psychiatry. Be prepared to write a few papers, but you have a good amount of freedom in what you write about for most of the papers.",
    "If you absolutely need to take an english department class, consider researching your options. The workload is pretty significant in this class. It involves a lot of readings and writing. Make sure you end up in a section that interests you because writing 4 papers on something you dont find any value in can be quite unpleasant.",
    "Gives one great insight into the section one is studying and it's fun. I would recommend the class to a fellow student as it really forces you to critically analyze readings and passages, thus improving both your reading and writing skills at the same time.",
    "Yes, it is a useful class for establishing basics of writing needed for university level papers.",
    "I would definitely recommend it because I really do believe that I gained important insight about writing and learning about mental illness was absolutely a plus."
