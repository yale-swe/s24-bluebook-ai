   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Though brief, each class was pretty interesting. I do wish that the material was more thought-provoking, though. I feel like I didn't really learn anything -- maybe present more case studies?",
    "Great seminar. The instructor was very engaging and did an excellent job of presenting the material. This course would have been better if it was a semester-long discussion course (for one credit) rather than just a few sessions.",
    "Very interesting concepts brought up. Great course!",
    "Strengths included no outside work. Weakness was that lectures were hard to follow with no slides or visual presentation.",
    "This course skimmed a broad array of ethical topics in public health, but was extremely surface-level and did not address many of the most complex and thought-provoking challenges in public health. While it was informative, especially for those who did not already have a background in public health, the course focused on obvious issues rather than the more critical ones. Additionally, the course did not engage students. I did not hear the perspectives of my classmates on important public health issues and I felt that many students were not paying attention.",
    "Very interesting. Lecture style of this course did not make it engaging, however. I would have appreciated small group discussion or visuals during lecture.",
    "You just showed up and listened to a talk for 50 minutes or so. The material was fascinating at times, but it didn't add much to my overall understanding of public health.",
    "strengths -easy to follow material -challenging topic covered in a sensitive and thoughtful manner",
    "Course was intended to be an introductory seminar but I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed it. The instructor brought in history along with thoughtful ethical questions for the group to consider. I would be interested in taking another course that spanned the semester looking at many of these issues. Definitely a good required course for MPH students.",
    "Good. The talks were informative and I liked the use of anecdotes to illustrate some of the points. Hearing about ethical controversies is pretty interesting in and of itself",
    "I did not think this course was worthwhile. The topic of ethics is and I wanted to learn more about this but the way this course was designed was not conducive to learning any material. There should be a powerpoint or something rather than having the professor just talk at an audience for the allotted amount of time.",
    "Probably more interactive when not a lecture format",
    "Not very useful to have as a lecture course.",
    "Maybe better to add some discussions to the class.",
    "I thought that this course was a waste of time. Bioethics is an interesting subject and there was simply too much for the lecturer to cover in three classes so the message was lost. If you want us to do the certifications, okay, but the lecture did the field a disservice, and it was not the instructors fault. I also never found out if my certifications were okay.",
    "While I found the course material interesting, I did not feel engaged in the class in any way. The sole lecture format made it hard to absorb the information.",
    "Strength: Excellent professor, well-versed in the material, was able to provide a succinct vision of ethics and healthcare in only three classes. Weakness: Only three-classes, lecture-format.",
    "poorly structured, didnt learn much",
    "This course was useless. Most people scanned in and didn't even stay for the lecture. We sat and listened to a guy talk 3 times without the semester. We didn't engage with the material at all",
    "It could have been more public health focused.",
    "This course was so disorganized, and really didn't teach me much of anything. It was an hour and a half of someone talking to us, with no guidance or layout for what was to be presented. It hardly engaged anyone, nor did it make me feel any more equipped to tackle ethical dilemmas.",
    "Basic ethics course, professor definitely structured class in order for it to be relevant to public health. Interesting lectures.",
    "This course did not have much to offer. The course consists of 3 lectures with no exams or assessment; there is no reason to take notes or be actively engaged. Conversations about ethics may be better addressed in smaller groups with discussions rather than long lectures that could be dry at times.",
    "The lecture style was not the most conducive to having a true discussion on ethics. This course would have greatly benefited from being broken into discussion sections--smaller sections would have enabled students to have guided discussions about ethical issues in public health. This, articulating and hearing thoughts on the matter, may have been more useful than simply just learning thru a lecture.",
    "I think this class is really important to be taught and am glad I had the opportunity to take it. That being said, while there was some dialogue between students and the instructor, I think it would have been much more engaging if it was a discussion based class. **Needed improvement: better way to take attendance (iClickers? Mobile polling?)",
    "I think that this could and should be a full-semester-length class at SPH; there is so much interesting content regarding public health and ethics, so attempting to cover it in three weeks is crazy and meant that we weren't able to actually learn in-depth about anything. This would be much better served as a first-year requirement that lasts the whole semester, rather than a three-week mini-series.",
    "A good course - but not what I was expecting. Could there have been more concrete skill-building or group what-would-you do scenario activities?",
    "It was somewhat informative but often the material seemed rudimentary and common sense based. Strengths were historical examples of ethics dilemmas. A main weakness was that the main professor seemed highly opinionated, and had trouble entertaining some students' questions and concerns.",
    "This course was boring. I spent most of my time in lecture working on other material on my computer.",
    "It was a good course, but the lectures should have included slides or some sort of presentation.",
    "I felt this course was an unnecessary additional workload for students. The material covered can easily be incorporated into other classes so that students shouldn't have to attend an additional 80 minute long seminar during the week when they're already taking 5 classes, a 2 hours\/week professional skills seminar, and a department specific seminar (all this not including lab positions, extracurricular activities, and internships).",
    "Very interesting class that explored the nuances in public health ethics.",
    "I think scenarios and a more discussion-based learning environment would have been more beneficial. While this was certainly interesting, I think there's a lot to be learned from chatting through ethically challenging situations and seeing how others would react and process and make decisions would be extremely valuable.",
    "Disappointing and very boring.",
    "The course covered interesting topics but was not engaging. Because of this it felt like most of my classmates did not want to be there and most people did not pay attention or gain a lot out of the course. As it was 100% lecture based with no evaluation schemes, it was very easy to not do work for the course. The topics were interesting and I enjoyed the supplemental readings, however I believe interaction within the course would have helped me learn a lot more.",
    "I liked the supplemental readings used in the course, they enhanced lecture content.",
    "Strengths: Very necessary to have a course such as this Weaknesses: Classes were pretty random and bounced from topic to topic, I remember not knowing that we had reading homework the first class Improvement: I feel like a class like this should have more discussion to it. Maybe half the class could be lecture and half could be small group discussion.",
    "Not a very engaging course as it was taught in the Harkness lecture hall, the topics were interesting and important but may have been more effectively taught through smaller discussions.",
    "Useful overview of ethics in public health, which is necessary and important for public health students. I liked that the course was short and mostly a lax lecture style.",
    "It is a good course for learning about the ethical aspects of research.",
    "very informative, readings although optional were helpful in understanding the lecture",
    "Interesting clas",
    "great course!",
    "Course was bland, the professor seemed to have no interest in teaching. He read from the slides and didn't add any other substantial information. My undergraduate Epidemiology course was insanely better. Overall, I am unimpressed with the Public Health program as a result of this essential core course. These courses need to be taught by great professors if the program expects to move up in rankings.",
    "It was pretty terrible. No one stayed after attendance. No incentives to do the readings. Literally like half of the class always left about 10 minutes into class. Professor really didn't do anything but talk. very little discussion.",
    "good introduction to understand the ethical issues in public health.",
    "I think this is a very important topic in public health, and I think the course was not organized in a way that effectively communicated the ethical issues. in fact, there was minimal organization in this course and I think it needs a clear direction and goal to accomplish these goals",
    "- lectures were not effective, made material more confusing - required textbooks were not effective - learned majority of material from online resources - exams were poorly worded, unclear, and very different from homework material",
    "The speaker was engaging and knew what he was talking about, but he was \"talking at\" us and I didn't always know where he was going with things.",
    "Everything good",
    "It covers several topics in ethics and make you think but I don't get why this course is made into a 4 lecture series, which makes us feel like we don't need to prioritize it.",
    "The professor just stood on stage and talked at us. Some people were definitely engaged, but the majority were either asleep or on their laptops. There was no practical component that helped us learn how to be mindful of ethics in our research and public health practice.",
    "This course only have 3 lectures.",
    "Its strengths are that it is engaging and important for public health students to understand. The weakness is that it is not long enough and would benefit from being a smaller discussion size.",
    "Very good",
    "I quite enjoyed the lectures, but think it was a shame that they got progressively stronger\/interesting as the final one was fascinating but I feel many of my peers had already been turned off. Maybe just a short (10 min) online quiz regarding the lectures themselves at the end of the class could address this",
    "Absolutely phenomenal seminar course. Wish it had been longer. There is so much to cover an not enough time. Would love to take a full class from this instructor.",
    "Interesting and controversial subjects in public health were discussed. However, the presentation format was dry and failed to include student perspectives.",
    "Class was interesting and worthwhile",
    "I wish the course could have been longer and had more topics covered. I did not mind the lecture format, though I understand it is usually more interactive. The instructor was really knowledgeable and interesting to listen to.",
    "The instructor was fascinating, but I wish the format of the class was more engaging. It was difficult to sit through the seminar because it was so long and at the end of the day. The professor was super impressive and interesting though.",
    "it was fine",
    "The course is great to let you learn some relating knowledge in this area.",
    "Strengths: Not too much work, Interesting readings and lectures Weaknesses: Far too short to have any real meaning",
    "good length and content",
    "I was disappointed that the subject was treated as less important, or at least was talked about by other students in that way. Personally, I think this is a vital aspect of public health, one that is ingrained in the \"public\" nature of the profession. I was expecting more. I was disappointed to hear that previous years had small group discussions and more depth to Their coursework. It seems an oversight on Yale's part that the course structure would be different merely because a faculty member was on sabatical. I would think that would be unacceptable. I was expecting to be introduced to new concepts pertinent to our profession, but I wasn't at all. I didnt learn anything new. Now, maybe other students did, but I wasn't expecting the lowest common denominator from this course. I felt it was a short history lecture not a bioethics in public health course.",
    "Strengths: it is a great concept and the lectures were good Weakness: I would prefer this as an online lecture series with a quiz at the end as there were no in-class assignments. It would help if it was a asynchronous online course that students could listen to on their own time and respond to questions based on the lecture at the end of the lecture. I think the requirement to be physically in the class is a poor use of student and teacher time.",
    "While the information taught in the class was interesting, I thought it could have been taught differently.",
    "A very rudimentary introduction to public health ethics. For students (especially AP students with backgrounds in medical ethics), the course did not feel like an especially good use of time.",
    "I wish the course was still operated as it had been in the past with small group discussions, instead of just a two hour lecture.",
    "Excellent course.",
    "The contents are very useful. And I love the format of several small exams through the semester, which helps me understand the classes better.",
    "STRENGTHS -- The topics were crucial and fascinating. WEAKNESSES -- I would have preferred to take a semester-long, for-credit class instead of this class. I took a Medical Ethics class in college (it was in the Philosophy department but I was interested), and I would have liked to take a whole class on the topic, but there wasnt an obviously advertised option to do that. If I could redo this semester, I would have advocated to take a full class rather than this little no-credit thing. Additionally, there was not enough time to complete the online component, and I rushed through something that I would have preferred to take my time on.",
    "The instructor is clearly passionate and great at conveying the importance of ethics in public health. However, I really think this class is a waste of time. I would rather have an online training module than sit through some lecture.",
    "If you are going to make this a mandatory course, you should make sure that people actually stay in the class for the duration of lecture. I thought the course itself was relatively good, but many people did not make it through any meaningful portion of the lectures.",
    "clear course",
    "The course is useful.",
    "It was a good overview of ethical issues to students. I wish we had examined these issues more in-depth, but I can understand the limitations given the course size.",
    "The large class section made it difficult to have discussions, but the material was engaging",
    "Strengths - this course was extremely interesting, and bioethics is an important aspect of public health Weaknesses - there was little to no structure in this course, as the instructor just lectured to the audience and many students did not find this engaging and would try to skip class",
    "The format of the course made it extremely difficult to become and remain engaged. The course would be much better by students if it were more engaging",
    "This course was interesting but did not make a big impression in my mind. It is important to think ethically about public health, medical, and scientific matters, and the course may have been better as a weekly seminar.",
    "The course had little to nothing to do with the assessments that were required by the end of the semester. The class provided some interesting anecdotes that stimulated conversation and discussion amongst ourselves after class, but it was very difficult to stay engaged during a longer lecture rather than a discussion.",
    "This course is very important for learning the fundamental of ethics in public health. It also taught related policies we need to know for our research activities. Great lectures!",
    "Very interesting. The subjects are very interesting and it's a seminar; thus, you learn from just reading and hearing the professor speak.",
    "The course content is very interesting and relevant to all public health students, but it was hard to stay engaged in the class because it was lecture-based. This material is more suited for a discussion-based class, and I think I would have learned a lot more if I had been able to interact with my peers.",
    "Too big of a class. Interesting material but the lecture style Is horrible",
    "I'm pretty horrified that three lectures are viewed as sufficient for introducing MPH students to ethics. I thought this course was extremely unself-critical, insufficient and basic, and was kind of appalled that this is the only required background in ethics students at Yale receive. It was almost insulting to include an ethics requirement but have it be so small.",
    "Overall I liked this course. I learned more about the history of ethics violations relating to public health and the importance of ethics evaluations that are in place now to protect study subjects."

    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Instructor: Harvey Strengths: Lectures were relatively short Weakness: The lecture slides were relatively confusing; it was hard to determine what was important and what was not. In addition the practice exams were not always a good reflection of what the exam was going to look like.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Professor Stephen Latham was an excellent instructor and I greatly appreciated the fact that he did not use a power point and instead just had a conversation with us and was able to recall all the relevant information to the topic at hand.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0IMPORTANTLY, Kaveh Khoshnood was NOT my instructor this semester, although this evaluation form says so. It was a different man, of that Im sure. STRENGTHS -- The professor was an excellent lecturer, knowledgeable and entertaining, good at telling a story. -- The professor effectively conveyed the history and significance of ethical questions in public health. WEAKNESSES -- The professor could have held us accountable to do the reading, in spite of this being a no-credit course, by allotting 5 minutes each class to discuss 1 short reading that had been marked in advance for peer discussion in small groups. That would encourage students to keep up and engage with the topics covered.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Dr. Khoshnood is a very intelligent man and that shines through during lecture. This class is structured like a story and Dr. Khoshnood takes you through the history of ethical controversies in public health throughout time. There is very limited class participation and most students don't even take notes and just listen to the lecture.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Although we had only three seminars, the instructor did an excellent job. Without any visual help, the instructor explained the concepts clearly, and made the material appealing. Without the visual aid, we could solely focus on what he was talking about and think. His talk reflected the readings we did before classes, which was great.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0He is nice and patient.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Professor Khoshnood was an engaging lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0kaveh was on sabbatical",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0The instructor was not at all engaging and it definitely took away from the content",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0Professor Khoshnood is very knowledgeable and resourceful. He gave us very good letures and very interesting topics to think critically.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0He was able to answer the students' questions and was not shy in stating his opinion but did not enforce it to the students.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0The guest-lecturer brought some very interesting and thought-provoking questions into the course, but it would have been helpful if he had a visual aid to go along with the material.",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0He is good, but course doesnt allow any interaction w him",
    "Instructor: Kaveh Khoshnood \u00a0The instructor did a fine job with the material, but should have been given far more time and material to work with."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it; there's no workload and for those who don't have much background in ethics, it's a great intro into that world.",
    "Good seminar course. Although it is mandatory, I recommend it.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who is particularly interested in the field or if it is a required course",
    "A surface-level view of ethical topics in public health",
    "Interesting history on the ethics of public health. However, I did not get much out of the course other than some interesting stories. I do not feel as I though I am prepared to even start to tackle ethical questions in the public health field.",
    "Since it is mandatory, they have to take it anyways. I think this is a very low commitment class, so it won't waste your time. Sometimes, the talks are interesting.",
    "Good required course, I found it enjoyable.",
    "would recommend.",
    "So you have this class for three weeks. Basically the point is to get you to complete a couple of required certifications, the lectures seem to be an afterthought. The lecturer tries to teach as much as he can about a field he is clearly passionate about, but in three lectures it's too little time. Take the class because it's required, but if you are really interested in Bioethics, this isn't going to be helpful, just get a textbook from the medical library instead.",
    "The briefest of exposures to bioethics.",
    "It's a really silly requirement we have to get through. Hopefully they make changes to make it more engaging and useful.",
    "Not worth the time, hopefully the usual instructor is much better with this course.",
    "Basic intro to public health ethics. Worth knowing the history of prior research in public health and where the public health community could have done a lot better in terms of consent. Gives one a perspective on why IRB boards exist.",
    "This course had little to no workload so it was no pressure, but it often felt like a waste of time. Topics were pretty straight forward. I had previous exposure to all of the material and learned nothing new. Ethics can be very interesting, but this course was fairly dry. There was no engagement, the class was strictly lecture.",
    "A very quick run through of the history of ethics and why it is applicable to public health. Minimal outside reading, just have to attend lecture and turn in your training certificates.",
    "Required but no work and nothing really learned due to the class structure",
    "Required - interesting if you pay attention",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The time could be better spent elsewhere, in my opinion.",
    "Eh, it was ok. Mostly it just felt like a waste of time.",
    "It was a good course, but short and not super impactful without the slides or any homework.",
    "Honestly, I would not recommend this course to other students. The material is easily covered in a CITI certification process, which most students need to complete anyways in preparation for summer practicums\/research and the information is poorly retained outside the classroom setting when students are not provided with materials to prepare for the course. If YSPH truly feels this course is necessary then I would suggest incentivizing students to attend by providing course credit. Otherwise, I believe this seminar can easily be removed from the curriculum.",
    "Great course that explores a lot of ethical issues in public health practice.",
    "Required to graduate, just show up and do the HIPAA training I guess.",
    "This is an easy course. Do the supplemental readings as they help you get the most out of the course and are interesting, however do not expect to be fully engaged in class as it is primarily lecture based. Ethics is very important in public health so you should attend lectures and attempt to engage as much as you can on your own.",
    "Extremely helpful and beneficial in learning more about the ethical implications of public health research and practice.",
    "I think this course could be taught much differently in a manner that would better engage students. Currently, I would probably not recommend the class to another student just because ethics is so important and I don't think this was made super clear in class.",
    "This is a required course, besides the readings and two trainings there is not much work, and if you read the readings the class will be more engaging and interesting.",
    "The substitute instructor had some interesting and amusing anecdotes when discussing the various topics. Good course overall.",
    "I would recommend this because it is a short course and is very precise with what needs to be covered in classes.",
    "I would recommend!",
    "Do not take with Harvey.",
    "it is essential to understand what can be and cannot be done in public health, especially the safety issues. this course provides what you need to know before becoming a public health profession.",
    "Good",
    "Very superficial exposure to ethics. I would recommend the course content but not the format of the class.",
    "This seminar was a good introduction into bioethics for health care professionals.",
    "Very good",
    "This course is a necessity for anyone who wants to work in the public health field. Ethics are complex, and this course did a great job explaining them and inviting discussion for how to handle these complex, real world problems.",
    "This course is an extremely brief overview of ethics in public health. I wish it could have been longer, but ultimately if you're interested in this topic you will need to take additional courses.",
    "easy",
    "This course is interesting and in my opinion, it is important for a public health student to take this course.",
    "Good introduction to the background of ethics in public health and the importance of ethics in public health",
    "I would feel I couldn't aptly represent the course. It sounds like my year got the short end of the stick because Kaveh was away and so I could not describe what a future student would experience.",
    "It is a required course for which there is no requirement to be physically present in the classroom setting. It should be an online course module with a quiz at the end of a recorded lecture.",
    "It was a requirement but overall good",
    "This course is required. I would encourage them to go to office hours for clarification as the lectures were confusing at times.",
    "Absolutely. Its a great introduction to public health ethics.",
    "Yes. I think the course is a link between other methodology courses and actual application.",
    "This is a good brief first look at public health ethics for someone who is very busy and needs to understand the basics.",
    "A useful course for health students at Yale.",
    "Just sit there and do some work on your laptop. Don't worry about the readings.",
    "This is an easy class because all you have to do is show up. The ethical controversies brought up in class are important to think about through a public health lens. Overall, it's a good class for first years to take.",
    "Yes, just because the instructor is a great speaker.",
    "I will recommend it to other students.",
    "This is a good introductory course that provides an adequate ethical context and framework for students embarking on a public health education.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, and it is a required course to take. The course does cover very interesting material, and although the lecturer was just talking to the audience the whole time, I found him very engaging and easy to listen to.",
    "helpful for IRB",
    "This was a lecture style course that. You will learn a bit about the history of medical and public health ethics. You will also hear about case studies in which ethics is involved.",
    "Strongly recommend it to everybody!",
    "Yes i would recommend it regardless of whether it is a requirement or not.",
    "The course content is very interesting and relevant to all public health students, but it was hard to stay engaged in the class because it was lecture-based. This material is more suited for a discussion-based class, and I think I would have learned a lot more if I had been able to interact with my peers.",
    "Inadequate as an introduction to ethics - plan to find other ways to study the ethics of public health work.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as a light introduction to ethics."
