    "Essential for anyone in anthropology and very interesting for those in other departments. It prompts you to think about identity, politics, ideology, and communication in a different way.",

    "It fulfills my expectations to know more about structuralism. It is just good to have more tools in the conceptual bags of tricks. Whether or not they will work with the issue at hand is a test of a student's thinking ability and it is always a long shot."
