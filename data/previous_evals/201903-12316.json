   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this class - I am a senior history major focusing on early america, and I thought it necessary to take a course on the colonial period. I'm glad it was this course. It was accessible, the professor was lively and engaging. The essays were fun. I could not have asked for a better intro course.",
    "I loved how this course was only papers that were interactive. We got to go on field trips to look at documents and paintings that we then write papers on. It was a very well structured straightforward class.",
    "I think I got a good overview of the time period and events that occurred in different parts of America. I also think I became a better writer, since there were consistent papers and we had to analyze primary sources.",
    "Learned how to analyze primary source documents and interpret them with historical context. Learned about the different colonies in America including their founding, the demographics, the role of slavery, and the different cultures that formed.",
    "I gained valuable insight on the themes present throughout the colonial period of American history.",
    "I learned about the foundation of American colonial history -- largely from the American perspective. The course exams the dynamics between Native Americans, European settlers and slaves. The course is relatively basic, giving a brief overview of a various regions and cultural developments.",
    "I gained a better understanding of the first colonial settlements in America and their interactions as well as societal structure.",
    "I learned a lot about American Colonial History and also about essay writing, especially in a history class setting.",
    "Apart from the general knowledge of colonial American history, this course also does a good job focusing on the analysis of primary sources and the critical thinking involved with that.",
    "My historical analysis writing improved with TA and Professor's help.",
    "This course was an excellent overview of the cultural history of colonial America with a good mix of political history, religious studies, and economic history thrown in.",
    "I learned a lot about an area of history that was kind of left out by my school. I learned about the Roanoke and Jamestown colonies as well as Metacom's War, but I did not learn that area in much detail. This class filled in the blank spaces I had in American history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course is very accessible to all students - first years taking their first history course and seniors taking their tenth history course. It was also very engaging, something that many intro courses struggle with. Something that would have made it greater was if Prof. Tannenbaum engaged with the class a little more because the lectures were so small - the class definitely could have been a seminar, it was that small.",
    "It was really organized.",
    "Strengths: The professor is really nice, approachable, and clearly very knowledgable and makes the information fun to learn. I personally like that there weren't any exams because I always submitted drafts of my paper for feedback and the feedback was helpful, and so I felt like I was improving and learning with every paper. Weaknesses: The final essays are a bit too long (like 6 days to write 3000 words). I feel like I would have preferred 1 or 2 days to write 1500-2000 words, and I feel like this would have been a better assessment of my knowledge and skills related to the course.",
    "Strengths are that it offers a wide range of information about the colonial period. You learn a lot about how America was founded, so it's relevant to what's happening today. Weakness is that it didn't connect to the present as much as it could have - although understandable because it is a history course",
    "This course is very dry and does not teach any new information about the colonial period that has not been taught in the majority of American high schools. The strength is that it is not very demanding.",
    "The course does a good job of describing the regions and why they developed as so instead of lumping all of the colonies together as one.",
    "Make it more engaging",
    "The lectures were very engaging but could have been better connected to the readings or vice versa. It sometimes felt like the lectures were one fully connected course while the sections were another course which was connected by the readings.",
    "I feel like if we were able to more with the time that we had in Discussion Sections it would be better. I felt that class time was very efficient."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Take it if you are an american history major, or if you are anyone interested in learning about the beginnings of american history. the class touches on a lot of themes and topics, and it sets up really well not only the american revolution, but also the civil war. highly recommend this course!!",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. It's honestly not too hard if you put in the work to talk to your TA about each paper, submit your paper drafts for feedback from the TA, and then make all the necessary edits. The readings are chill and the lectures are very interesting. I feel like I was learning without doing useless memorization and that was really refreshing as a history major in a lot of larger history lectures. NOT A GUT though, because the papers are not graded easily but it is easy to improve if you put in the work. I really enjoyed this class and since it was small, I even made some friends along the way. Definitely good vibes.",
    "Yes. Great class to learn about early America and not difficult. information is interesting",
    "Yes, its a great place to start if youre interested in American history.",
    "No, it is simply not very interesting. It is decent for an introduction into the Colonial Period of American History and it was cool to use the archives for a paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as it gives a better insight into how certain aspects of America developed.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if theyre interested in American history pre-Revolutionary War. It was very informational.",
    "Colonial US was a tough subject to get engrossed in. For AMST majors, not bad.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in cultural historiography generally or American history specifically. If you are a first-year considering history or are a non-history major looking for a credit in this area, this course would serve you well. It is very approachable as a fifth course (i.e. you will enjoy it and benefit intellectually without having to spend hours grinding through the readings).",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I attended two history courses during shopping period. Obviously, that is just the tip of the iceberg for one of the classes, but, off the bat, I would say this was the better class."
