    "a good intro to texts",
    "I would definitely recommend H&P, and DS in general, to any students who are interested in the texts and want a firm foundation in the history of Western thought. It's a lot of reading and writing, but I really enjoyed the exercises in thinking critically through the texts in a deep way, especially in the context of the six DS courses in all.",
    "The spring semester of H&P feels a lot more continuous in the fall. Rather than half of our works being historiography and the other half political thought texts, everything followed the general trend of explaining the forces that would have to be at play for a government to work, particularly a government among equals. Reading Arendt at the end of the semester was amazing, and it was one of the rare instances that we really had the chance to discuss the 20th century in DS. Professor Lebron isn't the most intense of DS professors -- he cancelled class often and didn't spend too much time evaluating our essays -- but he is a very fun guy and knows a lot about political philosophy. He would always spend time discussing what the important preoccupations of each thinker was, and would put them in the context of the greater syllabus.",
    "DS H&P semester 2 is incredible. The texts are totally fascinating. Definitely take it!",
    "Good\u2014take it.",
    "Overall a good course, and though it has a bit of a disjointed feel to it, it is a great improvement from fall H&P. The readings are generally interesting and not excessively long.",
    "Historical and Political Thought remains the most underrated course of the Directed Studies trifecta, even though it arguably exhibits the most continuity between semesters and the individual texts. If first semester leans more towards \"History,\" this semester leans more towards \"Politics.\" The texts are, as always, in wonderful dialogue with one another, and it is particularly exciting to see the thin boundary between H&P and Philosophy dissolve as we study the likes of Rousseau and Arendt. Professor Lebron encouraged us to challenge the authors and critique their arguments, and his philosophical approach to the material revealed nuances and connections that a wholly historical approach might have missed. He was an extremely adept discussion leader who knew the right questions to ask and the right time to jump into the conversations. Unfortunately, due to snowstorms and parental emergencies, Professor Lebron had to cancel way too many classes, which really disrupted the flow of course, but was obviously and completely understandable given the circumstances. In any case, when he was there, he brought a warm and contentious attitude that really facilitated wonderful discussion.",
    "H&P second semester is a lot more about the individual and the individual's rights to power and agency which is a lot more engaging on a personal level in regards to living in a democratic republic. It's really interesting to see the literature behind a lot of the social and political stances we take for granted today, and DS allows and asks you to challenge what we take as custom. It's a great way to revisit and bring back to life dead white guys in order to engage them and see why they thought what they thought."
