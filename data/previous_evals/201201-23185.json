    "good class, but instructor\/topic is important",
    "There are four papers, only one of them is 8-10 pages (which is most of your grade), the rest are 4-5 pages long. You also have reading responses due before every class which he then uses to direct the discussion in class. These can become pretty tiresome though. Make sure to give 100% to each paper especially the third one because he likes to see a progression. He will most likely give you a B in the beginning but Ithink he does this to motivate you to continue to improve your writing.",
    "It's an intro to academic writing. Take it if you want to work on argumentative essays.",
    "The course does exactly what it promises. It's a great intro. to college-level academic writing, and Prof. Arvind gives great feedback. Definitely take it.",
    "Take it! This class will probably use lots of your time, but it is worth it. You will learn a lot and be much more ready for your future coursework at Yale. Professor Thomas is a really cool guy and will try to help you as much as he can throughout the semester."
