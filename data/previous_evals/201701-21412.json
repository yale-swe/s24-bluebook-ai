    "In this course, I not only learned about the origins and early history of the science fiction genre (particularly in the mode of futurity\/time travel), but also about different conceptions of futurity, different schools of though such as futurism, modernism and postmodernism, and what conceptions of temporality, past, and present can bring to bear on our understanding of humanity.",

   "comments": [
    "The reading selections were incredibly interesting and unique, though I wish we had a bit more writing assignments and feedback before the final paper to help absorb and work through the materials.",
    "This course uses \"the future\" as a central theme to tie together very disparate but equally fascinating genres and formats of literature. Professor Williams was extremely engaging and the course fostered great discussions.",
    "The books are incredibly interesting and incite thought-provoking discussion. There was freedom in choosing novels for the final paper which allowed students to explore their personal interests within the genre. Professor Williams was great! I enjoyed the field trip to see futurist art and books as well.",
    "A wide variety of literature was covered, the discussion style was structured very well to facilitate student discourse",
    "This course has no weaknesses because it is absolutely fantastic. This was without a doubt my favorite course I have taken at Yale thus far. The reading list is super: from classics such as H.G. Wells' \"The Time Machine\" and Phillip K. Dick's \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\" to recent novels such as Octavia Butler's \"Kindred,\" this course has it all. Prof. Williams also added a couple seminal science-fiction films to the course, namely Stanley Kubric's \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" Not only did this course have a superb body of texts, the implementation of these texts in class discussions was equally superb. Science fiction and futurity as a genre are often used to shine light on the present 'human condition' (if you will), and this was certainly true for our class as issues of race, class, gender, social hierarchy, evolution, etc. were constantly at play throughout the course of the semester. Moreover, Prof. Williams's love for the subject matter is evident, which makes the course all the more enjoyable. To top it all off, the final project for this course requires one to select a 'missing text' and tie in the text to the course's key themes, while also analyzing the text in the context of pertinent secondary discourse. This final assignment is the only assigned work beyond keeping up with the reading, which I would absolutely recommend since every text reads quickly and is profoundly engaging. The final assignment is essentially an opportunity to delve into your inner geek and write an academic essay about a text you are particularly interested in; this could be a novel or even a TV show or video game (both of which were represented this semester-one student wrote about WestWorld!). Overall, this course is a fantastic opportunity to explore the realms of futurity and science fiction, and go through a fairly relaxed writing process that culminates in an interesting series of class presentations.",
    "The syllabus and structure were excellent. I appreciated the open discussion format but liked how Prof was happy to take the lead when the class was less well-read than we should have been for a class. Also the semester-long project was such a great way to get into a text and write a paper. I don't know how this class could be improved.",
    "This course has a fantastic set of literature as it's reading list! I really enjoyed the seminar format and the structure of the final project for the class. I would suggest perhaps adding one more novel and removing one of the more corporate readings (either the year 2000 or shell global scenarios) as those seemed to cover the same general ideas and weren't the most interesting to read. Also, even though prof. Williams has interesting stories, I would have preferred a bit more time to discuss the books and a little less time listening to prof. Williams, to take advantage of the seminar format."

   "comments": [
    "The selections of reading materials are super interesting and thought provoking. The discussions aren't exactly rigorous, especially for a junior seminar, but still learned so much about questions of futurity, technology, sci-fi, etc.",
    "I would undoubtedly recommend this course. The syllabus includes a vast variety of material and fosters great discussion. I always loved hearing Professor Williams' thoughts because he is extremely knowledgable on the subject(s). The workload is principally weekly reading (no reading responses) which is great because the works are things you actually are excited to read. The written assignments revolve around an independent research project regarding any text that you think could fit in the syllabus (Prof Williams is very lenient on that definition). While I ended up really loving the topic I chose, I also wished I could've taken the time in a writing assignment to work through ideas about works we read in class too.",
    "The class had a great reading list and very thought-provoking discussion on the future. I would definitely suggest it. Outside of class reading there is a paper proposal, a bibliography, and the final paper and presentation.",
    "Very fun class",
    "I would highly recommend this course. I love sci-fi so it was great to be able to read and discuss many of the texts that we did in this class. The final paper is a very fulfilling paper to write as Professor Williams really allows a lot of freedom in it, giving everyone the opportunity to approach it in a different way, which leaves a lot of room for growth from the students.",
    "Definitely take this course. Relatively low workload but you still get to read and explore a wide range of sources. The final project let's you pick your own source and argue a case for why it belongs on the syllabus which is pretty cool.",
    "A great, easy-going class where you get to read awesome books. I would recommend it to anyone interested in science\/speculative fiction",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student without a single doubt. The subject matter is deeply interesting and Prof. Williams is a fantastic and charismatic instructor - in fact, his role for this course is much less instructor than 'facilitator'; while he certainly teaches concepts and guides discussion, he encourages students to drive the course through their own interests and commentary.",
    "By far my favorite class at Yale. 10\/10 - never felt like work. I've recommended this class to everyone. Professor Williams is the GOAT.",
    "If you're interested in science fiction then yes! I got a great reading list out of this class, and I really enjoyed doing the assigned readings. As a science major I also found this class to be more approachable than other English classes as there were many non-majors in the class. The literature was approachable, but the class discussions were still seriously academic, which was great."
