    "The format of Arabic 130 will be very familiar to those who have taken 110 and 120, but there are fewer lessons that are purely grammar or vocabulary and much more of the learning is based on complete reading, listening, or speaking exercises. This class seeks to build on the individual elements learned in lower levels to increase fluency in conversation and overall complete comprehension.",
    "Best term of Arabic I've had so far. This course is relatively well organized and set up so that you build on your existing skills in the language to improve speaking, reading, and writing. We went through five chapters in Al Kitaab part two and read real source material that was designed for native speakers. This course would be better if it placed more emphasis on spoken communication; although my spoken Arabic did improve, I wish I had more opportunities to practice. It would be best if students of Arabic were pushed to speak in all the terms of Arabic, starting from level one. Too often, it seems that our grasp of basic communication is missing. Some teachers emphasize speaking more than others; Sarab is one of them. I definitely recommend that students of Arabic take this! Your Arabic will vastly improve and it is soooo worth it. However, the course is a fair amount of work. At least two hours of homework a night and studying for tests takes a while.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student, especially one after Arabic 120. Beginning the class without having done Arabic 120, it is certainly possible for a person to enter this class after high school Arabic as long as he or she has completed the first Al-Kitaab book. Most likely someone entering straight from high school Arabic will have less vocabulary than other students but will have greater understanding of grammatical structures.",
    "Very intense and well-taught language class, absolutely recommended.",
    "This is a great intermediate class in arabic that will progress your proficiency in the language a lot. I would definitely recommend this for anyone interested in learning Modern Standard Arabic."
