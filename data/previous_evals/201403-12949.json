   "comments": [
    "GREAT introduction to art history. Enriching look at architecture, painting, and sculpture. Wonderfully enriching.",
    "No-- was somewhat interesting, but not worthwhile. I felt like I wasted an immense amount of time just trying to memorize images. Maybe, take it Credit\/D\/Fail, and don't worry about memorizing that much, but then on the other hand that's almost all of what the exams require... You can certainly find a better (and less work) than this one.",
    "Yes, definitely",
    "Take this class if you're interested in the time periods covered! If you're just looking for an interesting art history survey course, maybe take the introductory History of Art course that covers Impressionism, modern art, etc. That said, the professors for this class were incredibly passionate about the material, and very helpful and approachable -- I found myself actually engaging with the artwork (even the cave paintings!). The workload was also pretty light: two short papers, a midterm, and a final, all very straightforward if you're used to the brute memorization required for History of Art assessments.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all art lovers. It was a good experience and I took it without ever having taken an art history class before. Yes, you do have to memorize art pieces, but you learn so much more than dates and titles. I am able to see art in a different way and I am able to understand the thought processes that went behind them. The reading is not too difficult (a little long) and the professors are very passionate. I recommend this to all!",
    "It is what it is--an overview. There are better courses to take (intermediate level), which might even give a better introduction to history of art as a discipline because you can really get into understanding the art; this class is so broad that it is overwhelming at times, and likely, you won't feel satisfied at the end. Beware of inconsistent grading (Prof Gaifman), but hopefully it will go back to only being taught by Prof Jung, who is great.",
    "It's OK. The lectures are good and the sections are interesting because they are held in the art gallery. The papers are fine but the exams seemed a bit unfair given their reliance on rote memorization.",
    "I would only consider recommending this if you take it Credit\/D. Even then, I would hesitate. I really enjoyed the sections in the Art Gallery as well as the lectures, but the exams leave you with such a bad taste in your mouth that, by and large, makes it hard to enjoy the class.",
    "A nice intro class",
    "Good class you look at images on the big screen and yeah, that kind of sucks compared to the real thing, but you end up learning a lot (good prep for if you actually do visit the artworks we discuss eventually!). Both lecturers were easy to understand and obviously really loved what they were talking about. The best part of this was section, where you go to the YUAG and look at\/discuss actually art from the periods\/in the styles you talk about in class. The book was actually pretty helpful, so I highly highly highly recommend buying AND reading it. Workload not too bad reading for class, two very-doable papers, and two challenging but not impossible exams.",
    "I would recommend this course, at the very least as a Credit\/D course. It's a great intro to art history, and I learned a lot about history, the evolution of western art, and techniques to observe art.",
    "Summary: Fantastic survey of art history from the Prehistoric Era up to the beginning of the Renaissance, but with a great deal of memorization required. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even those who might not profess to have been very fascinated by art history in the past. It may surprise you and bring out in you an interest and an appreciation for many works that you might at one time have overlooked. And it is also an excellent way to visualize our history. Humans are nothing if not very visual creatures, and this supplements our written record in a stunning way.",
    "The teachers were nice and clearly enjoyed their subject, which is great, but the problem was that the subject was super boring, and this is coming from an art major. I think the most frustrating part is studying for the exams because you just spend hours remembering the dates and places of 200 images, and this information is so unimportant. I thought you would learn more about how to look at art or how historical events effect art, but it doesn't go as deep. Basically, it's exhausting.",
    "This is a fantastic course. The workload is extremely manageable (weekly section, two short papers, two exams). The material is so interesting that I actually enjoyed studying it. Take this course if you want to broaden your mind in a low-stress context. I would encourage anyone to take this course. The amount of material to learn means this is not a gut, but with enough work, a high grade is attainable. Oh, and the professors are GREAT. Take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The professors are excited about their topics and the sections in the art gallery are awesome.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Even if not for a requirement, you will come out knowing things about art that everyone ought to know.",
    "I recommend this class even if it isn't within your normal field of interest.",
    "HSAR 112 is a fabulous course for budding art historians and those otherwise inclined. I hold it in such high regard, and would sing the course's praises to anyone I encounter. My only word of warning for those who have taken art history before, is that the course is essentially AP Art History with a few different pieces (maybe).",
    "meh",
    "If you aren't interested in a specific type of art, this is a great intro class. It's a survey course, so not much time is spent on any specific period. There are two tests and two papers--both of the papers are enjoyable to write. Both Professor Gaifman and Professor Jung are wonderful instructors!",
    "It's a great class, and it doesn't require too much work on a weekly basis. However, the midterm and final were challenging because they required a lot of memorization (it took copious hours of studying). Also, it was an adjustment writing essays for an art history class because I had never written one before. Overall, the lectures are great and the sections are really cool because they take place in the art gallery.",
    "A good survey course to take if you want to have a tough understanding of art history. I walked away with a lot learned.",
    "I would say that with the exception of 2-3 fantastic lectures this class was a waste of time. Lectures are long and either confusing or boring, grading is tough, and you can learn all the information from an art history book off amazon. Definitely would recommend taking other seminar based or different art history classes, since the only good part of class was the section. Even if you have no experience in art history- don't start with HSAR 112.",
    "Yes. A solid overview of important works. Lectures are good, and the sections--which usually involve looking at pieces in the YUAG--absolutely make the course.",
    "It's an overview of art from Prehistory up until before the Renaissance. I would take it if you are interested in looking at the art of more ancient societies and not modern paintings and such.",
    "A great introduction to history of art, but that requires by definition a lot of rot learning."
