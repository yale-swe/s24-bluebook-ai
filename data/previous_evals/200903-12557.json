    "Great class, not too hard. Everyone who cares about American history or the Constitution should take one of Akhil Amar's classes.",
    "A great class to take if you want to understand the American Constitution in a way that completely transcends anything you've ever learned in a basic government\/history class. This class allows you to see why our society has evolved in conjunction with how the document has guided the people.",
    "Take it. If you're interested in political science this is definitely an interesting course for you. Even if you're not, Professor Amar brings life to his lectures and it is definitely worth the time.",
    "Take this class!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it for anyone at all interested in the Constitution or our government.",
    "Great class! Would definitely recommend. A midterm take home exam and a final paper as well as some participation is factored into the grade.",
    "This class provides interesting perspective on the Constitution and its history. I recommend the class only to people who are very interested in the subject because lectures are repetitive. I don't recommend taking section for this class because it does not add additional insight into the class. The discussion board website is not utilized properly in this class and is really only looked at by the TA but is not incorporated into lecture or section. This class has great potential but the syllabus and lecture need to be improved. Amar's opinion dominates and little attention is paid to opposing viewpoints. The syllabus only includes Amar's book-which is a problem because he basically restates each chapter in the book at lecture each week.",
    "Meh. Lecture wasn't particularly interesting. The real appeal is the sections, which were led by great TAs. This class is probably never going to be taught again, so you can probably ignore this review anyway. In fact, what are we doing here in the first place? My God, I've wasted three minutes now reviewing this class, and for what? Nobody's going to learn anything from it. Everyone knows Akhil Amar is a big name at Yale. Will one measly review really affect anything at all? Probably not. But here you go.",
    "This was an interesting class and a good way to learn more about the Constitution. Professor Akhil Amar is passionate and knowledgable about his subject matter, and for being such a celebrity, he is extremely accessible. This class was as much about him as the Constitution, though--and often involved a lot of his personal biases, against the South, for example. He used \"The Constituion: A Biography\" basically as lecture notes, so you could just read the book, which is very compelling.",
    "Take it if you're really interested in the Constitution... don't expect to learn a lot outside of it. It was a good Credit\/D for someone with no background in Political Science.",
    "If it's ever taught again, it's worth taking. If you don't have the time, just audit it: most of what you get out of this class, you get from Akhil Amar's lectures, and they are usually clear and insightful. The workload is nothing like Con Law.",
    "This course deals more with history\/political philosophy than the law (as opposed to Amar's conlaw where you read cases). Amar has a handful of points that he recycles several times--he gets them across very well, but it can seem extremely repetitive (especially the second half of the semester). Still, it's very interesting to see how Amar thinks. Sure, overall it is definitely worth it.",
    "I didn\u0092t think this class would really be Amar riffing for over an hour to the amusement of the community, but it was. I wish it held itself to a more rigorous questioning than what Amar thought was fun for the day. He is a knowledgeable professor and it was nice to read a book and have another voice alongside it, but past that, I wish I had taken a real class. Enjoy your Con Law.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to hear what one of the world's foremost law professors has to say about the US Constitution. It's also a good option for anyone looking for a light workload--the only grades are for an in-class, open-book\/open-note essay midterm, a 12-20 page final paper, and participation in discussion section (i.e. you only have to work twice during the semester).Discussion sections are also a great opportunity to get to know a Yale Law student. My TA was brilliant, fun (brought us cake!), and I feel I learned a lot from him about what it would be like to pursue the law school track.That said, Fall 09 was the first time this class was offered, and I'm sad to say that it showed. Each week, we read a chapter of Professor Amar's book, then went to two two-hour lectures on the same material from the same person, which meant that we heard the same things all over again, twice. Luckily, Professor Amar knows that this was a trial run, so hopefully will have lots of improvements in place for the second time around. So take my advice with a grain of salt!",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you plan on reading the book alone and writing a long term paper on a completely unrelated topic to anything you've learned. The class was horriblydeceiving and a waste of time.",
    "It is essentially a course on the history of the Constitution as a document, as well as its implications in later American history.",
    "The class is fun, and you'll get a full dose of Amar's views on Rhode Island, South Carolina, George Washington, Mason, Madison, and Lincoln. That being said, you'll get them over and over and over and over and ov.......The lectures are pretty much Amar's book in condensed form.The section I was in was really good. I enjoyed it more than Lecture.",
    "I would only recommend it if you're actually interested in the material. For me, it got pretty boring.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. If you've never had a political science class before, this class introduces some of the main topics. If you've had political science classes before, this will change the way you look at the Constitution. If you hate the American system of government, this will change your mind. If you've had ConLaw, this is the exact same thing without the nasty court cases; more Constitution, less law. Though if you've had ConLaw, it'll REALLY make the final project a lot easier.",
    "Amar is a legend. This course won't be offered again, but take anything from Amar.",
    "I wouldn't take the class. It was geared mostly for the public who was auditing.",
    "This is an interesting course if you like American history and\/or the constitution. Amar is an engaging lecturer, so I would recommend this class.",
    "The class was okay. Very repetitive, but a good Credit\/D class.",
    "Great class.",
    "Worth taking but Akhil Amar's grading reputation (hard) should be taken seriously.",
    "Good overall- quality declined after the midterm as far as excitement- but it definitely changed my perspective on the original intent of the Constitution.",
    "Straight from Amar's Book. I would recommend Constitutional Law over this class if it is available.",
    "It was a very accessible guide of the constitution and its history. I wouldn't really recommend the course though. Just read the book.",
    "Prof. Amar is a great lecturer and a brilliant constitutional scholar. He has a very particular view of the Constitution that some may find too doctrinal. He can be very funny, but sometimes at the expense of snide comments about conservative politicians and South Carolina.This was the first time he taught this course, and I got the feeling was was so excited that he covered the material for the whole course through tangential references in the first half of the semester.",
    "This course won't be taught again, so this might be moot. Take ConLaw if you can, as it is a better version of this course.",
    "TAKE ANY CLASS AKHIL AMAR IS TEACHING. JUST DO IT.",
    "Constitutional Law without the Case Law. Easier, but less substantive too.",
    "Dull",
    "A class on the beauty of the constitution. If that at all sounds intriguing, then take it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're interested in the Constitution.",
    "Like Amar's famed ConLaw, except with less Law and more Con(stiutional history). This was the first year he taught the course, and it was a little rough around the edges, but it was still thoroughly interesting, and enjoyable (not to mention easy), and I could see this course becoming another Yale classic.",
    "This course was truly a joy to take and Professor Amar's insights were like music to my ears; this class was, without a doubt, one of the best I have taken at Yale. So often, the Constitution is studied for a day in high school history classes and people are taught Charles Beard's tale about the Constitution being written by wealthy, propertied elites. In a way that is not possible in Constitution Law--where the focus is much more on case law than on the document itself--I feel like I really learned a considerable amount about intricacies of the Constitution and the founding of our country. For instance, Professor Amar discusses the requirement that candidates for the presidency be at least 35 years old and explains how this was not arbitrary and capricious, but rather an anti-dynastic clause. Or, he explains how the true great failing of the Constitution was the 3\/5s clause which ultimately created perverse incentives for slavery to expand because the South benefited in Congress, the Electoral College and even in the Judiciary.Unlike so many History and Political Science classes, Amar's aim is not to make you memorize facts or dates. Rather, he wants students to think critically about the Constitution. The exam was open-book, open-note and could be taken either in-class in an hour and fifteen minutes or at home in eight hours; there were options that did not even involve material in the class, but asked students to think about an anachronistic clause of the Constitution. The term paper was like a seminar paper and allowed students to pursue any topic of interest.Section was optional, but my section was extremely rewarding and Professor Amar's TAs are without a doubt the best at Yale. I truly hope this class is taught again because",
    "My recommendation isn't required. You're going to take this regardless because it's Akhil Amar.",
    "We studied a different section of the Constitution about every week, addressing the origins and consequences of different constitutional clauses.",
    "It's a fantastic class, if offered again, everyone should take it. Don't be fooled, it also incorporates history inside the material, but it's simply fascinating.",
    "A pretty good class. Amar is a very engaging speaker, but he sometimes presented the material in a manner that was overly simplified. Perhaps this is because it was the devane lecture? Also, it sort of felt like he was stretching a bit to make this material last an entire semester. While his conlaw class is supposedly much more work, it sounds like it's probably worth it. That being said, the subject was still interesting and the class still enjoyable.",
    "YES, it's a very interesting class. Professor Amar's research is very impressive and interesting. In terms of workload, it was one midterm and a final paper.",
    "Yes - it was a good class, and wasn't too much work.",
    "I'm glad I took the class; Akhil Amar has a lot of great thoughts on the Constitution; but the lecture and the reading were horribly redundant. This might not be relevant because he probably won't do another DeVane Lecture, but it seemed like he was playing to the crowd of community adults who weren't doing the reading, so he just repeated everything in his book. I stopped going to lecture midway through the semester. The final paper is 60% of the grade, so make sure that you can get excited about some serious research.",
    "Take Prof. Amar's far more serious Constitutional Law course instead if possible. While the Constitution itself is an important topic, Prof. Amar's lectures are dragged out and repetitive. The ability of your TA to supply interesting additional material and facilitate discussion can break or break your experience. Also, the fact that the class is opened to the public as part of the devane lecture series means various kooks come in to monopolize \"question time\" in the last minutes of lecture.",
    "A nice class to take if you want to know more about the Constitution and the theory behind it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. It's not very compelling, nor does it push you very much. over the semester, it becomes somewhat perfunctory, and you end up wishing you didn't have to go to class. (that is, if you're the kind of person who feels an obligation to go to every class no matter what)",
    "This was a good class but you don't need to go to the class after the midterm. If you either do the reading or go to class you'll be fine. On Weds Professor Amar mostly repeats what he said on Monday and on Monday he says what he wrote in the chapter you just read. I recommend taking it with a section because the TAs (I had Jeffrey) are helpful in writing your essays, preparing for the midterm, etc.",
    "This is a really fun course. There isn't too much reading or written work, and the lectures are really interesting. It's fairly similar to Professor Amar's Constitutional Law course, though not the same, so it will be pretty easy but still interesting for people who have taken that.",
    "It is somewhat repetitive at times, but really fascinating- it is really cool to hear what Professor Amar has to say when he is not as constrained as he is in Con Law (when he has mountains of case law to work through). Not too much work- a reasonable essay midterm, a final paper, discussion postings, optional sections, and only Amar's ACAB as reading (which is not necessary after the midterm). Also, despite what some people (who haven't taken this class) might say, this is not the same as Con Law- you can (and should) take both- this is more history and political science while Con Law is more case law based.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this to another student. Just read his book instead.",
    "This was an awesome class! I highly recommend it to everyone--even if you've never considered political science before. Professor Amar lays down a comprehensive understanding of the Constitution that one would be hard pressed to find anywhere else. It will leave you questioning what you learned in high school.",
    "This course was basically a waste of time. There was very little material spread thin across a whole semester. Even Amar, whom I like a lot, didn't seem to think it was particularly rigorous. This course would be improved by having a curriculum beyond simply one pseudo-academic book on the Constitution.If you want a course to which you can never ever show up and still basically grasp the major themes of the course, this is it. It will give you a credit to put on your transcript. That is about all it will do.",
    "It was an OK class. I would not go through it again. Just read Amar's book instead.",
    "The DeVane Lecture Course 192 01 provides a very interesting prospective on the US Constitution, a historical analysis comparing the Constitution to state, colonial, and British practices. Professor Amar is extremely knowledgeable on all matters relating to the Constitution and has interesting interpretations of important clauses. The class is structured around his book, America's Constitution: A Biography, and is open to both students and the public. Overall I\u0092d highly recommend the class for anyone with an interest in the US political system.",
    "To undergrads, I would not recommend this class -- I feel it was geared more toward community members than toward students. Professor Amar rambles and often repeats in lecture exactly what you just read in his book. On the plus side, there is barely any work for the class, just a midterm (taken in class or 24 hours) and a final paper (so if you're taking the class Credit\/D, you can stop coming to class after the midterm if you want). Section is optional, but whether you take it or not you have to post on the classes v2 discussion board, which is annoying. Overall, I wish I had taken Con Law instead of this class.",
    "THE BEST COURSE. So unbelievably amazing. I knew nothing about this material before taking this course, and I learned so much--it's interesting for everyone, even if youre not familiar with the material to begin with. if you want a taste of the constitution and con law, but can't put in the time for the much harder version that is con law, you should take this class. it's really the kind of information that you'll want to know for the rest of your life, and change your everyday discussions about politics. Amar is so inspiring!!",
    "If you care about America, take it.",
    "I recommend this class only if you are VERY interested in the topic. Everyone in this class is already an expert on the Constitution, so don't take it if you know nothing about it. It's really hard to do well if you do.",
    "It probably wont be offered again, but Amar is better for Con Law than this course.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It was dry and repetitive",
    "Professor Amar is a knowledgeable speaker and a fabulous author, but the lecture was poorly structured and difficult to follow at times. One could learn almost as much from him by reading his book. This class is what you make of it- the exam and paper topic were very open in both length and subject-matter, and section was optional.",
    "This class was average. The syllabus--consisting only of Professor Amar's book-- is ultimately, and not surprisingly, rather dry.",
    "This was a great course. Most of the emphasis was on the final paper. The TAs all seemed to be excellent - I think this is characteristic of the students Amar selects to be his TAs. I intend to take conlaw as well.",
    "A Guided Tour of the Constitution was a course that examined the Constitution from adifferent perspective than the norm. It was illuminating and fascinating. I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student, but unfortunately, as a Devane lecture course, this was the only time it would be offered.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The work load was really what you made of it, and it was not too much pressure. The 20 page final paper was intimidating, but you can really pick any topic you want and make it interesting for yourself. It was a little hard to be graded on so few assignments, but I really learned a lot without too much work.",
    "Prof. Amar was great. His lectures did get repetitive though. Josh was an excellent TA!",
    "Very interesting subject material. Lectures are not necessary, but reading the book is.",
    "This course was a great analysis of seemingly simple ideas in the Constitution, and most lectures presented an unbiased and convincing perspective of those ideas. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone that wishes to learn more about the subject of the Constitution or the (as you will learn) convoluted history of the document itself.",
    "Take it, if only to hear Akhil Amar.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class."
