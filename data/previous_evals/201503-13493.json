    "I would recommend SOCY 018 to everyone. This class is a great opportunity to experience what a seminar is like and to read a lot of interesting texts that will basically make you question your life (in the best way possible). However, there is a lot of reading involved.",
    "SOCY 018 is a great class that discuss interesting topics. Prof Adams is not only great at facilitating discussion, but super sweet and receptive as well. Readings can be hard and long, and I was happier when I started to pick and choose which readings to do in the second half of the semester. Take it if you get the chance.",
    "100%. The vibe of each class was wonderful-- always relaxed, everyone responding to each other's opinions thoughtfully (I didn't even resent that it was at 9AM!). The ideas we discussed in that class will definitely stay with me for a long time, and guide my thinking outside of the classroom.",

    "This class opened up my mind to the exciting possibilities of academia. It served as the perfect introduction to college-level thought, reading and discourse with other students. I felt very much in the driver's seat when it came to class discussions and analysis of the readings, and Professor Adams did a wonderful job supporting our individual research and interests.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone. The sociological way of thinking that I was introduced to in this course is something that I will take with me beyond college.",
    "A excellent introduction into sociology and definitely recommended, even if you are not interested in majoring in sociology.",
    "This is a phenomenal class. I have grown a new perspective on things and now understand why students at Yale are so unique-for their passion and intellectual curiosity-which we all exhibit in this class because of how open and thought-provoking it is.",
    "A lot of reading, not much actual work, and fun discussion. Yes.",
    "Yes! Especially for Professor Adams, and because I think a general introduction to sociology is a wise class to take.",
    "You will like this class if you like sociology. Professor Adams is incredibly nice. The theme of the class was modernization, however don't expect to approach the topic like one would imagine you would do in a philosophy class. Work consists of readings, a weekly blog post, and a final 10 page paper at the end of the semester.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. The readings are consistently thought provoking, and the class discussions were always free flowing and in depth.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it was an interesting introduction to sociology that traced a range of themes across different cultures (although mostly western civ) and made use of the varied backgrounds of the students.",
    "Sociology 018 is history for people who prefer explanations and theories of history to the memorization of dates and movements. It is an apt introduction to sociology, and I highly recommend it to people remotely interested in the social sciences.",
    "A great introductory course to the world of sociology. Prof. Adams really really is the reason why i loved this course so much. She did such a great job of picking the readings to fit in perfectly with it each other, and to logically come together in the end. She is so available and ready to help and if you have never heard of Norbert Elias, Durkheim or Marx, THAT'S OKAY! This course is exactly for you! TAKE THIS COURSE! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! Every blog post lets you consolidate what you learnt and that really helped and please dont procrastinate your final essay (which might also be on a video game FYI! So much fun)"
