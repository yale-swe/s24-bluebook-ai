    "If you know nothing about video, I imagine it would be helpful. It's a lot about experimental video - so be willing to take a step outside your comfort zone. But if you already know what you're doing, I'd say just skip ahead to a more focused class that's going to give you what you want.",
    "It's a great course overall. You learn powerful editing software like Final Cut Pro. You also learn about and use a whole range of digital cameras. Workshops cover basics on lighting, green screen, etc. Very open-ended assignments mean you can do whatever interests you.Johannes is a solid instructor and a good guy.The course is really what you make of it, and if you're at all interested in learning how to make videos, I'd go for it.",
    "Yes, you will definitely learn final cut pro, and as much of after effects and premiere as you want",
    "Definitely worth taking. It is more rewarding if you are willing to put forth effort and bring new ideas to the table.",
    "Great introduction to video art. We had weekly video art screenings starting from its origins to now. We learned Soundtrack Pro, Final Cut Pro, and Adobe AfterEffects. Workshops were difficult to follow because we covered so much material in such a short amount of time so you'll need to learn the programs on your own for the most part. As you make more and more videos, it will become easier. I recommend the course for anyone interested in using video as a medium for art. This is not a film course so if you are interested in traditional films rather than video art, be prepared to keep an open mind about creating video art pieces. The amount of work depends on how much you put in. During crit, it will show. The instructor for this course changes frequently so it depends on who's teaching but my experience with Johannes was great. He is very helpful in and out of class. He also manages the equipment office so this will come in handy when you are making your videos.",
    "Great intro to everything you can do with digital video! Also great introduction to contemporary video art!"
