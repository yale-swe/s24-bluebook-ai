   "comments": [
    "Interesting topics chosen. Could use more of a theme though. Maybe split the course: fall- bacterial pathogens and spring-viral\/ fungal pathogens. Guest lectures, ok , but made the course feel more like another seminar.",
    "I loved this course and enjoyed it much more than last semester's section. The more relaxed pace of the course (compared to last semester) helped me gain a stronger understanding of the course material.",
    "Fantastic course all around. Group work can be a little aimless and frustrating. Guest speakers were awesome.",
    "By far my favorite class! Awesome material!",
    "I really learned a lot in this class, and appreciated that Jamie emphasized overarching themes in infectious diseases. It was slightly less organized\/structured compared to last semester, which was a weakness. Overall, I was very happy with this class.",
    "Fantastic entry level course in EMD. Jigsaw is both a strength and weakness. I know the topics I studied and presented very well, but some of the topics other students presented are not as memorable to me. The timing of guest lectures was sometimes unusual, but it did not make the course worse to take. Homework assignments were some of the best I've had.",
    "This was, by far, my favorite class this semester. I liked the survey style and guest lectures. Homework assignments were fun, required creativity, and were graded fairly. Jamie and Jasmine were great. I learned so much and can see the value the content of this course will play in my future public health work.",
    "Jamie is an awesome teacher and a great resource to learn about infectious disease in general. He is the strength of this course for me.",
    "This has been a great course. Maybe we don't need to have the jigsaw discussion groups so often. I really liked the student presentations we did on different emerging infectious diseases. I also really liked the guest lectures and I found them all very interesting and educative!",
    "It was fun and interesting course.",
    "very informative",
    "It was interesting, but needed a lot more structure and organization. I would like to know ahead of time what is expected of me. For example how many assignments there will be, when they will be do, how much they will be worth, etc, etc. Also knowing what we will be learning that day or week would be useful. I also think the last assignment could have been a little more sensitive...",
    "The course was good. The content and the format were very interesting. I was very appreciate of the public health practitioners we had as guest lecturers. We are in dire need of this resource in EMD. The homework assignments were also very creative. Sometimes, the class was not as structured as most classes.",
    "I do not think this course needs to be a year long. Obnoxious to take this course simultaneously with immunology."

    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Enthusiastic and excited to teach the material. Could provide readings in advance and provide a fixed as opposed to a working syllabus.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Dr. Childs was a great professor. He was very clear and made the course very interesting.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is fantastic - so knowledgeable, helpful and accessible. I really enjoyed his teaching style and enthusiasm.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Awesome!",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0It was very obvious how knowledgeable and enthusiastic Jamie is about infectious disease, and that helped to make the class very engaging. I do think in the future, Jamie could be a little more organized and more accessible to meet for office hours. Overall, I thought Jamie did a great job with this class and taught us really interesting material.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Lectures were both interesting and easy to follow.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is one of the most excited people you will ever meet when it comes to infectious disease. He is unbelievably supportive, and truly connected to the study of infectious disease through his life experiences, and also through his teaching.His understanding of infectious disease is so nuanced that it can feel a little disconnected, but in the end, it really is all connected. Owing to Jamie's knowledge of the subject, the case studies of specific diseases are as interesting as the general concepts that emerge.Due credit also goes to the guest lecturers that made the class so diverse.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie was excellent! He was always enthusiastic to teach and answer questions. His vast knowledge and experience added immensely to the course. Grades were extremely fair. Created a great learning environment. I will miss taking a class from him.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is an awesome teacher and a great resource to learn about infectious disease in general. He is the strength of this course for me.Always available for his students and more of a friend than a instructor for his students.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Dr. Childs did a great job leading the course this semester. Strengths: I liked that Dr. Childs integrated his own experiences into the material (e.g. lecture on outbreak investigation). This really added a lot to the course! I also liked that he kept us focused on the big picture ideas throughout the course and in reviewing for the final exam so we were sure to come out of the course with a good handle on overarching themes in infectious diseases. Weaknesses\/Possible Improvements: Some of the lectures at the beginning of the semester were a little \"disorganized\" (i.e. some slides I felt were not necessary or were never really discussed). -- Dr. Pettigrew's lectures were also very good and her questions forced us to think through some important topics, such as screenings, as a class.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Dr. Childs was an excellent instructor for this course. He did a very good job of engaging everyone in class and he was very knowledgeable about the materials he taught.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0He cares about his students so much!",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0He is definitely passionate about infectious diseases! Which is a definite plus.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is not your typical instructor. He is more concerned with the big picture. He definitely took us above and beyond as far as the class discussions and homework assignments. It made the class more interesting and enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Intelligent, good lecturer. Needs to be a bit more organized. I never knew when an assignment was coming because it did not follow the syllabus. Never responded to emails."

   "comments": [
    "A second part course of the first infectious disease course. The jigsaw discussions are a bit unnecessary. Could require a single presentation rather than the repetitive nature of the jigsaw.",
    "I would recommend this couse to another student. I learned a lot about different kinds of infectious diseases that impact populations as well as the methods epidemiologists use when approaching infectious disease outbreaks. It wasa very interesting and enjoyable course. Thank you!",
    "I would strongly recommend this class - passionate instructors, fascinating course material.",
    "wish I could take it again",
    "A really good continuation of the fall class, and much more information on some of the more interesting diseases.",
    "Yes because it is required for EMD students, both also because both PID courses together are a great introduction into infectious disease.",
    "This is one class that I feel fits the definition of a good course. You learn a lot, there's not much work (the work that you do have is meaningful, a few homeworks and a few presentations), and grading is reasonable. You get a lot for a little, in other words.Above all, the content is interesting, and so I found ways to connect what I learned in this class to my other classes. I would recommend this class to students that have some interest in infectious disease, even if you're not in EMD. You learn so much about the general concepts of infectious diseases, through diseases that I, personally, knew so little about coming into the course, and that have such public health significance.",
    "Definitely recommended, especially for first-year EMD students. I enjoyed having two semesters of Principles of Infectious Diseases, and learned a great deal from Drs. Childs and Pettigrew.",
    "Must take course at YSPH",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in infectious disease epidemiology. In conjunction with PID I, this course covers a huge array of topics and is a great starting point for students considering various research areas during their first year at YSPH! The in-class discussions for the most part of fun and engaging too.",
    "Yes I would strongly recommend this course to another student",
    "a great intro to ID. we covered a lot of topics in a small amount of time.",
    "It's required, kinda fun, not hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I learnedabout a lot of new diseases and the issues concerning infectious diseases in general. We covered things that I learned about in my global health courses in greater detail and we learned about the science behind vaccines,ARVs, etc..."
