    "Gained a stronger underpinning in how social knowledge is built, what arguments exist around how best to avoid bias and collect objective data, and what similar arguments are around some of the major methodologies (both quant and qual).",
    "I learned how to critique sociology studies and how to talk like a sociologist. I learned about methods in the field, and best practices and well as pitfalls. I learned that ontology and oncology are very different things.",
    "This was one of my favorite courses of the semester. I gained the knowledge, skills, and insights to be a much better and more rigorous social scientist.",

   "comments": [
    "I appreciated weeks when we had a methodological overview text followed by case studies. The case studies were interesting to discuss and grounded the theory in example, which I found helpful. The instructor clearly knew a lot about these topics, which was important. I struggled with the first several weeks on epistemology and ontology (they were so theoretical that it was hard to ground them in what I knew about research), but really enjoyed the later sections on methodologies. Students' level of engagement with the class seemed to vary widely, which sometimes created challenges in conversation flow. It also helped to focus the discussion and include more people when the instructor put in place a rule about sticking to the readings rather than outside examples. Assignment-wise, I appreciated that there was some flexibility in when reading notes were due. Readings were sometimes longer\/heavier in a week than I was able to get through, but generally well-portioned. Midterm and finals seemed relevant and useful.",
    "I appreciate the instructor sending out rules for discussion and enforcing them, but I think it might have been too little too late. We had a couple of really dominant personalities in the class that really discouraged active participation from others in the room. Also, for being young sociologists, I'm not sure how some of my peers could be so oblivious and insensitive to the power\/race\/gender dynamics in the room. Overall for this course, I would say that about 65% of the material was really interesting and helpful, and 35% of it was so far above my head that I felt like I was drowning. The second half of the course was much better, but the in-depth sociological theory made me feel like I was in a foreign language class. I had to keep googling all the -ology words to make sense of what was going on, but I still have no idea what Bourdieu was trying to say (although if I met a fellow sociologist at a cocktail party, I would ask them for their opinion on the epistemic break). Also, eight reading notes and leading a class discussion is a lot. Especially when you have a midterm and a final paper. Either keep the reading notes and ditch the midterm (recommended), or only require six reading notes.",
    "In my opinion the course was perfectly great. I would not change a thing.",
    "Strengths: back half of the class incredibly practical; enjoyed reading a variety of studies and papers Weaknesses: personally could have done with less theory; in initial classes the discussion dynamic was dominated by two people"

   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend this course to students who are interested in doing social research (either sociological or in another field) and want to gain a stronger understanding of the theory underpinning our assumptions\/research design decisions.",
    "Maybe? Depends on what the student is looking for. It seemed like a rigorous survey course, if there is such a thing. Coming out of the class, I feel like I can speak intelligently on sociological matters, but I don't think I can really do any sociological research, just critique what others have done.",
    "Without a doubt!",
    "Yes, for those who plan to conduct research in their future careers.",
    "This class gives you a solid overview of the main methodological traditions of sociology, so it is an important class for sociology grad students to take (it is required) so that they can pick up any sociology paper and understand what is going on. If you are interested in academic work in sociology this is a fine class."
