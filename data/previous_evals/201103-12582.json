    "I would recommend it, but not as wholeheartedly as Literature.",
    "You read a lot and write a little. I'd recommend it if you have a legitimate interest.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it.",
    "If you can take the fall of DS Philosophy (from Plato through Aristotle to Aquinas) with Della Rocca, do it. A self-described \"philosophy geek\", he will sometimes stray into a more-or-less pointless discussion point raised by a student - but for the most part, he guides the discussion very well. Plus, by the time you get to Parmenides and monism, you will love the fact that you happen to have him as a teacher.",
    "Take this course. Take it with Della Rocca. Otherwise you'll be miserable in your philosophy section. You won't find a more knowledgeable\/capable philosophy professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student because MDR was an amazing professor and I know that I improved immensely and learned a lot in one short semester. I can honestly say that I enjoyed coming to class every day to discuss the texts and even enjoyed writing the papers.",
    "Take DS. The works you read are great, and the discussions you'll have will be good for you in school and in life. Don't you want to learn about Aristotle's unmoved mover? Of course you do.",
    "The normal caveats of directed studies apply. With that out of the way, if you get Della Rocca, don't switch. You have the best philosophy professor in DS, and no matter what trepedations you might have about certain philosophers on the list, you are in good hands. You will need to be attentive and speak plenty in class, though oftentimes the discussion veers away from the text.",
    "This course is a survey of ancient moral Philosophy, with an emphasis on Aristotle and Plato."
