There were many weeks when section felt too unstructured and casual to me, and therefore not particularly productive. I also think Chelsea could improve in leading interesting provocative conversations. Sometimes I felt like she would automatically agree with participants' comments too often.

    "Professor Cashore has a lot of important things to teach however this course was unorganized and repetitive. The lectures were often quite similar, especially some of the anecdotes which we heard repeatedly over the course of the semester. The readings assigned for the course and the lectures were not complimentary to one another. Often, the lecture simply summarized the readings. Assuming we had done the readings, hearing the lecture did not add much to our learning.",
    "This class had a lot of potential, but I feel it was never reached. Ben Cashore has so much knowledge to share, but the class was so disorganized that much of it was lost. For example, we were always rushed to finish the material at the end of the class, so we often did not get to learn about how the theoretical concepts discussed could be applied to environmental topics. I feel like I would have gained much more from the class if we had spent more time applying the theories learned",
    "I enjoyed the class and the professor but I did think it was odd that he didn't know our names and didn't review our work (to my knowledge) except for our final papers. He also had to miss a few classes for conferences, or hold shortened make up classes, which is not ideal when we are paying so much money for school.",
    "I loved the multi-goal policy analysis, but I would have liked to have reviewed some professional samples (non-student work).",
    "Question 15: I found the course very beneficial and the subject matter extremely relevant.",
    "Professor Cashore is clearly committed to supporting the education of his students. I really appreciated that whenever there was a question he would work with the student to make sure they truly understood the material.",

    "The course was all about what one needs to be ready for the world outside of school",
    "Some of the topics we covered (ex. theories of power) were very useful and definitely have impacted my thinking.",
    "There are many important lessons in this course about problem definitions, types of power, questioning our assumptions. All of these topics are, I believe, core to what students at FES should be learning. Creating the policy analysis was a highlight -- it is an interesting assignment and enjoyable that we can make it our own.",
    "Discussion Section",
    "It is a good into to the world of policy- I learned very much about the policy process and how new policies can be created.",
    "Learning how to write a policy memo was very useful. I also appreciated that we had the chance to write each section of the memo separately and receive feedback. The book for the course was also very useful.",
    "I think that the lessons were very useful and you might find yourself thinking in those terms for a long time (Power everywhere)",
    "The final paper.",
    "My favorite component of this course was writing the policy analysis. I think this exercise was extremely helpful in solidifying and applying all that we learned throughout the semester. I also appreciated the way in which work on this project was broken up throughout the semester, and explained along the way. I also thought the structure of the course was helpful. I appreciated beginning with theory and moving into practice throughout the course. Our early readings about power and different governance models were extremely helpful in shaping my understanding of content later on.",
    "Having the chance of writing a real policy memo.",
    "The course structure was very clear, the lectures were engaging and I enjoyed the assigned reading. I also loved working on the policy analysis, learned a lot and appreciated the way it was broken up.",
    "The aspect of the course that I enjoyed most was the multi-goal analysis paper. This was an opportunity for us to compile everything we learned from the semester into a research paper exploring various policies. The other beneficial aspects were the breakout groups during class in which we would discuss course topics in small groups. This helped transform conceptual ideas into real world topics. The only problem is we rarely had time to hear the results of the breakout groups since the class would run out of time for the groups to present. I really appreciated Professor Cashore's personal examples from his own experience. He did a good job of integrating examples into the material.",

    "N\/A",
    "The professor clearly did not make this class a priority. He was consistently late, often underprepared with outdated presentations, missed 3 classes (made up 1.5), didn't know deadlines or assignment expectations, and didn't learn students' names. His commitment to student learning was very disappointing.",
    "This class really focused on only one aspect of policy building. The professor only assigned readings that aligned with his views and the readings on topics he disagreed with turned out to be negative reviews of these systems. Classes focussed on the readings and just overviews of other peoples work without a true understanding of why we should use one specific method. The readings were convoluted and used complicated language for no reason what so ever creating very frustrating and long reading assignments.",
    "The prof. needs to do a better job of managing the class. We went off on tangents too many times which distracted from the material we were supposed to learn.",
    "The readings and the lectures should be complimentary to each other, not repetitive. The answers to the tests should not be given to us during the discussion sections ahead of time.",
    "Second half of the course",
    "Organization. The content of the class is great, but we rarely got to all of it because we would run out of time, or class was cancelled and rescheduled at an inconvenient time. More application of the theories to environmental issues would be great as well, especially at the end of the class. Learning how feasibility, policy learning, etc could be altered by us in order to influence policy choices would have been a nice conclusion. I feel like everything was left up in the air.",
    "Class lectures were often rushed or went over time. A big part of this was due student questions and comments. There needs to be a better balance. When we rushed through the material I didn't get anything out of it. There is also a tendancy to use the same examples repeatedly. My understanding of a theory or idea would be deeper with a greater variety of examples.",
    "Lecture structure -- most were a review of the readings.",
    "My biggest feedback about this course is that the class sessions felt both rushed and plodding. I think some more thought could be put into the pacing in order to avoid these feelings. There were classes during which I felt like we moved slowly (I would argue too slowly) through one bit of material, which led to rushing through what remained at the end. I also think there was a little bit too much repeating of content from readings during class. I would have liked the class time to be spent building on the readings more than summarizing them.",
    "I didn't find the space of the classroom very conducive to discussion. While sitting in a circle is helpful in small groups, in a larger group I found it overwhelming. I think facing forward might have actually provoked more responses from different members of the class. I also thought that break-out sessions would have been more beneficial if the asks were a little more specific. When asked to develop a policy basket during break-out sessions, my groups always came to the same conclusion--we just don't have enough information in such a short time frame.",
    "Overall, this is an good course with important material on policy and politics, but the execution is hampered by poor organization. Professor Cashore struggled with time management. He seldom finished the power points he prepared, and oftentimes we would be unable to finish group exercises due to time limitations. The class would either go over or run out of time. The disorganization was also made apparent by the lack of communication and clarity between the TAs and the Professor. Whether it was regarding time, due dates or assignments, the TAs and the Professor either had different answers, were unaware of what the other had stated, or used class time to clarify. Professor Cashore relied on the same examples to elucidate the material, throughout the whole semester and would benefit from integrating new examples. The class could be improved if the TAs and Professor met outside of class to get organized and if Professor Cashore established an agenda with time allotments for each topic to ensure that he covers all the relative material.",
    "I think that there were too many in-class exercises that didn't really contribute very much to learning.",
    "It will be good if professor Ben can add more examples his explanations of concepts or ideologies."

I think more valuable would be to have one or two case studies that we learn about in the beginning, fully understand the context, and then utilize those throughout the course.",
    "Working on case studies in class was sometimes helpful, but I struggled often because I did not have as much knowledge of the problem as I needed to completely do the assignment. I think group time would have been used much more effectively if we discussed problems that were well known, or if we were briefed on them beforehand. Or possibly, we could be assigned to groups at the beginning of the semester, and worked on one case study throughout the course instead of learning a new one each time.",
