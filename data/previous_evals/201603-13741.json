   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about fish!",
    "This class taught me more than I ever wanted to know about fish, but it was worth it! It was actually kind of refreshing to become a specialist in something I didn't think I cared at all about before. It more broadly gave me a sense for the environmental and ecological dangers of the way we raise food and eat it.",
    "I learned a lot about how the discipline of biology works. We learned a lot not only about fish specifically, but the concepts of evolution, taxonomy, and biological research.",
    "I learned a lot about ichthyology, especially questions of phylogeny.",
    "A clearer, more holistic picture of evolution and the incredible diversity of life.",
    "Developed an understanding of evolutionary history, of how awesome fish are, and of how the scientific world is continuing to change what we know about the evolution of fish (and, therefore, the evolution of mammals too!)",
    "I learned a lot about how biologists approach deciphering the history of evolution as well as a lot of knowledge about the body structure of fish and multicellular organisms.",
    "I got to know a lot about evolutionary biology, ecology and general biology. I now know how to read a phylogeny, decode some of the evolutionary biology specific language in articles and find great fish videos on youtube. I think this class fulfilled the expectation of a science class (from the perspective of a non science major) of making a new vein of knowledge accessible to the students. I feel as if I can not only apply this knowledge to fish, but evolutionary biology at large.",
    "(1) Fish are epic! (2) All evolutionary biologists should learn about fish, because understanding them is immensely useful when looking at more recent lineages. (3) I wish I had taken this class freshman year, because I sort of want to be an ichthyologist now.",
    "This course provides a comprehensive understanding of the phylogeny of fishes and their basic biology. It provides concrete examples through which to examine important and interesting themes in evolution and ecology. I gained valuable exposure the areas of study within ichthyology and possible areas for research within the field."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I believe that either slightly less material or slightly more structure would benefit the course. The professor seemed very rushed to get through material and constantly surprised when he couldn't get all the way through it. So mostly just getting a sense for how long it would take to do the lecture and then making sure it fit into class time.",
    "I thought the overall course structure was good, but I would've appreciated having more review sessions and smaller assessments (on the lecture material) that would be worth a little less than the few assessments we did have.",
    "One weakness of this course was that it was not particularly well organized. We ended up not getting to many slides and skipping over many groups of fish or covering them in very little detail. I think this was Dr. Harrington's first time teaching this course and it will improve in the future as he has time to work out the kinks.",
    "The material was engaging, and the tests were fair. It was organized well. We ran out of time at the end, but ended up covering almost everything.",
    "I didn't find the textbooks very useful, but the two readings (Fish Caught in Time and Your Inner Fish) are great. They help me get a better picture of the subject (as a non-EB&B major) while diving into something specific. The youtube videos are definitely the highlights of the lectures! Preparing for exams can be tricky because there's so much information in class and it's hard to know which are the more important ones. In general I felt prepared for the exams and that I really have learned a lot by the end.",
    "This class has the perfect amount of material to learn - it's really a great amount of information, but it's all interesting and fun. The fish videos and fieldtrips are certainly highlights.",
    "I had a great time taking this course. I really like the format of a paper, two smaller quizzes about assigned books, a final and a midterm. I think the class had a good organizing structure but I would have appreciated it if it could have been made more clear to me what that structure was. Another strength was the great time and great learning experiences afforded by the two field trips. I felt as if Professor Harrington really embraced that there are multiple ways to learn and put good faith effort into incorporating them into the class.",
    "Most professors teaching organismal diversity classes at Yale have an infectious and almost funny enthusiasm for their organismal group. Still, I would say that Professor Harrington and Jess showed even more of a direct enthusiasm for their organismal group than other professors I have taken classes with. As someone who is very interested in the natural world for its own sake, it often feels that the way that science classes are taught and the issues they focuses on suck the joy out of science. Certainly, this class had well-organized information about fish evolution, fish taxonomy, and characteristics distinguishing different fish groups. What made it stand out over other, even excellent natural science classes at Yale, were things like the movies of fish, the popular science books about fish, and the field trips on the trawling boat and to the aquarium. I think it is necessary to include this type of activity in teaching all kinds of science. It may seem that we need to focus on stark, specialized information in order to prepare students to make important scientific discoveries. However, people making major discoveries generally didn't set out to do so - the top ichthyologists, for example, started out with just the idea that fish are cool.",
    "This course was well-organized. Biology and evolution of fishes were integrated into exploration of the whole phylogeny of fishes. It was the kind of course where you look back at the end of the semester and it all makes sense in a satisfying way. A very strong course in general!"

   "comments": [
    "Sure! It was fun and interesting. The grading was a bit delayed and there is a lot of material, but the professor does a good job of keeping his audience and the lectures are interesting and fun!",
    "I'd recommend this course to another student interested in fish biology and ecology. If you're just taking the class to fulfill a science requirement, be aware that it does entail a lot of exam prep and memorization of minutiae.",
    "This class quickly became my favorite class of my time at Yale. I first shopped it because I needed another class, but I was hooked after the first lecture. Basically, fish are really cool. I learned a lot about a subject I knew practically nothing about and enjoyed doing it. The pacing of the course was a little strange in that we spent a lot of time and detail early in the course on some smaller groups of fish and flew through large groups late in the semester. Harrington was always willing to answer questions, even during lecture, which is probably why we got a little behind the syllabus. As far as assignments go, there were 2 quizzes on books (which were easy and entertaining reads), a midterm, a term paper on the topic of your choice and the final. I looked forward to going to lectures and would highly recommend this class.",
    "This is a fabulous class. Prof Harrington is a lot of fun, and cares a lot about the material and his students. The lectures are fun, the books that are assigned are good, and the tests and quizzes are very fair. It's a great class. Get ready for lots of youtube videos of fish.",
    "I took this course as a science credit, which I thought would be a popular move, but I was one of only a few people to do so. It ended up being fun, and engaging, and not that hard, though definitely not a gut. I enjoyed learning a lot about this pretty obscure scientific field, and watching the videos of fish were great. No regular homework was nice too.",
    "Really cool, really chill class. Not coming from an EB&B background a lot of information could be confusing at first, but by the end I really felt like I have a much better sense of evolutionary history. Fish is dope. It humbles you to realize how amazing other life forms are. Professor Harrington is awesome. He's the kind of professor you'll wanna be friends with. The exams\/quizzes can be trickier than expected because there's so much information from class and we don't know what are the more important bits in terms of preparing for an exam. But tests are just one small aspect of learning so you shouldn't care too much about that anyway.",
    "Yes, an amazing SC credit for anyone and everyone! If you're remotely interested in fish at all - as in enjoy watching videos of animals on Planet Earth - you should take this class. If Professor Harrington is teaching it, the class is really fun and laid back, but it's definitely not a gut - you'll learn a lot and have to do a decent amount of memorization for the midterm and final. Overall I highly recommend it, it will actually make you happy every time you see a live fish after taking this class.",
    "If you are interested in fish or looking to get your science credit out of the way, you ought to consider this course. It's not a ton of work. You just need to study\/memorize content for the tests and quizzes and write a midlength term paper on a research topic of your choice. As a non-STEM major who is not particularly interested in fish, I enjoyed the course quite a bit. Evolutionary theory comes up quite a bit, which I enjoyed. However, a lot of your grade will come down to how good at memorizing you can be, so if that's not your thing, you should probably steer clear of this class.",
    "Yes. I think Professor Harrington is great and made the class great. It is not necessarily a gut science credit but an interesting and engaging class with only two books of reading, a fun professor and interesting assignments and field trips.",
    "This course is incredible. Apparently ichthyologists are among the coolest people on earth (no joke). If at all possible, I would recommend you take the lab - although like any organismal diversity lab, it involves a lot of memorizing taxonomic groups and the morphological characteristics that identify them. The lecture classes include fish evolution and taxonomy, morphological characteristics defining various groups, and some behavioral traits. What makes this class stand out, at least as taught by Professor Harrington, is that it is even more lively and playful, in some ways, than the other organismal diversity courses. The weighty information on fish groups is interspersed with videos of fish swimming and carrying out various behaviors; we read two fantastic popular science books on fish; and the class takes two optional field trips on a trawling boat and to an aquarium (on which we saw some truly great fish). In my opinion, this kind of approach makes a subject both more memorable and gives one greater inspiration to learn about it.",
    "Yes, this course is very engaging for both science students and non-majors. I would highly recommend it."
