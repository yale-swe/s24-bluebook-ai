    "Take this class, it is the best class I have taken at yale! And just being in the shop working will always make you feel better, you'll want to spend as much time as you can in there.",
    "If you like hanging out with Brent and doing your own thing in the shop, this is a great class. You might have to put up with crit time that feels like you've gone down the art-speak rabbit hole, but this is probably dependent on who else is taking the class with you. Scheduling things like installations and crit times (and iron pours) can be frustrating, but it's a good exercise in patience I guess. If you like to make things and are generally good at going with the flow, take this class."
