    "Take it if you get in.",
    "It's a fast-paced course that attracts people who are very interested in economics. The seminar is certainly more competitive and stressful than the lecture, but we probably learned more than the lecture students did. I would recommend the course if you don't mind a competitive environment and you are genuinely interested in economics. There is a curve in the class (40% As, 40% Bs, 20% Cs and below) that isn't necessarily conducive to collaborative learning.",
    "Economics 110 is a good class if you're looking for a challenge. The material is \"the same\" as the large lecture class, but honestly, we moved a lot faster than the large lecture... However, if you like learning in small class sizes, this is a class for you. Additionally, Professor Simons is a great professor and also really helpful outside of class.",
    "Economics 110 does take a lot of time on your own to read the textbook and understand the concepts. Still, everything is explained in class to help you grasp it fully. I definitely recommend this course over the large lecture. A large lecture seems as if it would be much less conducive to studying econ, especially if you have a lot of questions.",
    "Econ 110 is listed as a seminar, but this is truly just a lecture on a smaller scale. The material was exciting in some spots, but as a whole was fairly dry. Learning briefly about behavioral economics, game-theory, and oligopolies was the highlight of the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student, but only because I think that Intro Microeconomics contains very important information that is relevant to anyone's life, econ major or not. It teaches you to recognize and think analytically about decisions we make on a daily basis. And if you truly master the material, you have a very solid groundwork for further economics classes. You basically cover everything about supply and demand, capital markets, labor, production, costs, and some measure of consumer rational and irrational choice.",
    "It is a difficult course because of the amount of material we cover. But the fact that it's a small class size is definitely beneficial.",
    "Very intense introduction to micro-economics and if you are not prepared it might be more beneficial to take the lecture.",
    "With Tolga, yes.",
    "Don't take unless you're very confident in econ"
