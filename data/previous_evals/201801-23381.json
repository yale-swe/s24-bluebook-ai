    "This course was a very useful continuation of Portuguese 120 and increased my knowledge of vocabulary, grammar concepts, and cultures and current events in the Lusophone world.",
    "My Portuguese is better! I definitely improved my ability to communicate in the language and I learned about Brazilian arts, culture, & history, etc.",
    "I have a better understanding of spoken and written Portuguese, a deeper appreciation of Brazilian and Lusophone culture.",
    "oral, written, comprehension, and reading skills in Portuguese",
    "By the end of the course I was able to execute conversational Portuguese as my grammar had improved over the semester. I also learned much about current events in the Lusophone world, as well as cultural practices in and history of Brazil."

   "comments": [
    "I like the strong emphasis on culture in the course, as well as on the distinction between \"textbook\" \/ antiquated Portuguese and the Portuguese people typically use in everyday conversation. I think that more opportunities to speak spontaneously in class might be helpful. I also think that the textbook could be improved, as grammar exercises were often decontextualized and did not require students to attend to meaning; it was also pointed out several times that many of the expressions and structures used in the book are no longer part of spoken Portuguese in Brazil.",
    "The textbook is not great. Would be nice to have one organized in a way that made more sense and especially did a better job explaining the grammar. Overall though I enjoyed the course a lot. My vocabulary and grammatical understanding definitely both improved a lot.",
    "The instructor was absolutely incredible. Sabrina cared deeply about we, her students. Unlike many language instructors, she insisted on speaking to us only in Portuguese, thus motivating us to immerse ourselves in the Lusophone world. she went out of her way to obtain resources beyond the scope of the class to further our cultural acclimatization, and personalised the language learning experience by keeping up with each student and giving individual constructive feedback. The biggest downside to this class is the textbook. It should have color and have more interactive sections. Kindly refer to the French language textbook \"deux Mondes\" and the German equivalent \"Kontakte\" for a sense of what a good introductory language textbook should be....For 70$ I expect my textbook to have color, fun graphics, an online version of the text, review sessions at the end of each chapter summarizing vocabulary and grammar covered plus exercises, at the end of the textbook glossaries, detailed conjugation tables to reinforce these skills, fun trivia and cultural sections etc. I get that this is an immersion class but sometimes it would be nice to have tricky grammar points explained in English or even a few sample translations to aid the visualization of how grammar functions . Way to many verb tenses and structures are learnt towards the end.",
    "strengths: - fun - learn a lot in a small amount of time - different types of activities to keep us engaged with the material - small class so we get to know the other students well weaknesses: - textbook not very clear to follow, some activities don't seem very relevant",
    "The course is well organized with clear instruction in the textbook. The use of media in the classroom facilitates learning of the language. The course is very well off as is and I cannot think of anything that can improve it."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in developing their proficiency in written and spoken Portuguese, as well as anyone interested in Brazilian \/ Lusophone culture.",
    "Portuguese is a great language and I'm glad that I took it! Sabrina is great and although she won't be at Yale next year I've heard that all the other Portuguese teachers are also good. It's a chill and fun class if you're looking to pick up a slightly less common language here.",
    "Portuguese was the highlight of my day. This class is so much fun.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning Portuguese! It's a beautiful language!",
    "The professor is very understanding, and the course is not very intellectually challenging. It demands very little from the student outside of class as the opportunities to speak in class strengthens our knowledge of the Portuguese language."
