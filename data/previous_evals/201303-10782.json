   "comments": [
    "CHNS 132 is the perfect course to take if you can speak\/understand Chinese well (no English is spoken in class) but cannot read\/write. If this applies to you, take this course!",
    "yes! take the class if you are a heritage speaker and have any interest in Chinese; don't worry if you feel like the class is too difficult in the beginning, Liu laoshi works really hard to make sure all her students have a good foundation for Chinese.",
    "Very helpful if you want to improve your Chinese. Don't worry about your Chinese not being good enough going it, I didn't know any characters\/pinyin before I started and now I feel relatively comfortable with 1000 or so characters. It's a little annoying that if you have a particular regional accent from what your parents speak at home, you'll be forced to adopt northern Chinese, standard pronunciation.",
    "Liu Laoshi is a great teacher. Very helpful and cracks a lot of jokes. If you're not proficient in speaking Chinese, take the non-heritage course, as you'll struggle here due to the weekly oral presentations. Workload isn't bad, just annoying because it's every day. If you do all the homework and put the effort in you'll see large improvements in your Chinese. Note- despite her insisting that the course moves at a slow pace, it is actually quite fast, especially the last few weeks.",
    "A good course if you're one of those illiterate ABCs. You get what you put into it, so dont waste your time with this course if you dont have a passion for the language, or dont have a compelling personal reason to continue, or jumpstart, your study of Chinese.",
    "Good class! Liu laoshi is great and really cares about her students. this class made it fun to learn Chinese. And you do learn a lot. The class starts off slow but picks up at the end. Daily homework and dictation quizzes.",
    "Perfect for anyone who can speak Chinese but has limited to no knowledge of reading and writing. I would recommend it to anyone who fits this description, especially if Professor Liu is teaching it.",
    "Take this class, your Chinese will improve greatly. The courseload will increase near the end of the semester, but as long as you keep up with the work, you will have no problem in this course.",
    "Chinese 132 is a heritage track for students with some listening\/speaking background in Chinese. I would recommend it if you want to get the distributional credit or want to apply for the Light Fellowship for the summer. There is probably on average 1-2 hours of work everyday so it's very manageable and Prof. Liu is great.",
    "Even though it is a very hard class, it is incredible how much you learn how to read and write in only a few months. This is because it is very fast paced, with a lot of vocabulary and grammar to memorize every week.",
    "Definitely recommend",
    "A great class if you want to learn characters and practice your speaking skills. You don't have to be a heritage student to do well in the class. It certainly helps but you'll probably learn more in this class than the non-heritage one. It's quite a bit of work if you don't know any characters and will really take away from time taking other classes. Good opportunity to practice speaking vs. the L5 classes.",
    "Liu Laoshi was perhaps my favorite teacher of the semester. Caring, humorous, completely invested in her students. Class was always a joy. My speaking, writing, and comprehension of Chinese all improved immensely. I especially enjoyed the in class discussions focused on contemporary Chinese culture. If you're a native speaker wanting to start formally studying Chinese take CHNS 132 and especially with Liu Laoshi!",
    "Chinese 132 is enjoyable if Fan Liu is teaching the class. She is a very good Chinese teacher, but even more so- a caring and sharp person who will become very invested in your success. She makes learning Chinese enjoyable to the point where you consider taking more and more Chinese until you realize she will not be teaching those classes, and your chief incentive was simply to spend every day for the rest of your Yale career with her. She is a fair grader, a hilarious person, and enormously understanding. I was hesitant about revisiting a language I felt ashamed I did not know. Liu Laoshi dispelled all doubts and random thoughts of shame. She will change your perception of how one should learn Chinese."
