   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: A wide variety of content Weakness: Difficulty of the content varied a lot",
    "Having homework assignments due every class period was a definite strength because it forced me to study and practice continuously to keep my Japanese up. I also felt that the weekly speaking practice was a strong point.",
    "I think that more writing exercises that required the use of specific grammar patterns and current kanji would be useful to further solidify what we are studying. It's very easy to forget kanji especially learned from a week ago.",
    "Strengths: due to the small class size and Stever-sensei and Maruyama-sensei's teaching style, the class is very interactive and engaging. One of my favorite classes! I can't give Japanese up! Good balance of content that's going to be tested and content that's being learned just for the sake of learning The pace is so so much better than L1 and L2. Much slower (perhaps because it's a higher level course) but we're still learning a lot The consistent and thorough feedback I received on homework, essay, and speaking was extremely helpful Weaknesses: I'm not sure how to improve upon this, but I sometimes find that I'm not retaining vocabulary as much as I did in lower level courses. This is probably due partly to the fact that classes are three times a week instead of everyday. My writing skills didn't improve as much as my other skills did I found that sometimes we had a lot of writing homework, or none at all."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely. If a student is considering continuing with L5 Japanese and taking this course, I would definitely recommend that they do so. It was very engaging and well-developed for maintaining and gaining Japanese skills.",
    "A great way to consolidate your Japanese knowledge, especially if you did the Light Fellowship in the summer before!",
    "I would recommend the course to another student for sure, but would tell them to be prepared to speak spontaneously a lot in class and do a lot of outside-of-class homework (besides the regular studying for a course).",
    "If you've taken up through L4, definitely consider taking this class! It's a good way to solidify the language skills you've gained so far, and overall and enjoyable and actually relaxing way to start the day (if you take the 9am)"
