   "comments": [
    "Great introduction to drawing (no experience is necessary). Learned ALOT in terms of techniques and different mediums--it was really nice to actually learn how to draw, because in high school they never taught any sort of skills. Sam was an excellent professor--take his class if possible. Majority of work done during class time--a few homework assignments, but nothing unmanageable. Great as a fifth class. An enjoyable, stress-free 4 hours\/week. Take this class!",
    "Yes, because I really enjoyed it. Its a great class thats different from normal classes.",
    "I would recommend this class because it was relaxing and greatly improved the way I draw.",
    "I would strongly recommend basic drawing. Relaxing and a great way to learn how to draw.",
    "TAKE IT. One of the best classes I've taken.",
    "This class is a great chance to structure time into your schedule for drawing. While Sam's approach means that the class is low-pressure, you still become more attuned to technical aspects of drawing and working with charcoal (as well as with ink) over the course of the semester. Seeing your (and everyone else's) large final project take shape is also lots of fun. Highly recommend.",
    "Trust the people who say this course is what you bring to it. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take Basic Drawing. It's fun, not a huge time commitment, and I guarantee that you'll develop as an artist.",
    "It was an overall great experience. It really improved my drawing and was my favorite class this semester.",
    "I would recommend it to any student, regardless of artistic background. It is good because one is not required to be an 'artist' to take the course. Also, it can be taken even with zero drawing background. For people who do consider themselves more artistically inclined, it is also a good course--anyone would do well drawing more.",
    "A fantastic introduction to drawing, but more to art making in general.",
    "Art 114 with Sam Messer is the best class I've taken at Yale. Twice a week I would walk into the studio and be confronted with a problem: how to draw something well. This is the most challenging class I've taken in a while -- not in terms of grading, but rather that YOU KNOW (or you will learn) when the stuff you're doing is good and when it isn't. Unlike a problem set, there's constantly room for improvement. Everyone at Yale should take an art class (or several) before they graduate, and this is a great pick."
