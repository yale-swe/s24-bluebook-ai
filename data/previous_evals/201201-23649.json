    "I thought the course was paced well, required an appropriate amount of out-of-class time, lectures, and focus on the Electricity Strategy Game.I thought the course could use a little more explanation about the electricity strategy game before beginning the game, especially some more guidance or instruction on how to build a marginal cost model before splitting into groups and devising strategies for bidding on generation portfolios. I come from a power development background and have a pretty good handle on how elctricity markets work, but wanted to learn a bit more about the economics behind developing bidding strategies. Maybe one more class or two more class sessions could be devoted to this so that all the groups are on the same playing field? I ended up not contributing much to this early, but particularly critical, part of the course. I'm sure that disappointed my teammates, though I made up for it in later rounds of the game b\/c they didn't have much of a background in carbon regulations or policy development.",
    "The energy market simulation was a great way to reinforce the course material and theory. It was also a lot of fun to get to work with non-FES students on something other than a paper.",
    "There were aspects of the game that could have been better organized by the TA.",
    "The Energy Strategy Game was very well designed AND integrated into the course! I would have liked to spend more time with the readings to get a full sense of energy markets, in depth. I recommend this course be allowed to spread into a full semester. It would have been helpful to spend time looking at historical data of NG, oil, coal markets and understand the drivers of their fluctuations and who the market movers are."

    "It was hard to coordinate group strategy when the turnover of electricity strategy game was several times a week. But it integrated different perspectives into the strategy (since everyone had different backgrounds)",
    "I think I was clear about the advantages above. The disadvantage was in the initial meetings people with less economic backgrounds were not able to contribute as much (and some left the class) because they simply had not had enough time with the material to be able to help.",
    "The Energy Strategy Game. It was a great exercise and helped me to gain a firm grasp of energy markets. Probably one of the most useful classes I've taken at Yale. I was also able to apply a lot of what I learned in Environmental Economics in this course.",
