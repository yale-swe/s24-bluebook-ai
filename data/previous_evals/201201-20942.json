   "comments": [
    "This class is a great introduction to the sociology of sex and gender with a particular emphasis on work, family, and medicine\/the body. I would recommend this class (and have!).",
    "it is a course about sexuality. it focuses more on women than men. it might be more suitable for a student who has taken a course in that field before. the workload per week is not too much for a student does not have too much work to be done already.I would recommend the class to a student who is interested in the study of sexuality and research in the field, because the course professor is always ready to help in research.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to everyone. Even if they are not particularly interested in sex and gender, take it for Rene and the general research skills she will teach throughout the semester. For those interested in the topic, the course covers the most recent books and themes in the field."

    "I would have liked a bit more theory!",
    "It has made me more interested in the society, sexuality, and their point of interlock. it has encouraged me to have more interest in researching the sexuality in my society (country).the selected books are role models for research study. they are detailed and most of them are written in simple English language."
