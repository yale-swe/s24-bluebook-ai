   "comments": [
    "it was the only class i have ever taken that allows for such expression of my actual opinions and beliefs. so refreshing. definitely one of those classes you have to take.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Yes!!! awesome and totally applicable to the real world",
    "YES! A great class that is pretty easy",
    "Yes, highly recommend. Carreras is great, the class is interesting, we watch lots of interesting movies and clips and the grading is very fair.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to any student. The cases are interesting, the discussions add a lot to the lecture, and the exams and papers measure how much you learned not how much you can memorize.",
    "Professional ethics gives you a high level view of the different ethical theories and their real-world uses.",
    "Really interesting course. Talks about real issues and really interactive.",
    "i would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student given the interesting material and very manageable, almost relaxing, work load",
    "Yes, great class and normal workload.",
    "I would recommend it if the topic seems interesting to you and if you don't mind philosophy. Learning philosophical theories was a huge part of the class, and then we would \"solve\" a case or two toward the end of each class in relation to the theory learned.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. The workload is light, and the material covered is extremely interesting.",
    "Hell YES. Ethics is something everyone should know about before graduating college. Sadly I don't think many people realize its importance and thus can't recognize unethical behavior. So take it. You'll learn something useful for once (as in useful for actual life).",
    "Really interesting course if you put in the effort to learn the material. Didn't have to go to class to do the weekly homework assignments, midterm and final exam were take-home. The 10-pg term paper at the end was okay too - just start working on it over Thanksgiving break. Perfect gut course.",
    "Great class, prof Carreras is awesome. Homework is every week but very manageable. Very manageable",
    "Great class, assignments were easy and just had to complete. Take home exams which were simple.",
    "This class was fun but at times boring. It really is very easy. A fair amount of work but graded easily.",
    "Started off promising, but then devolved into a pretty weak course that was neither interesting nor particularly educational. Professor is a sweet heart but the content of the class lacks any real substance. It started off with some meaningful engagement with philosophy but then abandoned the more meaty content. UNrelated use of multimedia to try to make content interesting. This class has potential but unfortunately it fell short.",
    "Yes. It is interesting and not that challenging.",
    "You learn about the major schools of moral thought from Aristotle to Rawles. Occasionally, the lectures are repetitive and boring. However, I definitely feel as though I acquired very valuable knowledge and learned about the rights and wrongs of professional ethics.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. No section, enjoyed going to lecture. And the course material is interesting - really forces you to see all sides of a situation",
    "Yes, this class was a great fifth class to take this semester. It does not relate to my major, but it certainly relates to live.",
    "Controversial topics you debate and learn about different moral theories",
    "Definitely take this course if you can. Professor Carreras is one of the sweetest professors I've had at Yale. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit eccentric at times, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a total sweetheart who really cares about her students and has a lot of really cool experiences under her belt. The workload consists of reading a case study or two a week with several questions to answer about each one. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a midterm exam, a final paper and a final exam. The midterm and the final are case-study based and the paper is on just about anything you want it to be on, which makes it pretty fun to write.",
    "Professional Ethics is a very relaxed course, which makes you think about ethical dilemmas faced in the professional world. Regardless of your field of interest, the questions raised are all extremely relevant, particularly as the class is mostly seniors and therefore about to start our careers. There are weekly homework assignments that consist of reading short newspaper articles, and then two take home exams, which are glorified homework assignments, and a paper on an ethical dilemma of your choosing. Very straightforward!",
    "Great class that isn't that much work with a great professor. Take it if you can.",
    "Best class to take if youre interested jn pertinent topics about how businesses should unction and how we should behave as employees or managers",
    "This class is great. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Take it! It's an absolutely incredible class. Mercedes Carreras teaches you a lot about the different schools of ethics in a very interesting and relaxed manner",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone. Great professor and interesting material.",
    "Really interesting class. The professor is amazing, and the subject is interesting. Weekly assignments can sometimes be tedious and time-consuming, but not too much work overall.",
    "Super FUN! Great Teacher, not a difficult class, and the lectures are fun, and the homework is actually interesting and not difficult.Mercedes Carreras in wonderful! Take this class if you are looking for something fun, an easy study of philosophers and a solid credit!"
