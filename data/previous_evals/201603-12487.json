    "Learned a lot about how to think about philosophy, especially metaphysics.",
    "I gained an exposure to German thought between Kant and Hegel and a framework for understanding that periods texts. The texts themselves I can only claim to have a first passes worth of comprehension, but I am now able to return to it with an idea of the motivation and method by which different thinkers proceed.",
    "Learned about history of philosophy from Kant and to Hegel, learned about the influence of Kaballah on German thought during the time, honed skills for argumentation and paper structure organization"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I do not think that the readings were structured in a way that facilitated learning. We read exactly zero books in their entirety. Instead, we just read excerpts. If you took the class without a background of Kant, you would've been terribly confused. Having a Spinoza background from DS was also absolutely necessary to understanding at least the early portion of the course. In my opinion, the lectures put undue emphasis on the historical disputes between philosophers of the time. As opposed to clarifying or summarizing the difficult readings, or providing necessary background of the relevant philosophies.",
    "I wish Prof Franks were more responsive to students' emails. Also the lectures were not very engaging and I wish he had made more efforts to engage with the students. The first two paper prompts were not great and I did not enjoy writing those papers; I wish we had a choice over our paper topic. I wish we had greater freedom in our papers because in the first two papers I felt there were right answers which the TA was specifically looking for, and this was very frustrating.",
    "The greatest weakness of this course was the lack of engagement with the actual texts that we read. We would go to lecture, learn about different things, but not really examine the texts that we have spent so much time reading.",
    "Difficult texts are presented with clarity and with sufficient resources such that students may seek help when they need it; this, along with the professors articles that he has published about the material, are the strength of the course. The weakness occurs if it results you are not as interested in German idealism, realism, and romanticism as you thought, or do not sufficiently engage with the readings. Solid course, and necessary to understand for many purposes within and outside of philosophy.",
    "Strengths: the professor is knowledgeable, the TA is dedicated Weakness: the reading load is very heavy and the readings are not always discussed in class.",
    "The course worked with difficult material. However, it did not do so in such a way as to facilitate comprehension of said material. Lectures often covered historical information, which, while amusing, was not strictly relevant to the philosophy. More clear reconstructions of the arguments, especially in the later sections of the course, would have been much more helpful. More access to secondary sources--and fuller access to primary sources--would also have been helpful. At times, the course felt like a deliberately set up exercise in exegesis with incomplete information. Having completed the course, there are still a number of writers whom I do not understand.",
    "Strengths: most of the material is interesting, the professor does a good job of explaining complicated readings in lecture, I thought the assignment topics were chosen very well Weaknesses: Parts of the syllabus seemed disconnected from others, for example the unit on romanticism"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless they are interested in writing their thesis on something related to German idealism or metaphysics.",
    "Would recommend if you have a genuine interest in learning more about this era of German philosophy, otherwise don't take this class. The papers are not very interesting either; you don't get to pick your own paper prompt in the first two papers, and there isn't a lot of intellectual freedom for the students in their papers.",
    "If you are interested in German Idealism, this is the class to take. Professor Franks is really nice and all, but I think that this course would be a lot better if it weren't a lecture. The essays also were really annoying, and there were not many good prompts to write about. I suggest that you try another philosophy course instead of this. ESPECIALLY, if you have not taken a philosophy class before.",
    "If a student has taken DS or has some experience with Kant, even minimal, then the course will still be challenging but not overwhelming. Thus, this is not a first philosophy class to take. With time, and especially through the papers written over the semester, the texts will begin to make increasing sense and have increasing relevance outside of strict philosophy. Lectures were often dry but ultimately very helpful, but they will of greater immediate value if readings are done beforehand. Nonetheless, Professors Franks lectures and secondary-source articles hes published will provide a way to make sense of the texts at a much deeper level than otherwise possible.",
    "It's a historically and philosophical interesting period. The readings are dense. Some figures are particularly hard to understand. I would recommend if you are particularly interested in the period and religious thought (judaism and christianity).",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who knows that what they want to take is a philosophy course and is interested in the subjects listed on the syllabus. While I enjoyed the course, I realized a few weeks into it that what I was more interested in perhaps was an intellectual history course. This course was a lot of reading philosophers who constructed large philosophical systems that I found kind of interesting but also sometimes just a little silly."
