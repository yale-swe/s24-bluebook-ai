    "I would highly recommend ENAS 747 to a fellow student in engineering, science, and economics who would like to learn about numerical methods. This course is very thorough and self-contained, which do not require much preliminary background in numerical methods. The assignments and two exams help me master the material greatly and now I am ready to apply the knowledge and skills I learned from this course to my research.",
    "ENAS747 is a great course and it has taught me a lot. I highly recommend it to other students, with one caveat: it is very time consuming to finish the homework assignments in time, specially for grad students. Also, in my opinion there is practically no point in taking the course if you don't plan to do the homework well as most of the learning happens there. Overall, you will find that all the time spent doing these assignments was well worth it. The course is programming intensive, so if you don't enjoy coding you might be in for a rough ride. If you would like to improve fundamental programming skills, this can prove to be a very helpful course, as the major focus is on making programs more efficient and memory friendly. The course teaches how numerical computation has evolved over the years, and this can be an effective exercise in critical thinking and problem solving."

    "I am ready to apply the knowledge and skills I learned from this course to my research.",
    "Most engineering grad students will encounter numerical computation at some point in their careers. This course has served as a good primer on how numerical algorithms are developed and improved, and what are the limitations of various popular algorithms. Such knowledge can enable one to write code that runs in 10 iterations as opposed to 10,000. For me, a direct contribution of this course was in coding an image processing program for my research, where I could save computation time by using some of the nifty tricks I learned. The course also taught me to be more systematic in assigning arrays and running loops, that helped me avoid a crucial calculation error."
