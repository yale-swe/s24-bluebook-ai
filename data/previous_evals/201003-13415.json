    "Absolutely wonderful class and extremely interesting! I really liked the combination of student presentations with lecture. Really enjoyed the guest lectures, too. Overall, an incredibly enjoyable and informative class!",
    "Strengths: comprehensive coverage of all psychiatric disorders, application of new methods, recent publications, group participation and creative presentations, invitation of well-known psychiatrists.",
    "Great forum for discussion on mental health issues.",
    "I liked that every class period we got to listen to 2 student presentations focused on the week's topic. We talked about super interesting issues and had very relevant guest speakers come often.",
    "Great course! Really interesting to get the mental health aspects of public health issues. it really made me look at things in a different way.",
    "This course was absolutely fabulous! I really enjoyed not only how we covered mental health throughout the life course but also the discussions that we had from week to week. This has been by far the most interactive and engaging class I've had here and I felt like I got to know the backgrounds of students a lot better. Plus it's one of the only mental health courses (if not the only...) offered, and I found it refreshing to finally learn more about this topic.",
    "The class was the best one I have had at Yale school of Public Health.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at YSPH. If you're interested in mental health at all (or if you aren't and know nothing about it), you should take this class. It gives you a strong foundation in the concepts of mental health AND seeks to identify strategies where public health can intervene in the context of mental health.",
    "Great course covering a wide array of topic. Need more mental health related courses available to students.",
    "This was a fantastic course! I loved all the guest speakers we had - they added so much depth to the course and brought unique perspectives to the topics we were studying. I thought the presentations were useful for giving a jumping off point for the final paper, but there were a lot of presentations to get through for a class our size. I would have liked to dive into the readings more the class - because we sometimes just scratched the surface, I wasn't as motivated to do all the readings. Also, more small group exercises may help those who don't participate as often be able to take part in the discussion.",
    "Great class. Quite a bit of reading, but all of it was relevant. Very interesting assignments as well!",
    "It is a great course to get an overview of mental health issues that effect public health interests. Often times public health classes do not include mental health issues despite its prominence in the population. One strength was that the course reviewed many different mental health issues as well as common disorders that effect different populations."

    "This is a wonderful course--everyone should take it. This is such an important topic that can go under the radar sometimes, and I feel so much more well rounded for have taken it. Plus, Dr. Smith is the best!",
    "This class should be taken by all public health students. Mental health is an underserved area of public health so should be part of the public health curriculum.",
    "na",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Mental health is often over-looked, even in the realm of public health and this course was a great addition to the course offerings this year. It was a good balance of identifying the gaps in research and practice and offering examples of public health programs that work and allow persons with mental illness to receive the care they need and function well as a member of society.",
    "Great class, very interesting. I thought this class was a lot better than the Psychosocial and Behavioral Epi class offered in the spring, with comparable information. I loved it!"
