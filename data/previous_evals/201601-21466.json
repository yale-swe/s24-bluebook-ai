    "A fantastic and wide-ranging class taught by an enthusiastic and brilliant professor. Sometimes more of a lecture class than a seminar, but easily the best lecture I've taken at Yale.",
    "Especially for a class on a single text, this is precisely the right text, with the right professor. The Arcades Project appeals to a diverse range of students, which leads to interesting class discussion and questions in conjunction with Professor Sussman's elegantly organized and intelligent lectures."
