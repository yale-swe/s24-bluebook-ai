    "The course gives you plenty of practice speaking the language and learning the grammar. Some of the French in Action homework was repetitive and the episodes were boring. Focusing more on freewheeling discussions and less on the story of Mireille and Robert would be a nice change of pace.",
    "Strengths- organized curriculum Weaknesses- French in Action is antiquated and the pace of the course is kind of fast sometimes",
    "All sections follow the same French in Action program. It's old and the topics are sometimes irrelevant or hard to relate to.",
    "I feel strongly that I wasted much time by taking French at Yale. I started L1 thinking that I would be able to have at least a basic conversation in French, but unfortunately after two full semesters of French I can do no such thing. This course has been outdated for years and it appears that the French department has absolutely no intention of updating it anytime soon. During the course we learned outdated vocab like \"portire\" for the door of a car (when we learned this word my instructor said that no one uses this word, and they just use \"porte\" for both normal doors and car doors). The videos for the course were made in 1987 and accordingly have the technology of 30 years ago, and while some of that technology is still used, things like the minitel are certainly not used any more. As a result I have the cultural knowledge of someone in 1987, not even of someone in the twenty-first century. From the videos it seems clear that cultural knowledge is just as important as knowledge of the language, so the course would be vastly improved from updating the cultural aspects of the course. In addition to the videos being out of date, the tests for the course are apparently the same each year, which means that once you get back a test, you can't keep it. After about three minutes of going over the exam, you have to give the test back to your instructor. Not being able to keep tests after they are graded is a missed opportunity for growth, as realistically no one can really learn from their test in three minutes other than that they did well or that they did poorly. After looking them over there was a period of time where we could ask questions about what we got wrong, but being able to keep the tests would allow us to actually understand our mistakes and even form questions that don't come to our mind immediately. Honestly the fact that the tests don't change year to year seems like laziness on the part of the French department more than anything else. The main effort that would need to be put into the tests is rerecording the oral production and comprehension part, which could be tasked to the instructors that are to teach the class, or done over the summer. I find little excuse here. What's more is that one of the lessons on car vocab (all five of which come before we even know the word for bathroom, mind you) is entirely motivated by Robert trying to stalk Mireille. I honestly cannot believe that this chapter was even conceived for this text, let alone authorized and used for the last 30 years. I would expect that learning a language at Yale wouldn't involve following the plot of a stalker, but apparently for French that's too much to ask for. There are many problems with the plot of French in Action that have been brought up before that apparently have been mostly ignored, but I don't have the room to go through them here, so I'll move on. The course provided almost no real grammar rules, but instead essentially left us to just absorb them, or, as the workbook calls it, through \"observation\". While learning a language organically can be beneficial, there has to be some groundwork too. After all when you learn your first language you still take courses in the grammar of the language when you get older. You don't just start speaking the language and then never learn its grammar. In fact, the few times that grammar was explained, it was sometimes wrong, which I pointed out to the instructor, but that won't help until a new version of the text comes out, presumably. It would have also been much more sensible to learn the subjunctive much earlier in the semester, as the subjunctive clearly needs much more practice than two weeks to fully understand how and where it's used. Then comes the course packet for the course. The course packet had a number of typos and just seemed overall sloppily compiled, which also seems easily fixable with an increase of effort put into the course. I could write much more, but there is a character limit.",
    "French in Action, while sometimes amusing, is outdated. Relevant cultural content is welcomed!!",
    "I thought that this course was very strong. The immersion environment is exactly what students need in order to build up their French, and the structure of the course is logical. There is a good balance between grammar exercises (through the workbook), active speaking practice (in class), and active writing practice (through compositions). The weekly tests are a bit of a commitment, but at least they provided a good way to measure progress."

    "I would if that student needed to fulfill his or her language requirement or has an interest in French culture.",
    "This class was engaging and I learned a lot. French In Action is an antiquated method for learning, but actually does its job in teaching French. French 120 was also pretty hard though- it was a lot of work and pronunciation is stressed more than in French 110. Also, the weekly tests are really stressful. Learning unnecessary vocab is a large part of the course that comes at the cost of learning the language. Overall, though, the class was good. To be honest, only take it if you want to continue with French in the future.",

    "If you want to learn French fast, there is no faster way!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I never ceases to amaze me that we were able to cover all the most important tenses and modes by the end of our first year of French. The course is structured in a way that provides practice with all necessary skills, and the immersion environment is really the key to it all. Make sure to take it with a professor who takes that part of the class seriously, because it really makes a lot of difference."
