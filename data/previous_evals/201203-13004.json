    "A very stimulating philosophy class with relatively light reading and clear lectures. Some heady material (Hegel, Heidegger), but it's all fascinating. Sadly I don't think it will be offered again, but the lectures should become available on Professor Harries' personal website.",
    "Overview of the Pholosophy of Aesthetics from Plato and Aristotle to Hegel and Heidegger. Very abstract, but also very interesting. Definitely worth taking.",
    "This class was amazing. It is the best lecture I have had at Yale. Karsten Harries ties everything together in a beautiful and insightful way. This is what the philosophy department needs more of. This is actually what Yale needs more of. It was so good. This class gave me deep insight into some of my other classes too. The sections weren't that well structured, I think because Karsten Harries doesn't think about sections that much when planning a course. But such a good class. I will definitely take another class with Karsten Harries if I get a chance. Take a class with him before he retires!One thing I should mention is that I think a lot of the lectures were a lot more meaningful to me because I had a decent philosophy background from DS and some other classes. Be ready for some references to big thinkers who aren't on the syllabus, especially Nietzsche and Descartes. A sentence like \"Nietzsche sees Socrates in the image of Descartes\" sums up both the mastery Karsten Harries has of the history of philosophy and the beautiful tour de force that this class is.",
    "of course. the material is wonderful, harries is amazing - the syllabus is refreshingly light so you can really focus on short pieces of reading. an ideal yale experience!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested in how we look at things and what it means. Perhaps the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "It is a very engaging course if you are interested in art or beauty. It helped me understand how art is thought about, especially in the twentieth century. A very valuable introduction into how to think about art.",
    "Yes; Harries is excellent. Lectures were incredibly well thought out, eloquently written, nuanced. He may not be the most engaging speaker in the world, but the content is truly brilliant. Overall, distilled wisdom on some fascinating and thought-provoking questions about art - questions which reach surprisingly far into the way we think about the human experience.",
    "I would! Unfortunately, this is the last time it is being offered!",
    "Overview of Western aesthetics.",
    "What it says on the tin: a history of aesthetics. Since he won't teach it again, I hope Professor Harries posts his lectures on his Yale Commons Web site. Each is an essay worth reading in itself.",
    "Interesting survey of aesthetics. I would recommend this class, though it didn't really come together until the end of the semester.",
    "A truly wonderful class. One if the best. If its offered again, take it! Prof harries is excellent, of course.",
    "By far one of the best classes I've taken at yale. Prof. Harries is an amazing lecturer.",
    "Would recommend to someone interested in art + philosophy.",
    "Yes! It's really beautiful course about beauty -- how could you not want to take it?!",
    "Great topic, something on which we all have opinions, and probably opinions in need of rigorous re-examination.Great texts, as he only chooses the most important for a class of this broad scope.Great prof. A big deal in the field, and lectures well."
