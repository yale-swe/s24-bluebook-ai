    "The course allowed for research on a topic of our choosing, so I could investigate a topic of relevance for my dissertation. I appreciated thisflexibility, although it did make peer reviewing essays a bit unwieldy because of the diversity of topics. The research paper was nonetheless a useful exercise for me. I wish, again, that the earlier sessions of the course had been a bit broader; I'm not sure I came away with enough knowledge to, say, take an undergraduate exam on the subject at the end of the semester.",
    "I enjoyed the workshop format and the presentation of our papers, but I wished we had had more direction from Snyder regarding expectations and what it means to give a successful versus empty\/boring\/unhelpful presentation. He stressed staying within time limits, but other than that, there was little substantive direction.Hisinput in office hours was super helpful in framing my paper, but in class there was little in the way of suggestions, guidelines, etc... As someone who's just learning the discipline of history from a graduate perspective, I wanted a little bit more training."
