   "comments": [
    "Interesting subject matter, not always the most interesting class. Professor Quick is very knowledgeable about the subject and very available to help with homework assignments, which are not particularly difficult to complete. This class won't make you proficient in coding, but it is a good basic introduction for people who have no coding experience, especially if you have a strong interest in music.",
    "It really depends on your need out of this class. But either you want to learn about computer music or need a QR, it's solid choice. As a humanities major, I chose this class because it's a QR. It's an interesting, worthwhile but a bit challenging QR class. The class has no prerequisite, but for someone who has little background in computer science, it's difficult sometimes to figure out what's going on. Professor Quick doesn't sound super exciting (in the morning) but overall I think she's one of the hardest working instructors I've met. It's clear that she puts a lot of efforts into teaching and making sure that students understand what she teaches. She's super knowledgeable about her field and very nice and helpful!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone that is interested in music and computers.",
    "A very interesting class, but somewhat boring lectures. If you like this subject, definitely take this course; its workload is manageable and the topics taught are very interesting.",
    "A solid introductory course, Programming Music Applications helped me get somewhat up to speed with other people in the class in terms of coding, even though I had no previous knowledge with programming. The only criticism I have of the class is that the professor does not post class lectures online in the fear that people would just stop showing up to her lectures. The truth is, people either show up in the first place or don't, regardless of the slides. Posting the slides benefits those who already show up, and do little help to those who do not show up. The one midterm was definitely fair, and the project was fair as well. I truly hope she grades the final projects based on effort and not on all the difficult beyond-the-scope-of-this-course syntax that some students who clearly have been coding their whole lives who are just taking this class as an easy \"gut\" for them do. But for the rest of us who have just started learning how to code, this class is truly manageable, and the Psets don't take longer than at most 5 hours per week (assuming you get help from the TA for certain pointers).",
    "I found this class pretty interesting. It started out slow since I had prior programming experience, but the last few weeks of class were cool topics.",
    "It was a lot of fun messing around with Python and different aspects of music. Take this if you like music and want to learn programming.",
    "Not very difficult, even if you haven't programmed before. Will encounter lots of cool projects at the intersection of code and music in class. Take it if you're interested in digital humanities \/ a chill 5th credit :).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Computer science and musical principles are both extremely accessible, and this is a pleasurable way to earn a QR requirement. This class encouraged innovation and an interesting approach to problem-solving that I found very useful and very applicable to other subjects.",
    "This was a great class. Professor Quick can come off as a little boring, but is extremely approachable and knowledgable about the subject. If you are interested in computer science, music, or both I highly recommend. It is not very difficult and has a small amount of weekly work, a simple midterm, and a final project. It will be more difficult if you are new to programming, but moves slowly and will still be very manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student interested in learning the basics of coding from a musical standpoint. Do not expect to learn about synthesis or other advanced musical topics in this class though. This class is a really good way to get involved in the basic ideas that connect music and computing.",
    "This is the most accessible computer science course in the department for introducing non-computer science students to programming. It uses Python (which is by far the most useful language for most of academia) and provides a solid theoretical foundation that will be helpful to students in areas other than music. It covers everything from Markov Chains to Algorithmic composition and gives students a large degree of freedom on final projects to explore topics they want. I would highly recommend this course to other students. Donya is also an amazing teacher who quickly adapts her one-on-one teaching style to fit a students background knowledge. She is also an amazing mentor and sends student extra info that might be of interest to them.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to someone who enjoys interdisciplinary courses, but maybe not for people who expect to learn Python thoroughly."
