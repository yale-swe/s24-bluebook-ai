    "Best writing course I have ever taken. Best coourse of the semester. Professor very responsive and worked diligently to help students improve.",
    "This course is valuable to anyone who wants to figure out how to communicate a complex idea to the general public in a popular article. This sounds like it would be easy, but it's not. Fred is an excellent, caring, considerate, and thoughtful professor. You are lucky if you can can get into this course because you will learn a lot and get as much attention as you need from Fred.",
    "This class did an excellent job of walking students through the different components of an environmentalarticle and how to edit and refine those pieces into a coherent story. I really appreciated both the individual feedback from the professor and group discussions with students. The class made me think more about writing than any other class since high school! I often feel that professors require papers without explaining the key components or writing style needed for the piece. Although this course was not focused on academic writing, I think the general lessons could be applied to any environmental writing. I also look forward to applying the skills learned in this class to my blog and other writing efforts.",
    "I think that this was an excellent class taught by an enthusiastic and encouraging professor, but I often felt trapped by my own confusion over what I wanted to write and what outcomes I wanted to produce. I know that writing is a process and much of what I learned I will recognize more in retrospect than I do now.",
    "Overall the course, instructor and feedback on work was phenomenal and I will recommend it heartily to any and all students."

    "Fred is a wonderful teacher - enthusiastic and interested in every single one of his students' work. He goes over every piece of writing you do in incredible detail. I learnt a lot!It's good how we divided into teams late in the semester to review each other's work in more detail. You get great feedback on your own work and you learn from your peers' work.",
    "Personal interactions with the professor. Comments from from professor and fellows students. Access to a wide range of wonderful writing examples.",
    "The enthusiasm and commitment of the instructor is second to none in all my years of education.you have to practice writing if you want to write- and you have to read great works if you want to write great works. this class provides that.",
    "Going through the assigned articles and learning how great writers communicated their chosen messages. Also, getting feedback from Fred on my writing was a wonderful experience that I've never had before. If there were a next level of this course, I would take it.",
    "The level of detail put into feedback from both the students and the professors was beyond impressive and extremely helpful.The readings were on target and offered great examples for students to follow, regardless of each student's writing style or topic. It was very helpful to have a comprehensive guide to signature environmental writing pieces upon which to draw inspiration from.The dinner purchased for students helped ease the difficulty of taking a class 6:39 - 9:30pm, it made it easier to focus and facilitated energy for engaged discussions.",
    "Learning the basic components of a non-academic article and practicing what you've learned by writing about your own experiences\/research",
    "The amazingly detailed feedback from the professor on individual writing projects.",
    "The instructor, Prof Strebeigh is phenomenal !!",
    "Readings, class discussions, and class feedback on working drafts."

    "Perhaps a slight tweaking of the design of lecture- the professor is interested in drawing out specific answers from students and guides us towards the answer, which can get unwieldy if we're not going in the direction he's thinking about.",
    "I would have liked to spend some more time of crafting an angle for the article. We wrote multiple pieces, which had varying angles for me, and as a result I really struggled to put it all together.",
    "Overall, I thought the class was comprehensive and thorough. I think I would have appreciated more one-on-one feedback from the professor or one more additional editing round to polish the final piece. The beginning of the course certainly entailed the most work, but it worked well with the course's structure and having a strong platform for building a final piece.",
    "None",
    "The group work toward the end of the semester was fairly loosely organized. My group worked well together, but did not take advantage of peer reviewing outside of what was required for the course. I think it would be valuable to encourage more peer review if it can be done without taxing the process of writing itself.",

I try to accomplish this through my blog and Sage Writing, but I have never had formal training in writing for a general public on scientific classes. This class was perfect for filling that gap.",
    "This course helps students learn how to communicate what they've learned from their research or classes to a broader audience in an interesting and inviting way.",
    "Writing is an essential skill regardless of discipline. I don't necessarily see myself going into the field of environmental writing, but I have confidence that my writing has improved and it will continue to improve. This course helped me to become more cognizant of my grammatical mistakes and equipped me with an understanding of the various formulas (and anti-formulas) for environmental writing."

It was helpful to learn from my peers, although it was sometimes challenging to synthesize all of the individual edits into my paper. It was much more useful for clarifying complex ideas\/sentences and improving the general message or themes of the piece.",
