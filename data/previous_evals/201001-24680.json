   "comments": [
    "If you want to spend the majority of class time reading short papers written by other students and commenting on them (and having them do the same to you) then it might be worthwhile, but for people who actually want to discuss the subject matter, it's not worth your time. I've loved the other two classes I took with Professor Winroth, but this one was mostly a waste of time.",
    "Take the class if you want to learn how to write a more concise history paper, and how to carefully study mostly untrustworthy medieval sources. Don't take it if you expect to learn a ton about the religious conversion of medieval Europe, because you will likely be disappointed. That's not to say you won't learn any, but rather that you will come out with a significantly less comprehensive knowledge of the subject even if you entered it with the best of intentions (and put in a lot of work in the process).",
    "If you are interested in the period, Religious History, or improving your ability to critically analyze source material, then take this class. It is well taught and, given an appropriate level of effort on the students' parts, can be quite thrilling.",
    "The best word I can come up with to describe this class is \"aimless\". I just never knew what the goal of a given class was. The general goal of the class seemed to be to write well, rather than learning about history, really, but Professor Winroth had kinda an odd way of going about it. However, the workload is very light, which was nice. A good second junior seminar, if you want to do two, since the paper's so short. Generally a mediocre, confusing class.",
    "This is really a seminar on how to write about the middle ages. Expect to work a lot on writing in class, including in group activities. Interesting texts on a variety of medieval european cultures, culminating in a final paper on a particular medieval culture. Recommended for those with background\/interest in medieval hist. Probably slightly harder than most junior seminars, but with fair standards.",
    "I would summarize this as an advanced writing course on Medieval Europe. It is highly writing-intensive."
