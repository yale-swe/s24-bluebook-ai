    "Obviously is you're an ER&M major you have to take it. It is an interesting course and had great guest speakers. Good exposure to different kinds of scholarship out there.",
    "A good chance to meet your fellow ER&M majors. A good opportunity to think about yourself as a scholar and the choices you will make while writing your senior essay. A good opportunity to begin thinking about your senior essay. Sometimes the readings felt like things you may have read in Intro ER&M, but hopefully you can gear the discussion towards what you would find most helpful to talk about.",
    "It's a good course--solid reading and you get to hang out with your fellow majors. I don't see why you would take it if you weren't an ER&M major though.",
    "BE AN ER&M MAJOR! Therefore, you have to take this and it is worth it.",
    "Must take!"
