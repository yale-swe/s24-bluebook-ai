    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in how life evolved and is really fascinated by zoology and ecology\/conservation.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it per se since it's a lot of work. A lot of focus and much of the grade is on one final project.",
    "Good end to the bio module. Better, more cohesive lectures, but the paper is annoying. At least it's done in parts. Leo Buss is a good professor to have and makes the material easy to digest.",
    "Biol 104 was a mixed bag. Professor Buss' lecturing style is very unique, so you'll probably either love it or hate it. The class is a surprising amount of work: a final 10 page paper based on data you collect from evolution simulation programs, a final, 4 reading responses, and weekly low-stakes quizzes. You probably are required to take it though, so my best advice is don't wait until the night before the rough draft is due to collect your data (it takes a looooong time).",
    "BIOL 104 is well intended, but I feel like the final project for 104 significantly increases the workload of this module compared to the other three modules.",
    "Best class of all the introductory modules. It has a lot of weekly assignments but it is very doable.",
    "I would not take this class if you can help it. Bio 104 is perhaps the biggest reason I am changing my course of study. The material should be really cool, evolutionary biology is kinda the best and Leo Buss is a chill lecturer. But the rest of it is not worth it at all. So sorry to those who have to stick it out through this module. I am very very happy to be done with it.",
    "BIOL104 was a nice end to the intro bio sequence - although it required more work at the end (because of the final paper and the final exam), lectures were very interesting, and the rest of the workload throughout the semester was manageable.",
    "This course is the last stretch of the biology sequence, so many people are quite restless to finish the requirement off. It was not the hardest in terms of material\/concepts and it is genuinely interesting material about the origins of life. Lack of textbook makes researching concepts hard if you don't understand it the first time.",
    "Of all the intro bio modules, Bio 104 is the most unique in both material and teaching style (if you have professor Buss). Just make sure you put at least minimal effort into the lectures, because his slides will never make sense otherwise.",
    "You're most likely taking it because you have to -- more interesting than past modules. A little more work but spaced out well.",
    "I would summarize is it as a decently enjoyable class that it is required for most people in it. The material is pretty interesting and Professor Buss is good. It's a little annoying at times but not bad.",
    "Biol 104 is a wonderful end to the modules. The paper for the class can be a burden, it really isn't all that interesting to perform and writing the paper takes away from lecture since all your time will be invested in writing it. However the lectures will really make you appreciate evolution, the environment, and our world. It really made me think of evolution in a different way. You go beyond just talking about natural selection and fitness. It taught me new things about the history of Earth, the origin of life, the origin of eukaryotes, the evolution of sex, and the evolution of death. These interesting lessons makes the module worth taking.",
    "BIOL 104 is the last module of the introductory biology sequence. The class essentially goes through the history of the earth, and the material is very interesting. The course goes by incredibly quickly so it's really important to keep looking at the lecture study guides and keeping up to date in the class. The project is a huge component of the class and is a nice way to learn about scientific research and writing.",
    "BIOL 104 is the biology module about evolution and ecology. The course explores the beginnings of life and the way it has changed as the earth has evolved. Problem sets developed our understandings of the mechanism of evolution, along with a final project centered on student designed experiments. I would recommend this class to another student. It was interesting, rewarding, and well-structured. Although difficult and intimidating at moments, the workload was manageable as well.",
    "I would take this class only if you need to (which is why most people who are in the class take it).",
    "You are taking it because you have to. There are parts that are great (Leo Buss) and parts of it arent (the project\/the memory based quizzes and final). In an ideal world, I think the biology department would be better served to revert to the old system of one semester of cell biology and one semester of cell bio and one semester of evolutionary\/genetics, but the modules appear like they are here to stay for a while. If it is any consolation, 104 is probably the best of all the modules, so if you survive the first three, 104 will seem fun.",
    "BIOL 104 will provide an interesting perspective on how life developed on Earth, and the course material is meritorious for offering critical analyses of modern biodiversity. However, the class's homework is particularly tedious, and, unless another student were required to take the class for his\/her major, I would recommend auditing this class for the lectures and not bothering with the research paper.",
    "BIOL 104 was my favorite module, even if it might have been the one I did the most poorly in. Why, you ask? Two words: \"The project.\" To be honest, it isn't that bad. You have to conduct independent research using a software program that simulates evolution and write up a full research report on your findings, integrating outside sources as well. The problem is overthinking it and coming up with a huge jumbled mess of data, ideas and information that you can't possibly assemble into a coherent piece of work. If you keep it simple (you don't really even need to start early, like they'll repeatedly tell you to), you should be fine, honestly. As for the rest of the course, material is very interesting, Professor Buss is a fun, engaging and charming lecturer, the exam at the end was very fair, and Professor Buss's study guides are a godsend. Would recommend to anyone interested in the history of life, evolution, ecology or zoology!",
    "A somewhat refreshing change from the other bio modules, and as long as you're okay with things being a little hectic in class, totally (if not more) manageable than the others. All the instructors know it's a bit different and that it can be hard to keep up with notes and all the geological history content, but they compensate for this by making the curve very fair, helping with deadlines for different parts of the project, and providing great study guides which literally contain EVERYTHING you have to know. The final project was not at all daunting because of the different due dates they gave for each part. The reading responses were also good because they coincided directly with class and were a relatively interesting way of keeping you up to speed on reading. Leo was a great professor and Surjit was even better - absolutely take advantage of enrichment sections if you can.",
    "I would only recommend this class as a premed requirement or as a prerequisite to more advanced and interesting evolutionary biology courses.",
    "If you're majoring in the biological sciences or you're pre-med, you have to take it. It's as simple as that. With Professor Buss, the lectures are well led and interesting. The readings can supplement the majority of what you'd learn in lecture, and the written work is uninspiring. However, the course isn't difficult if you give an honest effort, and the teaching staff really works hard to make it as painless as possible. If you're planning on pursuing E&EB, you can consider it a broad introduction to that major. For others, it's a right of passage. Go in with an open mind and you'll be fine.",
    "It's an intro evolutionary biology class that focuses more on the history of life than on evolution. I would say it provides a good balance on microbial life but many of the concepts presented in the class are much better understood if you've taken other classes in the subjects. The final project is kind of silly and the guidance given wasn't great.",
    "I would not take BIOL 104 for fun, though as far as an introductory biology course I thought it was fine.",
    "Out of the four biology units, this was by far my favorite. Granted, I'm biased because I'm an E&EB major, but it was still so interesting and Prof. Buss did such a great job of making it interesting, entertaining, and story-like. There's a fair amount of work (three psets early on, 6 readings + 4 reading responses, a big final paper done in segments, and a final exam), but the work is all pretty helpful. The psets prepare you for the final project, and they're basically playing with evolution games, so that's fun. The readings are hilarious, and very helpful. And the final paper is staggered in portions, so you can't really fall too far behind. All in all, really enjoyed 104! Obviously, if you don't find bio interesting, don't take it (though you still might have fun), but I thought that, as an intro lecture goes, this was really good!",
    "BIOL 104 was an interesting course that required a lot of work. The lectures were enjoyable, the work was less so. Oftentimes, the work was time consuming and not very helpful in reinforcing course material.",
    "Take it if you need to.",
    "It's kind of just a class u have to take. And it's pretty well done. The project idea is a good one but please find a different software!!!!!",
    "As you're unlikely to make a decision about this course in isolation (or by choice), I'll be brief. 104 is the best of the four intro biology modules, which, admittedly, is not the highest of bars. Professor Buss is an entertaining and engaging lecturer, but the course can seem a bit disorganized at times. Grading is fair and not too tough. As someone passionate about the study of evolutionary biology, I'll say that Professor Buss does a good job of conveying its wonder and appeal. Sometimes the treatment is less than elegant (more like a survey of biological oddities and curiosities), but it conveys the beauty of nature all the same. You're not likely to have your life changed by this class, but with a little effort and curiosity you'll definitely enjoy it.",
    "If you have to take it, it is very manageable.",
    "Out of the four modules, BIOL 104 was definitely my favorite because it contained proper enthusiasm and organized grading and teaching policies. Hence, I would strongly recommend it for those interested in evolutionary biology, or for those majoring in biology or following a premed track.",
    "Best of the intro biology modules.",
    "Only take bio104 as necessary for pre-med or as a pre-req. Otherwise it is not worth taking purely for the educational content. It is designed for a certain student (which I am not), and therefore I worked hard, suffered, and struggled to keep up with others who are naturally better at this type of project we did.",
    "BIOL 104 is a mandatory pre-med requirement, so if you have to take it, you have to take it. Despite this, Professor Bus makes this course enjoyable and rewarding. Although you have to do a lot of work for this class, you seriously learn a lot, so try to enjoy the ride!",
    "I wouldn't do it for fun or because you need a science credit-to many different pieces to take care of (quizzes, problem sets, write-ups and the project is no joke). Time consuming.",
    "Yeah take this class with Prof. Buss. He's a boss and he has a wikipedia page, wrote some awesome books, and starts each class with some groovy music and video. He goes on tangents sometimes and I don;t really know what he's talking about, but I think he always knows what he's taking about, so that's cool. Don't fall asleep in his lecture... or do and see what happens.",
    "This was an interesting class and I learned a lot in the end, but it is difficult to engage with the material and the final paper is a lot of work.",
    "BIOL 104, \"Ecology & Evolutionary Biology\" is basically a history of life on Earth and how changes in the Earth system can lead to changes in the flora and fauna. It covers evolutionary biology much more than ecology, and I was disappointed at how little ecology was included. However, the material is extremely interesting, and applies to anybody no matter their major. It also nicely integrates the material learned in the previous three modules. Whether you're new to these concepts or pretty familiar with them, the class will accommodate you. Despite having a strong background in these subjects, I was impressed by the class and repeatedly blown away by new concepts I had never heard of. The readings are great too. Very easy to read and engaging. Also, the final project is really fun and allows you to investigate something interesting to you. Finally, Professor Buss is hysterical, and a great professor. Definitely take it with him. Very funny and knowledgeable in the subject matter. 100% recommend.",
    "It's an interesting course, but your grades depend upon your TA. Make sure to talk to them about your project, because they will be the ones grading them.",
    "Project is a nightmare. Everything else is fun and interesting."
