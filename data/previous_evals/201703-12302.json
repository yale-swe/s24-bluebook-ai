   "comments": [
    "I increased my understanding of Spanish constitutions and legal proceedings. I improved my listening comprehension in Spanish and my speaking skills, in addition to significant writing skills through multiple weekly assignments and a ten-page final paper.",
    "This class taught me some of the technicalities of law and made me think about some contentious topics in a new manner.",
    "It was a good way to practice my spanish every week",
    "Improved my Spanish writing slightly. Never covered grammar, this class is more about putting forth your ideas about legal\/political issues in Spanish.",
    "I enjoyed the fact that this class often talked about contemporary issues from a legal perspective. I think this class was very useful because we practiced debating, public speaking, and developed research skills.",
    "I gained some new Spanish vocabulary surrounding legal issues and developments. I also gained some foundational legal theory knowledge, such as the difference between civil and common law.",
    "My Spanish definitely improved and I learned about the law in the language that I will most likely practice in, which is very insightful",
    "I got a basic understanding of some important legal concepts applicable both in the US and in Spanish-speaking countries. I also had the opportunity to practice my Spanish through group projects and in-class discussions.",
    "Through this course I was able to improve my knowledge of the spanish language in addition to learning about the legal system in the U.S. along with other countries.",
    "I was able to develop the ability to talk about important issues (abortion, the death penalty, immigration) in presentation form. However, I would have liked it better if it was an actual live debate.",
    "I was able to learn legal terms and topics in Spanish including where laws get there authority, the difference between English Common Law and the Hispano World and civil and penal codes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One strength of the course was that homework was often a balance between listening to videos and answering questions, and writing essays. I thought this was a good balance, because it helped me build two critical skills--comprehension and writing. One weakness of the course was that classes took on more of a lecture than a seminar format. The professor certainly required us to participate via asking, answering, and responding to questions, and promoting small group breakout discussions, but I wish that there had been more group discussion as a class. I think that a classroom around a table, rather than rows of chairs, would facilitate this.",
    "I liked the homework structure in the class. However, it did not do a great job at helping me learn Spanish. There were so many flaunt speakers in the class that I felt uncomfortable speaking during class and ended up not practicing my speech at all the entire semester except for during the debates.",
    "Strengths: very fun and engaging material Weaknesses: Homework assignments are sometime unclear before very close to the deadline",
    "I enjoyed how the course was shaped by the students and had a lot of room for meaningful discussions. Professor Carreras took the time to give each student feedback on their assignments.",
    "The homework assignments, which included video responses and written responses to legal prompts, were a bit disconnected from the content of the court. The debates were also not as interactive as they could have been; they ended up being more presentations than debates. The vibe of the course was very upbeat, though, and Professor Carreras cared about her students and gave us lots of space to direct the course in the direction we wanted.",
    "Professor Carreras is incredibly blind and understanding and lets students participate to the extent they feel comfortable. There Ivan be a lack of structure to the lectures, but this was often somewhat refreshing.",
    "This course was very strong in the fact that it was very interesting and the lecture was kept engaging so that it was fun to learn. The only weakness that I would point out would be that it was a bit disorganized at times.",
    "The strength of this course lies in the opportunities that the Professor gives the students in improving their Spanish writing abilities. It could be improved by requiring students to participate even more in class.",
    "Definitely the flexibility and topic interest of the course were particularly attractive. However, I felt that weekly homework assignments could have used some improvement. Instead of consistent videos with questions simply about subject matter, I feel that more readings of the course text packet and occasional reflections might be more useful. Additionally, clearer organization including a course table at the start of the course might be better.",
    "Maybe more structure with the syllabus"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in taking an upper level Spanish class, improving listening comprehension and writing skills. My speaking skills did improve, but not as much as I had hoped. There is not too much pressure, and the class has an atmosphere that facilitates kindness and learning.",
    "This is a great class to take if you are good at Spanish and can actually participate in class. If not, you will not get much out it.",
    "Yes definitely! A great spanish credit.",
    "Good fifth class. Interesting topics but homework is busy work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was a great way to keep practicing Spanish at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class! It is not the most rigorous class at Yale for sure, but serves its function of adding legal terms (the kind that Google Translate fails to effectively provide) to a student's vocabulary.",
    "Very relaxed course with definitiely not as much work as the syllabus suggests. Prof Carreras is very nice and helpful.",
    "Definitely take this class, especially if youre trying to practice you Spanish skills (HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR NATIVE SPEAKERS)",
    "I would recommend this course both to people who are driven to participate in class discussions and really practice oral and written Spanish and also to people looking for a fifth class who want exposure to illegal topics in a relaxed environment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course - it was interesting and engaging, and facilitated learning in a relaxed manner.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to people interested in pursuing a job in a law related field. It definitely introduces people to terms that they might not otherwise know in an everyday Spanish conversation.",
    "Yes, I would likely recommend this course. It was very fun, interesting and helpful with the Spanish language. I'm confident that with a few organizational adjustments it might be better.",
    "Not bad for an L5 Spanish."
