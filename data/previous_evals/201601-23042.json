    "If you have a chance to take this course take it -- although I doubt anyone needs to be told that. You get the opportunity to learn about poetry, and be in discussion with one of literature's great critics. And though Prof. Bloom's reputation might be intimidating I found that the course itself was not. Discussions are fairly open ended and class guided. It might be helpful to have been in Directed Studies before taking this course or have some classical background knowledge although it is not required."
