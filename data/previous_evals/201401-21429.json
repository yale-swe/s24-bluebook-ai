   "comments": [
    "A French class that is mostly covering literature and film but that has a significant grammar and vocabulary component for students who feel their French isn't quite up to snuff yet.",
    "French 150 is a challenging French class that focuses on grammar, vocabulary, writing skills and oral participation. The readings are very interesting and provide lots of opportunities for engagement.",
    "Take this class, and take it with Madame Schneider. This class improves your french skills on all levels in a nice way. You read interesting, often hilarious texts, watch great movies, and discuss it in a fairly simple yet insightful way. Take it with Schneider because she cares so much about it. Her passion is infectious. She loves the texts and films we read and watch. She also creates all the course materials, including the course packet, tests, and exams, so you know you're getting the real deal with her. She's also french, so you learn so much by just speaking with her, especially in terms of the cultural language snipets of french ie how to say um, what french jokes sound like, how french sounds if she is impersonating someone else, etc etc. You really learn a lot. Take it!",
    "French 150 is a LOT of work, often an unnecessary amount if you ask me. It was certainly good for my French skills, my vocabulary and grammar improved dramatically, but it was a big time commitment and some weeks we would have an essay, a test, several readings, and a movie to watch and other weeks we would have barely anything. I think the class could be better if the workload was a little lighter\/better spread out.",
    "French 150 is a chimera of a course, but it is useful for a student who is good at French but doesn't yet feel ready to take literature courses. We watched movies, read and discussed texts, learned vocabulary, went over specific topics of grammar that often get overlooked in HS, and practiced our speaking a lot in French. Mme. Schneider was a great instructor, and was always entertaining in her French humor, but make sure you're always prepared for class and be there on time!",
    "The class continues and reviews the concepts of FR 140 while adding new ones. It is definitely a lot of work, but rewarding because if you do put in the work, the final exam is not hard to study for. The readings are interesting, and most of the films are as engaging. I would recommend the class to a fellow student.",
    "Learn french by reading short stories, watching movies and discussing the content."
