   "comments": [
    "The weekly homework assignments were \"designed\" to take 6 hrs to complete, according to the instructor. However, they usually took up to 10-12 hrs to complete. The workload for this course was very heavy.",
    "Question 7: Tomlin is great: funny, easygoing, responsive, knowledgeable, helpful, earnest... just a pleasure. He's also a GIS machine, the man thinks in spatial data.",
    "This course was a disappointment. Although the instructor was entertaining, it stops there. There was little or no application to forestry and environmental studies. The assignments were not engaging and the instructor communicated his expectations poorly.",
    "The course moved to quickly for anyone to have a firm grasp and understanding of what we were doing. Would be better to go slower and really solidly learn and understand what we were doing.",
    "The GIS (Raster) was the best class i have taken this semester. The instructor is exceptional and insightful and very responsive. However, the work load is lot more and you can spend days working on it.",
    "I'm torn over this class. I wish there had been a less intense GIS course at FES, perhaps one that is half raster, half vector, maybe focused on the practical applications rather than the theory and math (which, by and large, was over my head). I didn't get much out of class because when I tried to follow his actions using the software on the overhead, I couldn't listen, and when I listened but didn't follow his actions, I had no idea how to recreate what he was doing. It was just doing the assignments that taught me everything, and learning from my peers.This course actually challenged me in ways that most FES courses do not. It was something I wasn't comfortable with that I had to dink around with for hours.I guess I'm glad I can put GIS on my resume now, but I know I will never be a GIS mapper, and it prevented me from taking other classes that would have been more applicable to my areas of interest.",
    "Question 2 - instructor tended to answer student questions with cryptic answersQuestion 3 - class assignments took waaay longer than 6 hours, and even when I spent 12 hours, I still got an average grade. However, I appreciated the open-endedness of the homework format. I think I learned a lot more than I would have through a typical GIS follow-the-directions format.",
    "this is not a class that technically falls within my \"interests\" or area of study, but i think this is a useful skill to have, and provides tool by which to read and interpret data.- professor tomlin is highly knowledgeable, and presented lecture material in a very organized fashion, but i did not tend to absorb from being shown operations on the computer. learning mostly happened through assignments- in terms of workload, assignments took significantly longer than purported.",
    "Professor Tomlin is unlike any professor I've ever had. I was incredibly impressed with his lecture style. He has a uniquely fresh way of explaining geographical concepts which I greatly appreciated. He is also amazingly responsive. For someone who spends only 14 hours a week in New Haven, he was much more accessible via email than most other professors are in person.",
    "The TA for this course was not as accessible as the one from Modeling Geographic Objects. Her office hours were not at convenient times, and when I had a question for her she could not help."

    "The Prof is clearly very knowledgeable about the subject matter. He is brilliant, but sometimes I think he forgets that some of us are learning this material for the first time and perhaps he could slow down a little and teach the same tools\/operations for 2 lectures at a time rather than introducing new material every class.",
    "Dana's passion and his creative class assignments that were fun and challenging.",

    "Its conceptual underpinning which allowed a flawless application of GIS fundamentals and understanding throughout our varied interests.",
    "The homework! While the map assignments took a long time, I had a great time doing them, and I learned more through the process of the homeworks than I would have without them.",
    "This is one of the few courses at FES where you learn a specific, marketable, technical skill, and I wish there were courses like this one in that way.",

   "comments": [
    "More focus on application, less on theory. Teach it in a lab with computers so we can follow along and know what buttons to press. lets discuss theory after we've learned how we can use the program. No need to be in class for 3 hrs talking theory and allowing people to fall asleep when we could be following along on how to use the program=-which is the biggest take away from a gis course--normally.",
    "I think the course should be taught in a computer lab. It's very difficult to listen to the Prof lecture about how to do something on the computer without practicing it as you go. I understand you can bring your computer to class, but it's very difficult to follow him because often he would just talk about how to use a certain operation but he wouldn't actually show it on the monitor.I understand that the Prof was trying to get us to think creatively about GIS, but seeing as it was my first GIS course, I think I would have responded much better if he had just given us assignments with step by step instructions. It's difficult as it is to understand how to use the operations and the software. Adding another level of complexity by forcing us to think about how to use these tools creatively might be better suited for a higher level (not intro) class.",
    "the two or three assignments that were so difficult that you scratched at your eyes until 5 in the morning without making progress",
    "Assignments and readings tend to be very very vague.",
    "This is a course that needs complete restructuring and application to the environmental sciences.",
    "perhaps some modules that are field specific, like epidemiology and environmental hazards, etc. to help show more applied uses of GIS",
    "I think that the instructor could add some hours at the lab practicing the software.",
    "Better course materials. They were v. difficult to understand.",
    "The assignments were sort of canned in the sense that the data was all correctly formatted and compatible. My sense is that in real world projects the data has all sorts of incompatibilities that have to be fixed up. I would have preferred if at least a few of the assignments involved collecting publicly available data and massaging it as necessary to make it useful, then doing something with it. I understand that this would add a certain amount of complexity for both the student and teacher but I think it would be worth the extra effort to have some realistic experience.",
    "The TA sessions never worked for me. The instructor has to make that one of the TA session is either on Friday or one of the weekend.",
    "i wouldn't change anything",
    "- i found lectures dry and not as useful as hands on activity...- grading system is frustrating and feels fairly subjective.- assignments were highly time consuming\/more time consuming than they were supposed to be... especially with a subjective grading system, this could be frustrating.",
    "The class assignments should not be graded on a curve. We were supposed to spend no more than 6 hours on each assignment. However, most people started spending much longer than 6 hours on the assignment because of the \"grade curve.\"... Thus it was soon the case that in order to avoid getting a bad grade you would be forced to spend more than 6 hours. The result is that people spent much longer than they should have, sometimes at the expense of other schoolwork or other learning. Most of the learning took place in the first 6 hours and these additional hours were not very useful."
