Over Thanksgiving I read a few books and summarized them for my 10-page requirement. What a silly process, emblematic of a lack of caring by the History department",
    "Absolutely enroll in this course if you would like to graduate! Highly recommended.",
    "Very self-directed work, not much structure throughout the term",
    "This is the first semester of the senior essay for History majors. It's when we finalize your topic, research, develop a focus, and begin constructing an argument. There are due dates spaced throughout the semester for different writing assignments related to the senior essay.",
    "hey, if you're a history major... you're in this. dassit.",
    "you have to take it",
    "It is a very important part of completing your Senior Essay because it forces you to think and develop your topic or potential topics throughout the entire year."
