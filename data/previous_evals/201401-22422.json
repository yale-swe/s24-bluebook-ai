   "comments": [
    "This course introduces students to a variety of fantastic texts and links them in provocative and creative ways. Because it is not a tightly structured course, it requires that students are quite engaged with the material and bring their own concerns to the discussion, so students should be prepared to make a commitment to active participation each week.",
    "Yes, this is a great course for those who are interested in American literature, but are keen to explore alternative ways of thinking about otherwise canonical texts."

   "comments": [
    "The course exposed me to some fantastic texts that I am interested in incorporating into my future research. It also pushed me to think more critically about interdisciplinary work, which is always an important exercise.",
    "This course helped me to think about different ways of reading texts across genres, periodization, and geography. I especially appreciated the transnational nature of many of the texts we read. This course gave me the space to rethink through texts I had read many years ago, which will be helpful in teaching. However, it also gave me a chance to engage with writers that I will perhaps include in my dissertation work."
