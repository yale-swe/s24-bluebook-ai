    "This class is an intense analysis of the works of three great American poets. For anyone with an interest in American poetry of any period, it is certainly worth the struggle to be admitted. The course will change the way you think about poets of the 19th and 20th centuries.",
    "Great class. Bloom is a genius and a mensch. Of course, the reason to take this class is to get to know Bloom, but the syllabus is great, too. Bloom's discussions are often somewhat disjointed, but he tells great stories and really gets to the heart of what he's talking about. He's also great to talk to outside of class and very easy to form a real relationship with. This class has been one of my best experiences at Yale.",
    "Look--everything you've heard is true. Bloom does ramble, he often ignores students' comments (mostly because he can't hear so well), and he rushes from one poem to another so quickly sometimes that you want to yell \"NO WAIT WE ALL HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO SAY, WHY ARE YOU LETTING ONLY TWO PEOPLE SPEAK ON THIS POEM BY WHITMAN THIS IS ABSURD.\"But all that aside, Professor Bloom creates an environment where thinking deeply and reflectively about poetry, and examining the work of a poet as a dynamic and self-perpetuating process rather than as a fixed and frigid text, is the norm. He has a remarkable ability to make poems *breathe*, and he looks at and talks about poets and characters alike--Whitman, Dickinson, Emerson, Ahab, Ishmael--as if he knew them personally, as if they are *people* with whole subjectivities rather than closed entities: a Writer, a Character. The ability to look at a poem and let it seep into you so deeply that you understand on an intuitive level what it is trying to say rather than on a rational one, is a rare one, and it is one that this class offers. And, of course, there is an ineffable pleasure in getting to spar with Bloom, and to be welcomed into his ever-expanding cadre of academic grandchildren.If you can get in, take it. Take it as a 6th class. THIS IS IMPORTANT! I'm serious about this--it's what I did and it's the perfect class to take as a sixth one. There's barely any reading, andwhatever texts are considered in class are first read aloud (\"chanted\") by a student. The paper is not insubstantial, but he's so flexible with deadlines that he essentially lets you start it after dorms have closed if you need to. So if you're thinking about whether to take this or another class, and you want 5, just take both.And don't worry about the \"application essay\". Just write a lot of words about what you think about writing and reading, breathe onto the page.",
    "An amazing look at some of the very best American literature, in the presence of a truly great mind. Not a normal seminar -- discussions are riddled with paragraph-long digressions from the man himself, and the flow of conversations can be interrupted by his desire to move on (there is a hell of a lot to cover in these weekly sessions). But Bloom assembles a great class, and when discussion gets going, it's great. This class involves regular visits to his house for tea; don't let this intimidate you if you really are interested in this literature. This class (like this syllabus) is all about Bloom. And getting to know the great man well is a pretty amazing experience.",
    "I took this class for the curriculum, which did not disappoint. Bloom is a great thinker and a kind mentor, though perhaps not a kind thinker or a great mentor. You'll have to decide for yourself though, since too much as been said on the matter, which is obviously a personal one. I am very glad I took this class, and am glad I had a chance to speak with Bloom about some great works. Others may not feel the same.",
    "Just prepare yourself mentally to be buffeted by the strongest coalition of section hogs you have ever encountered. I would suggest fortifying yourself with some sort of numbing agent: cognac or vodka or rubbing alcohol, perhaps.",
    "A very special experience to sit at a seminar table with Harold Bloom and have wonderful informal discussion of some of the best American authors. I would greatly recommend any lover of literature and poetry to take this class.",
    "This class is unlike any course I've ever taken before at Yale. No other professor has been so committed to the idea of pedagogy, to his students, and to the material. Bloom is famous for a reason, but don't take the course just because he's famous. Take it because you love the works. He'll help you expand them to context-filled, explosive levels.",
    "Professor Bloom is an honorable scholar and one of the great teachers at this university. He has marinated in these texts for years, and it is a joy to be able to partake of the wisdom he has found in them."
