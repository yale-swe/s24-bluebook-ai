   "comments": [
    "Lot's of work but a lot of reward! Definitely take this section, especially if you are intersted inpolitics, economics, or international relations. Make use of the writing center and tutors from the get go and don't be afraid to meet with Professor Gosselink. It was so great to be surrounded by student who had a vested interest in this topic and who themselves were really global (I had classmates from China, Swaziland, the Philippines, Cambodia, Jamaica, Canada) and had really interesting ideas and perspectives. DO THE READINGS!!!! You will be cheating yourself if you don't.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone who feels a bit shakey about the quality of their writing. I definitely learned a lot about how to structure essays and make clear arguments. During this course we wrote a 5 pg essay, a 7 pg essay, a 10 pg essay and did a presentation. We had some essays to read for homework, but overall, it was very light on reading.English 114 is a course that teaches students how to improve the structures of their essays and how to effectively communicate ideas.",
    "Take English 114 'Acting Globally' if you are truly interested in developing a critical viewpoint on what it means to be a Global citizen in this day and age. As a prospective Global Affairs major, this course was awesome for me. I would recommend it to anyone!",
    "Recommend!It's a necessary class if you want to be exposed to readings that relate to global action.Helpful for reconsidering your viewpoint on issues that affect social welfareHelpful for improving your ability to convey your ideas",
    "Take ENG 114 as soon as you can. Your writing skills will drastically change over the course of the term. There are of course many different sections for ENG 114. Each section has different theme, but if you like globalization, you should really take ENG 114 with Prof Gosselink! She is really kind and patient, which is all any student can ask for when he\/she has mid-terms and essays from other classes to work on.",
    "Yes. I'd definitely recommend it to freshmen and sophomores who are not familiar\/ confident about their academic writings. This is an intensive writing class that teaches you the essentials of academic writings. You will be much more confident about your academic writing at Yale after taking this course. If you are interested in global affairs, definitely take this course. The papers discussed in this class are highly relevant and important in the academic world. The research-based paper also has a large flexibility to allow you to write on the topics of your interests.",
    "Take it but with a light schedule. I was in Gosselink's course and it was a good time but bad time because I took it concurrently with CHEM 220 (orgo).",
    "I will definitely recommend this class to another student, especially who is unfamiliar with college essay writing.",
    "This course helps you learn to write and learn to think about major issues. The class helps you to learn, but doesn't just give you everything you need to know. It's there as a guide through your thinking and writing processes. I would recommend this class to another student because I really enjoyed it and also learned a lot about caring.",
    "English 114 is a writing intensive course that really helps you learn more about US academic writing. I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student because it hones your skills as a writer. Also, the topic of this course, \"Acting Globally,\" was very interesting.",
    "This class has greatly improved my writing abilities at the college level. However, the workload was more than I expected for an English 114 class. In addition, there were alot of periodic assignments. They seemed annoying at the time, but really help keep you on track on reflection. I'd still recommend shopping other sections, unless you are really passionate about Acting Globally. However, the presentation at the end of the semester was awesome and great fun.",
    "English 114 07 is a demanding seminar that helps you to dramatically improve your academic writing and engages you in research and discussion of development and other global issues. Several multi-stage argument essays (with preparatory assignments, outlining, peer reviews,and teacher feedback) offer you ample time to improve your approach to the writing process and your style. As far as I can tell, these skills are going to help me throughout college; so take this course as early as possible. Because this section has a theme of global issues and development, I would particularly recommend this course to students who are curious about their engagement with the rest of the globe and\/or interested in addressing global problems in the future."
