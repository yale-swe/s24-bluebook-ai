   "comments": [
    "This is a very solid language course. It is well organized and well taught. It emphasizes speaking, reading, and writing to equal amounts, and it is not especially difficult.",
    "I think that this class was a good transition from high school, because, in a lot of ways, it was like a high school Spanish class. If you want a class that really challenges your Spanish writing and speaking, this wouldn't be the ideal choice.",
    "I would recommend the class.",
    "A review of everything learned in L1 and L2, find a good and lenient instructor",
    "The class is frustrating in terms of grading insofar as I talked to other students and their teachers seemed to grade much more leniently. I felt a bit slighted.",
    "If you're reading this right now then it is already too late for you too pick a different language. I'm sorry...",
    "I would recommend this course. It will improve anyone's skills in Spanish as long as they buy in and do the work. I was very happy with this course. As long as the person is interested in Spanish, they will enjoy this course.",
    "SPAN 130 is in general more work than 120, but not by much. It is definitely harder, however, to scrape by with an A or A-. Do the daily homework and such because it will help you greatly on the quizzes and tests. Professor Tortora is excellent.",
    "This class involves a lot of busy work with a couple larger assessments, but they are often helpful in the long run. Your grammar and reading skills may improve, but don't expect this class to help your speaking or writing skills. Professor Tortora is competent and friendly as long as you take class seriously and come prepared and willing to participate."
