    "ITS HARD. There is SO MUCH about trees to learn. You think there can only be so much to learn about Trees, but every day it surprises me that there could possibly be more to learn. THERE IS. You learn about Wood and the anatomy and physiology of wood and trees and plants.",
    "Definitely take this course!! It's super interesting and not only do you learn about the physiological processes of trees, but you also learn about practical applications of wood in music and sports. Craig is an amazing instructor who obviously cares a lot about both the material he teaches and his students. The class is not a gut so be prepared to actually go to class, pay attention, and take good notes.",
    "It's \"aight\". Like, the slides pretty much have most of the material on them if you aren't going to go to lecture but you really should go to lecture because they make the words on the slides actually mean something. Also, going to lecture lets you know when your quizzes are and when the homeworks are due. If you need a science credit then use it as a last resort but it won't be easy and you'll have to put more time than you think into it. I probably wouldn't take it again if I had the chance to redo the semester but I'm also feeling very \"whatever\" about it sooo all in all its a plain \"meh\" class. Also you'll get laughed at for taking it because people not in it don't understand that it is not a gut.",
    "I would recommend Trees to other students. While I would not say it was my favorite class at Yale thus far, it was an interesting science credit and a fun experience overall.",
    "Not a gut class like you might think, but is easy enough if you follow along during lecture and study for exams.",
    "Excellent science credit. Truly interesting material, a focus on scientific principles and concepts (rather than memorizing). Craig is dedicated and good at explaining science to people with little knowledge\/background, and should only get better over the years. You'll come out of this class being able to appreciate nature so much more, and you'll see how much you've learned if you just take a stroll through the woods.",
    "I really loved this class. Even if you aren't a big fan of plants or trees, this is a wonderful science credit, and if you go in with an open mind, you'll likely leave with a whole wealth of new knowledge and a newfound love for trees and plants and a host of other things. I definitely recommend this class. Professor Brodersen's calm enthusiasm for trees is wonderful, and he managed to make even some of the less interesting lectures charming. Also, I really liked the mini field trips. Oh, and the workload was quite manageable. Biweekly, very short quizzes (that ended up being less than biweekly), six homework assignments, two midterms, and a final--all manageable and not too hard if you put in some work. Basically, I say take it.",
    "I took this because I am not a science-minded person, and I got destroyed. There is a huge amount of info on every test, lecturers are dull, and there's no curve. Don't recommend for the non-science oriented student.",
    "Honestly, a pretty good class. Beware, it is a science credit and you have to learn actual science. But if you pay attention in at least most of the lectures you will be really fine. The hour and fifteen minute thing this year was tough; Craig is a great guy, but even he acknowledged that his voice is not the most engaging. I did not take a single note since the first midterm and I did pretty well in the class considering. You do have to study, but its overall pretty interesting to learn about trees (and Craig LOVES them).",
    "There are so many courses more deserving of your time in this field and in any field literal and figurative. This was probably the worst course I took at Yale.",
    "Trees has been one of my favorite classes at Yale among a full 7 semesters of courses. The class got off to a fairly slow start, but after the third lecture or so, I was excited to go to class each day. The material is all interesting and generally very relevant, and the way its organized is good as well. I felt like all the tests and homework assignments were fair, and I liked the variety of grades that made each particular component less stressful. Professor Brodersen is a good and enthusiastic teacher. The activities outside of class were fun and encouraged me to visit places at Yale that I would not otherwise go to (Yale Art Gallery, Musical Instruments museum). I am a science major, so it definitely made certain aspects of the class easier, but I would still highly recommend this class to everyone. Trees are actually pretty amazing!",
    "Trees is not a gut science, so if you're looking for an easy science credit, this is not the class for you. However, you will learn a lot of really awesome stuff about Trees and the environment. I feel like I actually understand a lot of what's going on with climate change right now (and how it relates to trees), which I value because climate change is such an important issue. I took the class for distributional requirements, and even though it was a lot of work, as a non-science major it was a great choice for me.",
    "Good science credit; can be scattered at times, and at first seemed impossible to figure out what we were supposed to know for the tests (one of the midterms was incredibly specific, but the final was very general and open-ended. The homework assignments were interesting- sometimes logistically annoying, but nice and very different from assignments in most other classes. Craig is a great professor, and very reasonable.",
    "Would not recommend. TAs are grossly incompetent\/ignorant about many of the topics of the course and don't seem invested in the students, their understanding of the material, or their overall success in the course.",
    "I liked this class. I've always loved trees and learning about them enriched my life! Leading up the exams, I studied for 3 to 4 days and did well. My friends who didn't try at all got 60s. In summary, take the class if you find your thoughts drifting to things like the shapes and colors of leaves. Studying comes naturally as reviewing this material will be fun for you!",
    "Trees is kind of a gut, kind of not. There is no accountability for attendance in a class its size, and homework assignments are easy enough to do the night before. Quizzes arent bad at all, and the field trips are quite fun. Tests, however, are a bit of a wild card. With a little bit of studying you should hit the mean, but we never knew what the curve was for this class, so I'm not sure how harsh or generous the grading is. TFs were hit or miss. Be proactive in making sure they receive all your assignments. If you go to lecture and do the work, you'll walk away from the class with an appreciation for trees and some interesting knowledge--more than can be said of most SC credits. Take with a friend if you can.",
    "Overall, good class for non-science major, however, is pure memorization and tests seem to be an information dump.",
    "I recommend that other students TAKE THIS CLASS. You will not be disappointed. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. HOWEVER BEWARE THAT THIS IS NOT A GUT, no matter what other people have told you. It's not a overtly difficult class but you need to put in work to get a good grade.",
    "Recommended as a gut science class for non-science majors, do not recommend for a science major (you'll find it at times boring and not very intellectually stimulating). Craig makes the material relevant by incorporating frequent field trips (all mandatory). Easy homeworks, predictable exam questions. Be warned that your experience in the class is highly dependent on which TF you receive. The TFs don't seem to grade homeworks and exams using a standardized scale: my friends and I would make the same mistakes on homeworks and exams and get very different number of points taken off.",
    "I would wait to take this course. This was the first year it was offered as a lecture rather than a seminar, and the growing pains were really felt. The TAs seemed to have no idea what was going on, the first two exams were ridiculous in the level of content you had to know (I think the averages were like a C). Therefore the final had to be pretty easy, and it was (just a million essay questions). If next year's reviews improve, then I guess this is okay, but overall this class was a huge pain to get through. (All this being said I'd like to also acknowledge that Craig seems like an absolutely genuine and amazing person, he is extremely passionate and I think that this is a huge plus!)",
    "A fairly straightforward science credit for a non-science major. Professor Brodersen is very passionate and makes each lecture as interesting as he can. That said, a bit more work than I expected in the beginning.",
    "Great course about trees, cell biology, climate change, uses of wood, and plants in general. Definitely take it if the content sounds at all interesting to you, because you will appreciate that you learned a lot. It is heavy on homeworks and quizzes- not exactly an easy course.",
    "The first half of the course is mostly biology which can get tricky and sometimes boring, but the second half is really fascinating. Prof Brodersen is great and helpful, so definitely go to office hours if you're struggling. The workload is very manageable and spread out so you're not stressed.",
    "EVST 191 is an easy, interesting introduction to trees, botany, environmental studies, etc. You won't spend too much time on any one subject (e.g. the tree's anatomy, climate change, etc) but Craig will impart an essential conceptual framework to students. You'll go on some field trips, but the class won't take up that much time. Homework is easy, tests are pretty easy, quizzes are easy.",
    "Not a good course. A lot of technical memorization of biological concepts required and not much else.",
    "The class is a bit harder than expected but a lot more interesting than expected. I had a good semester",
    "Good course. Gives a very solid overview of how a tree functions internally and how it effects the environment in general. Craig is a very good lecturer",
    "Definitely take it! Manageable course, interesting material, great professor",
    "good",
    "It is helpful if you need a science credit, but it can be boring and difficult.",
    "It's a good class for anyone interested in the environment but who doesn't want to take a difficult higher level course. It's especially good for non-science majors but also for those in environmental studies.",
    "You definitely have to work hard and go to lecture. The homework can be challenging and time consuming but it is VERY interesting.",
    "This class is MUCH harder than you think it will be. The first half is super detail oriented and tedious. The second half is a lot more interesting with topics like wood for sound, climate change, etc. The class is really hard so you must go to class and do the readings. Professor Brodersen is really helpful and approachable, so go to him if you are falling behind!! I would recommend this class if you are willing to put in the work, because in the end what you learn is really interesting and it is a subject that not a lot of people know about. The workload itself is very small, but the actual material and learning is hard and a lot.",
    "IT'S A TRAP!!!! RUN WHILE YOU CAN.",
    "Decent course if you're interested in tree biology",
    "take it - fun - not a gut",
    "Interesting course but definitely makes you put work in.",
    "A very easy science course, go for it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. do not take this class if you are looking for a gut science. do not take this class if you are looking for an interesting class. do not take this class if you want to be rewarded for your hard work. As a senior, I can definitively say this was the worst class I've ever taken at Yale. I took it for a distributional requirement, otherwise I would have dropped it. I should have dropped it during shopping period, but I kept thinking \"this can't actually be this bad.\" This class ruined my semester and I can't think of one useful thing I learned from it. In fact, this class deeply turned me off to the environmental studies program as a whole, so great job with that, Trees folks. In summary, the class is disorganized, boring, difficult, and the people who run it are rude and bad at their jobs. I basically had to teach myself all the material.",
    "If you're really interested in environmental biology, yes. If you're looking for an easy science credit, it's not worth the time and disorganization.",
    "A lot of memorization. Annoying homework assignments. Enjoyable lectures \/ content. You will learn a lot!",
    "It's interesting but be prepared to walk all over campus looking for the biggest tree for a homework assignment",
    "This class was a good intro to plant physiology and environmental biology. It covered much more than just the biology and brought into question the global significance of plants and why we need to protect the beautiful nature we have around us. I would highly recommend this class to other students because the field trips and the HW assignments were fun and interesting and I learned about things I probably will not learn about in any other classes. This class is perfect for someone who cares about the environment and the ways humans and trees have influenced each other throughout history.",
    "A good class, and an interesting class. Take it if you truly want to learn about how trees work and function in a global context - from the scientific workings of trees to how they are logged and even used in the makings of musical instruments. The class is not super quantitative or technical, but a simple background in biology would be useful. That being said, if you are looking for an easy science credit or even an easy credit in general, there are better ones out there than this.",
    "Trees, like woah dude, trees.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student at Yale. I feel like I have a great understanding of the course material that I will retain and share with others.",
    "A very accessible introductory science course for non-science majors. Might even be possible for people who have never taken biology before. I don't know if I'm the only one who found the exams more challenging than expected (especially compared to other intro classes), but that's more of an asset to the class than anything. It's still easy to prepare for the exams as long as you put some effort into studying. The homework assignments can be strange and require you to physically go to places (art gallery, musical instruments museum, measuring trees), but at least it makes it interesting.",
    "Yeah, it's a good class if you like trees. I felt like a lot of people were only in the class for an easy science credit, and it wasn't that, so people seemed resentful, but I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "This a great science class for people who aren't typically \"science-y\" because if you study and pay attention, the material is manageable and applicable\/tangible. The workload is light but you definitely need to study for the tests and pay attention in class.",
    "A science for non-science majors (or interested science majors) that is fun and doable. Interesting hands-on assignments, great lectures, reasonable midterms, and an easy final.",
    "The graded assignments can be frustrating because they don't always relate directly to material covered during class. Overall, it was an interesting course.",
    "Took this because I am interested in trees and needed a science credit. Wasn't disappointed. Tests are manageable. Content was interesting. Professor was nice. Basically, if you have any interest in how plants work, and can pay attention in class, then you don't have to do much work and you'll still enjoy it.",
    "This class was absolutely phenomenal. I learned so much more than I could have imagined when signing up. Professor Brodersen was one of the best professors I've had during my time at Yale. He presented potentially difficult material in a fashion that was understandable for someone with a minimal background in biology. The midterms and the final do require a good deal of preparation if you want to get a good grade. The field trips were really cool, too. I'd recommend this class to someone looking to fulfill a distributional requirement. The material is practical, interesting, and manageable.",
    "I took it because I'm not a science person and I needed a gut. There was more work than you'd expect in a regular gut class but it was very interesting, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",
    "This class is pretty technical and biology based. The workload isn't hard but you actually have to learn stuff to pass. If you like trees a lot you'll probably like this class, because there's a lot of talk about trees."
