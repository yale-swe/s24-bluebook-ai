   "comments": [
    "G&G 274 is a comprehensive, easy-to-understand, yet challenging course taught a leader in the energy industry, Professor Oristaglio. I thoroughly enjoyed his class. For the first time at Yale, I was taught how things are done in the ACTUAL industry, from exploring for oil, to drilling for oil, to unconventionals and renewables. Great, great class. If you are interested in the energy sector, take this course.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It is a broad overview of fossil fuel creation and extraction. There isn't much of a focus on transitioning away from them to other sources of energy. The work load is extremely manageable, only 4 problem sets, midterm and final paper. I wish more of my classes were like this one.",
    "GREAT class. Take it! You learn a lot about fossil fuels and the teachers are really nice and relaxed. There are 3 problem sets (you have 2 weeks to work on each of them), one midterm (super manageable and straight forward questions), a group presentation and a term essay on any topic of choice.",
    "Good intro to scientific study of energy issues. It was on the superficial side but still interesting. I learned a fair amount and the workload was pretty low (3 p-sets, midterm, presentation, final paper).",
    "Yes! It's a non-threatening introduction to the science behind the product that supports our entire existence. Very helpful to understanding modern policy problems.",
    "Interesting and easy; good for non-science majors who want to learn about fossil fuels - production, uses, geographical distribution, trends, etc. Fantastic field trip to PA (an anthracite surface mine and a hydrofracking operation) during October break. The problem sets are few and relatively easy; the tests require that you know the concepts pretty well. Not much reading. That said, don't underestimate the difficulty of getting up to KGL at 9:25 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays...",
    "GG 274 is a useful and fairly relaxed class, good for both majors and non-majors. I would recommend it to anyone interested in fossil fuels, one of the most important resources in the world. I liked the subject enough that I might look into possible employment opportunities in the field. Professor Oristaglio is a good lecturer and very approachable.",
    "Yes. Definitely take the class if you want an industry perspective on fossil fuels and transition fuels.",
    "I would highly recommend G&G 274 to nearly any student, as it was among the best lecture courses I have taken at Yale. The course covers nearly all aspects of fossil fuels including the geology of petroleum, exploration methods, extraction techniques, environmental costs, as well as aspects of the history of the oil and gas industry. The professors taught G&G 274 at the perfect level, not so difficult as to put non-science majors at a real disadvantage, but still difficult enough so that the material felt substantial and highly relevant. The syllabus and problem sets are also very well designed.The professors, who both have ties to the fossil fuel industry, do a good job presenting a nuanced and balanced view of some controversial topics.",
    "Highly recommend this G&G274. It is well taught, organized, and it's not too much work. The final paper is worth 40% of your grade and you get to choose your own topic, which makes the paper enjoyable to write.",
    "definitely take it. the hike up science hill in the morning may seem daunting, but it's worth it.",
    "Fossil fuels is a pretty sweet class. It is very likely that you have never seen the information before and it is a great way to understand energy from a geo\/oil industry pov. Oristaglio is a solid lecturer and very nice. Grading is fairly easy and everything is very casual. The field trip was really cool, easily the best part of the class. Seeing and hearing about the fossil fuels industry from the industry itself was a unique and educational opportunity. Not the most enthralling class, but has some high points."
