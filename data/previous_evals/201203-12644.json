    "If you're econ math, you have to take it. I don't really see why anyone else would. However, unlike the other econ math prereqs out there, this course is not bad at all.",
    "Overall, Math 480 is a good capstone to the mathematics half of the economics and mathematics major. I particularly like the way this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s themes tied together advanced math topics with economic theory. The first half of the course struck a good balance between the mathematics behind and applications of the implicit function theorem. The second half of the course consisted of an interesting way of looking at computational complexities of general equilibrium theory and tied together economic theory and theoretical mathematics. I would recommend this course because an economics and mathematics major cannot graduate without it. While one could take the section of the course intended for pure mathematics major, this section gives you the unique opportunity to learn from one of Yale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best economic theorists and a rising mathematics star in a small group environment with like-minded peers with similar interests. Additionally, this section is specifically designed to allow economics and mathematics majors to combine what they have learned from both halves of the major to better appreciate the interaction between mathematics and economics. Although this class seems scary and intimidating at first, preparing lectures is actually a great learning experience, especially since Professor Brown helps you develop coherent lecture outlines and is willing to discuss the subject matter during office hours with considerable patience.",
