   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course. Xu Laoshi treats her students like they are her children. By the end of the course, she was like a mom to me. She has a really good sense of humor. She'll be strict on you but in a good way. There will be days when you don't feel like learning Chinese anymore just because of how intense this course is, but stick with it. It's really rewarding in the end.",
    "Continuation of 152, not much else to it. There was a lot of homework at certain times of the semester though, which makes it hard to balance with other classes.",
    "Chinese vocabulary in political contexts, focusing on topics relevant to early 21st century China. The course concentrates on improving speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills.",
    "It's absolutely amazing, please take it. I didn't take the first semester of Chinese but it wasn't a problem at all. You'll catch up quickly. Also, Xu laoshi is the absolute best and is basically a mom to all of us. Plus she brought us muffins on the day of the final to fight off exam exhaustion, hunger, and to de-stress in general. She's great. This was an amazing class.",
    "Tons of work, rewarding if you put in tons of work, terrible if you don't",
    "SUCH A MEMORABLE CLASS AND YOU SHOULD TAKE IT.",
    "Really thorough continuation of CHNS 152 that really builds on the information already present. A lot of work and has no shortcuts. The class format is identical to 152, so most students should feel right at home. Professor Xu is absolutely wonderful, and she will always be there in rough times. Don't be afraid to talk to her outside of class!",
    "Although it is Level 5, for heritage speakers, this class is not really a great challenge in terms of workload and required knowledge. It is taught quite to the book, but with grammar patterns that our teacher teaches related to each lesson. Note that the workload does get a little heavy only when studying for tests, which can take a long time since you have to memorize lots of vocabulary and grammar patterns. But besides that, this class is very doable and I really enjoyed it as a freshman year class because it was a constant, reliable class among varying workloads of other classes. Also, it was just fun getting to learn with other Chinese Americans and we really grew closer this past semester. I loved it!",
    "Exactly what you would expect in the continuation of 152. Same teacher, same book, slightly higher expectations. Definitely take it if you want to really learn Chinese; you will get so much out of the class."
