   "comments": [
    "Would recommend only to those serious about math. Would recommend taking the application-based linear algebra course to those more interested in physical sciences\/applied math.",
    "This course strikes a good balance between theory and application; as someone who is not interested in pursuing a math major, I was leery of taking this more theoretical course over MATH 222, but am glad I did so. Professor Vu's lectures are helpful and pretty easy to follow, and the problem sets felt more worthwhile than simple plug-and-chug assignments.",
    "Lectures were easy to follow but very different from the homework assigned. Teacher definitely knows what he's talking about, though some of the proofs are very involved. Take it if you have a decent background in mathematics and proof-writing already.",
    "This was a challenging course, and only moderately satisfying. It provided a good picture of the applications of linear algebra and the relationships between all the different topics covered. Linear algebra is really beautiful and clean cut in some ways, and quite complex in others. The proofs are generally easy to follow, but coming up with them on your own can be difficult. I would have liked a little more guidance throughout the course. I felt like when it came down to the tests, I did not really know what to expect. The problems sets in the book can be puzzling and unclear, and they often are not representative of the material covered in class or on the tests. I did not find the TA helpful. His explanations were long-winded and often failed to clarify things. There is a lot of pressure because the midterm and final are the only two tests and make up the vast majority of your grade. The workload is not bad, one problem set a week, which takes anywhere from 2-5 hours. However, if you wish to do well in the course, plan to devote additional time to reading the chapters in the textbook and doing extra practice problems. Without this, there is just not enough practice to solidify your knowledge and be able to recall important things much later in the course for the tests.",
    "Take 225 if you have a good reason to do so (instead of 222) because it is harder to get as good a grade and you will spend much more time on the psets and final (which is really hard). That being said, it's a very interesting course--often the first proof based mathematics course for many. I recommend it but be prepared to work. And be prepared to do more than is on the syllabus if with Van Vu--that's the way he teaches I would say.",
    "Definitely one of my favorite classes so far. But definitely hard.",
    "I would not recommend it if it is taught the same way it was this semester - same textbook, teaching style, etc.",
    "Yes, it was good.",
    "Don't take this class. The idea is that you will learn proof based linear algebra, instead of only application based in 222. However, you will learn neither proof nor application based. You will have to teach yourself if you take this class, so if for some reason you choose to do so (although I strongly discourage it) my advice is this: don't go to lecture and watch the MIT videos instead.",
    "A decent intro to linear algebra, but due to weaknesses in teaching, it's tough to recommend this course. It is required for most following math classes, so i can't say don't take it.",
    "Learn basics of matrices, vector spaces, and how determinanants and eigenvalues allow you to solve problems.",
    "Most people taking Math225 are only fulfilling a requirement, so I guess most people reading this will be deciding between 225 and 222. 225 is difficult and not very well-taught, but I think i would still recommend it. From what I've heard, 222 is basically just memorizing formulas and then doing arithmetic, whereas in 225 you actually begin doing math and proofs for the first time. Unlike math120 where homework was to learn a method and then apply it, homework for 225 requires that you thoroughly understand the subject in order to be able to answer conceptual questions and do proofs. In the end, a challenging course, but I learned a lot. A good course.",
    "A rigorous overview of linear algebra. Very proof oriented (though you need not write many of your own proofs), which can be confusing, but sometimes illuminating. Prof Vu tends not to explain the big picture of anything so it'll be up to you to link the whole course together. This can be really frustrating and I never felt like I understood the class until the night before the final exam. He tends to write pretty quickly during lecture and doesn't stop much to give a more general explanation of anything, so you may find that you need to do a fair amount of extra work outside of class to 'get it.' Definitely take advantage of the TA sessions as they can be enormously helpful. He can be condescending when asked questions during lecture. Overall not horrible, but it could be much improved.",
    "Take the class. The math is very interesting and not incredibly hard. Professor Vu also emphasizes the applications, besides showing us the proofs, so you get the best of both worlds.",
    "(Disclaimer: I took this class to challenge myself. Didn't need another QR, haven't taken math in two years and wanted to test my foot in the waters again.) Professor Vu, though brilliant, lacks in the ability to communicate the material to those not as experienced in mathematics. I had to learn the material through other sources, i.e. MIT OCW. The students who already understood linear algebra breezed through and didn't go to class. The rest of us struggled. Sort of regret taking this class.",
    "If Van Vu is teaching with the Strang textbook again, you're much better off in Math 222, where you will learn the same material and probably learn more in class. But now that I think of it, Van Vu was not very effective at teaching even the easiest material in Strang, so I couldn't possibly imagine him teaching from a harder textbook, as usually happens (and is supposed to happen) in Math 225. Note also that 90% of Strang textbook is basically unreadable. If you are taking Math 225 with Van Vu and the Strang textbook (have fun!) you're probably best off skipping class and watching the Strang lectures on MIT OCW."
