   "comments": [
    "This was by far my favorite class of the semester. Professor Ehrgood is incredible. By the third week I could already sense that my writing was improving tangibly. Among the many things I learned from this course were: writing for the ear, communicating nuanced\/complex ideas, reexamining an ordinary phenomenon through a new lens. We read many interesting pieces, but what really made the course worthwhile was Professor Ehrgood. He devotes so much time to reading your essays and giving you the most helpful feedback. He has the uncanny ability to help you clarify your thinking, allowing you to reach a better idea or a better way of expressing that idea. If you're taking Eng 120, try to get into his section.",
    "I loved my class. Definitely take it!",
    "You have to write 5 different essays, for which you submit a draft and a final revision. After you submit your first draft, you meet with the professor to talk about it, and usually have to do significant changes for the revision. You feel as though you are constantly writing, which is great, because topics are pretty broad and you get to write about whatever the hell you feel like. I would recommend this class because I think that you end up writing essays that you need to write for yourself. This class made me grow as a writer, thinker, and communicator. Definitely take it.",
    "I would highly recommend the course, it is a very fun class even for non-English\/ writing people. I am a science major and still highly enjoyed it. I also found it very useful and helpful in terms of improving my writing.",
    "Amazing course. It will change the way you think about writing. Ehrgood is an incredible teacher--probably the best I've ever had. You have to be willing to put in the work, but the results are well worth it.",
    "YES. Take it! You will learn to appreciate other author's writing styles and improve your own dramatically. I wrote a lipogram- an essay with no 'e'! Trust me, if I could do it, anyone can.",
    "Absolutely! Take this class! My understanding is that English 120 in general will improve your writing and that all the sections are great, but Professor Ehrgood is particulary stupendous. Class discussions are fun and intersting, and you will actually enjoy doing the assigned reading and writing the essays since the prompts are so interesting, there's even one where you can't use the letter \"e\" (which in retrospect was fun, but during was a little frustrating). Take this class!!",
    "I loved this class, TAKE IT! ENGL 120 is an awesome intro english class that really, really develops your writing skills. You will learn a ton in this class, and read a lot. But, most of the pieces that Ehrgood assigns are easy reads and often very funny. I truly enjoyed this class, my favorite of Yale thus far.",
    "I would describe English 120 as a course that looks at several forms of nonfiction essay writing. First you read published essays, and then you use those essays as models for your own.I would recommend this to another student interested in writing, but tell them to prepare for a demanding course that makes you think in new ways about essays.",
    "It's what one might expect a typical college English course might be like. Write 5 or 6 essays and the professor determines your grade based on how well you write. If you want to explore different ways of writing and want to write with more freedom, then take this class.",
    "Yes! Ehrgood is a wonderful professor. After taking this course it'll be difficult not to think about every word and sound I write.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. I've found such joy in writing now. It will help in all areas. Seriously. This class has improved my writing skills for other classes - even lab reports. I can't recommend this enough. It is definitely the most useful and extraordinary course I've taken at Yale so far (and this is my third semester)."
