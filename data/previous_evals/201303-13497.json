   "comments": [
    "Would not recommend unless you have a LOT of time to read. The novels are all long, and Moby Dick is just difficult to read. The poems are incredibly abstruse.",
    "Great survey course of American literature. Workload is very manageable, two papers and a short response paper every other week. Readings are really interesting, although Berger's section focuses much more on American poetry than other sections, so if you're not so into poetry steer clear. That said, Prof Berger is the most wonderful, warm professor and really cares about both the material and his students, and the class is great just for him.",
    "Solid writing credit - Berger is good and funny, work isn't too much, and the material is interesting.",
    "This section has a huge focus on modern poetry: you only read two novels over the semester. Most of the reading IS tough: Moby Dick takes probably twice as long as an average book to read, and the poetry has to be read several times to be understood. The reading takes a lot of time. There are five shorter essays (3-4 pages), two longer essays (6-7 pages), and a final exam (8-10 pages).Professor Berger leads the seminar in a less regulated manner. He provides some structure, but lets the students choose new directions and go on tangents. This is great if you have a good class. Sometimes it created lulls in the discussion, but ultimately it was a much more natural and enlightening way to discuss books. He does not provide much feedback on papers: he only wrote extensive comments on one paper.",
    "Great literature course. Keep in mind that Berger's section focuses more on poetry and requires more writing than other sections. For example his section had a take home final and a final essay while other sections only had a final essay. However you will become a better writer and reader because of it.",
    "Definitely take it! Professor Berger is very passionate about what he teaches and really cares about the students' learning. Don't let the large number of people shopping this class dissuade you. The class size will diminish, you'll earn a spot, and you won't regret it.",
    "Yes! You read fantastic books (Moby Dick and Invisible Man) and some good poetry. Professor Berger is also the perfect seminar professor. The class atmosphere with him is great."
