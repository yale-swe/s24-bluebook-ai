   "comments": [
    "Perfect senior seminar. Frequent mini-essays in preparation for class with a 20-page paper broken into 2 installments. The reading does not seem long, but since it's Spenser it takes time and concentration to do the close reading that is required. Brisman is a marvelous close reader who can easily zoom out to see the larger moral issue at stake. I think it's probably important to have some knowledge of Spenser and his source materials (Ovid, Chaucer, Ariosto) coming in.",
    "If you like Brisman, take this class! He likes his class to be a certain way, and if you follow his lead you will be challenged and learn so much. The Faerie Queene is not easy to read, but if you have the time to dedicate yourself to the class, it will be rewarding.",
    "Challenging, but totally unique.",
    "This is a wonderful class. Take it if you get the opportunity. Leslie Brisman is one of the best instructors at Yale.",
    "It's about Spenser, focus on the Faerie Queene. If you need to read Spenser, this is a heavy-duty Spenser course, but it's a lot of work and I didn't get the impression that that many people in the section loved it very much. I don't know about what you'relooking for but I wouldn't recommend it to most people.",
    "You should only take this course if you enjoy Spenser immensely. Otherwise, it will probably be a painful experience."
