   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The syllabus and Professor Sussman were both brilliant. The reading is manageable and each text is interconnected so subtly and beautifully that by the end of the semester, the class felt like a \"constellation\" (to use the Mallarmean term often borrowed by Sussman) that had just begun to become intelligible. It is such a far-reaching course that it seems to encompass all other disciplines--from art, to architecture, science, psychology. A must-take for the intellectually curious reader.",
    "A wonderful and enthusiastic professor teaching a great syllabus.",
    "I highly recommend this course to any interested students. Do not be concerned if you are not a literature major or if you have no exposure to German. All course texts can be read in German or English at your leisure, and neither language is preferred in choosing topics for papers. This class was a true intellectual pleasure, integrating modernist literature with music, film, art, philosophy, psychoanalysis, science, and theater in Germany in way that will interest students of all disciplines. Professor Sussman teaches with such joy and skill, periodically engaging in brilliant monologues that will leave you happily scrambling to copy every word."
