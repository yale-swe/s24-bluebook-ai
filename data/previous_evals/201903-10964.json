   "comments": [
    "You will learn to sit with a character, to see that person evolve as the story shifts in your head, as you become better acquainted with the people you are trying to portray. You will write two 8-17 page stories with multiple opportunities for revision and will gain a lot of experience workshopping the stories of your peers. You will become a better writer because of them and learn to grow comfortable copying the moves of writers you love.",
    "We talked extensively about character, which really shaped all of our writing. I got a much better grasp on what really makes a story strong.",
    "The class helped how I approach fiction writing and the quality of my writing so much.",
    "This course was very helpful in developing my writing and editing skills in fiction.",
    "I learned about editing and redrafting in this workshop. I learned how important it is to have feedback to be able to fully see your characters and what they're trying to say.",
    "Knowledge\/skills: fiction writing practice in rigorous workshop setting. Insights into fiction writing techniques.",
    "Unlike other creative writing professors that I've had, Caz gave our class the vocabulary and built a framework with which we could think about short stories that was extremely helpful. Rather than fixating on plot (which he quickly debunked as a creative writing fallacy), his focus on character development above all else not only helped me improve my writing, but also helped me give more effective feedback to my peers.",
    "Development of characters, learning techniques and methods from established writers or pieces of fiction that appeal to me, and general tips and tricks for writing and publishing",
    "How to write better fiction storieswith clarity, fully developed characters, etc; how to comment on others stories",
    "I am glad that we focused on two stories only this semester, as I was able to really concentrate and think on them, and didn't produce any writing that felt forced (which can happen in classes with daily or weekly assignments). Also, any workshop class is great for thinking differently about how to approach writing."

   "comments": [
    "This course is a great way to learn about characterization and to identify both the strengths and weaknesses of writers your age. It will help you know if you want to a writer someday or perhaps and editor or perhaps neither. What little reading of outside essays and short stories we did was engaging and helpful. I know it's hard to fit in reading outside of workshops, but I think it is worth doing so.",
    "I really liked the two story set up. I thought it was a manageable workload. I enjoyed the readings Prof. Phillips would give us at the end of seminars.",
    "I loved how this course was structured. I liked the number of stories we wrote and the edits we got to do. I would have liked to get a second round of comments on the story I edited a third time, but it was also helpful to edit something myself without comments.",
    "There was a very strong focus in this workshop on character, which I liked. This was an outstanding workshop and the best one I've taken at Yale, but if time permits in the future, it would be exciting to look at more pieces of published short fiction.",
    "Strengths: excellent professor and format, strong peer group. Everyone engaged very seriously with one anothers' work, and Caz was always available to provide thoughtful guidance. No notable weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: Caz's focus on character development formed the foundation for all of our discussions and really helped us develop a way to know how to ask the most helpful questions when working on our own writing and when giving feedback on other people's writing. Weaknesses: none",
    "The feedback from the professor and students was incredibly helpful and the classes were designed to be able to help students improve their specific pieces as well as writing skills in general",
    "Strengths: always fun and definitely improves writing. Low time commitment with only two short stories to write (plus providing feedback for others). Weaknesses: sometimes workshops will be based on subjective factors\/preferences and thats sometimes hard to avoid",
    "I think the only thing I would have liked was more reading and discussion of (non-student) stories. Also, since I didn't have my first workshop until October, I did very little writing for the first three weeks of the course. I think I would have liked it if we had a draft due before workshops, or at least one smaller assignment, since I find deadlines very helpful. I thought our class workshops were very good, and there was a good mix of writers. I also liked that the class was fairly relaxed and not competitive. Some workshops (and professors) really encourage a tenser atmosphere, and this one did not."

    "This is a great course to take if you are interested in writing short stories. It's an amazing feeling to be around students who have great imaginations and who care about tapping into them. You should think carefully about whether you want to write novels or science fiction or fantasy, as there is not a lot of room for this kind of writing in the course. Be prepared to become intimate with your imagination. If you're someone who has a lot of trouble coming up with things to write about, this course will be difficult. I should also note that while you only write two stories in this class, it is the kind of course that takes up a lot of your mental time. Your stories sit with you as you walk to class and go to work and do p-sets. You can't escape them because you've created them. Be prepared to think deeply about what and why you write. I felt the class was a really supportive community of people who cared enough about you to critique your work.",
    "I'd recommend this to anyone interested in writing, reading, workshopping, and thinking about stories. You write 2 stories over the course of the semester, and revise both; aside from that, the only work is to read and comment on two-three stories before every workshop. The actual workload was pretty low compared to my other classes, but I also spent so much time thinking about the class and learned so much from it; it's the best of both worlds",
    "Yes! Prof. Phillips will help you with your writing so much!",
    "Yes! The fiction seminars at Yale are the best classes I've taken. Caz is great and you learn so much from him and from the other students in your workshop.",
    "Certainly. It is a lot of work because you'll have to do many drafts of your pieces, think about your characters, and really commit to your stories, but the workshop will make you a stronger writer for sure. You will also possibly make friendships with the other people in your workshop, and that's always a good thing.",
    "100%. I wouldn't miss it.",
    "Absolutely! If you get in, don't miss out on the chance to work with a professor who's genuinely invested in your improvement in a writer and who's honestly SUCH a good instructor.",
    "Absolutely! Just bear in mind that a course like this will take a lot of time and effort and you should plan for that accordingly.",
    "Yes! Its a great experience whether or not you want to pursue fiction writing",
    "If you have stories you want to write, definitely. Caz definitely focuses and encourages focus on certain kinds of stories, realistic fiction with deep interpersonal relationships (particularly familial) and lots of thought about how the past affects the present. I liked this a lot, but if you don't want to write in that genre, this class might not be for you. I think it also definitely depends on who else is in your workshop. This class also requires a lot of self-discipline, since there aren't many deadlines or assignments. You have to spend a long time with your stories, and though Caz will read any stage of a draft, he doesn't require it. To get the most out of this class, you should meet with him. But for various reasons I never really did, and I still felt like my writing improved from his feedback and the workshop."
