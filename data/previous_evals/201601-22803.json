    "A critical investigation of Ligeti's life and works-- highly recommend.",
    "This course was a very solid overview of Ligeti's music, but it also provided opportunities to deal with a lot of broader issues in theory and analysis, so I would recommend it for anyone interested in those kind of methodological issues, too.",
    "I think that the biggest strength and weakness of this class in the larger music curriculum is its devotion to Ligeti and Ligeti alone. Although we were primed to avoid the pitfalls of 'Ligeti exceptionalism,' as I walk away from the class I find it hard to be able to relate the topics of conversation to other composers or music scholarship in general. With that in mind, I would highly recommend this course to any student, theorist or historian, interested in later 20th century music, for the depth of thought that is applied to one of the later 20th century's biggest composers."

   "comments": [
    "This course was helpful both for its musical content, which familiarized me with less familiar repertories, and for the methodological ideas I came out of it with. I don't know exactly how it might affect my future research but some aspects of it could become very important."
