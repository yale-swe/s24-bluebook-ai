   "comments": [
    "Learn how to code in Java by spending far too long on problem sets.",
    "Take it if you have the time and interest!",
    "Take this class! But I wouldn't recommend it if you're not willing to put in a lot of work into it. Every freshman should take this class!",
    "a LOT of your time will be spent on problem sets if you take this class. A lot of the people that said it was \"easier\" already have a ton of experience with programming. Make sure you will be able to put in the work!",
    "CS112 was soooo much fun. Definitely recommend it to everyone; In this day an age you need to know programming. Final project vs final exam was kinda weird though. Puzzle day was the best!",
    "Really not that hard. 92.5 guarantees you an A, and 2\/3rds of your grade comes from problem sets (not to mention the fact that the first few are super easy). The class itself is pretty meh; Yang Yang is overrated as a lecturer, but he's very generous with extra credit and references to Google. If you're willing to go to office hours or have friends to work with (read: copy off of), this class is a really easy A.",
    "Fun and fantastic. Definitely worth it if you've never taken computer science before and want to learn more.",
    "Really great course. While class time isn't always that productive, the problem sets were interesting and engaging to the point where I enjoyed spending much more time weekly on this class than any other class. It can definitely be a lot of work but completely worth it.",
    "If you are like me and are coming into this class with no background in programing, be prepared for a challenge. That being said, if you survive the semester, you are rewarded with a feeling of accomplishment, a greater sense of what you are capable of achieving, and a greater understanding of how your computer functions. Be sure to go to office hours if you are stumped with a problem set; it will save you a lot of grief.",
    "Only take this class if you are willing to put in the time to learn the programming concepts and do the problem sets. You really learn through doing the actual programming rather than sitting in lecture.",
    "Take it if Yang is teaching it.",
    "Take it whether or not you're a CS major! It's a great intro to CS.",
    "An introduction to programming in Java, beginning with basic syntax and algorithmic thinking. The problem sets allow you to use concepts learned in class to make interesting applications, like a Sudoku Solver. The office hours were too crowded to get much individual attention, but there are resources to go to if you encounter a bug.",
    "Yes please take this class. I took it CR\/D, but as long as you put in the work (which you will anyway), you can get a decent mark at the end.",
    "Tough course you will feel proud about completing. Even if you credit\/d this course the workload isnt any less, you just feel less stressed about it.",
    "Would recommend the following: take a look at the homeworks from past years. If you feel like you can handle them, go ahead and take the class. The vast majority of them take over five hours to do if you are a good coder, so if you are not into teaching yourself how to solve hard problems for hours, don't take this.",
    "CPSC 112 is an introductory programming course. You mainly learn Java, but at the end it covered web programming and JavaScript. This is an excellent course, and I think that it teaches skills that everyone should learn. The class is a lot of work; the problem sets, though not weekly, are increasingly challenging. I probably spent an average of 8 hours on them, but I know some people took much longer. The best thing about this course is the amount of help available. There are a ton of TFs and undergraduate tutors that hold office hours basically 24\/7; going to office hours made the problem sets take a lot less time. There is so much help available that there is no reason not to get the maximum points on every problem set. There was one exam that was more challenging than expected, but still not difficult. Yang Yang is the best programming instructor you could possibly have. He genuinely cares about his students, and has great lessons that teach material relevant to the problem sets. I would highly recommend this class to any student, as it is well-taught, and you come out of it with useful, applicable skills.",
    "Yes, with computers becoming increasingly mainstream I highly recommend this course to anyone and everyone. Also be aware the computer science is not just learning about computers really. At the core of taking a course like this, how to program, we are learning how to problem solve. Computer science = problem solving. And solving problems and getting good at that is an excellent skill to have regardless of your field.",
    "Very useful for learning up the Java language, the workload may make the class look a little bleak at times but you definitely learn a lot by the end of it.",
    "Yes, definitely. This was a very fun class. Yang Yang is the man. The psets don't take too much time if you are quantitatively minded. I would start early just in case there are annoying bugs, though. The final project was fun-we built a game.",
    "Might be better to take 130 if you want a science application, or just to learn web design or app design on your own if you are interested in that. class is very time consuming and not applicable.",
    "CPSC is a lot of work but fun at times and very rewarding. The problem sets are cool once you finish them and the TAs are very helpful and are available almost any time you need them. I definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in getting a taste of programming.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale (and I'm an econ major). At times the amount of work might seem a little daunting, but the experience overall has been extremely rewarding.",
    "This is a BRUTAL class. If you don't have a background in computer science, you should definitely credit\/D this. The problem sets take 12-25 hours. Easily the most work-intensive class I've had at Yale. You move super quickly through concepts, with little time to actually practice them before you have to use them to solve abstract problems on the problem sets. While the TFs and tutors are helpful, office hours are completely packed, and the TFs were overwhelmed by the sheer number of students. If you want to take this, be prepared to work your ass to do the problem sets, and be aware that you won't be able to focus as much on your other classes this semester.",
    "This class is amazing. As a senior, I'm so glad that I got to take it before I graduated. I learned so much and I have been motivated to continue learning programming after I graduated. One warning, it is a HUGE amount of work, sometimes more than others. But it is doable and the TAs are super helpful, you just have to put in the time.",
    "Great class if taught by Yang Yang. I learned a lot with the Psets, and came out with a huge jump in understanding of both programming and web design.",
    "I think knowing how to program is a really important skill. The class moves quickly and it's easy to stop paying attention or going to lecture, but that's not a good idea. I had a fair amount of background going in, which made this class pretty easy so I guess I am not the best person to take advice from.",
    "I really liked this class! I had some programming experience in the past, but learned completely different things in this course and was not bored. The problem sets were extremely interesting and they were difficult but doable. Yang Yang is also awesome! This class forces you to learn good programming skills (as opposed to just doing nothing and getting a good grade) which is very important.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to any student who has an interest in compsci.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Take this class with Yang and no one else. The problem sets are fun and you will learn so much over the course of a semester. The PSETs are pretty time consuming but the TFs are very helpful during office hours. I can't recommend this class enough. It's perfect for people needing a QR credit or for those who are considering a major in computer science.",
    "CPSC is a lot of hard work that takes a long time, but the end result can be very satisfying. I would only recommend this to kids who like logic and are willing to put in the hours.",
    "I would absolutely recommend CPSC 112; it's a challenging course, with a fair amount of work, but there are so many resources in place to make sure that you will do well that even someone who isn't naturally strong in the subject matter can thrive.",
    "As someone who has never been inclined to take a CompSci class in my life, I thoroughly enjoyed this class and - to my surprise - am interested in taking more classes in this area. Most of the work you'll do on your own or during office hours, as you don't learn much in class. Don't be too concerned about your grade, since there are about a million chances to get bonus points and do make up assignments. Even though the midterm is hard, it's pretty easy to get an A overall. Also, the psets involve making hangman, sudoku, etc. so it's pretty cool\/relevant to learn.",
    "There's a super huge learning curve. I didn't really understand a lot of what I was doing. However, if you put in the time\/effort, you could probably get a lot more out of it. The problem sets took FOREVER. I'm glad I understand how Java works, but I'm also glad to be done.",
    "good overview, doesn't give you much actual coding ability but is a great experience and introduction",
    "Take this class if you actually have the desire to learn java. Otherwise, you will question why you are spending so much time typing up code. It is not a hard class to get a good grade, but if you're not actually in it to learn, it gets boring and tiring fast, since programming is time-consuming by nature.",
    "Yes. It helps you look at problems in a unique way. It forces you to deconstruct every problem so you really think about the different parts. Also there is always help available, which is vital. And the final project was fun. One thing: it is a DAMN shame that there was even talk of this course being capped. It's an intro lecture, ok CS department? No wonder Yale's computer science department is behind the eight ball, because the department clearly does not have the resources to even provide an intro course for everyone. The Harvard equivalent has 600 students. How are we supposed to take computer science - nay, LIBERAL ARTS even - seriously here if we have to shut people out of an INTRODUCTORY course? I'm not sure if this ended up affecting people, and it wouldn't have affected me, but so what. It's just embarrassing.",
    "Eh....grade-wise it's easy, but it's NOT fun if you've never had any programming experience before. I don't think I've learned so much other than superficial knowledge of some comp sci buzz words. Decision is up to you...I feel like I understand some new concepts but am not sure how proficient I am at actually applying them.",
    "TAKE THE COURSE!",
    "YES please take it. Yes, I've spent sometimes more than 15 hours on a pset but I have learned sososo much!",
    "A fairly fun class, and one that I believe will be useful to even people not planning to pursue a career in computer science. Lectures move fast, so its best to do the reading before hand. It is very possible to get an A, as anyone will tell you a course heavily based on P-Sets and of course, you can tell if your program is working or not. That said, after the first few P-Sets, difficulty ramps up quite a bit and you are required to put in a lot more time.",
    "Take this class with Yang Yang. I was not that interested in CS, but this was an amazing experience.",
    "A really great way to learn the basics of programming and get introduced to a lot of cool applications and concepts to further explore. You can get as much out of it as you put in, and the problem sets show you that with a little guidance you can already perform some really cool tasks. Prof. Yang is also hilarious and amazing.",
    "I have a lot of thoughts about this class. I'm a senior science major that took this class for fun. I learned a lot, it was fun, and Professor Yang was great! I was proud of my final project. I appreciate that the class caters to people who have little experience with quantitative thinking because I think it's an important skill for everyone to develop. HOWEVER, I think it tries TOO hard to make certain students feel welcome. Many students were extremely rude to TFs when they couldn't figure out how to do something (people were seriously yelling at the TA during the first week of class when they couldn't figure out how to install things on their computer). There were ridiculous complaints on Piazza about how the second midterm should be cancelled or that \"we're busy Yale students, we don't have time to turn in the problem set on time.\" Don't get me wrong, I like that we didn't have a second midterm, but the fact that someone complained about it and had their wish immediately granted is absurd. Also, we already get 9 late days to use at our discretion, don't whine about being busy. It was just frustrating to me that there were so many entitled students who were less than polite to the class organizers because of their own incompetence, and that oftentimes the class organizers catered to those people. If you have a good quantitative background, even if you have NO programming background, this class is REALLY easy. I wish there were an intro programming class that moved more quickly so people who sit around and blame other people\/the computer could take a different class. Higher level comp sci classes seem to be less relevant to people who just want some programming experience. Anyway, you still learn a lot even though the class is easy.",
    "Absolutely take this class!!! I'm not a computer science major, but I just wanted to learn about programming a little bit - it turned out to be my favorite class of the semester. The problem sets start out hard, but once you learn more and figure them out, you feel fantastic. The tournaments held throughout the year are a lot of fun, and the winners get cool prizes (like cash and an iPad), so it's definitely worth putting in the effort to understand the material and do well. The homework assignments are really fun, too. You don't just do programming exercises but you make animations (we had an angry bird bouncing off of walls and made a program that sounded like the plucking of a guitar string when you pressed keys). Very cool class.",
    "A fascinating QR that I'm happy I took, but a thoroughly frustrating experience at times. It should have MANY more TFs and support staff in upcoming years. This year was not enough.",
    "A great intro to computer science and programming! i would recommend it",
    "A course that everyone should take. Highly recommend it",
    "I would tentatively recommend CS 112. Learning programming is really cool and useful. You have the chance to win awesome prizes. But this class sucks up alllll of your time, when the work is at its hardest.",
    "The course is a lot of fun, but time-consuming. You don't need to worry too much about your grade as long as you take advantage of the multiple resources (TAs, late days, extra problem sets) designed to help you in that regard. BUT DOING SO IS TIME-CONSUMING! This class required more hours per week than my other three put together. You will feel proud of yourself when you get a program to work. The final project, which is done in groups, can be a lot of fun. My group designed an octagonal version of the Trap The Cat puzzle game.",
    "Extremely well-taught, well-run class. Definitely take this. Yang Yang and the team of TAs made an incredible effort to make sure everyone got the support they needed and that problem sets and exams were always manageable as long as you put in enough work. Psets are also not as hard as they're reputed to be\u2014I took 2-5 hours for each, and I don't have any programming experience. Just pay attention in class, read the textbook for the concepts you don't understand, play around on Eclipse, and you'll get it.",
    "This course was a great way to learn the basics of programming. I felt like I developed a basic background in the most important parts that will really help me become a better programer. I went into this class thinking it would be very difficult, but I was surprised by how it easy it was and how excited I was to do its work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are looking to see what computer science is. That was exactly what I was doing, and now I'm looking to take more classes in the department. The class is a lot of work, and lectures aren't super helpful, but if you put the time into the problem sets, you will learn a lot and be fine. Just be prepared for really long problem sets.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in programing. It is a lot of work, but manageable if you budget your time well. The teaching fellows\/peer tutors are super helpful and they have office hours all the time!",
    "It's a really exciting course, but definitely make sure you have room in your schedule to handle the weekly\/biweekly problem sets, which tend to take double-digit hours of work later on into the semester...but it'll all be so worth it in the end! Plus, Puzzle Day and the Bulldog Tournament at the end of the year were nice ways to get to know people better and to reflect\/acknowledge checkpoints throughout the course.",
    "YES. Take this class if you want to know basic programming. requires some work but if you're math-inclined then it will be fun and easy and you'll like i.t",
    "I WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE! 1) Computer literacy is so essential. Coming out of this class, I feel a little like I can control magic. 2) Professor Yang is wonderful. Go talk to him, because he listens to your concerns about pace, content, and structure of the class really well. (Also he's so nice!!) 3) The work is challenging and can take time, but TAs are always available to help you. You can control your grade in this class because you know exactly how well you've done every assignment.",
    "Introduction to programming using Java. Programming, like writing skills, is becoming an increasingly useful and valuable skill in many disciplines. This class is the perfect way to learn! The PSETS can be long and time consuming, but it is worth it! The help sessions are very helpful in this regard. My year, the final was changed to a final project. I used the Leap Motion sensor to make a motion controlled video game with a partner. In fact, I joined CPSC 112 with the goal of being able to understand sensor API's so I can use them in my own projects\u2026that is exactly what happened! This just goes to show how much you learn in this class! If you are deciding between this and the ENAS version, the latter has recently switched professor and is now MATLAB intensive. While MATLAB is important, you pick up the language very fast after learning a lower-level language like Java. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! It will also be useful if you have a particular \"goal\" in mind for taking this class. Web design? Game design? I feel some people just drift into this class and get a little turned off\/daunted by the class. But I really loved it!",
    "I would summarize this class as an introduction to the basics of java programming. I would definitely recommend this class to other students, because it is an excellent class to take if you are interested in learning more about computers and their inner workings.",
    "This is an introductory java programming course. This course moves really fast through topics and is very time consuming. Expect to spend at least 10 hours on each problem set if this is your first exposure to programming. I would recommend this class for everyone. It is a great way to get the basics and Professor Yang is a great professor who is very flexible with scheduling.",
    "WONDERFUL COURSE! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Professor Yang Yang is superb! He's a brilliant professor who is also an excellent teacher. His lectures are very interesting, and he enjoys connecting computer science to other subjects like history and finance. He truly deserves a teaching award. He worked very hard to build a computer science community and to make the class as fun as possible. YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG YANG",
    "ugh.",
    "Definitely take this class, but I say that taking into account the professor!",
    "Great. Take it if you have time in your schedule.",
    "YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE BEFORE YOU GRADUATE. Seriously life changing.",
    "'CS 112 superbly introduced programming and algorithmic thinking-- especially with Prof. Yang leading the charge. The course covered the computer science fundamentals (sorting, cryptography, polymorphism) while also delving fairly deep into Java. Prof Yang, the Great Innovator, also devoted a fourth of the course to web programming (HTMP, JSP, CSS and so on), allowing us to extend our programming knowledge and apply it to a different class of languages. I would definitely recommend the course to someone looking for an engaging introduction to programming. I came in with APCS knowledge and still learned a ton and enjoyed it quite a bit. The problem sets are awesome.",
    "If you want to learn basic programming, definitely take this class. Expect to put in several hours per week on some of the p-sets, though. It's very easy to do well in this class if you put in a lot of work (because of how much extra credit is offered), but really doing well and mastering the material will take a lot of work. Don't make my mistake of taking this class Credit\/D. If you're going to take it, go all in and commit to doing it the right way. You'll learn far more than the Credit\/D students, and if you put in enough time you're essentially guaranteed an A. This is a really great course, though, maybe the best intro class I've taken at Yale (I'm a junior Econ major, and I had no programming experience before this semester).",
    "Yes, it was a fun and interesting to learn computer programming. One of the more enjoyable classes I have taken at yale.",
    "112 is a fun course that isnt too challenging if you already think algorithmically. The problem sets were, I thought, really well designed so that you were really able to apply what you learned in a real way, and the policies and grading were very lenient. I found the content to be incredibly basic and feel like I could've skipped to 201 just based on my competency with math and science generally, but I found that the problem sets really got me useful practical experience programming.",
    "a seriously amazing course. I took it for kicks as a senior history major, and I gained so much. in terms of sheer pleasure, this course produces so much of it! just plain fun. writing successful code is deeply satisfying. I'd have dreams about my code, bang my head against the wall. and when it worked, it was so cathartic and gratifying. I also can appreciate now what coding involves, have a great platform on which to teach myself more programming if I want to, and had the QR parts of my brain worked out. Yang is an amazing, friendly professor. his lectures were not clear because they went too fast for me. I learned much more from reading the textbook. but he runs a fantastic class - good TAs, great Psets, fair tests, etc. I thought it was an unbelievably well executed course. this course had more work than any credit I've taken at Yale save my senior thesis (more than Directed Studies, more than high level history seminars). be prepared to work.",
    "Not really. It's interesting to learn how to code in Java, but it's also something that you can do on your own time. You don't really learn much from lectures so it ends up being you learning it on your own (with the help of TFs) anyway.",
    "Take it. It's fun and you learn how to code.",
    "This class is a good introduction for programming. I knew literally nothing about programming or computer science before coming in to the class, but it wasn't too hard and I learned a lot. It is a pretty big time commitment for the problem sets, and the midterm was harder than I expected, but overall it was a good class.",
    "Don't take it unless you are a freshman interested in becoming a computer science major.",
    "If you are looking for a quick introduction to programming on your computer, this is the course for you.",
    "Very thorough teaching, good introduction to the power of programming for someone with no background in computer science or coding at all. Opened up a new world for me. Homework sets are very time-consuming but office hours have been helpful enough. However, if you don't enjoy things with minute details (eg. debugging) or learning a new language (ie. coding), this class will be very painful.",
    "I would recommend it, but with caution. Don't be fooled by the first two psets; this class is INCREDIBLY time-consuming. You feel awesome once you've finished a pset, but they can take so long. If you have time in your schedule, take the class. It's a pretty awesome feeling to run a program that you never thought you'd be able to make. You also learn so much in a short time.",
    "This is a very challenging yet rewarding class. If you put in the time to go to office hours several times a week, then you will do well on the problem sets. It's time consuming, but ultimately worth it I believe.",
    "Take it! You leave with a knowledge of programming which you can build on at Yale or on your own - class moves fast and psets can be challenging, but if you have the time to invest into it, it's a very worthwhile class to take!!",
    "I loved this class. It's hard if you don't know anything about computers but they have an army of TFs, Piazza and a lot of makeup work available if you mess up. The psets can take a while, but generally the instructions make it really clear what you have to do, so as long as you read the slides (or do the reading, either one really is fine) you will be able to do it.",
    "CPSC 112 is a great introduction to programming. I found that lecture wasn't very helpful, since it was so large, but the constant office hours and extensive resources were amazing. I think we learned even more because the problem sets were so practical and required real problem solving skills and application of the concepts that we'd learned.",
    "Pset difficulty jumped way too radically too early. Before anyone had been able to get a grasp on basics, the psets were super hard. There was a massive difference in ability between programmers which TAs and professors didn't really seem to understand (ie they thought we should all be at the highest level of ability). Took it credit d which isn't always recommended because you still have to do the work for the psets, but if you know programming really isn't something you're going to be good at it can be a great way to take the pressure off psets and exams while still learning a lot.",
    "CS 112 is a class to take if you enjoy problem solving and want to learn some introductory -level java. The problem sets often take 5-10 hours but are very rewarding when finally completed. The teaching fellows and office hours are also very helpful. Definitely a class worth taking regardless of whether you are interesting in pursuing computer science further or not.",
    "If you're willing to dedicate your semester to learning what programming is from the very basics, I'd highly recommend this class. You'll learn a lot without the stress of exams and term papers and you'll be challenged through individual projects that stimulate certain mental areas you'll never realize you had.",
    "If you are curious about programming and you here willing to put in time for the class, take it.",
    "It's an intro to programming class focused on JAVA. Most of the course is focused on JAVA. You do a little bit of Java script and some web programming at the end of the term but not a lot. I would recommend it to someone who really wants to start coding, however warning it is a LOT of work. Psets took me 6-10 hours- I never programmed before, but still it was pretty difficult for me. If you go to office hours though, the TAs can walk you through it and you eventually can work out the pset. Also if you take this class take it with friends! Professor Yang encouraged figuring out psets together with other people and there are quite a few group assignments. So take it with a friend!",
    "Interesting to learn programming, but the lectures were kind of useless and mostly you just need to go to office hours to get through the problem sets.",
    "A really good introductory course to learn mainly about java, but also about CSS and html.",
    "Good intro to java - take it no matter what!",
    "time consuming; rewarding. if not serious: credit\/d it",
    "Harder than you expect. By Pset 4 things were basically impossible for me without a lot of help. Still, I now know what programming is and what I can do with it, which is what I wanted. Start it Credit\/D if you are like me, with bad intuition and no experience programming.",
    "It was a good survey of programming. I would recommend it to most people, as it is an important skill to have.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a major time commitment, but a very great course nonetheless if you want to learn about programming.",
    "Yes great course and easy to do well if you do the work. Take it with a friend and the psets will be more enjoyable. We sure to go to the office hours and start ahead of time on the psets.",
    "Very long and hard problem sets. People are expected to have no background but it's not true, many students have an advantage over others since they already know the stuff, what leaves the rest behind.",
    "Take it! I would recommend it for students who have never taken programming before. I had done Codeacademy, but that was the extent of my compsci knowledge. The assignments teach you how to program, so you can apply what you learnt using Java to other languages. Also, you can do well in this class without going to class, but lecture is very engaging.",
    "Good class if you want to put the effort into it. I wouldn't recommend taking it CredD because you have to put in a baseline effort anyway.",
    "CPSC 112 is a great course. You will learn so much. Don't bother with Cr\/D. Honestly, if you put in the time ( and this class requires A LOT of time- plan for 10 hour a week problem sets sometimes) you will get the A. If you don't put in the time, you will not pass. I don't really think the Cr\/D option saves you any stress in this case. Also, Yang is an incredible professor and more than willing to listen to your feedback. Definitely take this class with him.",
    "A great class at a high level; that said, you can definitely go in with no prior experience and enjoy it, as I did. I learned so much, and definitely found it challenging, but the kind of challenging that was supported by helpful TF's, well-structured\/chosen practice assignments, and clear materials. It really teaches you a skill, and a different way of thinking. I know this class is going to be valuable to me now and in the future. Highly recommended!",
    "A 3 month struggle, but fun and rewarding and necessary",
    "CS 112 will teach you how to program in Java, but it won't teach you much web based programming. If Yang Yang is running the course, it will be incredibly well staffed with some great TAs or TFs and a few meh ones. The assignments were graded fairly but took a ridiculous amount of time. Thus, if you don't have 12 or so hours a week to spend on this class (the class was quite difficult for me, so this may be an over-approximation for you), don't take it. If you put in the work, you should do well. Be sure to not get lost at the beginning, or you will need A LOT of time devoted to your text book to catch up, especially because everything builds on what was previously learned.",
    "You essentially teach yourself the class, but it's a lot of fun with yang yang. Great class, definitely worth it if you have the time to dedicate to the psets",
    "This class demands a lot (I spent at least 6 hours each week at office hours), but is incredibly satisfying--plus, if you really work for it, you can guarantee yourself a good grade in this class.",
    "An awesome class. I would recommend this class if you are at all interested in programming. Our year tried out a lot of different things but it was really fun and I would retake it. Even if you don't have a STEM background, you can manage it. It is extremely rewarding to see your work literally pay off in a program. I don't know if Prof. Yang is teaching again but take it from him. The psets take a while as you get further in the course but nothing unmanageable. And you can literally do anything you want for your final project!",
    "crazy heavy workload, take it if you love lonely nights in front of the computer slapping yourself because you have been spending over fifteen hours on an assignment and it still going no where",
    "This class is a lot of work, but you learn a lot of programming, and Yang makes everything interesting and fun.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone looking for an interesting QR credit",
    "I would recommend this class to people who REALLY want to pursue computer programming longer term than just this course. I wouldn't call this an intro class to understand the basics or concepts, but a very hands on course for those who want to pursue computer programming.",
    "Take it and just focus on each assignment at a time. For the final project, stay organized and be early to finish. Try the extra credit opportunities! They're fun and you learn lots.",
    "Everyone should take this class.",
    "If you're QR oriented or have wanted to learn some basics to programming, I would highly recommend this course. I had a great time in it and learned a lot, too.",
    "All things considered, programming is an important skill and I am glad I took this course. It was extremely difficult and took up an exorbitant amount of my time (8-10 hours per problem set at minimum), but I learned valuable skills in the process of getting a QR credit.",
    "Such a great class, no matter your major! The problem sets can be hard, but if you go to office hours you'll get endless help from the TA's. With the optional psets and heaps of extra credit opportunities, it's not hard to get an A.",
    "Good class, but yang yang kills you with work. I took the class as a second semester senior (econ major)...I am glad that I took the class, it had to be done. BUT, second semester senior year was definitely the wrong semester to take the class, haha. take the class before senior year, and take it credit d. IF you are a second semester senior and still have not taken this class, take it, just adjust your other courses so they are not as much work. 10 hours or more on pset is pretty typical.",
    "Overall, I had an extremely positive experience with this class - the work was challenging, but not overly difficult or time consuming, and the teaching staff was extremely dedicated and accessible (and creative in how they made the class fun for students). The only complaint I might have is that lectures moved pretty quickly and it was often difficult to follow along and actually understand everything everything being taught.",
    "Intro to Programming is as exactly as its name describes; it is an introductory course that teaches java and the basics of programming. The workload is extremely heavy so make sure you put aside the time to invest in programming psets. On the other hand, the grading is extremely fair and even generous. The course definitely sparked my interest in programming because the sense of accomplishment once you finished each pset and saw the resulting program was so gratifying!"
