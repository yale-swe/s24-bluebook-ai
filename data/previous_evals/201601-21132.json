   "comments": [
    "This course wasn't as amazing as last year's reviews indicated. Prof Silbermann is nice, but seems too timid when leading class discussions and does not challenge students enough or probe to create a strong learning environment. The beginning of semester was interesting, with lots of feminist theory readings. Then, for a month or more we read different poli sci research papers that were dense and didn't contribute to a broad understanding to the subject matter - they just showed, for example, if clothing choice impacted voters perceptions, rather than prompted a discussion more broadly in the class about the different ways voters view men and women candidates. Not really a hard class, but before taking it I'd recommend closely reading the syllabus to make sure you're interested in the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to any students who are passionate about women's rights and want to engage other students in conversation regarding the academic work being done on women and U.S. politics. This class depends largely on the group of people who take the class, as much of the course is discussion-based. Be willing to give your opinion and ask questions in class. If you don't weigh in on the discussion and ask questions, seminars can be dry. This course is very much what you put into it.",
    "I would say that none of the information is particularly novel, but you learn a lot of important research behind it and get to explore the topic more. A worthwhile course for sure.",
    "A satisfying look into the issues surrounding gender biases\/sexism in politics and beyond. I would recommend this course because you will become more cognizant of gender roles you encounter in everyday life. I feel like I have a much more critical eye now when I watch movies, YouTube videos, political speeches, television, etc."
