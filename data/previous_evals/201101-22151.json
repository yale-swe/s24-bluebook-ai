    "You have to take it.. Good thing is we have more time for each project than last semester. Seeing your progress is a great thing.",
    "In this studio, you will LEARN. The learning curve is kind of rough at the beginning, but Keith is great and will really help you grow in your architectural education.",
    "Though this course is required for Architecture majors, I found it to be a good course and was glad that I got to take it. That being said, the work load is extraordinarily heavy and the expectations are very high. I would say that this was a good course in a poorly organized, unrealistic major.",
    "Parties and Bullshit, minus the Parties.",
    "You probably have to take it. It's better than Fall semester, so keep that in mind.",
    "This was a tough studio. It was Keith's first year of teaching the junior studio. As a result, the workload was a bit unevenly distributed. Everyone in our class pulled all-nighter(s) for the final project. We spent 7 weeks developing one house, compared to only 3 designing an entire housing block (the final project). The assignments were pretty challenging but rewarding in the end. The first two seemed unrelated to the rest of the work during the semester. Not a bad studio, but could definitely use some improvements. Keith is very rational, precise, strict in termsof his demands for each assignment and in terms of his approach toward design, and has a clear notion of what domesticity should be.",
    "The downs: like any studio, Spring Junior Studio is physically, emotionally and financially exhausting.The ups: the people who are running this show are legitimately some of the most intelligent, perceptive people you'll ever be taught by.It's best to think of this studio as an apprenticeship - diligent labour under the tutelage of people who are equal parts slave-drivers, critics, parents and friends. You will think thoughts that will make your head hurt, and make amazing things with your hands. I enjoyed spring junior studio much more than fall junior studio, partly because the projects were less abstract (we designed a real house and an entire city block for spring studio whereas we essentially made sculpture in the fall) and also because the teaching staff was especially incredible.If you find that Keith Krumwiede isn't teaching this class, rage until they put him on it. Like, actually. The man is amazing. He'll put you through a trial by fire, and when you come out the other end you'll find yourself a more skilled designer and thinker for it. Studio is hard enough as it is - teachers like Keith make it worth it.",
