   "comments": [
    "Good class. Focusses on readings of books like l'etranger. Not a lot of work.",
    "French 130 is a work intensive course but if you do the work you'll learn a lot of French.",
    "Great intermediate class to build upon the foundation of introductory French.",
    "Rather good. Incredibly rigorous and stressful at points, interspersed with a lot of fun in the meantime. Could have benefited from some standardized grammar resources.",
    "Very intense course.",
    "The Yale French Department has great resources and course materials, so if you want to learn French, by all means take it. You will have to put in some work, but the grammar lessons, the accompanying audio files, and the readings and films make for a nicely integrated and thought-out learning experience. I recommend you dont take the class with Vysosias though. There were several things that bothered me about her style of teaching. One, there were quite a few times when she was frazzled or seemed lost. It wasnt just that she forgot class materials every now and then (that didnt really matter to me). It was the little grammar and spelling mistakes that we had to catch, and her inability to answer questions for clarification. When people were confused about a grammar rule, she would often either repeat exactly what she had already said, or go into a long monologue in French that often had nothing to do with the question posed to her. In the end, students often just dropped the question because they were too confused to carry on the exchange. In connection with these confusing explanations (and this is the second main point), I would sometimes feel a slightly authoritarian inflection to her way of explaining things. Something like an unstated this is the way it is! - Its not easy to describe, but it definitely felt like questions for clarification werent welcome. I had a latent sense that it was our fault when we didnt get something, and so it was our problem as well. This latent authoritarianism also came through in other situations. We had a group exercise in which one student would sit in the front facing the rest of the students. Prof. Vysosias would write a vocab word on the board that the class had to explain in French to the student sitting in the front, who had to guess it. A very nice exercise, except often she would, without warning, call out a student to sit in the front, and only then explain what was going on. Those are small things, but they contributed to a general classroom environment in which I felt uneasy in a way that just wasnt necessary. Three, she was not a very passionate teacher, both in terms of the material and of engaging the students. It often felt like little details didnt matter. Sometimes, we would just plough through the reading by her doing almost all the talking. And on Fridays, her mind seemed to already be in weekend mode. If you werent performing too well, it didnt feel like you could go to her to ask for help or advice to improve. You were pretty much on your own. Again, the course itself was good, and I learned the language well. I just wouldnt ascribe it to Prof. Vysosias. Do take the class, but with someone else."
