    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is a fascinating way of thinking about place, first and foremost, but beyond that, it really helped me grow as a writer and as a human being. If you're looking for a professor to make you feel like you're God's gift to writing, Professor Zarin is probably not your person, but she does find a way to help you improve your writing and structure and she pushes your thinking.",
    "A lot of writing, interesting, unintimidating assignments, fun class sessions, great professor",
    "Take it if you like to write!",
    "Recommended for students who are serious about creative nonfiction. There is a lot of writing (an essay every week), but it's worth it--you will amass a large body of writing about place and see your own improvement over the course of the class. Very interesting readings and discussions that expand your conception of place as a topic of writing (beyond cities or buildings to consider states of mind\/institutions\/works of art as place)."
