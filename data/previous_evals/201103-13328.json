    "I would highly recommend this course to any student who has not had a lot of exposure to writing research papers.",
    "English 114 was a solid introduction to academic writing. Professor Karas was very informative, and gave clear suggestions. The peer-review aspect of the class i found most helpful: we were, for each assignment, able to read and review each other's work prior to submission, and offer advice. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student who is seeking to improve their academic writing skills. The workload is reasonable (only four papers throughout the semester, three 4-5 pages, and one 8-10 pages), and the class offers a nice introduction to writing academic papers.",
    "Great class for if you know you need to improve your writing. The class size is small so more one on one time with the professor. I recommend this to any students.",
    "Absolutely, this class sets up a foundation for college-level writing that takes the fear out of lengthy papers.",
    "Yes. It is a good way to start out college.",
    "I was happy I took this course. It was a nice intro to college writing that wasn't too demanding. It's a good way to fulfill a writing credit.",
    "Yes, I would recommend 114 for any student that wants to improve their writing in a low-key environment before delving into harder and more demanding academic papers. It's a really nice way to ease into college writing because it's not too difficult, and you learn a lot along the way."
