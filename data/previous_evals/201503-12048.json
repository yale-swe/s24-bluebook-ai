    "This course is perfectly engineered to teach you French if you do your homework. Ngame is an incredible, incredible teacher, who doesn't grade harshly but will teach you SO much French. Take him!",
    "I would recommend the course if you are willing to put in the work to learn the language and not just do enough to receive the A's on the French tests. The traditional memorize and dump will not take you far in 130.",
    "French 130 is definitely a bit harder than L1 or L2, but you get to read and watch movies, which are nice improvements!",
    "I definitely would recommend this course and this section to a friend interested in French at the appropriate level.",
    "A lot of work but also a lot of fun. Recommended jf you really want to learn the language.",
    "This course successfully improves a student's French-speaking abilities through its daily assignments (of writing and listening) and daily classes. It requires effort, but its results are worthwhile.",
    "yes, it is a well taught class"
