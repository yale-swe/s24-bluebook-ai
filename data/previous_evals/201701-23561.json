    "I am not sure how well known this course is. I am positive more students would have taken this course if it was advertised\/described differently. This is a similar to a clinic course focused on federal lands and policy. It goes over US policy\/government structure.",
    "This class provided an extremely interesting perspective on working on policy issues, especially in Washington DC. The coursework mixed readings on the structure and function of various policy entities in the federal government with more anecdotal and experiential lessons about how to advance your policy agenda in the face of non-institutional obstacles. I really appreciated how much emphasis was placed on working with people and developing relationships to achieve policy goals. Overall I think this class is immensely useful for anyone interested in working in Washington or for the federal government--extremely useful for FES students!"

    "Working with clients was great--very challenging and it allowed us to get a sense of what a career in advocacy or policy may entail. I especially enjoyed how hands-on this course was. We didn't focus much on theory, and instead looked at case studies and presentations from speakers to articulate and discuss aspects of the policy process. I think the coursework in this class is probably some of the most useful for students (like myself) who are interested in working in government\/policy.",

    "This course was poorly organized. Deadlines and deliverables were not clear, which is frustrating when other courses follow their syllabus. I think this course used to have multiple client projects, mock testimonials etc. This did not happen this semester. I think this would have been more useful than one project for the entire semester - which someone could get from a clinic course.",

I wanted a course that would provide me with experience, understanding, and professional skills to help me build a career in federal policy. This class was a great complement to other clinical\/practicum courses like EPC, which focuses more on advocacy work. I feel like this course prepared me extremely well for a career in the federal government."

Jim has immense experience and so many stories that are applicable to the issues we will face in our careers. I definitely recommend this class to other students at FES."
