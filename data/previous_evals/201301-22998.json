    "It teaches you real world skills for piloting ships.",
    "Naval Science 112 covers all the basics of navigation including Rules of the Road, piloting, charting, and weather. I would recommend this course if the student has an interest in these particular topics because it is very informative and well structured.",
    "This class takes you through the basics of navigation, from rules of the road (the rules of driving the ship) to the actual nitty-gritty aspects of shipboard navigation and the science behind many of the instruments and navigational procedures. I would recommend this class to anyone who is very interested in the United States Navy's approach to navigation.",
    "Whether you are a ROTC midshipman or just someone interested in learning what navigation and boating is all about, this is a great overall introductory course that is fun with no pressure. It covers many important topics that navigators are concerned about, and what you will learn serves as general useful knowledge even if you won't be using it in professional practice."
