   "comments": [
    "Databases might not be what you expect, but it's pretty solid. The readings for the course are entirely academic papers on database architectures and related topics. You walk through these papers in class, and then you write a couple of C++ assignments that illustrate some architectural techniques. In the second half of the course, you read more academic papers, but this time you write responses to each one. Finally you have a project with a group of 2-4 people. Professor Abadi does a pretty killer job with this course, and he makes sure to keep all of the students involved. I highly recommend the course, not because databases are really exciting, but more because it is useful to learn some architectural techniques that apply to databases and can be used more generally in computer science.",
    "I give this class my highest recommendation. I am a graduating senior, and I think this is the best CS class I've ever taken at Yale. Abadi is a truly wonderful professor and cares about his students.",
    "One of the best electives you can take. Even so, be prepared to put some extra effort if you want to get all you can from this class.",
    "Great course! Definitely one of the better CS electives I've taken here. Abadi knows so much about database management systems. Although he doesn't always impart this knowledge 100% eloquently, he's always happy to talk about it and answer questions (both during and after class). I would recommend this course, for sure. It's not easy (the assignments are decently hard), and the midterm was an absolute killer. The first half of the course is database basics, and the second half of the course is a survey of various database topics out there right now. I learned a lot!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in how databases work and the algorithms that run in a database system. The material we covered was really interesting and the problem sets allowed us to implement some of the things we read about.",
    "This is an extremely interesting class if you want to learn about what goes into building a database management system. The discussions during class are highly interesting and you get to learn a lot from your peers, as many people may have previously interned at Oracle, MongoDB, SAP, etc. I would enthusiastically recommend taking this course.",
    "Great class, take it!",
    "Interesting class. Abadi does a great job at in-depth analysis of seminal works in database infrastructure. Lots of cool projects and an opportunities to do independent projects.",
    "This was such an interesting class, particularly because of the structure. Prof. Abadi does a great job of facilitating discussion -- something that rarely happens in other CS electives, which tend to be much more one-directional. I should note that this was originally very intimidating for me. I usually sit near the back of classrooms and engage with content on my own time outside of class. This class encouraged me to engage with content while in class and to vocalize my ideas. As a second-semester senior, this was a really nice last-minute growing experience. In terms of academic growth, the class also teaches you how to read research papers and be critical of them. Although I never looked forward to reading the research papers (perhaps a sign that I shouldn't go into academia), I undoubtedly got much better at understanding them as the semester progressed. Credit to Prof. Abadi for encouraging such a unique learning experience. Some final thoughts regarding Prof. Abadi. Although it can be hard to tell at times, he really cares about his students. He has high expectations of his students because he thinks that his students can meet \/ exceed those expectations.",
    "This is one of the best cs classes the department has to offer. I would recommend having some concurrent programming experience before taking the class (422 operating systems is good to have under your belt). The workload isn't very high (We had 2 programming assignments, the first only took ~8 hours and the second ~20 hours) but you'll get a lot more out of the class if you can follow the reading (dense reading! a technical 8-12 page research paper for every class) and apply it to the final project.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend to any and all CS majors.",
    "This class is a pretty good class if you're at all interested in knowing more about databases. It's quite research based and you should be prepared to read dense research papers for every class and also participate, but otherwise the coding assignments are pretty fair.",
    "A thorough and excellent course on the background machinery of databases (database management systems DBMS), from important historical DBMS to current cutting edge systems. The workload is high, 2 programming assignments, weekly readings in the first half, and a midterm before spring break. After spring break, there is a full academic paper to read and a reading response required for each class. This is capped off by a significant final project \/ mini research project on some aspect of DBMS. Prepare yourself for the workload, commit the time to the class and you will learn a ton of useful knowledge about databases. The course material is at times really dry, be warned.",
    "This is by far the most unique computer science elective I have taken at Yale. Most electives consist of a sequence of ever more time consuming psets or labs. This class had only two psets, and primarily consisted of mandatory reading from foundational research. In the second half, we looked at more recent literature, writing reading responses and criticizing the papers in class. This is definitely a good class to take if youre itching for some exposure to real CS research. The classs focus on fundamental concurrency control strategies also makes it a must-take for all majors. Moreover, Abadi is a gem of the department, a young, ambitious professor who really breathes a new life into what can otherwise be a dry subject.",
    "One of the better CS electives. Also very different from the rest. You'll learn to be opinionated when looking at research papers.",
    "This is one of the top CS classes at Yale. The teaching staff are extremely knowledgeable, and Profesor Abadi is an engaging lecturer and really keeps the class excited with the topic. You will learn a huge amount, and have a chance to work on a rewarding final project, exploring a topic in great detail.",
    "A lot of prep time goes into this course. I really recommend spending more time than you think you should be spending in the first month of the course--it's easy to blow them off. However, the infamous midterm will rekk you, because if you don't understand the early material perfectly, your ability to understand material in the future will be hindered. This is a hard course, especially if you've never done one of the 'hard' CS electives like OSs or Compilers, but you will learn a lot about concurrency and how computer systems are architecture. Prof. Abadi is a fun lecturer.",
    "A must-take for every CS major. The course selection at Yale is narrow but this is a true gem. You will read a paper before every class, which takes up the bulk of the preparation time. Not an easy class but surely worth it.",
    "Take for a cool intro to academic CS. It's totally different from any other electives\/core classes here and I think everyone should see what this side of the tech world is like",
    "Bottom line: This is an excellent course which every CS major should take. The course layout, ad the demands that come with it, are very different from other CS classes, but honestly I wish more CS electives were taught like this. It will teach you skills you might miss out on otherwise, but you will have to work for itharder that 223, easier than 323 or 365, but most of the value is in actually reading the papers so you can discuss them rather than grinding on psets, so dont overload your schedule if you want to enjoy this course. You will get to read academic papers in CS, learn to conduct research in CS, get experience with systems programming (we did some parallel programming), and get engaging class discussions, all on top of getting lectures that will teach you about databases. Before taking the course, I didnt think databases were that interesting, but honestly the study of databases kind of touches on so many areas of CSalgorithms, hardware, OS, distributed systems, networking, business concerns, and more. Abadi brings these all together seamlessly, and the result is really rewarding. Higher expectations only occasionally lead to better results, but this is definitely a case where that applies.",
    "Very in-depth class to database systems. Take it only if you're very interested in how they work. The final project was a lot of work."
