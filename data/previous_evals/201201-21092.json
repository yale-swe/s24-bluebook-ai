   "comments": [
    "HIST 606 is a research methods seminar and a reading course in early modern Britain. I'd recommend this course to any student interested either in gaining research experience or a better grasp of research methodology or to any student with an interest in early modern Britain. The course requires a significant amount of work week to week, but the intellectual and experiential gains made each week far repay the effort.",
    "This is a course that introduces students to the most important debates in the field and challenges students to think more deeply in substantive and comparative terms. The focus is on 'big' history and students are encouraged to write research papers along such lines. The course offers plenty of things to keep one busy through the week so it's not an understatement to say that it'll be the heaviest class for most people taking it. That said, I wholeheartedly recommend it, because that workload is perhaps the most interesting and engaging one shall encounter.",
    "History 606 is a class in which you finally learn everything you were supposed to about how to draft and write an article-length research paper. I would highly recommend History 606 because the professor is an invaluable mentor.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, because you learn a lot and it's an excellent chance to do a piece of quality research. However, it will be a lot of work, and the student should be prepared for that."

   "comments": [
    "HIST 606 was a research methods course, so I gained a great deal of methodological insight and research experience generally speaking. I also had the opportunity to begin research on what will, in all likelihood, make up one case study of my potential dissertation.",
    "I don't know how I would complete my dissertation without this course-- the weekly 'rants' the professor gave inspired me to write better, think harder, and work faster.The subject matter was also a gaping hole in my knowledge of the period, so I benefited from the secondary literature as well."
