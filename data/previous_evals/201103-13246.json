   "comments": [
    "I thought the course was great. Enjoyed the case studies, and i learned a lot. I thought there was just too much to cover, and maybe for next year they should consider taking out a few topics. It felt a bit rushed.",
    "I think the topics covered in this course were excellent and very interesting; however, I think the course was a bit disorganized. I don't think the readings we did that we were quizzed on in class connected very well with what we then talked about during class.I also think that the range\/types of different assignments were a bit all over the place. From the book review, to the food security assignment, the Thanksgiving reading, the final project, and the radio show. I appreciate very much that Dr. Humphries was trying to give us variety and keep us engaged with these very different assignments; however, I felt the course could benefit from more focus or honing in on the key aspects of global food and nutrition.",
    "I loved the blend of concrete facts about different micronutrients with the critical analysis of various interventions and policies. I had little nutrition background coming in and now it is something that I want to focus on within the field of public health.",
    "Great course - would have liked more in depth discussion of nutritional deficiencies - more class discussion led by the professor rather than focusing on opinions of students",
    "I really enjoyed taking this course. I with there had been more emphasis and time spent on the second module about agricultural policies. It seemed like we had to skip over a lot of important information because there wasn't time. I feel like the modules about micronutrient deficiencies could have been consolidated in order to spend more time on agricultural policies.",
    "Overall, I think Professor Humphries was an effective Professor. Participating in the creation of material for collaborators in Nepal was a great project. I enjoyed reading My Ishmael because it was thought-provoking. I would have enjoyed discussing it more.Some of the readings were confusing and challenging to parse because they seemed contradictory. I don't know that having a reading quiz for every class during the first and third modules was particularly effective. I would have liked to see more time on the case studies and on discussing issues. The handouts were great, but a bit cluttered. Too many studies to discuss, but not enough context (information to help interpret the results).Overall, a really interesting class.",
    "I really enjoyed this class.Readings from a textbook and from articles and books provided a good balance of background information and more nuanced views on issues.Class discussions were always engaging - though it often felt like we didn't have time for things. It might be better to consider having the class meet once a week for a longer amount of time?The assignments were interesting and fun, and they related well to what was covered in class.",
    "Spread the work out a bit! Seemed like everything was due in mid-November. As for the material, though, and the teaching style, both good overall.",
    "The course covered a great deal of information. At times, I felt the course was rushed and unable to do any one topic justice. The handouts could have been skipped for more interactive, discussion-oriented activities or by simply displaying the handout information on the overhead.",
    "Assignments are interesting, topic is fascinating, discussions are provocative. Great course. Too much work though, especially the final project.",
    "Strengths: covered wide range of topics, learned a great deal about a lot of important materialWeakness: covered so much often hard to bring all together",
    "This course was great. It is a discussion based course that provides for a great overall understanding the issues facing hunger and malnutrition from vary aspects.",
    "This course was one of the best that I have taken. The structure allowed for discussion along with increasing knowledge of the course material.",
    "It is an excellent course that addresses the subject matter from a variety of angles. The opportunity to think about global nutrition through many different types of tasks and lenses was exciting and stimulating. Some of the work, however, (mainly the quizzes) was not really helpful in terms of time spent in and out of class. Also, the lack of a lecture format was refreshing, but made it a little hard to pay attention\/keep up with what was going on throughout class.",
    "Its just really great. I have no suggestions.",
    "Overall, this was an excellent course. Dr. Humphries was careful in providing a structure and rigor to a topic (nutrition and global health) that I had anticipated would be somewhat vague or would be very specific in a biochemical fashion. As a result, I learned a great deal about the immunological importance of nutrients, larger social challenges, and areas where health policy can be utilized to improve nutrition."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Great at leading discussions and listening to student's questions. Patient. A bit disorganized at times.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0I think Dr. Humphries did a great job of trying to bring together a wide array of materials in global food and nutrition and making them relevant and interesting to her students. However, as I mentioned above, I do think the course could focus a bit more (from the topics covered to the kind of assignments we received) on the key concepts. I like how the course went through three distinct phases; however, within those phases the materials and the assignments could be more organized or streamlined.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Effective teaching style - does not read off of powerpoint slides, but is very engaged with the students and in the discussion.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Wonderful. Though I wish discussions were led more by Prof Humphries and less by students",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0I loved having Debbie as a professor. She was passionate and a great teacher. She presented the material very well, and asked questions in class that left me thinking and inspired. She had us over for dinner at her house which was amazing. We had daily topics sheets that were passed out in the beginning of each class that had studies about the topic of the day. We often did not get to discuss everything on the sheet, and I think picking one or two studies insteadof three or four would allow us to understand the material better.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Really enjoyed that Prof Humphries scheduled a meeting with each of us individually to talk to us about our goals. It was great tohave a Professor take the time to learn about her students. I also appreciated that she opened her home to us so that the class could make a nutritionally awesome meal (i.e. putting our knowledge from the semester to good use while bonding over food).I appreciate that Professor Humphries will say if she is not sure about a particular issue. I wish that there were more concrete answers though to some of the things we discussed in class (which is more a statement about the field than Prof Humphries).",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie was a great instructor. I'm glad to have gotten to know her through this class. She led interesting activities and invited lots of discussion for students.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie is friendly, knowledgeable and approachable. At times her expectations of students were somewhat unclear, especially in terms of the final project.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Excellent - approachable, knowledgeable, friendly and encouraging.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Professor Humphries is a great professor. Though we usually ran out of time to get through everything in the lecture, she was passionate about the material and was very knowledgeable about the subject.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Dr. Humphries was a fantastic instructor who was patient, supportive and challenging in her teaching.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Professor Humphries is an extremely thoughtful and knowledgable individual. I was very impressed by her and grateful to have the opportunity to learn from her.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Good. Perhaps she could be clearer in what she expects from students, though.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Debbie Humphries has a unique teaching style that I find incredible at teaching and facilitating discussion. She is knowledgeable, passionate, and open.",
    "Instructor: Debbie Lee Humphries \u00a0Dr. Humphries was a fantastic instructor. She was particularly organized, punctual, and approachable. The handouts she provided for each lecture were very helpful in presenting the data, especially in a concise but powerful manner. I just wish the class lecture was longer because I often wished that our class discussions, while fascinating, were not long enough! But Dr. Humphries was excellent at knowing when to segue into the next topic of the day."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "Absolutely take this course!",
    "A broad intro to malnutrition worldwide. Looked at everything from micronutrient deficiencies to Ag policies and how they affect world populations.",
    "Very interesting and covers a broad range of topics. There is a lot of work, but it is manageable. The readings for micro\/macro nutrient deficiencies can be redundant, but the quizzes focus on the malnutrition sections, which makes the reading more manageable. The final project we completed actually has potential for real application in Nepal, which was very exciting.",
    "This is a really interesting course that is broken down into 3 modules: one that focuses on nutritional deficiencies (i.e. more science-y), one that looks at context of food and nutrition throughout the world (i.e. economics, politics, the implications of culture etc) and one that looks at infections and their relationship with nutrition. All in all, really interesting stuff. Worth taking a gander at.",
    "This course is a good introduction to micronutrient deficiencies and other food-related health problems. Larger questions are also addressed, like whether food should be a human right. I would recommend this class to anther student; not too high a workload and the material was interesting.",
    "This course provides a solid overview of issues related to nutrition and development.",
    "Yes - great course if you're interested in the subject matter. Be prepared to come prepared to every class and have a lot of extra assignments, which enrich the course in many ways.",
    "Great course! Would definitely recommend it!",
    "This course provides a base of understanding as to various ways that nutrition affects health and reasons for why there should be investment into the nutritional education and food security in every community.",
    "I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in the subject matter. The multi-disciplinary approach is quite informative and eye-opening, and the discussion format is very enjoyable. My only suggestion is to look carefully at the syllabus - because there is such a wide range of angles, if someone is not interested in a particular aspect of nutrition that is covered, they need to go into course with the understanding that they're not going to enjoy part of the work.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "It is a thorough overview on food and nutrition, often in the developing world. It discusses specific nutrients, issues with food security, and diseases associated with malnutrition.",
    "This course discusses the subject of global nutrition from a multi-faceted approach, utilizing epidemiology, immunology, policy, sociology, and anthropology to further understand why nutritional status across the world is so variable (often within the same geographical area or family) and how we, as future public health practitioners, can strive to improve it for others."
