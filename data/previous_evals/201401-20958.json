    "This is an interesting survey of some modern topics in astrophysics that manages to connect the ideas through gravity. The midterms are fair and the problem sets are pretty straightforward. Prof. Padmanabhan is very helpful for the final projects, but office hours are sparse for most of the semester. He really cares about his students and is enthusiastic about what we choose to research. My only warning is that the workload picks up at the end of the semester with a final poster, paper and exam. None of these are too bad, but it adds up.",
    "This is definitely one of the best physics\/astronomy courses at Yale. The classes are a lot of fun and the material is engaging. Also, Padmanabhan is an excellent professor with an engaging style and a great sense of humor. If you would like to get to know the most interesting topics in modern astrophysics and have fun doing it, without getting too rigorous mathematically, take this class!",
    "YES. TAKE IT. if you are even thinking about taking this course, please take it. if you are scared off by the first lectures on exoplanets, know that the first section is by far the least interesting - the class gets EXPONENTIALLY better in the next two sections. your mind will be blown. you will not regret your decision. one of my favorite classes so far. The project is a lot of work but not as bad as it sounds. Just don't leave it for the absolute minute and it will be fine. The class isn't what I would call easy, but there were only 6 psets during the semester, and you get a lot of support. Tests and problems sets are fair and interesting. Also Prof Padmanabhan is amazing, so that's enough reason to take the class. He's an amazing professor, cares a lot about his research and about his students, and he's one of the few professors I've had who's truly both an engaging lecturer AND a caring professor AND a fabulous scientists. If you ever wanted to take a class where you could learn SO much just by going to lecture, you should also take this class.",
    "A good prereq for this class would be an introductory astronomy class. I hadn't taken any and found myself lost several times. It was an interesting class, but I had to Credit\/D\/Fail it because I didn't have enough of an astronomy background to do super well in it - plus, there is no textbook or assigned readings so it was hard to try to understand material on your own. The tests were open-notes, though, which was nice.",
    "343 is designed for rapid exposure to a variety of topics in modern astrophysics--those normally left unstudied in the undergraduate years. Though occasionally difficult to keep up with the material at times, the class was well-structured, well-taught, and substantial. Nikhil is a dedicated professor. His homework assignments were of reasonable length and difficulty, and quite fun. Shockingly, I could even say the same for exams. Overall, I recommend 343 as a lighter addition to a science major or for anyone who wishes to become conversant in modern astrophysical topics. Or for those who want to jump into a black hole and figure out the exact amount of time they'd feel pain before being crushed by the ever-unforgiving singularity.",
    "A great intro astrophysics survey course. Three midterms and a paper\/presentation. You can find PDF's of the books he uses online, which helps to understand things sometimes. (Padmanabhan has a tendency to move very fast, as he did in Phys 301).",
    "This was probably my favorite class I had all semester, and will probably be one of the best I've taken at Yale. You cover 3 main topics: exoplanets, general relativity, and cosmology. Not only do you learn about the big ideas\/key equations pertinent to these fields, you also learn about how astronomers actually study and measure these things. The workload overall is quite reasonable, but don't procrastinate on your final paper. Professor Padmanabhan is also awesome. Not only are his lectures very interesting, but he clearly cares an enormous amount about his students and will go to extraordinary lengths to help them learn. If you are marginally interested in physics, astronomy, and the universe you should take this class.",
    "It was a cool class, but a lot of work. I would recommend it if you want a physics elective that doesn't require too much math and gives a shallow introduction to many hot topics in astronomy today.",
    "A reasonably easy class that gives a good overview of important topics in astronomy. A physics background is helpful.",
    "Take this class if you enjoy physics, particularly if you do not feel committed for taking a higher level physics course. This course reminded me why I like physics (I'm not a physics major).",
    "I would recommend this for anybody who thinks that the universe is an amazing place. This class is not too difficult but will give insight into the weird and wonderful mysteries of the universe. The professor is really good, and the workload is totally fair.",
    "I would recommend phys 343 to another student, the material is simple enough for people with most physics\/math backgrounds to be fine, and complex enough to be interesting.",
    "This is a good class. It's fairly challenging, but the topics are always interesting. On top of that, Nikhil Padmanabhan is the best professor I have had at Yale. He is accessible, and is always willing to send out hints or clarifications to the class for difficult homework problems. He also offers review sessions in bass the day before each test. You should take advantage of them, as they are extremely helpful. I honestly cannot enough good things about Professor Padmanabhan. This class is a fair amount of work if you take it, but I found it very worthhwhile. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This was a really cool class and taught me a ton about the three topics in the title. The explanations and lecture went a little too fast for me sometimes and I got confused by the metrics at the beginning for sure. However, I hadn't taken any physics courses here before (no AP or anything in high school either), and it was kind of manageable still, so if you're interested in taking an easier (not easy though) physics elective, this isn't a bad choice at all. Nikhil's great too and the final project\/presentation was very chill but still super interesting.",
    "Take this class only if you're not going to slack off. It's not the most organized class and it's pretty easy to get behind. Padmanabhan is not always the clearest lecturer, but he's definitely always enthusiastic about the material. He's helpful in office hours and helps you a lot with your project and paper at the end of the term. Sometimes, I found the problem sets unintelligible even after attending the class lectures and reading his notes online. Easily solved by going to office hours of course, but I found that this happened more often than I liked. All in all, it was a good course. It was a class that wasn't the most excellently-taught, but was about interesting material and was lead by a professor excited about his craft so it all turned out OK.",
    "This is a great class, especially for students interested in physics, but who haven't taken physics at Yale yet. Professor Padmanabhan is awesome, and lectures are generally very interesting and engaging. It is difficult at times, as sometimes homework and class material can stray outside of the prerequisite knowledge for the course. Grading is very lenient to reflect this. I'd highly recommend this course to anyone looking for an interesting, and relevant science class. The field is developing rapidly, and Professor Padmanabhan touches on these new developments in class.",
    "I would recommend this class to Astronomy & physics majors with a solid background in mathematics and physics. Overall it was an interesting course, with amazing subjects ranging from the field of exoplanets to cosmology, and I am very happy that I took it, even though the midterms were very hard and the final project was not really necessary. It is also great not to have a final exam, although be aware that the project is due during reading week, the poster session is done during those days, and the third midterm just happens to be on the day of your final (so technically you still have an exam during finals).",
    "TAKE IT ITS NOT A GUT BUT IF UR GOOD AT PHYSICS DO IT",
    "Definitely take it! It's a really good class, and if you're at all interested in astrophysics you'll have a great time. It's pretty easy too. Only six problem sets, three midterms which were easy and one of which was in place of the final. We also had a final paper and poster presentation, but the poster was ~1500 words and the presentation was really chill. Padmanabhan is great too, really funny and just all around nice but also a good lecturer. One of my favorite classes at Yale so far.",
    "Yes, it is a great course that is a lot of fun.",
    "A fun, not too challenging physics elective on really cool stuff, with a good professor. I recommend.",
    "This is a cool class! Astrophysics is neat, and this covers a breadth of interesting topics. Note that this class is not killer hard if you are a physics person, but it is for sure calculus intensive and often you have to do clever mathematical moves and Taylor expansions to find the solutions to problems. Prof. Padmanabhan is a really, really good professor! I would almost take this class just to take a class from him.",
    "PHYS 343 is a survey of three important topics in astronomy: exoplanets, black holes\/GR, and cosmology. Each topic has its standalone section and non-cumulative exam, so you aren't required to know more than a 1\/3 of the class at any given time. It culminates with the third section exam and a group project. I would definitely recommend this class as an advanced physics elective, because although it is not easy, the material is interesting.",
    "If you're good at physics, I don't think there is any reason not to take this class. You get to apply some pretty theoretical physics and derive some pretty surprising results from them. Who doesn't like throwing stuff into black holes and seeing what happens?"
