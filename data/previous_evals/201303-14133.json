   "comments": [
    "I would summarise the class as being both a survey and an intense seminar in analysis of recent and current Middle Eastern hotspots. Through close and in-depth analysis of a variety of thinkers, both religious and political, Dr Shaker challenges all her students to be able to reach a more nuanced and actionable understanding of how to resolve some of the problems (like Sunni-Shia relations) that affect the Middle East today.",
    "I would highly recommend it if you wanted to learn about a variety of conflicts and become equipped with the tools to understand them.",
    "It is a great overview of the most pertinent conflicts facing the Middle East today and also touches upon past historical events that have produced lasting conseqeuences\/engagements. Surveys US involvement in these conflicts and a few of the seminar meetings are transformed into UN Conflict Resolution simulations where students take on a role and argue to solve a conflict.",
    "Yes! Professor Shaker is great! She presents a lot of facts in the class discussions about the literature and it is a great introduction to the Middle East and all the conflicts in it - as long as you go in to the class without biased opinions.",
    "I would extremely recommend it--it is extremely educational for both those who come into it with extensive and only surface knowledge on the region. A great approach and great professor. Extremely inspiring and educational.",
    "If you have the chance to take it, do it.",
    "Highly recommend it! Great content and exciting seminars.",
    "This was a great course with so many good topics covered. Unfortunately it will not be taught again as Dr. Shaker is now teaching at Claremont!"
