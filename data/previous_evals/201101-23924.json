    "Fabbri is chill and the workload is very relaxed. Can be slow at times and themes are repetitive. Assignments are short and fun.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! one of the most exciting classes i've taken at yale and has really made my academics this semester fun! i loved almost all the reading, made me look at a lot of things\/practices in the world today in a new way, expanded my imagination--inspiring, fun, Fabbri is really kind, intelligent and excited about the topicnone of the reading is long and class discussions can be fun and lively if you contributenot much work at all and a lot of it is creative: definitely recommend this class if you are interested in theater, visual arts or just generally engaged by artistic pursuits\/historyif you're still not sold: we had a futurist banquet based on the futurist cookbook including fried roses and an airplane made out of dried fruit and eau de cologne...and that's just the tip of the iceberg of the weirdness\/wonderfulness of this class",
    "I recommend this class only if you are interested in learning about an art movement in an unconventional way. It's not your typical lecture style course. It really focuses on the theories behind Futurism and the many manifestos. I don't think I came out of the class learning new ways of analyzing Futurist art, but I got to experience a bit of the strangeness that people who participated in the movement felt.It's a pretty laid back class with not a lot of work. The class does a lot of fun and unconventional assignments such as cooking from the Futurist cookbook or writing poetry.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about a silly piece of art history and don't want to do any work.",
    "IF you are looking for a not-horribly time consuming class, or if you have a passionate interest in Futurism, give this a whirl.",
    "Futurism is the first avant-garde movement in Europe. Some of the manifestos are beautiful and definitely worth discussing. You'll also do a lot of fun projects to help you get a grasp of what Futurism really means--from poetry to theater to cooking. Lots of fun!",
    "Yes definitely for a light, fun and interesting class",
    "A lot of fun if you just go with it. Definitely take it, you don't get to be this creative in any other HSAR course."
