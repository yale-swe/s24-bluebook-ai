   "comments": [
    "We could have focus on some topics more,,, to deepen our understanding",
    "The strengths: very comprehensive and pratical for communication needs (presenting, writing, etc.) The weakness: the latter part of the class was not very well-organized. The second exam was postponed for nearly a month, and we did not have our chance to go through a review as the syllabus described. I also suggest that the class should be \"encouraged\" but not \"obliged\" to take for the international students who did not perform well in the August assessment. It takes 3 credits from our original class selection plan and the fact that we the Yale students have to take this class hurts our confidence. I also heard that many SOM students want to be in this class and many FES students prefer not to. In this case, encouragement will be better.",
    "S: talking about negotiation and persuasion techniques W: some topics were extremely basic. Also, the schedule of the class was very bad. A lot of conferences happen on Thursday at 7 and we could not attend because of this class. Also, a 3-hour class is very dense.",
    "In class discussion with classmates and professor was really great. Assignments also helped the students to practice and see progress. In particular, policy brief paper writing and presentation are incredibly helpful in terms of learning each other among classmates and professor's comments.",
    "Strength: wide topics to give students a comprehensive training. Weakness: it only lasts for one semester."

    "International students should take this class, whether or not you have passed the initial language assessment."
