    "The course is a senior requirement so there is no choice; however I did find the course enjoyable. I think it offers a really practical and unique way to get us started on our senior essay writing.",
    "You practice public speaking skills the whole semester. Its kind of boring, but if you listen to each presentation you get to know what your fellow majors are writing about, which is nice.Its helpful to articulate what you want your senior thesis to be about through the presentations in the class -- but make sure you are pacing yourself in your research \/ writing your thesis outside of class. you could technically get through the whole semester without doing any direct thesis work if you dont meet regularly with your advisor and put additional guidelines on yourself outside the guidelines of this course.",
    "As Professor Trumpler taught it, it's mainly about learning how to discuss your essay for different audiences. It won't help you directly with the essay itself (though talking about it and formatting your speech helps you fine-tune some thoughts), which should be happening with your advisor behind the scenes. However, it will give you a lot more confidence about the validity of your work and you as a scholar."
