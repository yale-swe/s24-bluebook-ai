    "MATH 115 is an overview of Integration, Parametric Forms, Polar Forms, and (perhaps the most-stressed of all) (pun intended): Series.The class moves very fast and I would be prepared to study math out-of-class. The weekly homework assignments are not bad, especially with all of the math tutor opportunities that are available, but if you do only the minimum (i.e., the homework problem sets) and do not work through additional problems as practice, the midterms and final will probably go badly and\/or you will be cursing having taken this class by the end of the term.Shop around the T.A.'s and make sure to find one whose teaching style you can appreciate and whose accent you can understand well enough for lessons.That said; Recommended but be aware of what I have just stated.",
    "Math 115 is not meant to be fun. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. That being said, my section wasn't too bad.",
    "This course is tricky. Problem Sets and classes seem pretty easy, but midterms and final are terrible. They test really complex and confusing problems. Plus, many students in the course have already learned most of the material in high school, so the curve tends to be rough.Apoorva is an excellent professor. He really helped me in office hour and via email. He is clear and concise. He is also particularly nice and cheerful.",
    "I would recommend this course to student interested in calculus. It was not too demanding but the tests required a good amount of reviewing.",
    "Math 115 was a very difficult \"intro\" calculus class. I had taken AP Calculus AB in high school and had become fairly confident with the material. Consequently, my original impression of this course was that it would be similar to the Calculus BC course. While the content may be similar, the approach is not. The class is rapid fire to the student's disadvantage. The math itself becomes complex and daunting at times. This challenge is fine but coupled with the fact that the instructors are so immensely comfortable with the material, I feel oftentimes they forget how challenging the concepts can be. The grading in the class can be frustrating as well. Relying on only two midterms, a final, and problem sets is stressful. What's more, the testing is, in my opinion, unfortunate. One can study and know the concepts cold but then get to the exams and still struggle. Calling on a student to show a good grasp of skill in an exam is very reasonable, but the tests unreasonably demand mastery and pesky algebraic re-configuration (the mathematical version of busywork) under the crunch of time and 20% of a final grade. Apoorva is a really good instructor. He knows the mathematics extremely well and often adds his own tried and true tricks to the material. He explains every item logically, thoroughly, and systematically. Be warned, however, that he moves EXTREMELY FAST, many times detrimentally. I can recall times where I literally took time to turn a pageand was lost for the remainder of a calculation. On the whole, though, he is very understanding and kind, dedicated to being available and helping student comprehension, and approachable and easy-going (if not endearingly flustered at times). I would highly recommend him to anyone thinking of taking this course because he does a great job simply put. He makes the best of a flawed course structure. Overall, take this course as a pre-req or pre-med or some other necessity, or perhaps if you really love the type of class I just described. Otherwise, I would steer clear and fill a requirement or math class with another option.",
    "I would only recommend Math 115 to someone for whom the class is a requirement or pre-requisite. If you have already taken BC calculus in high school, do not take this course. You won't learn anything new, and you'll still be confused and overworked."
