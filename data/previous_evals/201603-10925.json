    "Full immersion was effective, but Connect homework was not",
    "Please, for the love of all that is holy, just tell us what a complicated word means in English instead of trying to mime it for five minutes. Immersion learning is only crucial from ages 2-12, after that we learn languages by connecting them to languages we already know. Also, the video final projects didn't really induce learning for the amount of time we spent on them. If we could take those hours and put them into studying for an actual final exam, I am confident that we would all learn more.",
    "The film project at the end was a complete joke. It was difficult enough to make a 5 minute video in German let alone having to find some connection to German culture. The immersion style teaching taught me heaps. But the connect homework was also ridiculous, sometimes I'd spend hours trying to correct an answer that I knew was right but might've been a slightly different word, spelling or even a space in the wrong place."

   "comments": [
    "The structure of the class is very predictable and formulaic, so it's easy to plan and organize for exams and homework assignments. The workload can get heavy, but there is never a time when it seems excessive or unmanageable. I would recommend the class to whoever is interested in learning German. The immersive experience really forces you to practice and memorize a lot of information.",
    "Yes, if the student is interested in learning German",
    "Yes, because you have to take it to get to the higher levels of German."
