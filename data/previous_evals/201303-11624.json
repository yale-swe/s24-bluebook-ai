    "This is a great upper level interdisciplinary course, covering BME, CS and Math. Homeworks are half coding, half sheet problems. Tests are tough but fair, and are both open note. If you're at all interested in image processing or analysis in amy field, this is a must take.",
    "More theory and less actual biomedical application than I would have liked. The class requires a solid knowledge of probability theory, linear algebra, and MATLAB to be successful. The class has about 6 problem sets with about 6 questions and a MATLAB question or two per problem set. Both professors are great guys and are easy to talk to in person and over email."
