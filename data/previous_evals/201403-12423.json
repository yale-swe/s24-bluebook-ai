   "comments": [
    "The class is a lot of work, though probably not dissimilar from other language classes. Hebrew is, admittedly, not the most widely-used language, but the department as a whole is great, and classes are consistently fun and engaging. In this class, like my other Hebrew classes, I came out feeling a strong sense of community with my classmates.",
    "Yes, why would you stop after L2? And overall I would definitely recommend starting Hebrew to someone looking to pick up a new language.",
    "Pretty similar to L2, lot of work and moving quickly but you really learn a lot",
    "I good deal of work, but not as much as L1or2. A great way to continue the language.",
    "The course is fine. It is a lot of material in a short period of time and because it is not every day, you do not learn as much as you did in L1 and L2. The course primarily covers the future tense, which is an important foundation to have for continued study in Hebrew.",
    "The class was very structured, and I felt comfortable with the pace of the class despite not studying Hebrew in a formal setting for over a year. I always knew what was expected of me in terms of each assignment. The class was very laid back and enjoyable since most of the students already knew each other from levels 1 and 2. Overall, this class was a great way to improve every aspect of my Hebrew. Shiri and Yevgeny were both amazing teachers and very easy to communicate with. At times, the class moved a little slowly for my taste, but this was the case only because I had already learned much of the grammar during the summer before last.",
    "i liked the class a lot. i would say that it's not as easy to get an A in L3 than it was in L1 or L2, and there is a similar amount of work, except now it's for 2 days a week rather than 5. my hebrew improved a TON and i am way way more conversational than I was after L2. If you are serious about learning hebrew then this is an amazing class-- you will learn a lot and improve a lot, but it's partly because you're also putting in work. some days the class will feel boring and the work will feel a bit monotonous, but it's worth it if you want to seriously learn hebrew"
