Enjoyed the flipped version of this class.",

He is not only knowledgeable and an expert in the Statistical Sciences but he is highly approachable and makes boring concepts fun. Additionally, being in the flipped version of the class allowed me to spend more time in the classroom asking questions and learning by using minitab.",

I hadn't taken a stats class since I was an undergraduate, and this was a good refresher course that went a bit beyond what I had learned in previous stat courses. I feel like I have a solid enough basis in statistics to understand general stat applications in research."
