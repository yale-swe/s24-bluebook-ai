    "If you're going to do any type of Physics lab work, or take on a Physics or Bio Med major, just work with what you've got and push through. If you are using this as a course to explore the idea of a physics major, or are trying to explore a lab, try 165, or just don't take a lab. I am a humanities major who wanted to learn more about physics, and this was not the way to do so.",
    "This class has the upside of no reports outside of class, and the downside of lasting like 100 hours. I was literally there from 1:30 until 7 most weeks. It was horrible. If for any reason you had to leave on time, you would get points docked from your report. The TFs are notoriously angry and take it out on all of us, but the professors are really great. Just show up and make it through the semester and you'll be fine. It's only 11 weeks, you can do it!",
    "I would definitely not recommend this course. DO NOT take it unless it is a requirement for you. You will hate yourself if you do.",
    "If you have to take it, good luck. If you don't, don't take it.",
    "While the course teaches the basics of the error analysis and use of physical equipment, it is definitely not worth it unless somebody needs this course to fulfill major requirements. There is a lot of work to do both before and during the classes (for only half a credit), which causes a lot of stress and rush that prevents from taking as much from the course. It should also not be taken in the first semester of the freshman year because the theory that underlies experiments is at times quite sophisticated.",
    "This class isn't much work but it's kind of boring and laborious when you're there.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. It literally sucks. You have to write your lab reports in class and you have a laundry list of things to do each class and they never get done (you'll probably get decent grades anyway but still class is miserable). And... yeah it sucks.",
    "A brute force introduction to physics as it corresponds to lab.",
    "Phys 205 is a fine lab course, but don't take it unless you have to. The labs are only scheduled for 3hours, but don't expect to finish in under 3.5 hours and the labs will be the most stressful 3.5 hours of your weeks. The difficulty in the course doesn't come from the difficulty of the subject matter, but rather the difficulty of rushing through the labs as quickly as possible. The redeeming factor of this coure is that the textbook they chose was clear and easy to read\/understand. The main goal of this course is to teach error analysis, so honestly, if that's all you want to know, just read the textbook and you'll be set. The lab will not teach you anything else.",
    "STRESSSS. Be ready to hate lab day.",
    "Ah, 205L. Those four hours (or more) of your life every week that you'll never get back. The good: no outside lab write-ups at all except for four short psets the first four weeks (and weekly short four question quizzes on classesv2) and no overwhelmingly lab techniques. The bad: labs would always take up more than the allotted time (we stayed from 1:30 to 6 once), you can't really adequately get a feel of the lab from the handout, and error propagation is annoying yet always demanded. One of those \"only take it if you must\" classes.",
    "Manageable lab which you will probably only take due to a requirement. Read experiments ahead of time, and if you can, figure out the error analysis and answers to questions beforehand to save time. It usually takes more than three hours, but no out of class lab reports is nice. Also, read the guidelines for grading before the first lab. Most people did poorly on the first grade because we didn't follow the format they want.",
    "Take this only if it is required.",
    "It can be a very stressful lab, but it teaches you useful technical skills with different equipment and you will walk away having learned a lot in the class (whereas PHYS 165L you may walk away not having learned new things). I would recommend it to another student only if they are willing to be pushed for the challenge.",
    "I would not recommend PHYS 205L to anyone unless they needed it for their major. Labs are long and walking up and down Science Hill in the winter is dreadful.",
    "Phys 205L is a good introductory lab, but it has some issues: each lab, including observations and conclusions, must be completed during the short timeslot alloted to the section; and the lab doesn't sync up with any physics course, which results in learning complicated topics like electromagnetism from a lab packet. Since every lab is completed during class, homework is light and the practical exam is fair. I'd recommend this course to physics majors or other students who need experience in a lab setting.",
    "A student should only take PHYS 205L as a requirement, not an actual look into physics and how it works. I did enjoy some of the experiments, but having lab run two hours over and struggling to get the equipment to work every time took away from the experience. Moreover, if I had not taken EENG 200: Introduction to Electronics, the second half of the semester would have been horribly difficult. As with many requirements, if you have to take it. It's more challenging than 165L, but I feel you learn a lot more. The choice between the two is up to you. If you're thinking of taking it to \"explore physics\", don't. The amount of stress this class causes is not worth the half credit.",
    "Only take this class if it is a requirement. The first few weeks are incredibly difficult, especially if you've never done much error analysis before. The class gets easier as time goes on, but is still very stressful, as the lab report needs to be done in class every week, and almost every lab runs way overtime. Depending on whether your TA is nice (mine was), they might deal with overtime labs in different ways, which might be in your favor or against you.",
    "Interesting labs but challenging in time and also if you don't know the material. Would advise someone not to take it unless they have finished an intro physics course.",
    "I found PHYS 205L to be a solid physics lab course. I learned more than I expected to learn based on what Id heard from others who had taken it in the past, which was a pleasant surprise. If youre required to take a physics lab course, Id recommend it.",
    "This is a much less painful lab class than chem, and it takes a ton less time. That said, it is still stressful for the 3 hours (+ prep) that you commit each week.",
    "Basic physics lab where you go through typical experiments such as cart down an inclined plane, vibrations, etc. Towards the end we do some more interesting ones, such as playing with a gyroscope. If you need to take it, take it. Otherwise, the time restraint is unnecessarily stressful.",
    "It's a tough lab that introduces error analysis and the study of physical concepts in a lab setting. Some of the TAs are quite nice, like mine, and there's very little work beyond preparation and some early homeworks, but each lab is very stuffed and pretty tense. The final was also quite tricky. It won't be the most pleasant experience, but lab never is. I'd recommend it if you are genuinely interested in physics or engineering as courses of study, because it does introduce the key concepts and modes of thought in any lab.",
    "These labs are boring, stressful and time constrained for the most part. Most of the lab is fixing problems and trying to complete a 4 to 5 hour lab in 3 hours.",
    "A decent lab. Nobody takes these for fun, but this one is very much a half-credit class. No lab reports, which is a plus.",
    "On the whole, Physics 205L was a good lab. Some of the experiments were pretty cool -- playing with gyroscopes, watching radioactive materials decay, and using oscilloscopes to observe harmonic motion over time. There wasn't too much work outside the lab -- only four homework assignments on error analysis at the beginning of the course and practical exam to study for at the end. But the labs themselves were pretty challenging -- my section frequently stayed 1-2 hours after the lab period ended, just to finish the experiment. And the grading was sometimes harsh, especially given the time constraints. That all being said, Physics 205L was a good experience and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in Physics... especially those who want to see Physics in action."
