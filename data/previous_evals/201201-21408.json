   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, if you have the time to read about 100 pages of German each week. It is difficult in the beginning, but it is really fulfilling when you get faster and better toward the end. Prof. Stoicea was great, and helped us get as much out of each text as we could. You only have to make 2 ten-minute presentations throughout the semester, and this isn't difficult because you're already used to the seminar style of the class. Prof. Stoicea guides you through the 3 short essays and she's very approachable if you want help. The last paper is ten pages, but in English, so it's less gritty than you might imagine. Definitely take it.",
    "It was great. We focused on key themes in the texts and looking at key scenes rather than going through the plot. We developed a vocabulary around these themes. In our papers, we focused on complicating issues that might seem straightforward. We also grew massively in the amount of text we were reading in a week - but you work up to it so its not overwhelming.",
    "Definitely. What a great way to delve into the heart of German literature and thought!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It can of course be a little tough to read so much in German, but at the end of the class your reading comprehension will be a lot better. It's also kind of fun to write about literature in another language. The class size is small (and probably will be next time, too), which is nice because it gives you a chance to practice talking in class.",
    "Take this! It's a great introduction to German prose and a wonderful way to practice your german speaking skills! This was just a great experience."
