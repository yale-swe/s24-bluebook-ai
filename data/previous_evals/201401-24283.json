    "This course was well-constructed, organized and engaging. Professors Chertow and Park made a good team.Some of the guest lectures were very dry and the readings were repetitive. The class periods could have been more engaging if there were activities or simulations (like the negotiation activity early on), rather than reading presentations. It would be more effective to have to apply the articles to a debate\/simulation etc, rather than report back on what they were about.",

    "Jooyoung was extremely well-organized and both her lectures and the course overall were put together very well. This is all the more impressive since this was the first run of the course. Having Marian in the class and her experience and leadership in this field was a huge asset.",
    "I liked sharing the reading discussion responsibilities with other students. It was great to hear their questions and reflections on readings to kick-start discussions.",
    "Besides a very well planned an executed course work, the class included sections with most of the globally re-known practitioners in the discipline.",
    "The term project was valuable and some of the lectures at the very beginning of the semester were fantastic.",
    "The international perspective and carefully selected readings"

   "comments": [
    "The class did have a very academic focus, and it may be more valuable to approach the material from policy and business perspectives as well. If more quantitative analysis and exercises could be incorporated, that may add value.",
    "Time management! There's a lot of information to cram into the class time, and a 3-hour block is pretty brutal. I think breaking up the course time\/meeting to twice per week would help a lot.",
    "The lectures could be more interactive and the assignments more diverse. There would be more accountability if students knew they would need to complete the readings in order to participate in the class activities.",
    "1.) more simulation\/programming related addition (doesn't have to be within the class but some relevant information will be helpful); 2.) start to encourage people think about the final projects earlier during the semester."

He did not begin writing the paper until around 10PM the night before it was due. I had urged him since about a week ahead (with an outline) to prepare a draft of his parts, but he did not. I had to stay up with him for 12 hours straight to force him to finishwriting the paper as he kept dozing off all evening, which was a terrible experience for me (considering I finished my part ahead of time...). I was very unhappy with the final quality of the paper due to his lack of time management\/willingness to prioritize this assignment. I believe I would have been better off writing the paper on my own."
