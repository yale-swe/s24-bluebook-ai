    "I gained a lot of skill in formulating and writing argumentative pieces. I also learned about the history and contemporary debates of free speech, sedition, and dissent.",
    "This class focused a lot on the basic principles of writing: organization, refining claims and sub-claims, improving the narrative structure of each essay, etc. But the class was wonderful because it also introduced us to Butler, Foucault, Milton, and other scholars' theories about speech and the power of speech to maim or nurture. In that regard, the class also concentrated on teaching students how to analyze current and historical events about sedition and dissent and how to incorporate philosophical concepts about speech to bolster a claim.",
    "Of course, as this was a writing class, I learned the basic skills to write a satisfactory college essay of varying lengths. Unlike many of my previous english classes which focused on grammar, mechanics, and 'research,' I learned how to write in a narrative structure where each paragraph was its own miniature arc. I also learned another important skill which had little of before this year--close reading."

   "comments": [
    "I benefited from the class discussions. It helped me a lot that we turned in rough drafts and received feedback before submitting a final version of each paper. My one complaint is that often papers were graded long after they were submitted; I would prefer to be able to see feedback and my grade while the assignment is still fresh in my mind.",
    "The professor brought intriguing insights into the classroom discussion every day. Discussion time was always productive. But I do feel that more time could have been devoted to directly tying the analysis of the assigned readings in with our own writing.",
    "Readings and discussions were interesting. Grading was clear",
    "This was the first writing class I took at Yale, but I loved how this English course concurrently taught the principles of writing and some introductory legal ideas about freedom of speech. Class discussions were wonderful; they really added substance to the readings. Depending on the reading, the discussions could get a little dry, but I think that Professor Ranks does a pretty good job in moderating the discussion so that it doesn't completely become tepid.",
    "Pros: Learned to write much better essay. Great class workshops. Taught essential skills of close reading. Great class discussions (however biased they were). Cons: Not enough outside engagement with the professor and feedback was limited. The two books I bought were almost entirely unnecessary."

    "I would not recommend this course to any student. While the subject matter was interesting, I do not feel like I came away from this course any better a writer than I was to begin with, an opinion my other classmates concur with. Unhelpful jargon was thrown around and feedback was, while very extensive, vague and unhelpful. the timeline of grading too was disappointing. Papers submitted before Thanksgiving break were not evaluated even by last day of classes. Grades will only be posted online and no feedback is forthcoming. Feedback, which would and should have been helpful for the subsequent writing to be submitted, which was written without any feedback whatsoever. This class was disappointing and a waste of a semester, and I wouldn't suggest anyone take it.",
    "Yes. I feel like my writing has improved significantly due to this course, and so has my knowledge of free speech issues.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to strengthen their writing skills.",
    "The insights a student will gain surrounding the topic of sedition and dissent are pertinent to the challenges and controversies off our time. New developments in writing and critical reading abilities of the student will take place.",
    "Yes, its a great course to introduce freshmen to writing at Yale.",
    "Definitely. This ended up being my favorite course of the semester, mostly because I can clearly see how much more sophisticated and nuanced by writing has become since taking this course. Professor Ranks does a great job of guiding students so that their writing is more expressive and clear, and I think that the skills developed in this class will definitely be helpful in later Yale courses and beyond. It's a really good course if you're interested in law or in history, but even as a STEM major, the topics discussed are still very pertinent to current events and are fascinating to consider. Just FYI, Professor Ranks grades somewhat harshly on the first essay, but go to her office hours (she gives nicely focused feedback) and use the writing center and you'll end up doing fine.",
    "Only if you feel your writing skills are prepared for college."
