   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you're looking for a broad intro on China.",
    "Extremely repetitive.",
    "Not a ton of work and an interesting class",
    "Yes!",
    "Good course, though repetitive.",
    "Can be repetitive at times, but on the whole, a very solid course. This is an exciting time for China, and it was great to see the class' lectures dovetail with events going on real-time in China.",
    "Yes, take it",
    "It was a good review of the Chinese - good if you don't know anything about it. Pretty repetitive. Roach is a leader in the field.",
    "Great class if you want a very macro overview of China's economic history and current situation.",
    "yeah, AWESOME econ elective",
    "As far as econ lectures go, it's definitely one of the better ones. The material in the beginning and end are fantastic, but the stuff in the middle gets a little repetitive. Not too much work -- no psets, 1 midterm, 1 take home final, 1 10-15 page paper",
    "This may be repetitive, but this class can get repetitive. At times, I felt like Professor Roach was stretching in his assertions regarding China's development. You definitely get as much out of the class as you put in. The readings are well selected, and if you do the readings, you will emerge with a great understanding of specific issues that China faces, from its pension program to environmental worries. The class is very thematic and really emphasizes empirical evidence. The work is manageable too, but I would say the final paper is actually rather hard to write. I spent a lot of time finding a suitable topic, because I think it's neigh impossible to ask an undergraduate to write a 10 page paper on highly technical issues that have data, like intellectual property law or banking sector reform. Overall, the class presented a great overview of the Chinese economy, and I definitely learned a great deal.",
    "If you want an easy class, then take this one!",
    "This class is a good intro to China. Sometimes it can feel a bit rudimentary but I think Professor Roach is truly an expert on the subject and it is very interesting to hear about his unusually positive forecast for China.",
    "consumer-led growthinfographicsbuzzwordsNext Chinagrowth imperativesgrowthgrowthtertiary sectormore buzzwords",
    "This class provides a pretty thorough assessment of the Chinese economy, especially for those who don't know much about China, like myself. I would say I learned a lot.It's a straightforward class, you don't have to do the readings, and assessments are not hard. There was one midterm where you could have 5 pages of notes, one 10-15 page paper and a take-home final. The timing of these was not great, though, as the biggest assignments (paper and take-home) were left for reading week\/finals, which was kind of irritating. Also, Roach was so so repetitive, it could get boring - he would basically reiterate the same five points in every lecture, with some variation in graphs and data. On the other hand, this made the content on the exams pretty predictable. Aside from that, Roach is a cool guy and actually really funny. I'd recommend the class, especially if you have some background in macro, because it's pretty stress-free and a low-workload. Also a great class to take Credit\/D.",
    "Easy Econ course. Just an open-notes midterm, a paper proposal, a final paper, and a take-home.",
    "interesting topic, feels like you take the same 6 week class twice",
    "As China is a huge impact on the world economy, it is important to know China's economy.",
    "Next China is agreat class that increases your understanding about the topic immensely. The class is what you make of it. I know people who barely went to class and still did fine on the assignments and others who attended every lecture to get a better appreciation of the subject from an expert like Roach. I would recommend doing the latter because Roach is a character in class, and his slides are well organized and great. The reading load seems daunting, but you can easily get by with only doing one of the more important readings for each lecture. The workload otherwise is extremely manageable (straightforward midterm and take-home final with a final paper mixed in as well). Take the class if you want to learn more about the nuances of China's economy and understand how large amounts of macroeconomic data can be used to glean insight about an economy.",
    "Definitely take it! You'll learn a lot about China qualitatively and there's not a lot of work either. No numerical stuff at all. A midterm, research paper and take home final so very manageable.",
    "Very insightful class on China. Definitely recommend",
    "Yes, it's a good class that will teach a lot about a very important country.",
    "A little repetitive, pretty straightforward. You'll learn a lot about China but it'll start to sound the same after a while. Roach is nice, not the most interesting professor. Very knowledgeable and totally a badass, but as a teacher, eh.Class consists of midterm, and then the final is take-home and there's a pretty long term paper on literally any topic you want. But basically 60% of your grade is in the last week of the class, so basically none of us have any idea how we did. Should be fine though. Huge lecture.",
    "Very interesting class, though it gets a little repetitive.Professor Roach is great, and obviously has a lot of expertise on the matter.Grading's a little strange for this class. 60% of my grade will be based on work I turned over the past five days, so no idea how I will do in the class. Midterm was fair.",
    "It is a great econ class. take it.",
    "Loved this class. Definitely would recommend it if you're interested in economics or in understanding current global events. Workload is fine and the final is a take-home which is nice.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes!",
    "Good if you're an econ major looking for a class with not too much work.",
    "Great class about China over the past 30 years and it's future. Stephen Roach is one of the world's foremost experts on the China and he brings a wealth of experience from serving as the Head of Morgan Stanley in China. The topics were very relevant and interesting, especially if you are interested at all in China. The workload is very manageable (midterm, paper, final) and it is all essay based. I would definitely recommend this course, even to non-econ majors, as it is very easy to pick up the material. Professor Roach was fantastic and his knowledge about China was remarkable. His lectures were very clear, precise, and easy to understand. While he knows so much, he presents everything on a level that undergraduates can easily understand. Furthermore, he is also very easygoing and approachable.",
    "Yes...you learn a lot",
    "Its a survey of globally relevant economic issues",
    "The Next China was really just Roach's opinion of China's development, which isn't bad. It was a really interesting, though narrow perspective of China's development. I think it could be improved by bringing in guest lecturers that offered a different perspective to the debate.",
    "If you're an Econ major, you have to take this.",
    "I think it's a very interesting and relevant course. I particularly enjoyed it because you not only learn about where China came from and its economic\/social\/political history, but you also learn about where it is now and where it is expecting to go in the future. I would definitely recommend it to another student. It's also a manageable workload so you can actually enjoy learning!",
    "Very boring and aimless and repetitive.",
    "Absolutely recommend if interest in China + Economy. I took this as non-econ major, so a bit of a steeper learning curve, but in the end, there are some take home points that I am glad that I learned.",
    "Sure, I'd recommend it. Grading was a 20% midterm, 10% section, 10% paper proposal, 30% paper (10-15 pgs), 30% take-home final. Not bad.You dont' have to do all the readings; just make sure you understand the general important topics: Economic Imbalances, Transformation from Manufacturing to Service Economy, Devalued Currency, Role of Internet, Role of Environment, Rural\/Urban divide, etc and you'll be fine. Worse comes to worst, google Prof Roach and read some of his articles.",
    "This class gives you a very good overview of China today - from an economic, political, and social point of view. Professor Roach is an expert on China and you're certainly going to learn a lot with him. The only negative thing about the class is that it could sometimes get repetitive. The readings look overwhelming but you'll soon realize that you don't have to complete them to do well in class (and you'll also realize that very few people actually do them). Apart from the readings, the workload is definitely manageable. In short, if you're interested in China at all, take this class.",
    "I would recommend the lecture if the topic interests you. The reading is a lot and sometimes it is hard to see the connection between the readings and the topics in the class.",
    "This class was very interesting and at the same time not too difficult. That being said, there is a lot of material but all of it is worth learning about since China is very important and is going to continue to be very important. Good class to take. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Do not take this class. I learned very little.",
    "This class was a pretty straightforward. Roach is a nice teacher, a little dry. I thought the course was just ok, nothing too inspiring but also not too hard. You begin to understand the main themes of China's economy (which are repeated over and over again...) but not very much in depth.",
    "Easy course. Roach repeats himself a lot but you come away with a pretty good understanding of what China is all about. Take this course.",
    "Yes! Easy econ credit thats interesting",
    "Relatively easy economics credit that is on an important topic in today's global-economic climate. Definitely will start to feel very repetitive by the end, but relevant nonetheless.",
    "If you're interested in China, or the relationship between China and the United States, I would recommend this course. If not, you will probably not want to take this course. Though it is pretty easy. Readings are \"required\" (not required), and you only have to do an essay. The midterm and final are pretty easy. If you're looking for a gut, this is a good class.",
    "Take it! It's an easy econ, but one that will be really informative and interesting if you have any interest in China. I feel like I know so much more about the world economic situation after taking this class, and it was definitely my favorite of my courses this semester.",
    "Pretty laid back class. Some of the topics are very interesting, but the course gets repetitive over the course of the semester. Not much work though.",
    "This is the first economics class I took that explored the field in such an applied and relevant setting, and its intersection with the real world is compelling and interesting. I learned more about economy, politics, and societal structure of my nation of birth this semester than I have collectively in all the years of my life. I can't say that China's current account surplus or RMB appreciation had me at the edge of my seat, but the class covered a number of topics that provoked thought: urbanization, consumption, migrant workers, the hukou system, how China developed into the nation it is today, and how China must rebalance to move forward. Professor Roach may be a tad dry and more than a tad repetitive, but he really is a leading expert on the Chinese economy and has many insights to share with the class. But beyond lecture itself, I think what really made this class a great experience was my section. Chloe (Duo) Xu, my section leader, is a Beijing native and often wove her insider's perspective of the issues China is facing into discussions, adding a fresh and insightful dimension to the subject at hand.",
    "The Next China is an overview of the Chinese economy post-cultural revolution, and a blueprint for its future, both in the short term (3-5 years), and long term (10-20 years). I would recommend the course to another student.",
    "Yes, definitely. I really enjoyed this class. Roach isn't the most dynamic lecturer, but he's organized, efficient, and actually very witty. You end up learning a lot about the Chinese economy, and the workload is very manageable.",
    "I would recommend this course because it has a great current events element to it.",
    "It's definitely a pretty relaxed class, if you have a busy schedule, you can count on not having to do all the reading for this class. It gets a bit busy at the end with a ten page paper and then a bit less than a ten page final, but throughout the semester, it is very relaxed. Also, IF YOU ATTEND ALL THE LECTURES, Professor Roach reviews the same ideas so many times (but in a way that is not as boring as it sounds) that you will basically not have to review for the tests at all, because the theses will be ingrained in your mind. If you skip, however, you'd better do the reading and go over the slides.My only qualm is how redundant and shallow it was. I prefer more rigorous examinations of policy issues, whereas Professor Roach's approach was mostly just summarizing statistics to prove a certain point about a certain issue.",
    "Very interesting but repetitive material. The material could be really helpful for those interested in working in finance. I reached a much greater understanding of the Chinese economy while putting in relatively minimal work. Probably the highest ratio of important stuff learned to homework of any class I've taken at Yale.",
    "If you're interested in China and macro, definitely take it. Professor Roach is a great lecturer and definitely funnier than you'd expect! Readings are pretty much totally optional, except it's helpful to read some chapters of The Next Asia (a book by Roach himself). I learned a ton, though it was a bit repetitive after a while.",
    "Although The Next China is not an amazing course, it is still a very interesting class if you want to have a broad view on China's future (political, economic, and social). Take it if you're not an expert on China and have time to read (the amount of readings is ridiculously large). Professor Roach is quite an expert on the topic and is very well connected in China, which also makes the course interesting (plus he's quite funny). The Next China does not have other homework apart from the readings, and the exams are not too difficult. Be prepared at the end of the semester though, as the final paper takes a lot of time and the final exam (take home) comes right after the final paper.",
    "This course is an interesting survey on the state of the Chinese economy. Lectures with Professor Roach are of high quality, though the course material may start to get repetitive towards the end of the semester. The readings are meant as a supplement, which means you can skim them, and with the exception of a final paper and a final exam at the end of the course, there isn't too much work otherwise. If you are interested in Chinese economic development, definitely take this class!",
    "Definitely take the class. You learn a lot about China and its not too much work. I learned a great deal about China, and did well in the midterm.you don't have to do all the readings, you are allowed a cheat sheet in the midterm, the final is take home and you can pretty much do whatever you want with the paper.Although your grade entirely depends on your TA. 10% class participation, 40% paper and 30% take home final are graded by your TA. So choose your TA wisely!",
    "Yes, great class",
    "Take this class if you think China will play a large role in your future.",
    "This is a really engaging Economics course, and the first that I have taken where I feel I learned something about the real world. I was able to apply my macroeconomics knowledge to this course. Definitely a course to take as an Economics student or merely interested in China.",
    "This is a worthwhile class if you want to learn more about the Chinese economy. There is a lot of reading throughout the semester, but overall the workload isn't too bad through most of the semester. However, the workload really ramps up at the end when both the paper and the take home final are due.",
    "Econ 338 is a survey and current events course of Chinese economic policies and reforms. I would recommend it any student who is interested in China or in Asia.",
    "Great course - definitely learnt a lot about China from a variety of perspectives. Material might seem a little repetitive, but looking back, that's what made me learn the material so well. Keep in mind that there's a paper and a take home final at the end.",
    "If you are truly interested in the content, you won't be disappointed. That said, Professor Roach can come off as a bit stale as a lecturer. The course material is very pertinent with a decent workload. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in China's (and Asia's) economic development.",
    "Yes, easy going econ class",
    "It's a bit dry, and basically what you learn from the course is that China's current economic model is unsustainable (which you probably already can guess).",
    "A fair class - very informative and not as repetitive as you might think. I come from China myself and feel like I've learned quite a bit. Discussion sections can be organized better.",
    "Sure if interested in china",
    "recommended",
    "I would recommend it. It's pretty interesting, and not too intense economically. It sort of a course based on history, current events, and economics all together. It's a pretty interesting combination of the three.",
    "A good, easy, but still informative class. Definitely take this. It's chill but you do gain some good perspective not only on China's economy (and culture!) but also on how to analyze a nation at large. Makes for a good 5th class.",
    "This course provides a good introduction to the Chinese economy, with a focus on future developments. I would recommend it to students interested in China, the economy, or business. You don't need to be too good at econ to get it, but a basic understanding of macro would certainly come in handy.",
    "History of China's economy really since 1949 and the rise of the PRC.",
    "A good introduction to China and the Chinese economy. After taking this course you will have a good idea of where China is at, and be inposition to ask further questions. Lectures are good, but can be repetitive at times.",
    "No: Class was great actually, but section was the worst of my time at Yale so far. When we asked our section leader what time the paper was due (midnight or 5pm) he got angry and told us not to ask him details of the course...he knew no more than we did about the Next China.If they improve section, then take it. Otherwise, the class is to frustrating.",
    "Professor Roach ties in everything together very nicely. If you want to understand in one semester what sort of events have led up to modern china and what sort of forward-thinking analysis has been done, definitely take this class. Professor Roach is great - I took his Japan seminar, and decided to take this lecture with him.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in China and economics whatsoever. The best Econ. class I have taken.",
    "Take it.",
    "It's an easy economics credit, and Roach is a good lecturer. Take it, but don't expect to learn anything new after the first month. If you've heard any of Roach's lecturers or seminars before on the Chinese economy (or read his book), think that, but repeated for 15 weeks.",
    "Great class, but material gets repetitive. If you already have a firm understanding of the Chinese economy and it's future, this is definitely not right for you. If you know nothing about China though, there's probably no better person to learn the basics from than Prof. Roach.",
    "This class is a great survey course on the Chinese economic transition. The class has a pretty light workload. Beware, however, of the paper plus take home final during reading week!",
    "Pretty standard econ class. Roach is cool though",
    "As has been said (I'm sure), the topics seem to get repetitive in the second half of the class, but this means that you really learn and remember what the issues surrounding China's transition models are. You don't need to do the readings at all, but they are very interesting and really complement the class.",
    "A good course, but the lectures began to get very repetitive.",
    "Good class for anyone interested in East Asian economic conditions!",
    "It's a good class to take if you're interested in China or the global macroeconomy. It is a refreshing change from the theory of micro or macro, and it really brings economics to life.",
    "Took the course Credit\/D which was nice but I didn't feel like it was necessary honestly. Missed a few classes, but Roach tends to repeat himself a lot and the slides and reading are all easily accessed through classesv2. Take home final was pretty simple as a result considering it's all there on classes and you're just echoing Roach's ideas. These are all conveniently found in the relatively short editorials he writes for newspapers and websites (also on classes). I enjoyed writing the final essay and found this to be the best part of the class.",
    "Absolutely take this class! It provides a good breakdown on the hot topic of China. The workload is light throughout most of the class. It does get bunched at the end with the final paper, and take home final, and depending on when your presentations for section are scheduled, those can get put on at the end also. Nevertheless, it really provides useful knowledge and allows you to get what you want out of the class. There are a lot of readings, and they are very informative and helpful; however, they are not necessary. You will learn a lot if you do them, but when other classes are heavy, you won't suffer for not doing them. Professor Roach is very knowledgeable. He certainly has his opinions and views on how China shouldprogress, but he is a great professor and has incredible experiences to share."
