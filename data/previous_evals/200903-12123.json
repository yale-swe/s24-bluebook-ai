    "Good class if you want a general survey of the World History from 1800 onwards.",
    "It's a relatively light course. The readings are a lot, but you don't have to do all of them to do well in the class. The movies are really interesting, and the Sunday screening really isn't as big a deal as it might seem. Prof. Kalyvas is an amazing teacher, and makes classes really interesting. Definitely a must-take. If you know about the cold war period and the revolutions in Europe and Socialism\/Marxist theories, the content part of it is really easy. Even if you don't, you get to learn.",
    "good classindifferent about recommending it",
    "This is a political history class in which you watch movies. I have enjoyed it though and feel like I've learnt about some political philosophies in which I wasn't very knowledgeable of. It depends on what movies you watch, if you enjoy the movies you'll enjoy the class. The professor is kind of dry and not the best but I don't regret taking the class at all.",
    "Good class, interesting material. Liked the choice of movies. However, while the title may make it seem like an easy class, it definitely has a lot of substance.",
    "A strong course, though it seemed to be predominantly a political science\/history course that relied on film as an illustrative medium rather than a course that dealt with politics and film as if they were coequal. Also, more interesting than enlightening or groundbreaking. Still, a very good way to acquaint oneself with the dominant historical narrative of the political economy of the 20th Century, while watching a panoply of excellent films in the process. That said, the readings seem almost entirely disconnected from the bulk of the class, and the midterm and final were not at all of equivalent difficulty (midterm was an easy in-class exam, final was a more in-depth take-home paper.)",
    "Yes. I would recommend it more to PLSC student than to a film student. The film functions more as a jumping board for the in-depth discussion of politics. The films themselves, their art, directors' visions, were not stressed enough.",
    "This class is a class on modern political history that emphasizes certain eras with film. I would definitely recommend it unless you are very knowledgeable on 20th century political history, and then I would recommend taking another class with Professor Kalyvas. In my case, it was a great way to reinforce what I already knew and to teach me about a few different regions from Europe and the US what we always study.",
    "Yes. Great course, interesting films and lectures.",
    "Very good and ambitious class. Prepare to have a lot of information thrown at you, but luckily, you get to watch films and get to interpret this information (most of which you might already know) from new angles and perspectives. Would definitely recommend the course if you want to connect all the dots of 20th century history that you've learned. It's a class with broad themes and a broad focus.",
    "The class is more of a history course than a politics course much of the time, and does not really go in depth into the film aspect of the course--the films are mostly just a jumping off point for Kalyvas to review a particular period of history and the political movements within it. Nevertheless, it is an interesting course, and I would recommend it if you want to watch some good films and get a survey of some of the political movements leading up to the modern age.",
    "It's a fun class and you get to watch a lot of cool movies. The work isn't too demanding but you should already have a good grasp of 20th century world history.",
    "Yes I'd definitely recommend it; although it's very light on fil, theory\/history, so if that's what you're looking for, this might not be the class for you. This is much more about using the films to explore historical events and political theories.",
    "definitely take it!!!!",
    "This was a great, fun, easy course right up until the end (you watch one film a week almost all of which are awesome, the reading is unnecessary and the midterm is extremely easy, and you actually do get a decent sense of 20th century world history). However, BEWARE that the \"take home final exam\" was actually a term paper! Even though we asked for details about it starting from the first lecture, we received none until the final class, when he handed out the assignment: a 10-15 page paper incorporating outside sources, all on a single question. This was intensely frustrating for me since I already had a ridiculous number of term papers to write for seminars and was counting on this lecture course to help balance that out. I'd still say great course, and the paper wasn't hard, but you should be aware going in that the \"take home exam\" might be a surprise term paper."
