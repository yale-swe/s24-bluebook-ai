    "This is a great course with a great professor -- getting to work with Professor Andrew in a small seminar setting was a weekly pleasure. It challenged my preconceptions about adaptation and presented new structures for interpreting them. I would gladly take any course offered by Professor Andrew -- he has strong opinions which he is eager to discuss and explore.",
    "Absolutely take this course. The small seminar environment with Professor Andrew is phenomenal and the films\/texts are arresting and thought-provoking. You will never have an opportunity like this again.",
    "I loved this course: a small seminar (7 students when I took it) with a focus on questions of film adaptations from literature. The curriculum was ostensibly split -- the first half of the semester would cover adaptation theory and the issue of \"fidelity,\" particularly in relation to the French tradition of adaptation, and then the second half would cover adaptation in practice, with an emphasis on contemporary American films. In reality, though, the structure of the course was more organic, and class discussions were wide-ranging, addressing both the source texts and the films themselves. I would absolutely recommend the course if you're interested in the subject matter--Dudley Andrew is wonderful and extremely knowledgeable, the workload isn't too intense (weekly readings and a few papers, plus a screening each week), and the material is fascinating."
