   "comments": [
    "Its a great class! Take it! Much better than theundergrad version!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It provided a lot of great background material on a wide variety of subjects. This information will be directly applicable to my studies in the lab and for my qualifying exam.",
    "Yes i would - it's interesting and the material varies enough that everyone can find something interesting.",
    "Introduction to cell bio from a biomedical perspective.",
    "A comprehensive overview of specific topics in cell biology with individual professors lecturing each week on a specialized topic. Topics included nuclear organization, vesicle trafficking, and cell division. Quality of lectures varies based on who's giving the lecture and how clearly they're able to explain concepts. Contains three paper discussions which also vary based on who's leading them.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. It gave us a lot of information about cell biology from a lot of different professors without being too difficult or requiring too much work on our part. The assignments were fair and fairly spaced.",
    "This course is a good introductory, survey course covering the basics and delving deeper into the research specialties of each professor teaching us more about the current state of the field. I would strongly recommend this course to someone who has not taken or does not have a strong background in cell biology. I may not recommend it as strongly for someone who has a strong biology background as it might be a larger portion review, other than the research specialties of the professors.",
    "I highly recommend the course.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking for an introductory course in cellular processes. This course provides a very good place to cover material that is important to many biological research questions.",
    "Yes, it covered a lot of material and gave students a good idea of where the field is headed.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it, and tell them that they will learn a lot of new information about cell biology experimental methods and knowledge.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I would describe itas a course that builds on numerous basic concepts of cell biology.",
    "Its a crash course covering current knowledge in all cellular processes. I would recommend taking it with 603.",
    "It is a broad course that covers a lot of topics in cell biology. I would recommend it only if that particular student is very interested in topics in cell biology and learning basic cell biology information, but not if they are interested in learning techniques or applications of information learned.",
    "Yes, if you have never taken cell biology",
    "Yes",
    "This course was very comprehensive and I would definitely recommend to another student.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student as a good foundational course in molecular biology.",
    "Recommend!Really a great course! So much to learn and understand, very helpful in research and understanding literature.",
    "While I completely agree with the goals of the course, I don't feel that I got very much out of it."

   "comments": [
    "I did not take a specific cell biology course during my undergraduate studies, so this course was a life-saver as a way to catch me up to other graduate students. Although each topic was not necessarily directly relevant to my research, several were and the others were still good to know.",
    "I learned more about cells in this course, which might be helpful in my research",
    "significantly, greatly",
    "For those lecturers who presented information clearly my appreciation of the depth and complexity of interactions between cellular processes, organization of the cell, and complexity of regulation of all biological processes were increased substantially. I feel my basic understanding of eukaryotic cell biology has increased.",
    "I feel like this contributed to my knowledge of cell biology on some fronts but not on others. I think part of the reason for this is because we all come from different backgrounds; there were things that I knew very well already that I'd covered more in-depth in my undergrad career than we covered here, while my friends hadn't had much experience with them before, or vice-versa. I think as a whole most people (if not everyone) is going to learn a fair amount of new things while covering some things that they were already familiar with; however, the new things more than make up for the review.",
    "This significantly deepened my knowledge of cell biology, but as I do not expect to join a cell biology lab, it may not as be as relevant to my dissertation or research as I expected.",
    "I believe that my new knowledge about where the different sub-fields of cell biology stand and what questions are currently being asked will help me tremendously throughout my time at Yale and beyond.",
    "This course was a good overview of a wide range of content. I have a greater understanding of the molecular processes in the cell, and this course was an excellent addition to the biochemistry and molecular biology courses I took as an undergrad.",
    "It was my first cell biology class and sometimes, I would have wished for a little more basic introduction of principles, but I'm aware that it is a graduate level class and I think the level was appropriate.",
    "Expanded my knowledge of cell biology, since my main training was biochem\/biophysics.",
    "I learned more about my area of research interest, the early secretory pathway, and SNAREs and vesicle fusion, which I did not know much about before this class. This information will help me in my thesis lab.",
    "It helped me pinpoint areas of cell\/molecular biology that I am interested in and gave me a good foundation of knowledge that will serve me well in any lab I join.",
    "I know I really like cellular movement now. I didn't know that when I started graduate school.",
    "Not at all",
    "The course helped give me an understanding of key aspects of molecular biology that will aid me in future research endeavors.",
    "The course helps me understand different topics in cell biology, gives great details in understanding specific topics. And several lectures help elucidate how to develop questions and conduct research."
