    "If you want to learn German, definitely take L1\/L2. You'll be more fluent than you expect to be after a year. Good teachers are a must, so ask around. Workload is very chill, though the video projects at the end of each semester can be time-consuming if you procrastinate them. I can't speak to the intensive track's pace compared to this one, but rest assured that L1\/L2 is a very manageable pace.",
    "Yes. It's a good class. Although at this stage, I think it would be better if I just did German reading instead of speaking and listening.",
    "From what I know, in comparison with other languages, the German intro classes are quite fun while striking a good balance between tough and manageable, so you are always motivated to learn more. Do take this class if you are interested in learning German!",
    "Take it if you are interested and want to fulfill your language requirement. It was a little demanding to do just for fun."
