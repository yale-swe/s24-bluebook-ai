    "Great class, a lot of writing, but next year there may be a bit less. Attendance at lecture decreased over the course of the semester, but Professor Blattman really does a good job covering the topics and the guest speakers are for the most part great. All essay fro your grade (specfically 7-11 short 2 page papers and 22 longer 10-12 book reviews this semester). Attendance in section is also necessary (20% of grade for participation in section).",
    "This class looks at different theories behind the causes of African poverty and solutions to reduce it. Although macroeconomics is not a prerequisite, I would recommend it. Having taken macro already, I felt it would have been difficult to understand some of the economic models discussed without a background in econ. However, it would certainly be possible to take the class without this prereq.The class is a lot of work, so I wouldn't recommend it if you're not genuinely interested in international development, Africa, or western aid. If you are interested in these topics though, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this class. You will learn a lot and come away from it with a greater knowledge of the discipline and with significantly improved writing skills, particularly in analyzing and critiquing the theories of development and aid we will be reading. The readings are great at combining theoretical and empirical studies.",
    "This course is an introduction to the debate surrounding international aid to Africa. It is a lecture-based course, though attendance in lecture is sparse. The exercise of writing a two-page paper each week most certainly improved my writing skills and understanding of the material. The two longer papers, both book reports, were manageable but certainly less inspiring. This course, as a WR, does have a good deal of writing, but if you get the good TA, it's a good experience.",
    "There's a lot of weekly reading, but it's manageable once you figure out how much you actually need to do in order to write an effective reading response. Overall the class is pretty easy, and the papers are conveniently spaced so that they don't usually conflict with the crunch times for other classes.",
    "Definitely take the class, but be prepared to work hard",
    "This is an excellent and interesting class - as long as you know what you are getting into. The readings are long and sometimes very dense. If you're like me and can't hammer out two pages very quickly, the weekly responses are pretty draining by the end of the semester. The book reviews are tough. But if you are interested in the material, it is a great class. The topics and readings are interesting. Because you have to write about them, you really get a sense that you leave each week knowing all sides of the issue. I left the course feeling very well-informed about the theories behind Africa's poverty and the attempts to end it. So if you're ready for a challenge, definitely take this course.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to all Yale students regardless of their major or interests.",
    "No. This is a very interesting topic, and I'm glad that I learned all of this stuff. But there is a lot of work, and it is tedious. The reading responses are hell, and you can only write about a very narrow range of things. Some of the readings are incredibly boring macroecon stuff. I'm glad I took it, but not glad when I was actually taking it.",
    "As an intro course, absolutely. Interesting material, broad enough to cover just about anything related to the topic.",
    "It's pretty straightforward, in terms of having a ton of writing (reading responses every week), but a lot depends on your TA, because they come from African Studies\/International Studies\/Poli Sci, etc., and basically run the class for you other than lecture. Fantastic for a background of the subject matter, and a decent writing credit if you're looking for one.",
    "African Poverty and Western Aid will tackle your misconceptions about development and most likely replace them with cutting edge ideas by providing you a range of opinions.I would highly recommend to students interested in development, African history, and critical writing.",
    "Great class - covers tons of material from an economic perspective. Section leaders, at least this year, were AWESOME (both the ones I went to were among the best section leaders I ever had). Material is interesting. Tons of reading, and INCREDIBLY tough grading - the focus on writing style above everything might have been useful if I wanted to write PoliSci papers for the rest of my life. Blattman is a really cool guy, and the guest lectures were pretty good by guest lecture standards.",
    "I would say that it's a very interesting intro course in development economics and policy, but that it's a whole lot of reading and writing. The workload should be taken into account when choosing this course. Otherwise, very interesting. A good class for anyone remotely interested in the subject.",
    "Yes, I got a lot out of it and really enjoyed it. I would recommend it to someone willing to put in the time to do the reading and writing, because the WR makes it more time consuming than most courses.",
    "African Poverty and Western Aid is an awesome class! Be prepared for 150-200 pgs of reading a week along with weekly essays. Even though the work was often daunting, the class was one of the best I have taken at Yale and very applicable to real life, current day struggles of development in Africa. If you are interested in African development, politics, and economics, take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend African Poverty and Western Aid for any students interested in the subject matter discussed in the title of the course. It definitely furthers your understanding of the issues in the field and provides a very nice reading list. Professor Blattman is also a great resource. I think the writing component of the class is less helpful.",
    "This class consists of 2 weekly lectures and 1 section with a heavy volume of reading for homework. The lectures closely mirror the readings. The readings are interesting, but at times they can be difficult to get through for their sheer volume. Each week you write a 2 pg essay critiquing the week's readings. I would recommend this class to someone who enjoys the field, isn't afraid of a lot of reading, and wants to improve his\/her poli sci writing abilities.",
    "I would only recommend this course as a Cr\/D\/Fail course because of the grading structure. The curve makes it very difficult to write strong essays if you aren't used to writing political science papers.",
    "Take it if you can handle the work.",
    "This is a introductory course to international development in Africa which covers different theories as to how and why Africa has developed (or failed to develop).",
    "If interested in foreign aid, I don't know what you are waiting for!",
    "Weaknesses: The lectures were not mandatory, which was just silly. The grading was equally silly. The TAs could only give \"A\"s to a certain percentage of each section, same with \"B\"s, etc., which essentially means that if you are placed in a really smart section, your grade is curved downward in comparison to that of a student in a \"less smart\" section. You're also competing against each other to get a good participation grade (since only a few high grades are doled out per section, as well) which creates a suboptimal learning environment. Way too much writing, with very little feedback. If I thought that simply writing, writing, writing would improve my skills, I could do that by myself. There was so little criticism of my style that I can't say I learned very much. If you just read the books, you don't really need to take this class.Strengths: The material is interesting, but you don't have to take the class to read the material. I learned to write simply and concisely, but that pretty much meant that I stopped doing all of the readings and kind-of \"underachieved\" in order to receive higher marks, which was frustrating. It was helpful to learn how to critique established writers, but I'm not sure if that is a very difficult skill to acquire.I would not recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the class for an interesting introduction to the problems facing Africa.",
    "I would definitely take African Poverty and Western Aid. By far the best class I've taken at Yale. it is both tangible information and a practicle way to learn how to write. Just a wonderful class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to anyone interested in African development or development\/economic growth in general because the scope of the class is very broad and gives a great introduction or addition to the subject.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in economics or Africa. The weekly writing assignments are certainly time consuming, since all or most readings must be read and then critiqued. However, in terms of information and facts, I feel as though I learned a lot more in this class than many other classes at Yale.",
    "This course is an overview of arguments and theories about African development. It is a great introduction to the literature of development. The way in which the course is structured (weekly assignments forcing you to critique the readings and theories in them) really encourage unique thinking. I could recommend this class to any student at Yale, even one not necessarily already interested in Africa or in development. The weekly assignments can seem daunting but you quickly become acclimated to them. The weekly assignments and then two book reviews create a manageable workload for a class that teaches a lot about development and will change the way you think about African poverty."
