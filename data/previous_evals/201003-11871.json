    "Absolute hell. If you have taken any Calculus, AB or BC, I would skip this class and Math 112 and just take 120 (if its for your major etc). I sat in on 120 for the first few weeks and should have stayed because I already know enough of the basic concepts behind derivatives and integrals to get by. It had been two years since calc so I thought 115 would be a good brush up but I was wrong. I have learned very little that is relevant and have been tortured in the process as you even need to consult a table on some problems, a clear omission that it is impossible to do in your head, so why not a calculator? This class is antiquated.",
    "It is a difficult and frustrating class. I would not recommend it to anyone who does not have to take it.",
    "Take because it's not as bad as 120.",
    "Because it starts with Calc I material you might think it's an easy class at first, but it gets a lot harder. With work, though, it definitely gets easier. I would definitely recommend it to other students; the content of the course is really good to know, especially the concept of Taylor and Maclaurin series.",
    "Mathematics 115 01 is essentially Calculus BC but a little more intense than the high school equivalent.",
    "I would recommend the class, because the material is a prerequisite for some higher level classes. Just don't expect an easy grade.",
