   "comments": [
    "This is a really great class that I highly recommend. The reading can get a little out of hand, but for the most part it is totally manageable. The assignments are also super manageable and interesting. You really learn a lot about the way that ethnography is experienced which is really valuable. If you are an anthro major this is a definite must take!",
    "If you can get in, definitely take it. Prof. Erami is absolutely wonderful (as a person and as a scholar), and it's really not that much work. The class met my expectations for a field methods\/ethnographic writing course, and then immediately transformed them. Every anthropology major should try to take this prior to engaging in research; I feel like I learned so much more about the discipline than just how to do ethnography. That being said, a lot of the logistics of the course could have been somewhat better organized, and it would have been helpful if assignment instructions had been clearer or even slightly more explicit. Also, I should mention that it's up to you to take the class seriously--it's one of those \"get out what you put in\" kind of deals. If you're planning to skip the reading, don't bother.",
    "If you're an Anthro major, you should definitely take this class!",
    "A wonderful balance of anthropological theory \/ method readings and actual ethnographies. I do wish we didn't read as many introductions as we did, though; taking a second week to read a couple of chapters of a book instead of skipping from ethnographic example to example would have been more productive, at least for me. I was grateful for the symposium style presentations at the end of the class. All around, a wonderful seminar that I looked forward to each week!",
    "Somewhat interesting class on feildwork that's very easy to pass. If you've never conducted field-work in anthropology it's a great introduction. The size of the class, poor facilitation of discussion, and lack of a discussion section made it difficult to be critical and gain something from the class.",
    "Not as rigorous as it should be as a methods course for the major, I don't really feel like I learned that much. Definitely did not do as much work as expected especially for a writing course.",
    "It's a very chill class that can either feel like a waste of time or highly beneficial (I've heard both descriptions) depending on how you participate. It's one of those classes where the return depends on your personal input.",
    "Basic theory and method of ethnography. YES TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This course dealt with issues like the field and exoticism, reflexivity and the identity of the fieldworker, and it gave an overview of several trends, techniques, and developments in fieldwork and ethnography. Additionally, there were weekly ethnographic samples. Professor Erami is excellent, and she makes students feel at ease in seminar. I recommend that you take this course after Introduction to Cultural Anthropology (sophomore year?) and concurrently with ANTH 311:Anthropological Theory. This will give you as firm a grasp of cultural anthropology and ethnography as undergraduate classes at Yale can give you. It is also a WR credit with very little writing, but very much attention paid to writing in ethnographic work.",
    "Since this is one of the required methods courses for Anthropology majors, most students who take the course are Anthro majors. That being said, this class was very interesting and brought to light many of the biases and debates surrounding ethnography. I recommend this class to anyone interested in this field in general.",
    "Yes, if you know what you're getting into.",
    "Great readings, not very much writing (but the assignments are interesting), super interesting subject if you care at all about anthropology, not very organized.",
    "Learn how to do ethnography! First part of the course is very theory-heavy, but just the first few weeks to get you in the right mindset to work on your own project later in the semester. The reading is manageable and there are only a few short papers on your own ethnographic work. The class is interesting, exploring the origins, ethics, and methods of ethnography, and it gives students a chance to pursue a short original research idea.",
    "yes, do it, even if it's not necessary for your major. be prepared to learn from the other great people in there with you.",
    "I took this class because some kind of methods course is important for the major. Although I had heard it wasn't a great class, it was even worse than I had expected. I don't really think that I learned very much of anything really. The class needs to be much more structured than it is at the moment. Discussion often disintegrated and became rather repetitive. The level of discussion was pretty low and not intellectually engaging. We did read a few interesting introductions, but most people probably didn't do all the readings anyway. Thankfully, the level of work is pretty low and you do have your choice of projects. If you are an anthro major, I suppose you will probably take this class, but keep your expectations low."
