    "If you are a math or computer science major, don't hesitate to take this class! Vu is absolutely brilliant and wonderful, and we covered a fair amount of the Discrete Mathematics textbook. There are some really beautiful results covered in this class, and I thought it was a great introduction to graph theory, combinatorics, and probability. If you love problem solving, the problem sets were great!He follows the book rather closely, which can be both good in that you can read up on material that you didn't quite follow in class. However, our class attendance was still rather high throughout the semester even though people could have just followed the book and taken exams.",
    "Grading was a little tough (on homeworks and on the midterm). The midterm had some tricky problems. Professor Vu is pretty good at explaining things. The TA, Kyle Luh, is the best TA you could ask for. This class is also good prep for any job interviews that ask quantitative\/probability questions.",
    "Good material, poorly taught. Don't take it with Van Vu, he either doesn't speak English well enough to explain the material or makes enough errors demonstrating proofs that they are overly hard to follow. If offered with another professor I would consider it.",
    "Cool material. The combinatorics section is a bit boring for those with math competition background, but graph theory, probabilistic methods, ramsey theorem, etc. make it worthwhile. It definitely helps to have some experience writing proofs. Van Vu didn't put too much effort into the class beyond presenting the lectures and choosing homework problems from the textbook exercises, but it's hard to blame a man of his caliber.",
    "Take it. If you never had a proof based class, you will have to work very hard, but that is why you go to college.",
    "Great course. Absolutely take it if you're mathematically inclined. The material (mostly graph theory, but assorted other topics as well) is awesome, Professor Vu is great, and if Kyle Luh is the TA, he's awesome too. The textbook is enjoyable to read, the workload is definitely manageable, particularly with office hours or a study group. The midterm was a bit rough in that it was a long exam, the but the final was very fair (maybe even on the easy side). Thoroughly enjoyed it, my favorite class this semester.",
    "Math 244 covers a large amount of material from combinatorics to graph theory. It was an interesting class, although the exams were difficult and the problem sets often took a fair amount of time.",
    "A solid introduction to combinatorics and graph theory. It is very clear that Professor Vu is a brilliant combinatorialist and graduate level instructor. However, as he was teaching undergraduates, it seemed as if he did not put very much effort into presenting formal proofs. He relied too heavily on proofs by drawing\/appeal to intuition, proofs by 2 examples, and proofs by omitting a proof. All the same, it was pretty cool to watch the thought processes of a gifted mathematician.",
    "Van Vu is gives excellent lectures and is clear and interesting. The material covered is presented with a good balance of proof-type and application-\/computation-type problems, although if you're hoping exclusively for one of those, you may be disappointed. Workload is quite doable, one problem set a week, usually 3 to 6 hours, although the exams are rather difficult.",
    "Awesome class, if you are CS I would recommend taking it over the CS course. Van Vu is really famous and knows what he's doing... if Kyle Luh is TAing, count yourself lucky. Homework grader (Nazerke) was kind of.. overly strict, but luckily, she doesn't grade the final\/midterm. Midterms and finals were really easy... though some really struggled with them. It's a really different kind of math, so it takes some practice to get used to it. Think about the extra practice problems at the end of each chapter, then go to office hours and talk to Kyle about them.",
    "I think everyone should take a course in Discrete Math. It's so remarkable to see how math permeates such practical facets of our everyday lives and you learn about really cool and interesting problems in relation to probability, coloring, and graph theory among others. This class definitely sharpers your analytical skills, which are transferrable to any job. That said, only consider taking if you like math and are at all interested in the subject (or need it for a requirement.)",
    "Math 244 was not required for my major, I took it as a way to introduce myself to proof-based math. I had only done calculus and differential equations before this class, which I felt were relatively boring, but the graph theory and combinatorics I learned in this class were fascinating. The applications to computer science and everyday problems like map coloring were fascinating to me. The professor Van Vu, is a leader in his field, but still friendly and makes funny jokes in class. The TA, Kyle Luh, was also great; his problem sessions twice a week were extremely helpful. Even though my career probably will not involve discrete mathematics at all I am happy that I took this course. I'm considerably better at problem solving, and I've been exposed to lots of interesting fields of mathematics that I may try to study on my own time because they are so interesting.",
    "Van Vu is a brilliant mathematician. The class almost entirely consists of him going through proofs of mathematical concepts (Multinomial theorem, 5-coloring etc.).If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s between CS 202 and Math 244\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 my guess is Math 244 is more proof-based, not learning concepts and applying them, and therefore more difficult but to me more interesting.This class also made me realize that Math is so much deeper than I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ever going to be able to begin to understand and so much has been proven already. I realized that even though I like proofs, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be a math major or spend my life trying to penetrate to the edge of human mathematical knowledge.",
    "This is a solid intermediate-level math class. You'll learn some cool things about graph theory and some interesting approaches to probability (even some that you don't see in 241\/242). All in all it's worth taking if you're into discrete math or math that can be applied to compsci. The problem sets are very doable and the exams are manageable. Van Vu is an OK lecturer but he's incredibly smart so it's worth taking a class from him.",
    "This class tends to vary a lot from year to year, depending on the professor's preferences\/ style. If you have a chance to take it with Van Vu, you definitely should. He's thorough, funny, and in general a great lecturer.",
    "Take it only if its required (CS\/Applied Math). Lots of proofs, but concepts not too difficult. Not the most interesting of classes, but pretty standard workload.",
    "I would recommend the class to a mathematics student, not a computer science student. CPSC 202 would likely be an easier, more applied option that is more relevant for CS majors. For math majors, I would recommend the class only if you already have some working knowledge of the material. I didn't, and really struggled through the class.",
    "I'd recommend this class to someone with experience in math competitions. The proofs and problem sets would be extremely difficult otherwise. It's a great challenge nonetheless.",
    "Excellent course; problem sets can be deceptively difficult, but stay on top of those and you'll do fine.",
    "Rather difficult course from what I thought it would be. I would caution people.",
    "Take it, but be prepared to learn a lot of proofs.",
    "An OK course, but not stunning. Not too difficult for a math major, though certainly not an easy QR for the average student. Like many math courses, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have calc or linear algebra as a pre-requisite, although matrices& determinants are used a bit near the end. Combinatorics and graph theory are the main topics and the book is pretty good. HW and midterm are tougher than the final, which is fair. The course seems to change each year with a new professor so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to say what it will be like. This year the lectures were proof-based and some problems required proofs but exams did not require as much proving. Prof. Vu is OK but I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seek him out to take a course with him.",
    "If you really enjoy the subject could be good, if you're going for CPSC\/MATH major take the course in the CPSC department.",
    "For those interested in math, I would recommend it. For \"dabblers\" like me, it was really hard."
