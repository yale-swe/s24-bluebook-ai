    "I definitely improved my ability to apply calculus to physics concepts, especially in the way of solving a problem by splitting it up into tiny pieces and integrating the results.",
    "I learned a lot about Electricity & Magnetism during this course.",
    "I learned about electromagnetism, and about applying my knowledge to solve new problems.",
    "I really enjoyed this intro physics course. I learned a lot about electricity and magnetism - and I'm inspired to learn more.",
    "Physics intuition and much better practical integration skills. Integrating is hard.",
    "I learned and EandM side of physics and that physics is beautiful. Also teamwork and cooperation is cool too.",
    "Physics",
    "I learned how to work well in a group to solve problems. I learned to think analytically to figure out solutions. I learned a lot about physics principals, in particular I learned a lot of conceptual physics which is sometimes missing from many other courses.",
    "I learned Physics.",
    "Better understanding of abstract concepts, better understanding of integration and calculus in a practical sense",
    "magnetism!!",
    "I did not take Advanced Placement Physics C as it was not offered in my highschool, thus the majority of my current knowledge of electricity and magnetism stems from this class.",
    "How to think logically and critically about problem-solving. Beyond pure subject material I learned how to approach new problems and combining things I've already learned with things I've yet to tackle.",
    "I learned problem solving skills, especially re physics e and m, working in a group, casual presentations in front of peers, got better at asking for help.",
    "I felt this course gave me a very strong foundation with the knowledge of Physics. In addition it taught me elements of problem solving that can be applied outside the field of Physics particularly in other STEM fields. Outside of the scientific aspect of Physics it showed more of the artistic beauty of the phenomenons of electricity and magnetism taught in the second semester. Particularly with Physics 181 I found the material was taught in way where you didn't learn how to solve particular problems but were taught the concepts and were well versed enough in the concepts that you would be able to solve the problems.",
    "I learned about electrical forces, gauss' law, electrical potential, current, resistance, circuits, magnetic forces, induced magnetic forces, ampere's law, biot savart's law, and maxwell's equations. The only reason why i remember so much is because prof. Kharel was so amazing and took the time to make sure we remembered what the larger context was for what we were doing at a given time.",
    "I learned problem solving skills and group skills working with others.",
    "I learned a lot about physics. I learned how to tackle complex problems, discuss physics with other student and to improve my reasoning skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course covers a lot of abstract material for one semester. From electricity to magnetism, forces that seem almost magical in our day-to-day conception of them, this course attempts to ground the physical phenomena we see in reality and mathematics. It can be challenging to imagine things like electric and magnetic fields, but I can't fault the course just because nature is so abstract and confusing. As someone who enjoys learning about modern physics in his free time, the one critique I will offer is that, much like 180, 181 neglects to touch on the fascinating breakthroughs of the 20th century. While I understand that doing so might muddle the [what would be under normal, e.g. not quantum\/relativistic, circumstances] perfectly-fine concepts of classical E&M, I felt somewhat unsatisfied by only learning things that are centuries old without any kind of nod to what we know to be true today. While this more ancient knowledge is certainly the important bit I'll need as an engineer, I wish I had the opportunity to gain deeper insight into how the world truly works rather than just the approximation that the classical perspective offers.",
    "Kharel is definitely a strength of this class! He is positive and made sure he got to know everyone's names by the end of the course. This class was held in TEAL, and Kharel did a great job utilizing the space well. The exams were very tricky, and even with test corrections, it was still hard to do well. I wish this class was more aimed at actual intro students, since there are many people in 181 that should be in 201.",
    "The course is structured well, and it was fun working together with the people at my table. Sometimes, it is possible to fall behind on the reading, which would make completing the reading quizzes difficult.",
    "It was extremely interactive and engaging. The flipped classroom format really worked for me because so much of the subject matter is application. Doing problems in class helped me learn the material.",
    "The format of the course in the TEAL classroom really made it a more fun and enjoyable experience, as we were learning literally with one another. Prof Kharel also did an amazing job of engaging with students one-on-one to make sure each student understood what exactly was happening in class. I would've liked to see us move through material faster and go through more rigorous proofs in class, but given the structure of it, this would be difficult to do without TA's or some other staff in the class to help students that were struggling.",
    "High focus on conceptual aspects of physics. Highly cooperative and collaborative environment.",
    "I loved lecture and the munchkins!",
    "Kharel's section was an interactive one and was in the TEAL room in Hillhouse. The biggest strength was this professor. He organized the course to be very engaging - group problems, clicker questions, group discussions. It was never boring to be in class. Weakness of the course would be the psets which took too long to do each week!",
    "Strengths weee how interactive it was. Professor Kharel made everyone feel part of the class and everyone contributed to the class environment. Weaknesses were there was not much formal teaching. A lot of problem solving which is a great way to learn, but I would have been good to have a brief lecture on key things before jumping into everything.",
    "Sometimes I feel that if the course were more lecture based, we would get more done in class.",
    "Great community, a lot of work in groups and the professor made sure everybody was engaged, working with one another",
    "I believe that some time is wasted via the TEAL set up. I encourage group collaboration however I believe there should be a stricter set lesson plan.",
    "I took physics 180 with Professor Steinacker and never felt truly prepared for any of the exams, but after taking Phys 181 with Kharel I actually felt like I learned a lot about electricity and magnetism so that I could excel in the class on my own. It was great that Kharel's and Steinacker's sections had different exams because they both have very different teaching styles and prefer different types of problems. Kharel aways chose really applied problems which I enjoyed because the point of physics to me is to learn how to actually solve physics problems not just derive the equations without being able to apply them.",
    "The intimate classroom setting allowed for a lot of peer-to-peer collaboration and instruction. It kept students engaged with material and constantly doing, rather than just absorbing. It also was more fun to come to class because the professor knew your name and what you do outside of school.",
    "I felt the course was very strong in teaching the concepts but I felt some of the PSETS became tedious and unnecessary with the amount of math that was needed. They became more of a math problem and no longer a Physics PSET. Also, it would be better if the PSETS weren't completely reliant on office hours. If one missed office hours it would be extremely difficult to be able to finish a PSET.",
    "Strengths: - interpersonal relationships with peers\/prof. that reinforce learning and encourage engagement with the material - prof. kharel cares so much and will make sure everyone understands the material before moving on - lots of clarity around expectations for exams, etc. Weaknesses: - sometimes the class moved too slowly - maybe might be helpful to have an extra section for review and questions so that we could get through the material a little more quickly?",
    "This course is very unequal based on the professor you take. Last semester, the different professors had the same PSETS and Tests, and that worked well because then I could work and study with kids taking another professor's class. This semester, however, each professor had their own tests and homework, so I could only work with those in my professor's class. Also, one professor had far more students than the other professor, so that also made it harder to interact.",
    "Strengths: This particular section of physics 181 with Professor Kharel involved a lot of group work. I believe that being able to work and learn with your peers was very beneficial. Also, the practice problems that he would give us aligned well with what we were tested on. Weaknesses: The exams seemed to focus a lot on conceptional questions, but I think that we spent more class time doing word problems. It seemed like we fell behind on the material that we were suppose to cover.",
    "This course had many strengths. The in class work, the layout of the classroom, and the professor's excitement over the material was great and helped me learn. The class could be improved but stating learning goals each class, staying on track and better time management during each class."

   "comments": [
    "Most students taking this course will in one way or another be using it to fulfill a major requirement, so I won't try to sell it seeing as I probably won't have to. If it's important to you to truly feel engaged with the material and how it applies to your life, I strongly recommend taking the interactive, TEAL version of this class if it's offered. Otherwise, I'm sure the lecture variant did an excellent job of streamlining concepts and giving great mathematical practice with the equations of E&M, which is also a very useful skill.",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics with Kharel!! There is a lot of work associated with this class, though. In additionally to weekly PSETs, there is an online reading quiz before each class. To properly learn the concepts, you need to actually read the textbook, too, so this class seemed never-ending, but in a good way! The tests are tricky, so study hard for them, but you do get test corrections, which can help a little. Kharel is what makes this class, though. He is *the best* professor you could ask for, and by the end of the semester he'll know your name, where you're from, what you're majoring in, and what your summer plans are. He truly cares for his students, and that shows through his teaching.",
    "Prof Kharel clearly cared about us students and made learning physics fun. This course has a flipped-classroom format, and why I'm not usually a fun of this format, the classes were useful (especially since Prof Kharel still went through the material) and it was fun working with our groups.",
    "Yes! This was my favorite class of my semester. Unlike a lot of other physics classes I've taken, this class is really engaging and fun.",
    "If you're going to take PHYS181, absolutely take it with Professor Kharel! This was one of the classes I would look forwards to going to every single day, and he does a great job of making the class feel like a community, rather than just a random group of Yalies. Problem sets aren't too difficult, and there's plenty of help with them.",
    "Important topic. Cool teacher. Cooperative environment.",
    "Section 2 of phys 181 02 with Kharel is a semi-flipped classroom. I didn't even realize it until I started but it was pretty cool. Made quite a few friends and prof kharel is great.",
    "Kharel is bae.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. If you need to take physics this is a good option. It is challenging but interesting.",
    "They might need it for their major, and it was a good course.",
    "Yes, it is a class that will help you for the future if you are looking to do a STEM major",
    "This course was definitely the hardest I've taken at Yale but very rewarding as long as you take it with Professor Kharel.",
    "Yes, but only to STEM majors, especially engineers. The physics of the course wasn't too bad -- not many proofs or complex math -- but it's simply a hard subject to begin with.",
    "Savan Kharel is the best! Not just the best physics professor, the best person in general. Often, class time wasnt used to the maximum efficiency, but it was always entertaining, so I paid attention like 96% of the time, which is 46% greater than I do in lecture. Professor Kharels enthusiasm and general care for his students made the class a great experience. Kharels positivity and enthusiasm for physics\/life made a positive impact on my life outside of physics. HE IS A LIGHT. Kharel's presence MADE the class for me, so I can't comment on 181 versus 171 or 201, since I don't think he'll be back next year :'(",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they had an interest in the sciences and were either a STEM major or a humanities major. The knowledge one learns in Physics is present through so many aspects of life that event if one did not use it again it would expand their thinking.",
    "Take phys 181 with Kharel! He is so kind and really makes sure you understand the material before moving on. I didn't think of myself as a \"Physics person\" before this class but he empowered me with so much knowledge. This is a class that could be boring or engaging and doing Kharel's section will make it so engaging.",
    "Yes, this course teaches great problem solving skills. Just make sure you do the homework well in advance.",
    "I think that you should only take this course if you have to because of your major. However, I would recommend taking it with Professor Kharel if you prefer a class that is more focused on group work over a regular lecture class.",
    "This was a great way to learn physics. I would recommend it to everyone."
