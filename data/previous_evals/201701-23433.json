    "The course is effective at teaching comparative health systems.",
    "Really fun class Great discussions Chima is very knowledgeable and engaging",
    "I learned a lot from this course. Class was always interesting and I loved that Chima applied relevant issues, such as the growing refugee crisis, to the curriculum. I feel that I know so much more about health systems than I did before and am so happy I took this class, I think what I learned will be valuable throughout my career.",
    "Great groundwork for understanding healthcare systems around the world and applying methodology to understanding their formation and benefits\/drawbacks. Glad the course was modeled in a conversational\/discussion-based format to allow for free flow of ideas.",
    "-enjoyed learning about the various health systems models, aims, and levers -group project was helpful to apply learning -smaller room would have been a more conducive environment for class discussions",
    "Class is great - provides a great overview about the basic approaches to developing health systems and assessing its success. Con - perhaps Winslow is the wrong space for a class that could become so discussion based. Because we were so spaced out, the class ended up being more of a lecture than a discussion",
    "A great class mostly because Chima is very passionate and thorough in examining how health care systems form. The first half is fairly straightforward, but after the midterm, it's more fun because it's more or less a few weeks of discussion and debate about questions with no correct answer in how countries should handle health care problems.",
    "Love Chima",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at YSPH. The material was incredibly interesting and relevant. Each class had interesting discussions. It would have been helpful to have a little more direction for the data assignment.",
    "Lectures and readings were interesting and useful, but the discussions and class exercises could be better thought out.",
    "Very interesting course presented in an engaging way through the intructors style. He made it a very enjoyable lecture that I felt I learned a lot from. Very interactive with the students."

    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is one of the best professors I've had. He is charismatic and passionate and really included important issues, such as equity, into the course, which was refreshing and I think more professors need to follow his lead. I really really respond well to his teaching style, I have not seen another professor able to engage the entire room in Winslow the way he does and he made it a discussion more than a lecture.",

    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is funny and engaging. My only feedback is that sometimes I'm not sure if we are supposed to respond to his seemingly rhetorical questions.",
