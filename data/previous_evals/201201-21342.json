    "pretty bad. difficult to understand and repetitive. heard a lot about heavy vs. light industry and urban willages. not clearly organized, text-heavy slides.",
    "Probably not.",
    "I would not recommend Econ 180 to another student.",
    "It's a good way to get to know about the Chinese economy. The fieldtrip to a real estate company was also cool, and the assigned readings were good in general. The work was largely self-paced, though. You're probably not going to have any problem not reading any of the assigned readings and just cramming for the exams, but you definitely get more out of class if you do the readings.",
    "On how China succeeded in transforming its economy from the socialist, very inefficient system to the global industrial powerhouse.I would recommend this class ONLY IF you're sure you can bear extremely boring lectures and you love Chinese economy."
