   "comments": [
    "I would recommend taking Econ 115 because the concept is important. Besides, people will take this class whether it's recommended or not... The lecture isn't stellar, but I found Udry's Africa comments amusing. Make sure you have an excellent TA and go to section! A lot of things don't get covered in lecture and section helps so much for the problem sets.",
    "Only take if you are planning on doing Econ or something Econ related later on.",
    "Definitely take this course. It relates so much to the real world, and the concepts are well explained. Be wary of the midterm - it'll be very easy, and you might do as well as you thought because, even though it's curved, almost everyone does well.",
    "Take it but don't expect to love it. Udry is the man - his little quips and anecdotes about goats, Ghana, and his brother-in-law are absolutely hilarious and he does a really good job connecting to students despite the enormous size of the class. That being said, it's intro econ...so it's not gonna be riveting. The problem sets vary from easy to hellish and the grading at times is fairly arbitrary, but you have a 90% (literally) chance of getting an A or B so don't worry too much. Go to lecture, at least the second one of the week, because a lot of times the problem set problems are just reconstructions of stuff we talked about in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to everyone. Intro Micro is a great course and knowledge of key economic concepts is important to any field. It's also not a very hard course.",
    "Fine for what it is. Boring, questionably valuable material, but Udry does a good job with what he has. Don't spend the huge $$ on the textbook - you absolutely WON'T need it.",
    "I would take it for the core knowledge of Economics, but not because it's an incredibly fun class. You learn a lot, even if you took Micro in high school.",
    "Yes, only if you need to fulfill Economics requirements. Even then, try to get into an introductory economics seminar.",
    "Take it (especially if you need a QR). If you have never taken econ, like me, don't be worried. If you go to class, do the p-sets, and study you will understand class content and do well. the curve is very generous. 40% get in the a range, 50% get in the b range, and 10% get in the c range or below.RECOMMENDED!",
    "Definitely recommended, especially if Christopher Udry is teaching. He works in development economics, which lends such an interesting perspective to his examples and teaching. I really liked this class. The work is very reasonable, problem sets are graded very fairly, and the concepts are just fascinating. There is a fair amount of mathematical thinking and a good amount of algebra, but it's definitely, definitely doable, even for the not so mathematically inclined. Highly recommended.",
    "Yes, economics is really interesting.",
    "If you're considering taking this class, take it. It seems like everyone does; it's a great way to meet and connect with other freshmen and especially upperclassmen. Workload wasn't too bad, no more than 30 mins - 1.5 hours a week working on problem sets. Please don't buy the book; you'll never open it. I used to read the book and take notes on it before every lecture until I realized how useless that was; the book is terribly written, and everything you need to know is taught in class, lecture, or can easily be googled. Office hours were hit or miss, depending on the TAs present; when I worked with a good TA, it was incredibly helpful in clarifying the material and problem set questions. When I worked with a bad one, it was not. That being said, overall, go to office hours. The TAs are very cool people and it's great not just to talk to them, but hear about their lives and whatnot. If you can, get Jamin Speer as your TA. He was utterly fantastic and super helpful. This class is definitely a good opportunity to make a study group to check problem sets and study for the midterm + final with. Overall, I'd recommend taking it. I had never taken economics before this course and I in the beginning I felt a little behind, with a good amount of hard work and studying, by the end of the course I had a great grasp of the material and was tutoring many people who had taken AP Micro in high school.",
    "I mean, it's intro. If want to major in econ, you'll take this course. Udry is a pretty good lecturer and incredibly enthusiastic about his work. He is also very helpful with any individual questions you may have. Overall, very approachable and likable professor. My one gripe with his lectures is that they spend too much time reviewing previous lecture material and not enough on material you need to do the psets (pretty easy overall). That being said, prepare to do a good amount of individual study fromthe book.",
    "Definitely, if it's with Prof Udry. His lectures are energetic and interesting, and he explains the concepts clearly and thoroughly. I went to lectures and took great notes, and he taught everything well enough that I didn't even need to look at my textbook once all semester. He's great about taking questions, his homework is generally very fair and straightforward, and you can tell how much he loves the subject. It's some great, relevant material that people should learn at some point in their lives.",
    "If you're not afraid to get a bad grade, take this course. The curve makes it incredibly hard to get an A. Our midterm had 60 points on it, and a 59 was an A-, and a 56 was a B+.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow Yale student who has had no introduction to economics beforehand. For people who took econ in high school, the pace might be too slow. I enjoyed class, and really felt like I learned a lot of information.",
    "I really enjoyed Economics 115. Professor Udry was an amazing lecturer, and if he is lecturing again, take the lecture without giving a second thought to the matter. Some people complain that Introduction to Microeconomics doesn't having many application to the real world, but I disagree. It's surprising how even simple models can explain real world phenomena",
    "Econ 115 is a well-explained and fairly basic introduction to microeconomics. The class is enormous so expect a fairly impersonal experience in lecture and huge variation in skill level of the class members. Sections were very well taught and much more personal, and Professor Udry was a great lecturer considering the nature of the class. If you come from an exceptionally strong math background, you will find the math involved in the class frustratingly simple. The class is an extremely manageable workload. The reading is only intended to supplement lecture information, so if you understand all the concepts as they are explained in lecture, it is completely unnecessary. The problem sets are short, but nonetheless address the core concepts well. Each lecture begins with a review of the last lecture, so the class moves at an extremely manageable pace. The material was fairly interesting. All-in-all, effective, fairly easy and interesting class, but not particularly inspiring.",
    "It gets a lot more interesting after the midterm.",
    "I had heard bad things about this class, and some were true but most weren't. Prof. Udry was new and enthusiastic. His lectures weren't always the most interesting but they were informative and clarified the book (not that anything from the book that isn't covered in lecture is on the test). Full disclosure, fell asleep a few times, but I wanted to learn economics, and I had no background but now I feel like a have a solid base for higher level econ. I think I enjoyed it more than a lot of my friends enjoyed the seminar, so don't feel bad if you don't get into a seminar. Also, feel free to switch around until you find a good TA. Theyre good about taking in new people.",
    "No matter what my thoughts are of the course it is important to understand econ.",
    "Only take this class if you have to. The material is not that difficult but it becomes ten times more confusing the way it is taught. This class is only useful if you eventually want to take classes that require you to have at least a background in economics. That said, I think this class could be more interesting if it was taught better.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 if you'd like to be an econ major. The material might be a little dry and dense for somebody just looking for a QR credit.",
    "Definitely a good class to take just for general knowledge. Udry made it as exciting as intro econ can be. The curve is good too.",
    "Do not waste your Yale credit on this course: you're not going to learnanything meaningful. Just read any book on the topic and you're good; otherwise you'll have to sit through boring lectures and worry about your grade which depends on hard exams.",
    "This course is really good introduction to economics. The material is interesting, the work load is definitely manageable, and it presents concepts that are important to know about how the economy works, no matter what you want study. The course was repetitive at times, as we usually spent the first half of every class reviewing what we had done before. Other than that though, I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to other students.",
    "It is a good class to take if you have to. Much of a the class is taking it only to fulfill a requirement, but take it if you want to take higher level econ classes.",
    "Econ 115 was a pretty good class. Udry was a fantastic lecturer. I really appreciated the international development spin that he put on his lectures - I really liked learning about development economics. The class was not too hard grading-wise - you're guaranteed an A or a B, which is nice. It gets a little boring towards the end of the class though. Definitely try to get into Muthoni's section if you can.",
    "I would say: it's an econ course.",
    "Take it with Udry!! So dynamic and clear, and the concepts are actually really straightforward and interesting.",
    "Useful to take as things you should know as a Yale graduate",
    "Intro to micro turned out to be exactly as advertised: a straightforward introduction to the most basic concepts of economics. No curveballs, simple math, fairly easy to grasp concepts.",
    "If you don't HAVE to take it... there are way better things out there",
    "Basic Microecon class. I used it for my So credit, and would recommend to science majors searching for such a credit. The math is almost unbearably easy, and the concepts are real world and really interesting. If you go to lecture and section, then this class should prove quite manageable. Not much workload, and great curve!",
    "If you can fill the prerequisite with AP scores, skip ECON 115. It is almost about the same things that show up in AP test and it can be very boring to take it again if you already know about the material pretty well.",
    "It's one of those classes you take because it's necessary, not because it's thrilling, but I would definitely recommend it. I feel like it's important to have a professor who is interesting, since the subject can be quite dry, and professor Udry was excellent at keeping the lectures somewhat entertaining.",
    "I think I wouldn't. It's hard to get everything out of the course in a lecture format. If I could do it again, I would take the seminar even though its three times a week. There is less math and you are able to really interact with the teacher and make sure you understand everything.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "The workload isn't all that much, and if you're looking to get a QR retirement out of the way without taking math and gain a basic understanding of microeconomics, go for it. But be prepared to take way more economics courses if you want to really understand economics; this is far from the end-all be all.",
    "I came in with absolutely no knowledge about economics and really poor calculus skills (you don't need any, it's just easier to understand some of the concepts), like, seriously, NO KNOWLEDGE, and I finished the final exam feeling really good about the work I had done and how much I had learned.One problem set a week (not difficult), one midterm, one final.You don't need the book.Most people will tell you to take it with Berry, but Chris Udry is fantastic. He uses humanitarian work for most of his examples, and it got to be a class joke after a while, but he's really cool. He won't tell you any of this in class, but he was in the Peace Corps after college, he was the head of the department the last 4 years, and other than this class, he only teaches PhD students in international development economics. Very cool person to know.The TAs are hit or miss. Mine was so great, my friends started coming to my section. SHOP TAs.",
    "Good introductory course. However, be prepared to do a lot of self-studying.",
    "this is a straightforward intro econ class. i enjoyed it a lot. i had intro macro in high school.it's a pre-req for more advanced econ classes, and it's relatively easy. it makes a great fifth (or probably even sixth class) and covers fairly interesting topics.be careful about the professor you get, though. udry and berry seem to be really good.",
    "It was a very easy class which teaches you a few interesting things and a few boring\/self-explanatory things. I think that microeconomics is something that everyone should know a little bit about so I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to be a good world citizen\/wants to get into more advanced economics.",
    "This is an excellent intro Econ class! The professor is good at lecturing, although he sometimes dedicates a lot of time to reviewing. The course is not terribly difficult that it's unmanageable, but it's also not so easy that it's boring. Overall, it made me more interested in Econ courses.",
    "Overall it is an interesting and useful course. Professor was really good but sometimes the subject can't help but to get dry. It is an easy course though. As long as you do the problem sets and go over the practice exams before the midterm and final, you're good. You don't even have to buy the book. I never read a page and did well in the course.",
    "If you're going to take Intro Micro, take it with Professor Udry. He's AMAZING and brings in a lot of examples about developmental economics, which I personally found very interesting. But be warned - after all, this is intro micro, so you better like the subject material.",
    "Econ 115 is the standard introductory course. If you want to study economics, you'll probably have to take it whether or not you want to. The course is okay, and you'll learn the basics.",
    "If you're looking for an easy and perhaps useful QR, this is probably not the one you want.",
    "Rather boring concepts but necessary for mastering intermediate economics. Not too hard and not too easy. Great course! I would recommend it!",
    "This is all learnable via textbook if you really think it's important information to have. Maybe it just wasn't framed the right way for me, but definitely not an enjoyable experience. This is a class that should be important right now, given the political climate of the economy, and it just didn't feel that way.",
    "Yes take it if you need to take intro micro. Udry is a great lecturer.",
    "Take Econ 115 for a basic understanding of Microeconomics. Understand that most of it is very theoretical and can't be implemented in the real world. At the same time, it lays important ground work for future economic discoveries.",
    "Take it if you need to, it's also just a great class in general and everyone should understand micro.",
    "Econ 115 with Prof. Udry was amazing! Definitely take it if he teaches it because he really did a great job and made microeconomics a really interesting subject.",
    "Basic intro econ course. It isn't very interesting, but has a nice curve that makes it worthwhile and a good way to get a SO credit. Don't take it if you can't stand huge lecture courses because it is probably one of the biggest here.",
    "Intro to Micro with Professor Udry is a solid introduction to microeconomics. Even if you do not have any prior experience with econ or find it to be difficult, if you study and complete the problem sets you will most likely do well-- the curve is very helpful. I would recommend it to another student only if he\/she needs a QR. If you are just interested in knowing a little bit about economics (as you should be since it is very relevant) I would recommend taking a more interesting class, or at least reading about economics on your own first to see if it interests you enough to spend a whole semester on it.",
    "Interesting class that teaches a lot of great concepts",
    "Take ECON 115. It's a good basic introduction to Economics and goes over a lot of common sense rules that lay out the foundation for going forward. The class isn't all that hard, just go to section and class. Especially class so that you can get the graphs and understand what's going on. The way the prof explains makes the notes a lot more clear and easy to remember.",
    "ECON115 is a very straightforward class. It's a good class to balance out more intensive ones (such as DS). The material is straightforward and the midterm and final are very much structured to previous midterms\/finals. You will be given old exams and their solutions to study from, and as long as you go through them, the course itself should be a breeze.",
    "Yes. The workload isn't bad at all as long as you stay on top of your problem sets and don't wait to start them. Midterm and final are fair, but you do have to study a lot!",
    "This is a great intro course--whether you plan to be an econ major or not. I learned some great stuff.",
    "I would recommend Microeconomics to anybody who wants a fine introduction into the principles of economics. The course itself is not too challenging, and, with a bit of application, you probably will get more than 90% of the material. The curve is also extremely generous, which is nice.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're looking for a general overview of economics.",
    "Lots of material covered, not much work but hard tests",
    "Take this course if you want a good foundation in Econ. I'm an international student from Singapore - for international freshmen who took the Econ A-Levels and qualify for intermediate course, I would suggest taking this intro course instead because the material is different and you will learn the relevant mathematical proofs. Overall, very manageable course.",
    "Yes, the material is good and useful but it involves a lot of self-teaching too because there is not a ton of interaction.",
    "I would recommend taking Intro MicroEcon because it's good material to know for the future but only if you're at least relatively interested.",
    "I would definitely recommend Intro Micro to another student. Not too much work and you can get away without ever picking up the textbook (the exams\/psets are solely based on the class notes). This being said, the lectures are sometimes are a little dull because they do get very repetitive (the first 30 minutes of most lectures were just review), but Chris Udry is definitely an engaging lecturer. One warning: ALL of Udry's examples come from rural African farmers as oppose to modern day American businesses so they are sometimes very challenging to follow! It is definitely a course worth taking regardless of major because it does give you a new way to evaluate economic decision making and gives you a basic understanding of how the business world works.",
    "It's definitely a course I would recommend because it helps you see everyday life in a new way. The work load is pretty light with problem sets every week and one midterm and final.",
    "Not terribly difficult, but you do learn a lot. If nothing else, microeconomics gives you a different perspective if you take it early in your Yale education.",
    "A valuable experience which teaches you about real world issues.Definitely recommend it.",
    "Decent intro course. If you have to take it, take it...It isn't incredibly riveting but the curve is generous, the teaching is fine, and section is optional.",
    "I would only recommend it if you need to take the class for your major. It was pretty boring and nothing was really that great about the class. I obviously didn't take the Econ 110 seminar course but I would definitely look into taking that instead. The curve sounds pretty nice, but it seems like everyone has taken this class before in high school. I hadn't, so the curve wasn't actually helpful at all.",
    "Not an easy QR, the midterm is relatively tough (you only have 75 minutes to do it), and not all of the material is interesting. Don't be fooled into thinking that the course will give you a good understanding of economics because \"you should probably learn about it at some point because it would be good for you\" or something like that. If you don't work on the problem sets with a small group of friends, you probably won't be sure of whether you have the right answers or not.",
    "Econ 115 is an interesting introductory course where you learn the fundamental ideas of microeconomics. I would recommend this course to others because it is a good chance to see if you like economics and the Professor teaches the class well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Learn lots of economics, see the world in a different way, listen to interesting lecture from a really interesting professor.",
    "Econ 115 isn't particularly thrilling, but it provides the foundation for future econ courses as well as basic knowledge of some economic concepts that everyone should know. It is also pretty easy: weekly work on problem sets took maybe 2 hours, and apart from that the only work was preparing for a midterm and a final exam.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in learning about economics. It's a pretty useful course cause I think it gets discussed in other disciplines, like political science.",
    "Yes. This class is important to a Yale education but it's not easy. You'll have to work and show up to section.",
    "You're probably taking it because you want to major in econ. Good luck with that. If I had one hour to live, I'd spend it in this class because it feels like an eternity.But really, it wasn't that bad. Gets fun at times. Not so difficult. PSets and the final are easy, just ace the midterm and you'll be better than everyone else.",
    "This is your basic Intro Econ course. Don't expect to be wowed, because the information is so basic and impractical. I would recommend taking Econ 115 second semester to avoid headstrong freshmen who come to Yale and want to delve into Econ. Udry is good, but sometimes unclear.He is a really nice guy though, even though he has an Africa obsession. My major problem with the class is the grade distribution---your final is worth 50%, and the weekly and tough problem sets are only worth 20%. Ignore the textbook and just study the lectures. It'll all work out.",
    "Straightforward and boring. Take the intermediate level classes if you have previously taken Econ courses.",
    "If you have to, or want to, take Intro to Micro, I would take it with Udry. You're never going to be enthralled by Intro to Micro, but you come close with Udry. It's not a ton of work, and if you're prepare well for the exams, you can do okay.",
    "Yes. This is class is NOT AP Microeconomics, though some subjects will ultimately overlap, I did not feel that I was repeating AP.Professor Udry is entertaining, funny, and very prepared for lecture. He has single-handedly (with the TAs) revived Econ 115 from something that used to get negative reviews and complants (just check past sessions from 08,09,10...etc.).I do not regret choosing his lecture over the seminars.",
    "This course is a good introduction to Microeconomics. I would recommend this course - the lectures are quite interesting (if you like economics).",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who wants to understand the basics of how markets work. It taught the basics of microeconomics, including how markets work and then factors\/situations that made markets not work.",
    "I'd recommend it to someone who is interested in economics and doesn't mind self-studying a lot of material.",
    "Good course, easy workload, Udry is a great lecturer.",
    "Intro Micro is a broad survey course that should be taken by those who want to get a feel for the field of economics or use it for higher level classes. I would not necessarily recommend it for someone looking for a social science credit.",
    "It is a good introduction class, but I did not love it. But that is probably just because I really am not a fan of math or economics.",
    "Econ 115 is an overview of microeconomics. I would recommend it for someone looking to get an introduction to economic thinking.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in starting out on an economic path or wants a foundation in economics.",
    "I thought I was not going to like being in a big class but turns out it doesn't affect your learning in any way. Help was always given.",
    "I would say if you are willing to put the time in to read the textbook, take copious notes, and seek help from t.a's as well as fellow students, then this class would be worthwhile to take.",
    "The first half of this class will bore the hell out of you. All hypothetical models that don't really make sense yet require you to think as you would (using your common sense) if you were a consumer in this impossible situation. The second half is pretty good. I liked Chris Udry a lot, was a nice lecturer, but the TAs really stood out for me. I had three and all of them were helpful. Sections were insightful and really helped in my understanding. Psets are not difficult at all. Take it if you want a good solid QR credit that will give you a basic understanding of econ.",
    "Econ 115 is an excellent introductory course. I had zero econ background prior to this course, yet I did not feel overwhelmed by the material. This course was not taught with calculus which was frustrating, but that is apparently a decision each introductory professor has to make prior to beginning the course. Regardless, this is a great QR for those not mathematically inclined, but also a great course to stimulate further interest in economics.",
    "YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS as long as it's with UDRY or someone comparable.",
    "take this class and figure out if you still wanna major in econ...unlikely.",
    "basic econ",
    "This is your basic microeconomics class so, while it is boring, I definitely suggest taking it to learn the material and understand a little bit more about how the world works. The problem sets aren't bad, but the curve is pretty steep in the end (a lot of people took Economics in high school, so be prepared to work a little harder if you don't have any Econ background).",
    "Great class to find if econ is the right path for you..",
    "Take only for your major, or if you need need a relatively easy gut class.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU WANT TO TAKE A HIGHER LEVEL ECON COURSE LATER. It is not worth it, and it is not an easy QR.",
    "Yes, I'd highly recommend the course. Professor Udry makes it worthwhile. Enthusiastic and friendly, he teaches with obvious love for the subject matter, as well as a genuine care for his students. He does a great job simplifying difficult concepts and is always so ready to re-explain them in lecture if needed. If you frequently attend his lectures, listen to him, and take good notes, you won't ever have to touch the textbook (in fact, I won't even recommend buying it; it is verbose and unhelpful. For a much better text I'd suggest the one by Pindyck and Rubinfeld). The problem sets aren't overly difficult, though I'd suggest finding a pset partner so that you can compare answers or figure out together problems that are more challenging.",
    "ECON 115 with Prof. Udry was a good course. I think it's been taught by Steven Berry et al in the fall so I wasn't sure what to expect, but Prof Udry was really good. He explains all the concepts slowly and carefully and gives you lots of chances to ask questions. He also reviews stuff from the last lecture each time so that's a real plus, even if it does become a sort of self-necessitating thing since half the lecture is spent in review\/getting to stuff not covered because of reviewing. But it is helpful nonetheless. The exams were fair, but the jump from the conceptual stuff to the psets may not come intuitively at first, so you really have to work with the material. This is of course presuming that you haven't done econ before. A lot of people have taken econ before in high school so it's sort of annoying, but this isn't everyone so it's still fair. I think\/hope. Also the material in microecon often seems really....pointless\/useless because so many assumptions are made that most of the stuff actually doesn't apply to \"real life.\" But it's still an interesting way of looking at and breaking down\/making sense of how the world runs, so it's definitely worth it. It's a pset a week, one midterm and a final, so the workload is definitely not that bad, but if you feel like you are not really getting the material, you should review the lectures regularly, etc. and put in independent work. If you want.",
    "Professor Udry is great. If he's teaching the course, I would definitely recommend the lecture. He explains the concepts very clearly and his graphs are very clear. The course material is not difficult, but keep in mind that there's quite a lot of algebra involved.",
    "Economics 115 provides a basic conceptual understanding of microeconomics; it covers a range of concepts that effectively introduce the student to the field.",
    "This course is largely what you would expect it to be. It is not bad, but not great either; interesting enough, but not something you would want to write home about. How helpful section is will largely depend on your teaching fellow; I was lucky and had a good one, but I also went to a review session taught by two of the others that was supremely unhelpful. You will walk away with a good enough understanding of the basics of microeconomics, so it accomplishes its objective.",
    "Econ 115 with Udry is a wonderful introduction to microeconomics. After taking this class, you will have a very good foundation in economics. The lecture course with Udry is fantastic, because while it teaches a lot of somewhat challenging material, the problem sets are not impossible to do, and the lectures and teaching style is very clear. It is also not a very stressful class in terms of grades, which is nice. Udry\u0092s teaching always made the information relevant and interesting, and I definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, even if you had no knowledge of econ, like me. It's a great intro course, and econ is really something everyone should have some background in. Because of this course, I'm actually considering majoring in econ, if I like macro next semester.",
    "Yes, take it with Prof Udry. He's a good lecturer, and you will really understand the concepts by the end of the semester. I took it for a QR and because I wanted to understand economics better--the quantitative part of it was really easy, and I feel like I know a lot of useful information now.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the area of economics.",
    "Econ 115 is a great introduction to microeconomics. If you go to lecture and spend the time reviewing and understanding the material covered each week, then it is not too difficult of a class. In order for you to really understand the material though, you do need to put in effort each week. Professor Udry was a good professor and tried really hard to engage the class. Take it for a QR credit if you need. Otherwise, only necessary to take if you want to be an econ major.",
    "Huge lecture, and a lot of students who took economics in high school, but as someone who never did, I found it to be a great introduction. A lot of majors require it so you may not have a choice, but it also serves as a good QR. If you know the material you can get a decent grade, and section was very helpful in going over the important material. Udry was a very nice guy and taught it well. Textbook was not at all necessary.",
    "Definitely an interesting course to take.",
    "Wld recommend it purely because it's important I hink to take Econ, not yet really sure how helpful it will be for myself",
    "It's not great, but a necessary step to take further classes.",
    "Introduction to Microeconomics. Pay attention to lectures and go to all sections. If your TA sucks, just go to another section and write that TAs name on you homework from that point on. Do not think this class is a gut or it will gut you.",
    "If you want to learn Econ, take it. It presents a unique side of reasoning. That said, it is very basic, and a tad artificial.",
    "Economics 115 is a basic intro course. It isn't outstanding in terms of the teaching style, but will offer students interested in economics the basics to get started in the field. It is not an intense amount of work, and really not math-based at all. I found it interesting, but there are concepts that can be tedious and dry.",
    "Udry has an interesting selection of shirts.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. It's a good intro class and the workload is very manageable.",
    "The course load wasn't too bad: a p-set a week and a midterm and final which weren't too difficult.",
    "I would recommend Economics 115 to another student because it teaches valuable lessons for life and helps you understand real life situations, like insurance, for example.",
    "The class teaches you a lot of what you should know about economics. Take the class. It's not the best, but it's a lot of useful information which you will learn by the time the final rolls around.",
    "The lectures were long and arduous, but the slides were very clear and helped a lot in studying for exams. Overall, it was a good class. I learned what I needed.",
    "The class was pretty good. Kinda boring considering it was a huge lecture but the material was interesting and the problem sets were challenging in a way that made you better understand the material without hitting anything near Math 230.I thought the class was just generally very easy - though the curve to get an 'A' is tough. Easiest A- in the world though.Everyone should probably take this class at some point while at yale.",
    "Great class for people who aren't the best at math but want to keep the left sides of their brains active. This class helped me understand a lot of what I read in the news. It can get dull at times. Not too hard, not too easy.",
    "For someone like myself, who had never studied economics before, this class is based on a lot of concepts that are intuitive, but there is also a great deal of new material to learn. If you keep up with the readings, completing the weekly problem sets should not be tremendously difficult, and the overall work load is not terrible. I think that all students, regardless of major should take this course because it is extremely important to have a fundamental understanding of economic principles, and this course provides that if not more.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 simply because knowing microeconomics at a basic level is important for understanding life (or moving onto courses that will help you). It's not that exciting or thought-provoking, definitely not a life-changer. It's just OK, predictable and solid.",
    "The class is mildly interesting. If you want to be an Econ major, it's a requirement. So you don't really have a choice.",
    "This course is like any ordinary Intro Micro course. Sure, I'd recommend it.",
    "Yes, it is a good introduction to economics, a typical lecture class.",
    "Great class. You'll have a better understanding of the world after taking it. Professor Udry is AWESOME.",
    "It is a typical \"intro\" course that covers a lot of material in a succinct manner. Not very math intensive so anyone with an interest in economics should take it.",
    "Great class to get a foundation in economics. Udry was a dynamic teacher and I learned a ton. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "It's a fairly hard course, but is necessary to take other economics classes.",
    "If Professor Udry is teaching this class, definitely take it. The lectures were interesting and the problem sets were not too challenging. I think this is one of the best intro lecture classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "I think it is a helpful class if you are interested in gathering basic understanding of economics concepts. However, it is pretty math heavy and at times quite confusing. However, the work load is fine and the subject matter isnot too bad once you understand it (recurrent types of questions).",
    "I would recommend it as a very good intro to a useful skill set. (So yes, I'd recommend it!)",
    "It is not the most exciting class out there, but you get glimpses of some really cool stuff you might like to learn about in the future. And it is important knowledge to have.",
    "I would, i thought it provided a great into to economics.",
    "I would summarize Economics 115 01 as a good comprehensive introductory course to microeconomics. While I believe that prior knowledge in microeconomics is very useful for the course, it is certainly not necessary. I would recommend Economics 115 01 to another student based on my positive assessment (as described above) of this course.",
    "This class isn't a throwaway QR, and I think every Yale student should take this economics class before graduating.",
    "If you have any interest in economics, you should take it. It's not an easy class by any means. It wasn't the most interesting or rewarding class either but I definitely don't regret taking it. Micro teaches basics that you need to know, and by the end of the semester, I found myself enjoying the material. Udry was a great professor too.",
    "I highly recommend micro, even if you are not a potential econ major. The course helps develop a skill set that each person should have.",
    "Your basic intro economics lecture. Basically what you'd expect, no surprises. The curve is huge and really really helps if you're on the lower half but is harder if you're towards the top. Basically everyone gets some form of a b because of the people that drop.",
    "I definitely don't recommend taking Micro unless you're an Econ person and plan on majoring in it. There are much easier QRs to take. That being said, the curve is great.",
    "I would say that the largest and most defining characteristic of this course is the fact that it is a large lecture course. Unlike my other courses at the time, this course only really had just one midterm and one final which determined the overall grade. Thus, it is slightly scary that way. Overall, I would tell a fellow student that the course requires one to work in order to understand the material, but it is not impossible.",
    "Yes. Take this class with Prof. Udry.",
    "Great intro course. Definitely take it!!",
    "Extremely light workload- as long as you get the notes from someone, going to lecture or even reading textbook may be optional. Good class if the rest of the courses you are taking require a large time commitment. Material is interesting, and Udry is great.",
    "Every student should take introductory microeconomics of some sort, and the 115 lecture presents the material very well. It would seem, at least, that the lecture is also somewhat easier than the seminars, so if you have never before taken economics, 115 is highly recommended.",
    "Great class, learn a lot.",
    "Basic microeconomics. Lecture is sometimes boring.",
    "Good course. Not too hard and a reasonable work load.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Economics 115 is an introductory course that most will take if they are interested in learning about the world of economics. Students learn about all the basic topics of microeconomics. Professor Udry gives a good overview of all the necessary topics to learn, but his quick teaching with powerpoint slides and long reviews may create a confusing, boring environment to learn in at times. I would recommend this class to students who wish to learn about economics, because this course is an essential stepping stone into the world of economics.",
    "Take this relatively easy class if you want a good grade!",
    "You should probably take it. You wont love it, but it is important to know.",
    "Udry is definitely the guy to learn this from. It's an enormous lecture that meets twice a week, when Udry wears really awesome Hawaiian shirts and delivers an excited and coherent lecture. Then you've got a really boring section that meets once a week, and a problem set to turn in each week. It's a class that every Yalie should take, just for the sake of being a better-educated, more well-rounded human being and understanding how the world works. And Udry is a great guy to learn from: though he was new this year, he's got an amazing natural talent for teaching, gets very excited about this material, and will expose you to the awesome field of Developmental Economics.",
    "A challenging but not too demanding introduction to economics. Udry was a good lecturer.",
    "It was a fairly difficult class especially if you have no prior economic experience. Sections helped a lot though.",
    "I think that this course is a good introduction to the quantitative foundations of microeconomics.",
    "Huge lecture class. Udry was a good lecturer. All the lectures were posted online so you didn't necessarily have to go to class. MAKE SURE YOU GET A GOOD SECTION. But going to class was really helpful, because every week he'd go over last week's topic before starting the new one. Lectures were pretty dry but it's an intro class. I'd say take it if you need it for your major, not really that interesting if not.",
    "Introduction to micro econ. No calculus assumed. Very approachable no matter what level you are coming from. I would recommend it.",
    "A pretty good class. Section can be hit or miss depending upon your TF but Udry is a good professor, and you can get pretty much all you need from going to lectures.",
    "Economics 115 can be viewed in two ways: (1) A way to get one's feet wet in Economics via understanding how the math is supposed to help one understand Economics, while learning little about the math's involvement itself. (2) A slow class that avoids real economics (i.e. theory, models and research) so much, it's laughable.Unfortunately or fortunately, this class will provide just what you are looking--either to take intermediate micro or just get a social science credit.",
    "A good course to take if you want to startlearning about Economics. If you are just starting off economics, be warned that some of the students in the class do have previous experience with the content. There is not too much work, other than a weekly problem set that can be done in a study group. Seek help if needed, particularly from a QR tutor.",
    "Definitely recommend!",
    "100% yes. The concepts we learned are applicable to everything. Absolutely everything. I am not an econ major and definitely enjoyed the course.",
    "This is a good intro to econ. I would take it again. Professor Udry is a really good lecturer, and introduces you to his own field of developmental economics in Ghana - a field that most people didn't know about before the class, but that I would like to work in more now after the class. One midterm, one final, and weekly problem sets.",
    "It is not a great course by any means. The lectures are pretty boring and I didn't feel like much of the stuff we learned was that applicable. Overall it was an okay class. Also, Udry wasn't a very good lecturer. This could have just been because the subject matter was relatively boring but i felt he could have presented it in a more interesting manner.",
    "It is a good course. Udry did a great job.",
    "Yes- having not taken any economics in high school, I feel that I still have a great grasp of introductory microeconomics after the course. The workload is very manageable, and both exams are straightforward.",
    "A good class to get the basics of economics but don't expect it to change the way you look at the world. The class did explain some interesting things here and there but it's probobly too basic to get at the complextity of real life.",
    "Its a difficult course but its worth it. It can be stressful at times because you feel as if you know nothing but after reviewing things become more clear.",
    "This stuff is good to know. Udry makes the subject as interesting as possible.",
    "If interested in economics I would recommend this course in order to pursue future courses.",
    "Economics 115 is a course that Yale students should take. Although the class is not the most enjoyable, fun class, the material presented is important information that Yale students should know upon graduation.",
    "If you can take the seminar, definitely do it. Lectures just aren't an effective means of learning for me.",
    "Professor Udry was a very clear lecturer and lectures were very interesting. However, he did not follow the textbook at all, and I never used the textbook; had I known this, I would not have even bothered purchasing the textbook.I would recommend Econ 115 because it has given me a basic grasp on understanding the market, insurance, and the fundamental concepts of long-run\/short-run. The workload is not bad, and lectures are enjoyable.",
    "Good class to take with Udry- he is so awesome! Not boring at all, and he tries really hard to make students understand the material. Always available for office hours. Also, tests are great because they only test what he teaches in class (he even said so in class) so no need to read the dumb textbook. Very fair class, ok curve. TA's are alright.",
    "Take this class if you need to take it.",
    "Only take this course for a grade if you're looking to be an Econ major, or you think you're particularly good at the kind of thinking Econ requires. If you're a Math\/Science kid, the lack of Calc will drive you mad. If you're into social sciences and humanities, the models will seem overly simplistic and totally not illustrative of how humans actually feel and interact with the world. This is not an easy QR by any stretch of the imagination, and the curve is seriously rough.",
    "only worth it if you take it for credit, otherwise you will get nothing out of it. Take it, but know it is very abstract and conceptual--the information is intuitive but made complicated.",
    "As a disclaimer, I took AP Economics in high school. I would recommend this course to any student interested in the economy or current affairs. Economics provides a different lens to analyzing contemporary issues and gives a deeper understanding of how economies actually work. Although econ 115 is more valuable because it is a pre-rec for great courses, it is still a foundation that everyone should have.The class is not much work at all. It is just one problem set a week that takes roughly 2 hours. If you have a good quantitative background, the course will be easy. It is only algebra but since it is more theoretical some students did struggle to understand the concepts.",
    "Professor Udry was an incredible person from whom to take Econ 115. SO MUCH better than Prof. Karlan. If you're interested in Intro Micro, professor Udry is a SUPERB choice.",
    "Yes definitely. Great class to take at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in getting a rough understanding of economics. The professor is thorough and clear, the sections are helpful if you find the right teaching fellow for your learning style (be sure to shop around and see which one you prefer), and the size, although large, is manageable.",
    "Yes! I had never taken any economics before and found this class very enlightening. It, basically, helps you understand how the people running the world think about how the world should be run. It's great!",
    "Excellent course. Strengths: lecture notes were well structured, very understandable and conducive to learning. The HW helped to strengthen my knowledge of Econ since the questions seemed to be strategically chosen to highlight the most important issues.Amazing teacher!! Taught the class well, great speaker. He made everything understandable and was open to answering questions and clarifying. If he noticed that many people are not understanding atopic, he would revisit it to make sure everyone has gained full understanding.To study for the midterm and final exams, most importantly read over the previous exams: tests are modeled directly from these.Then, HW and section notes. If you have time, then only read over the lecture notes.All the questions come from these resources.",
    "General overview of microeconomics, but the large lecture format of the class can make it really hard to get a lot from class.",
    "It was a good into class, understandable even if you have not taken any econ before. The math in the class in also not difficult, you only need high school algebra.",
    "Excellent course to prepare yourself for further studies in economics, or just for general micro economics knowledge.",
    "This course is for someone who would like a basic understanding of microeconomics and who has an interest in the subject.",
    "ECON 115 really inspired me, but that is because it was taught with an emphasis on developmental economics thanks to Professor Udry. I think that the course does a great job of covering microeconomic concepts. Be warned: calculus is not used, which can be really frustrating for people who are good at\/like calculus. I think the class would have been a lot easier with calculus, but that is reserved for the Intermediate Microeconomics. If you didn't take econ in high school, though, take this class. This class did a great job of teaching simple concepts, like taxes and equilibrium, and their effects. You will enjoy learning about things that will change the way you vote and make you a better citizen.",
    "It's required if you're an econ major. Otherwise, I wouldn't take it. The lecture is just way too big, and instead of actually learning a lot of econ in the end, you learn a lot about how to take Udry's tests.",
    "Econ 115 isn't the most exciting class, but it's definitely worth taking!",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 to another student if they wanted to learn about economics. While I do not know what the freshman only Econ 110 class is like, Econ 115 was very informative and is a good class to take.",
    "It's a basic, fundamental microeconomics class. It isn't too hard and is definitely worth taking as an intro to the major and as a class people at Yale should take.",
    "not a gut class. interesting at times but boring most of the time. fair exams, psets don't take long. plentiful resources (past exams, hw, solutions, etc.) are uploaded promptly, and most of the TAs are good. professor is one of the better ones that teaches this class, so try to take it with Udry. overall, one of those kind-of-useful, kind-of-interesting filler classes that you feel you should take before you leave yale and mostly worth your thousands of dollars for the credit.",
    "Absolutely take micro, especially if Professor Udry is teaching it again!",
    "Eh, it's a course you're going to have to take at some point. I didn't enjoy it, but I'm glad I now have it on my transcript.",
    "Econ with Prof. Udry was actually a pleasant experience. I took intro micro for fun, basically. I am not an econ major and I did not need the QR. I just thought I should understand basic economics. I thought his lectures were interesting, especially when he talked about his own research. Problem sets are very fair, as are the midterm and final. If you want a random 5th class, don't be afraid to take it! But otherwise, many will take this to be an econ\/global affairs\/epe\/etc. major.",
    "I would say it is really important to work the problem sets along side the lectures in order to fully master the material.Since this is a lecture format class, you need to do more self work and accommodate to the large class size. Definitely recommend this class (as it is a prereq to certain majors as well!)",
    "Even if you're not interested in an economics major, take this class for a new perspective.",
    "Not going to be the most interesting class you take, everything seems slightly unrealistic, though it is the solid basic course of economics most students take.",
    "It's a prereq and somewhat useful. Though not a phenomenal course.",
    "Unfortunately for most of you - the only way to study econ. Boring, uninspiring. Don't waste your time reading the textbook, its totally ok to even not buy it.",
    "See answer to Q1",
    "Probably a class everyone should take at some point. Most of it is common sense presented formally, however there are a few neat things you learn about. There's very little homework and the exams are reasonable if you prepare for them, and often predictable based off of previous year's exams. Lectures are somewhat helpful, just don't expect too much of a thrill.",
    "Take it for a QR credit. You'll learn a little but don't expect to fall in love with the course.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class. The class was straight forward and very informative. All the notes were online which was very helpful. The tests and problem sets were challenging but fair. Great class.",
    "I think intro to microeconomics is a very important class for students to take especially for the world we live in. However, I would not take it with Professor Udry. I found him incredibly confusing, even though he seemed nice. I may not know my grade yet, but I know that I did not live up to my potential because I had to teach myself the entire course.",
    "Take it with Udry if possible.",
    "It is a great class specially for students who havent taken econ before",
    "This was a good class. I recommend taking it if you are interested in economics or want to try it out. Professor Udry isn't the most interesting lecturer, but his lectures teach you the material with daily reviews.",
    "Take it if you want a general grasp of economics. Good class - lots of repetition to help ease learning curve. It's sometimes hard to stay awake in class - fight it! Udry teaches on his own and it's not really based off of the textbook at all, so it's important to make sure you understand everything taught in class - don't expect to sleep through class and figure everything else out on your own with the textbook because it skips around a little. Overall, decent class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Although it is a requirement for the economics major, it is also a good basic course for any freshman student, especially one seeking to fulfill his\/her QR credits.",
    "If you're majoring in econ you have to take this course",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Udry is a great professor, and most likely for most people this course is the first Econ class you'll be required to take at Yale. Choose your TA carefully: I switched mine after 2 weeks because he was so bad, so your TA assignment isn;t set in stone. Some people didn't go to TA sections, but I found it helpful since they did practice questions.",
    "I would definitely recommend Econ 115 to fellow student. I think all Yale students should be exposed to at least the fundamentals of economics and this class is a fairly painless way of doing that. Sometimes the material can be a bit dry, but you learn the basic concepts of microeconomics and are exposed to some interesting examples as well.",
    "Solid introductory microeconomics course. Prof. Udry was a decent lecturer, but the sections were by far the most helpful part of the class. Problem sets weren't too challenging or time consuming.",
    "Grading was kind of harsh.",
    "A good introductory class. Not too much work, only a problem set a week .",
    "Great class with Udry...take with him if he teaches again! If you have some math background and if you go to section, you'll be fine.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who desired an overview of microeconomics concepts or who knew they had an interest in econ. Because the course was so large, the sections were extremely helpful, although they weren't mandatory. Professor Udry was conscious of the fact that not everyone in the class had a solid background in Calculus, and discussed things accordingly, but for students with Calculus experience, that could be a bit frustrating. There was one problem set a week, along with a midterm and a final.",
    "You should definitely take ECON 115 if you want a fundamental understanding of introductory microeconomics. Although the class is incredibly large, it has the advantage of always having people to work with.",
    "I would recommend Econ 115 to students who want a basic understanding of markets. It does help one understand vaguely what is happening in the economy. However, it requires a lot of outside research to compensate for the lack of information in the textbook. Lectures would be more productive if calculus were included.",
    "It's a fine intro. The curve is comforting. I wouldn't take it if you absolutely need to be in a small, intimate setting.",
    "I would recommend taking a class with Udry certainly.Econ 115 I would also recommend, my only hesitation would be how it is a lot of concepts to cover with little application to satisfy.",
    "Econ 115 is a great overview of the basic concepts of microeconomics. One can certainly do well in the class having not taken any prior courses in economics. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about the way economists think and the way one might apply the concepts of economics to real world situations. The course does a good job in laying a foundation for further economics courses at Yale.",
    "It is a good course that helps with understanding the world around you in the field of economics. A great introductory course to enroll in.",
    "Econ 115 is a good overview of basic microeconomic concepts. I think this is necessary knowledge for any member of society because as a voter, a consumer an involved citizen, an individual must at least comprehend the general ideas that play into the way an economy functions so as to always make educated and rational decisions.",
    "Good intro course - but most of the concepts are pretty theoretical. Only in the last few weeks do you really get into interesting, real-world concepts and examples. But if you do have to take Into Micro, I would definitely recommend it with Prof Udry - he's one of the better intro econ professors.If you are looking for a more real-world intro to econ (as a non-econ major or something), i would look into other classes. though many classes require 115 as a pre-req, professors don't actually care - and those classes may actually be more rewarding or suitable to your interests."
