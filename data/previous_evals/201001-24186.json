    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It's a great art class that incorporates history and visits to many of Yale's holdings.",
    "It meets Tuesdays and Thursdays, with each Tuesday spent doing various art projects in the studio of the beautiful art building on Edgewood, and most Thursdays spent at Yale's different art galleries and special holdings. It's really a great class - not only will you become more comfortable making art, but you will also become knowledgeable about the many truly vast resources Yale has to offer. We also took a trip to NYC to see \"Slash,\" a paper exhibition at the Museum of Arts and Design, which was amazing! Take this class! I feel bad for everyone who did not take Paper. Do it.",
    "Paper is like kindgergarten, but all grown-up. You are given the materials and some basic ideas of assignments and then are allowed to roam free. It is a half-studio, half-seminar class, with one day a week spend in the studio working on projects and the other day spent visiting museums, galleries or meeting with local art professionals learning different aspects of the art process.",
    "Take it! Good for the soul."
