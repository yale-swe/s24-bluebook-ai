   "comments": [
    "Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne. You've probably read three out of four already but probably not with the closeness and the accuracy of this class. I would recommend it, once again, unless you can't stand writing literary criticism or analysis.",
    "I really enjoy poetry so I loved this class. however, if you are easily deterred by complex prose and medieval English language, this class may not be for you as Spenser and Chaucer did prove to be tricky at some times.",
    "I was placed into this class as a freshman, and had no idea it was intended for English majors. However, I found it the most challenging and rewarding class I took this semester. If you enjoy poetry at all, I would highly recommend this class; it's a lot of work, but extremely worthwhile.",
    "I would. The material you read is really interesting, and Shakespeare and Donne are absolutely brilliant. You will become a better reader, but I definitely recommend shopping different sections and making sure you get a good professor.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in poetry and wants to learn about it. This course also improved my writing skills.",
    "This class will make you read a lot of British poetry, and will really make you think about British poetry. If you enjoy that, or think you could possibly enjoy that, this is a wonderful class to take. If you don't think you could enjoy it, still give it a shot! It's beautiful stuff taught by an excellent teacher.",
    "English 125 is a class for those interested in deep analyses of the English poets Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne. I recommend this course to people who are either strongly considering the English major or have a great love for close-reading of English literature. Some of the material is dense, but if you have a love for language, it should be worth the toll. If you don't like writing long analytical essays about poetry, I would think twice about taking this course.",
    "Yes, English 125 is definitely an interesting class to take. It might be more work than you'd like if you're not an English major, but no matter what, I think it's important to read some of the poets who laid the foundation of English poetry.Take this class with Professor Manley if you can. He's a very fair, consistent grader who's looking more for clear, thoughtful arguments than brilliant theses. Your close reading skills will improve under his guidance, and you'll learn a lot from his input during section.",
    "I would recommend it to all interested in learning to do extremely close readings of poetry. That is what the course is about and that is what you learn. I have found these skills incredibly useful in all my other classes, as it makes you a much better reader.",
    "I would summarize English 125 with the BlueBook description, which I thought was very accurate. I would recommend the class to another student, but I would encourage that person to take it with a different professor. Cathy Nicholson covered our class one day this term and it was one of my favorite discussions. She was great. (My other two favorite discussions were those led by Paul, the English grad student paired with our section.)",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone wishing to improve their analytic skills who is not afraid to get B's on papers. The more you put into the class, the more you get out ofit, and your hard work is rewarded with an improved ability to draw meaning from poems and construct logical arguments."
