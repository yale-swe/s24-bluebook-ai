    "Take it.",
    "Grammar improved! It is a bit more challenging than 130, but I would go for it if you want to continue studying Spanish. Overall, a pretty good course.",
    "Great class. If you took 130, expect much more conceptual work and more difficult\/complex grammatical ideas.",
    "You have to take it if you're trying to learn Spanish. Daily classes suck, but it's the most effective way to learn a language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's exactly what you would expect. It can be a lot of busywork, but you come out with a better grasp on grammar and improved fluency.",
    "Spanish 140 was a class that involved a lot of work at home and in class. It consisted of constant preparation for homework or projects or quizzes. If you have to take this class to fulfill a requirement, then you do it, if its not mandatory, avoid it.",
    "Good review of grammar and useful vocab.",
    "It's like spanish 130 but more projects.",
    "Lots of work, rewarding, awesome if you have Tanya as your professor."
