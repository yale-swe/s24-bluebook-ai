    "This is an easy class if you don't make it otherwise. Take it if you have the motivation to make it interesting for yourself, if you are truly excited by the project of translation, and if you have the time to pick interesting, meaningful tasks for yourself. This class is what you want it to be, and Barbara Harshav is terrific.",
    "Yes, take this class if you're interested in language. My favorite part of the course was the translations we workshopped in class towards the end of the semester.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Barbara Harshav is disorganized and completely unable to focus on anything, least of all the matter of translation. Two-thirds of the class is focused on theory, and the level of sophistication\/rigor is pretty much dinner-table conversation (and your parents are probably more thoughtful and focused than Harshav). The actual translation part is fun, but Harshav doesn't actually look at the original language, and she can't keep track of time so she'll often spend an hour talking about one person's translation and not look at other people's work at all.",
    "LIT302 was a low stress class I really enjoyed because of my interest in translation. Don't take it though if you're looking to be put to the ultimate test.",
    "Great class. All up to you as far as how much you invest in it. It's a fun group of people that usually take it and you have a lot of fun given everyone knows different languages. Great discussions and not a lot of pressure. Barbara is a sweetheart, and is also very sharp.",
    "If you're even a little bit interested in this then the class will probably satisfy your interest."
