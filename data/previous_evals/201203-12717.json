   "comments": [
    "Recommend this class. It is off the beaten path of a lot of other CS courses, and you come away knowing a lot more about how complicated something as simple as making a phone call really is. I can definitely see how I might use what I learned in this class later in life.However, hopefully the next time, Professor decides to remove the complicated equations from the powerpoint slides (there must be better ways of giving equations to students)...",
    "The class material is interesting, but it is so poorly presented that one has to basically teach oneself everything, after spending hours trying decipher the slides. I'm glad that I was forced to learn the material and do the homeworks because I do have a MUCH better understanding of how the wireless world works.",
    "This class was really good. We learned a ton about wireless networks and communication, and did some fun android app development. The first part on the physical layer was kind of messy as there was much more math than I would've liked, but the rest was great. Prof. Yang is amazing and very involved in the class, and a great resource for sure.Overall the class was good. I think the second half was much better than the first half.",
    "A difficult but rewarding class. In-class, we started with a explanation of how signal is created and transmitted for analog, then move onto the same thing for digital systems (with all of the additional intermediate algorithms and methods). Then, we learn some APIs (mostly Android, but also basics of iOS). Finally, move onto how mobile networks work on a link and physical-layer level - how do we handle switching between towers? The final project is to build something out of Android, iOS, or other APIs, and includes Android items. The professor is quite clear and the well-made Powerpoints are online. Nevertheless, he has a tendency to go into complicated mathematical digressions that no one understands. There is one midterm, 3 problem sets taking about 100 hours in total, and a final project in a group. This class is great if you want to learn theoretical concepts for signals transmission and networks. If you just want to do app development and hate learning about physical-layer networks (which I think is something worthy of learning regardless), just study app development in your own time.",
    "Take it for a fun CS credit. But definitely work in groups on the psets. They are super difficult but not in content.. difficult in getting terrible software to work, and setting up workspaces, etc.90% of the work in this class is fighting GNU Radio or Eclipse to do what you want. The actual \"logic\" behind most assignments is a piece of cake.",
    "Decent course, but possibly not worth it. It was one of those where it would take an hour to do something that should have been done five minutes, just because the program we had to use was terrible, etc. If you're taking it for mobile, be wary that with us at least, he only spent half the class on it, and the other half got pretty in-depth into the physical layer. Look at the syllabus and see. Ends up being more work than you might realize, but nowhere near 323, OS, etc.",
    "Pretty great class that actually has a legit group project (usually Android apps) for our final assignment. The class is structured into a few parts, with signals and radio for the first part, app development in Android and iOS for the second, and various wireless network schemes for the third. The first part is dense, and difficult for non-EE\/CS, butthe other two are okay, and the whole course is well-taught and clear with lots of great PowerPoint slides. Professor Yang is also great, and I encourage everyone to get to know him outside of class!",
    "Hmm. Well it's interesting and I feel like I learned a lot. The android stuff was useful I felt for mobile operating system design. But a lot of the info was very complicated and the gnuradio assignments were a little silly sometimes. Simply figuring out the assignment was really the biggest hurdle. Work together with people. Some assignments are a lot of work and there's a final project. Don't worry too much about the midterm. Also the material after the midterm barely matters because there's no final",
    "Pretty cool class on wireless systems and mobile computing. The beginning part about the physical layer was pretty boring and hard, but the end was much better as we moved into developing for android and iOS. I'd recommend it, with the caveat that the class can be really confusing at times."
