    "Math 115 was really hard. Regardless of what instructor you get, the material is very difficult and the pace is really fast. I wouldn't recommend the class unless you have to take it to fulfill major requirements.",
    "Yes but I would warn them about the considerable self-study portion of the syllabus. The subject matter seemed fairly dry but is necessary for further studies in Math.",
    "I mean, I'd recommend it because it's useful. But, it was my least favorite class overall because I would do fine on homework, and be dumbstruck on tests.",
    "The tests require an extremely conceptual knowledge of the material along with practical.",
    "I would recommend math 115 to fellow students but this course is not by any means \"easy\" even if you have taken a comparable high school course. Tests are based on the concepts you learn and sometimes combine several concepts so tests can seem a little abstract. Some weeks problems sets are easy while others they are challenging. The course is manageable and I do not regret taking it.",
    "Math 115 was frustrating in the sense that it was focused more upon turning in psets and taking an exam than really understanding the material. I would only recommend the course because it is a necessary class on the math track, not for the quality of the course."
