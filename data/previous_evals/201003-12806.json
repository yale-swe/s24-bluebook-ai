   "comments": [
    "Great course! Really laid back. Learned alot while having fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone who wants to draw, but doesn't really know anything about drawing. It's fun and can be challenging. You get as much out of it as you put into it.",
    "Take it if you want an easy, chill class that you're actually going to enjoy. You can be really creative on all the projects, they're very flexible.",
    "Yes. Everyone at Yale should take at least one art course during their time as an undergraduate. It really expanded my humanities education and introduced me to interesting people from around campus.",
    "Sam Messer is a wonderful human being. You could take Reed's class if you want to work really hard on technique or you could take Storr's class if you want to get some art history lectures in as well. But take Messer's class if you're interested in exploring personal style of expression (along with learning the basics in the first few weeks).Class is very relaxing; we always played music (sometimes he brought donuts mwaha), and the crits are informal but very informative. There are only 3-4 homework assignments, and the best project of the semester was a life-sized portrait of Adam and Eve (drawn in class) in an environment of your creation. The days when models posed for us were my favorite.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Great for people who do not have much experience drawing and I think the other students who did have a lot of prior experience would say it was great for them too.",
    "Very fun class, and you definitely leave a better artist than when you came in. you DO NOT need to have art experience to take this class.",
    "Basic drawing (at least with Sam Messer, it varies) is an opportunity to spend a couple of hours a week practicing drawing, being exposed to art and ideas and techniques. Sam is particularly good about teaching composition, and it seems that technique is secondary- but he does care about technique as well. He can be slightly callous, but overwhelmingly is goodnatured and funny.",
    "Basic Drawing involves a series of large-ish drawing projects, each one theoretically focusing on a slightly different method of drawing. I would not recommend it - if you're an art major and have to take it, take it with someone other than Sam Messer - who offered no one-on-one advice ever, and took no interest in his student's work. The only plus with Messer is that there is very little homework.",
    "Sam Messer was an awesome art instructor. He encouraged creative freedom that most basic drawing classes don't. We did a little of everything: the basics like the use of line and shape, still life, landscape, and figure drawing. The projects we did weren't really presented as projects. They were more a gradual building of a scene from class to class. For example, we drew a female figure, and then we were told to add the ground and then we were told we were going to be drawing a male figure and it was to be a scene of Adam and Eve in whatever way we'd like to present it.",
    "It's a great class if you want to get better at drawing with minimum stress and not a lot of work. If you come to class focused and ready to draw twice a week, you'll have fun and improve.",
    "Art 114 depends entirely on the professor from whom you take the class. I would recommend Professor Messer's section if you are looking for a self-directed experience, which allows you to branch out in different artistic mediums. You really learn from using your eye and drawing from life a lot, so you should have a confidence in your basic skills going into the course because you don't spend a ton of time on clearly spelled out technical things. This class is about exploring, and challenging yourself in a range of ways, so you figure out what you really like about art.",
    "I enjoyed this class. Sam really trusts his students to do their best with drawing. Where in other classes you will spend a lot of time drawing circles or a boring still life, Sam gave us the freedom to explore. On many class days we had models to sketch or work into our drawings. Some projects were more ambitious than others, but overall I feel like I accomplished a lot. You will improve over the semester. I didn't have the motivation to work much outside of class, but you will improve greatly if you can stay disciplined by yourself. I sometimes wish there was more guidance from Sam and the TA, but it was fun to experiment on my own and arrive at something distinctly mine, though perhaps not technically perfect. I hadn't really considered drawingbut took the class to meet the art major requirement. I wasn't entirely blown away, but I find myself with the urge to draw more after the class has ended.",
    "Absolutely, take it. If you would like to spend two relaxing afternoons a week drawing and listening to music, yet improve and be inspired at the same time, this is the class for you."
