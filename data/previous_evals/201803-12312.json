    "I learned about vectors, double and triple integrals, vector and line and surface integrals, and about several other mathematical processes related to these.",

    "I don't need to reinvent the wheel if a true evaluation of math 120 has already been published in the YDN: https:\/\/yaledailynews.com\/blog\/2018\/11\/01\/yang-and-liu-reform-math-120\/. As a quick factoid, someone told me that after that article was published, someone who took the class in 2010 (!!) resonated the same feelings. Nice to see that in eight years one of the most popular math classes in all of Yale hasnt seen much improvements. Id also like to say that none of my opinions are personal to myself, amongst all the older friends I have, Ive been told that in 3-4 years worth of Yale classes, Math 120 has been many of their worst classes by far. I'm really not quite sure what I learned in this class -- I'd learned multivariable before, but even that couldn't help me with this class. Grading should not be the most important thing in any class, but Math 120 is designed in a way which demands unnecessary detail versus actually learning the material. As an example, on one of my midterms I accidentally said 1+1 = 1 or something and instead of taking like a few points off for a juvenile mistake, I got 15 points off a 20 point question. This is incredibly disheartening after spending hours studying, attending review sessions, and mastering all the topics. This combined with the unnecessarily aggressive grading schemes of the problem sets (I once got a 0\/10 on a problem even when I literally got the right answer) taught me the math 120 isn't about understanding the concepts but rather being good at simple math. Instead of spending time going to the review sessions before midterms, Id suggest a visit to your local elementary school to practice your times tables with a 5th graders multiplication flash cards -- this will save you a letter grade or two.",
    "Learned Stokes' and Greene's theorem.",
    "I grew comfortable using a variety of formulas and tactics of multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned a lot about three-dimensional calculus, and how to bring single variable calculus into higher dimensions.",
    "My ability to incision 3d graphing grew a lot.",
    "A lot of math! Like also solidifying some math concepts.",
    "Better problem solving overall",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths- -Covers a suitable amount of material - Has well-planned lessons - Clear material Weaknesses- - Grading system (course should be curved) - Material jumps around and is often not connected - Tests often do not contain material reflective of what we learned in class Improve- - Connecting material more - Testing of material - Grading system",
    "I think the course covers a good range of material. However, I think a lot of class time was wasted on practice problems that had to be done with peers, which was not beneficial to me. Many of the students either had previously taken the class and knew how to do the problems easily, and the rest had no idea how to approach the problem because it was something we were learning that day. I think class time would be better used if the professor explained more in depth the concepts and did the problems step by step with us from the beginning. The peer work is not something that benefits me as a student in math class.",
    "This course is very very fast, and there is a lot of discontinuity between sections with different teachers. This particular section I thought was taught pretty well, but the P-Sets can be long and it is easy to fall behind and feel unprepared for the exams. I felt the need to seek outside help many times.",
    "Strength: The exams were pretty fair. Weaknesses: A lot of material in a condensed amount of time, and most of the professors don't do a good job of teaching the material so that the students understand it. Personally, I did a lot of self-studying in order to understand the material.",
    "Id like to preface this by saying that the weaknesses of this course are in no way personally related to Professor Itziar -- she is actually a fantastic teacher\/person who really cares about her students, presented us with very clearly laid out lecture notes every class, and was always attentive and willing to host office hours. Now, the pleasantries aside, theres not a single strength about Math 120, it is the weakest class Ive ever participated in 18 years of living. Taking Math 120 is one of the biggest mistakes I made in my entire life. I spoke to many people telling me how bad the class was, but being the naive freshman that I was, I didnt listen. Dont be me, listen and dont take Math 120. Need it for your major? Try ENAS 151 -- I mean literally any class is better than Math 120 so you cant get any worse. Im not sure 4000 characters is enough to express my full disgust of this class, but Im going to try. Do you know those moments in life that youre filled with so much happiness and joy that you just cant describe what youre feeling in coherent words? Imagine that feeling, but in the complete inverse direction (ha, a math pun, sorry to tell you but youre going to learn more about math in this review then you will in the 26 75 minute Math 120 lectures), and thats how I feel. I wasted 1950 minutes sitting in the basement of LOM (a building that I pledge to never walk into again), and I will never get that day and a half back in my life. There are a lot of objectively bad things about the class, but I dont think thats the worst part about Math 120. One should expect that a class taught by a mismatch of grad students\/first year professors (some with very limited English, Ive heard) might be taught pretty awfully, thats fine, the issue is that its so bad that it legitimately discourages people from taking math or STEM classes again. Imagine being placed into Math 120 over the summer as a first-year, having no idea how hard it was but simply just wanting to take a math class, and then going through the rushed, confusing pace of Math 120? How does that encourage potential STEM majors at all? Im an engineering major whos always done fine in past math classes, but left Math 120 hoping to never have to take math again. I know Im not the only one who thinks like that, and thats particularly disheartening. I understand that the pace of the class is unavoidable -- there are many topics Im sure this class has to cover in order to prepare its students for harder classes, but then why make the actual course work so hard? Am I really going to learn any more math just because you took off 5 points on my problem set for multiplying something wrong? The environment of the class forces students to learn how to earn a good grade in the class rather than try and understand the material itself. Also, it would be wrong to assume that all Math 120 classes are taught equally. There is Math 120 with Sudesh (an actually fine class I hear), and Math 120 with literally anyone else. The reason Math 120 doesnt 1.0 rating across the board is because its skewed by Sudeshs competent teaching. Dont be tricked, the class is even worse than you think. I know that in recent years Math 120 has gone over restructuring to try and make it a better class, and I believe that it has improved, but much more still has to change. This criticism comes with the hope that the lecturers of Math 120 (Sudesh and Co.) can create a better class for years to follow.",
    "There was not consistency between the different sections.",
    "We never really answered the \"why,\" proved anything, or talked too much about applications. We learned formulas and practiced them very repetitively.",
    "Less topics would allow more time to digest the information and put them in relation to each other, rather than just learning each separately and having to figure out how we use all of it together.",
    "This course went very fast. We learned a new thing each day, and rarely had the chance to practice it in class again before the midterm or final. I think this class could be improved by having quizzes each week on the material, or recapping the previous lesson in class each day, just so that there is some continuation. It was difficult to learn something one day and then not use it again (except for the p-set) until the test.",
    "Strength is that it is very structured Weakness. There should be one or two review classes",
    "Please let all the sections have similar notes. Its very hard because some section focus more on different materials, which may not show up on a test.",
    "Each lecture was clearly taught; however, the end of the semester proved diffucult because all of the material was combined together for the first time.",
    "weakness is different tfs mean the learning happens differently making some better than others.",
    "Strengths: Very good content, the professors are concerned about our learning. Weaknesses: Too many people that already know the content in the class, so sometimes the class goes faster for those who are learning it for the first time.",
    "It moves at a fast pace for those with no prior experience",
    "This course is good at forcing you to work on everything you learn, with the weekly problem sets doing a good job of testing whether you fully understand the material. The course is, however, very unforgiving, and moves very quickly, making it easy to get lost."

   "comments": [
    "I would maybe recommend this course to another student. It is difficult, and the material taught is not applied to anything other than math for the sake of math, so I would only recommend if you enjoy math. I personally do, but even then I did think the course was difficult.",
    "At the moment, I would probably not recommend this course to another student. I think it was a great challenge, but there are still many things to be improved upon in the class for students who have never taken a multi variable calculus course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who needs to take multivariable calculus as a prerequisite. Otherwise, it is best to take a lower math class, especially if you are pre-med.",
    "I would recommend another student take literally any other course before they take Math 120. Again, ENAS 151 gives you the same credit even for majors that arent in engineering!! Please save yourself and learn from past students mistakes, the only way to force a change in Math 120 is to abstain from taking the class. When I look back on my first term at Yale, I know I will remember so many fond memories, but I guarantee you I will never forget the hell that is Math 120. If youve read this review and still take the class, I told you so.",
    "I had a good experience in the class and was able to build a solid foundation for math classes I plan on taking later on.",
    "Sure, if you want a basic intro to multivariable calculus that is immediately usable. Not if you actually care about math.",
    "I think it depends on the student. I think this class would be okay for someone who has had exposure to multivariable calculus before - they would be able to keep up with the class even though it goes very fast. For people who have never taken multivariable, however, I don't think I would recommend this class. It is hard to get a good grasp on the material when we only learn it once and do not revisit it.",
    "Yes I would but I would advice them to really stay on top of each topic",
    "Yes. I would recommend it. Make sure you get a good teacher (or a teacher that will teach you information on the final).",
    "Yes. Even though some professors are better than others, and the tests are very hard, I learned so much over very little time.",
    "If you are prepared for the work and understanding it then yes",
    "Yes, this class teaches you a lot of important concepts that are very useful for the technical studies.",
    "I would recommend it if a student is very interested in math and is willing to possibly put in a good amount of studying to do well",
    "I would recommend it only if the student is willing to put in a lot of work and be heavily challenged by the material."
