   "comments": [
    "218 is the first course of a 2 semester sequence covering ear-training and keyboard skills that is standard in all music programs. We covered sight-singing, melodic dictation, chord identification in class and in lab we practiced figured bass. I took this class with Sarita Kwok and really enjoyed it. The class is really chill - there is no homework assigned except for any additional practice you might want to do - but you will improve so much by going to class 2 times a week and doing these exercises. Sarita is a great teacher and very approachable. I think this is a must-take class for any serious musician.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student! It might be helpful to have 205 first, if possible, but it was doable with only having passed out of 110. Practicing is crucial though, so if you realize it might be a challenging course, make sure you'll be able to dedicate enough time to it. Taking it Credit\/D\/Fail might have made it a bit less stressful as well, as basically all of the grading is based on practical skill assessments. Overall, however, it was a great experience!",
    "I learned SO much in this course. It's a great course that covers essential skills every musician should have. I came into it with essentially no background in singing or ear training, which meant that at times I struggled quite a bit. But that also means that you don't need any background in ear training in order to succeed, as long as you practice a ton and aren't put off by B's and C's on the assessments (it's a perfect Credit\/D course). Don't be discouraged if you feel like the material is second nature to everyone else and that you're the only one who isn't getting it; I'm not especially musically talented, and I still managed to become pretty competent by the end of the semester!",
    "Make sure you're in the right class. I took the Music AP in high school and found that I was way too advanced for 218. The trade-off, of course, is that I did virtually no work and did very well on quizzes, which was nice. The keyboard labs are annoying (imagine the most boring piano lessons ever), but if it gets me pre-reqs for the music major, I'll do it. Sarita is really cool.",
    "Do it if you want to advance your listening abilities: chords, melody dictation, etc.",
    "Take it. It's fun."
