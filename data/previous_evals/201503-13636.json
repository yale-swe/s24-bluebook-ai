   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the culture of ancient Rome and the views of different authors on dinners.",
    "The class is fascinating and is a good choice for anyone who knows Latin and is interested in learning about the niche culture.",
    "Overall, I recommend latin students to take this course. Professor Freudenburg was able to make this subject a very entertaining and enjoyable experience, something that not every latin professor is able to do. The difficulty of the course is very fair and homework is not too overwhelming provided you have a solid background in grammar.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I think it's a great way to get a deeper feel for Roman culture and to learn how to see all the nuances of Latin.",
    "Great class! The professor really makes the class, though.",
    "If you are looking for a good bridge Latin course, or need to fulfill a language requirement, this is a great way to do it. Fun subjects, great professor, and an overall great course.",
    "I would recommend Latin 450 to another student who is interested in an introduction to some of the Latin literature surrounding the specific topics of food, dining, and social history. The course doesn't address the entire corpus of Roman poetry and prose, and the perspective on the texts is substantially historical rather than literary, but for anyone who wants to cover the texts in this way (as well as getting good practice in the fundamentals of grammar and translation) I think the course is a good fit."
