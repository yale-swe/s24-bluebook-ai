   "comments": [
    "I am not sure if professor Williams is teaching this class again but if so, definitely take it. We read a various amount of interesting science fiction books and work on one large paper over the course of the class. For a person who would prefer Renaissance literature over any other genre, I found myself loving the science fiction reads he chose!",
    "10\/10 would take again. Get started on the final project early, it's a lot of fun if you don't have to deal with time crunch.",
    "I recommend ENGL 287 as it covers really interesting literature that few other Yale courses allow one to read as well as opens up an entire genre (science fiction) to the academic world. The course is very fun and interesting and worth taking.",
    "If you want to listen to Prof Williams make a lot of (usually funny) jokes and tell a lot of stories and not have to really do the reading because you never really talk about any of the books, maybe take the class. If you want a class that involves discussion and seminar-style learning, I would look elsewhere.",
    "I highly recommend the course! The class goes far beyond the science fiction genre in its consideration of literature's relationship to the future. Throughout the semester you work on a finding a \"missing text\" that would enhance the course and writing a paper proposing its inclusion in the syllabus. Doing in-depth research on a text of my choice was one of the most fun assignments I've had at Yale. The reading assignments are manageable, seminar discussions enriching, and overall the class is a great experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as it brought many almost-universal themes from this genre to light, which in turn has impacted my outlook on all science fiction \"texts\" I have encountered since being in this course.",
    "ENGL 287 was very enjoyable, both for the syllabus and for the great environment Prof. Williams was able to create. The class has a very reasonable workload and also allows for some thoughtful considerations of literary criticism and the Futurist movements in Italy. Although there are not enough writing assignments to drastically improve your writing ability, it definitely was a great course to take as a complement to lectures, because the seminar style allows for great discussion and also the opportunity to make new friends!",
    "Basically, English 287 takes you through some important works in science fiction and the big themes they represent for the genre. You'll always want to do the readings for class because they are very interesting and you'll like hearing Professor Williams speak about everything that he knows about these topics! I loved this class and would totally recommend it. The workload is perfect, just enough to keep you wanting to do it and never complaining about too much.",
    "Simply fantastic course. If you (fellow student) have ever had any interest in how people envision the future in depth or in a literary sense; if you have ever been interested in sci-fi or speculative fiction; if you're looking for an English course that is fun and stays busy without being overwhelming; if you feel you need to get a little more comfortable with diving into literary criticism; if you're looking for scintillating conversation over fascinating work that goes everywhere... you must take engl287. Regardless of whether you're an English major, this class yields fascinating perspectives, and I don't think I can recommend any class as much as this one."
