   "comments": [
    "If you are willing to read all of the required readings and participate in the class without coasting through it, which is possible, but far from recommended, you will enjoy this class very much. I would definnitely recommend taking this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. The course is composed of four essays, one of which is a research paper that you can write on practically anything. The grading wasn't too difficult so that is always nice. But there is work. This is a writing class after all. Papers take time.",
    "English 114 is a good introductory writing course. I would recommend it to a friend who felt their writing was weak",
    "Take English 114 with Professor Hopper. She's really helpful, and the workload is very manageable. I really feel that my writing improved!",
    "A student interested in religion or a devout religious person should consider this section of English 114. It will engage you in a topic you are passionate about and you will learn how to become a better writer, no matter what level of writing you are at.",
    "Good introduction for freshman. Make sure to pick a writing section topic you are passionate about.",
    "I would summarize the class as an excellent introduction into academic writing, covering important topics for writing in a scholastic environment. I would also say that the class's topic of religion in modern America also made the class very interesting and applicable to current events. I would definitely recommend this class to a student, because it helped prepare me for successful essays in the future.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I have greatly improved my writing as a result of Professor Hopper's teaching style and positive criticism"
