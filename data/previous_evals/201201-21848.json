   "comments": [
    "It's a really broad overview of criminal justice from a ton of pretty disjointed perspectives. Even though you could spend just one lecture talking about as huge of a topic as the drug war, you're often still expected to remember specific details about each topic, as well as from the long assigned readings. I don't think I would recommend the class to another student.",
    "You'll get a critical overview of how the criminal justice system works and what the purposes are.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class. Both the lectures and the readings are interesting and you don't want to miss out on this great professor either. Professor Huber makes lecture worth going to.",
    "Great course on American criminal law.",
    "A primer course on the American criminal justice system. If you're interested in law school take this!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the criminal justice system.",
    "WOW. A must-take during your Yale career.",
    "The course presents a variety of topics in the criminal law, including the evolution of defendants' rights, the moral philosophy of the criminal law, and the edges of the law e.g. juvenile and educational justice.",
    "Not a fantastic course by any means. Has some interesting topics, but not executed well with a dense syllabus full of horribly long and difficult to understand readings. I would definitely take it as a writing credit as writing two 10 page papers and having a final worth 15% is much better than taking a midterm and having a final worth 55%.",
    "A good course about the philosophy and practical applications of the criminal justice system. If you're interested in law courses, take this instead of Akhil Amar's Con Law--it's much less law school-y, the professor is more down-to-earth, and the readings are more interesting. Huber is a great lecturer, though the subject matter has the tendency to pose more questions than it answers. You'll leave it questioning the nature of the law in ways that never would have occurred to you before, but since the course is based in real-life examples, you'll sound a lot less pretentious than if you took MoFoPo. Overall, not the most interesting course I've ever taken, but I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A very interesting lecture course. Unless you really need the WR, take the non-WR version... it's a lot less work with just a midterm and final, both of which are totally doable. There is way too much reading, though.I've had a million sections in my 4 years at Yale, and this was the only one that was actually somewhat fun.",
    "Yes, totally take it. It's fun and the tests are open-note, and the whole thing is just all around enjoyable.",
    "YES.",
    "A really good, interesting intro class to the justice system and the big ideas behind crime and punishment in the united states. I learned a lot, and found the material engaging.",
    "\"Crime and Punishment\" is an excellent Political Science lecture. The main strength of the course is its non-partisan approach to politics. Professor Huber deliberately avoided an excessively liberal or conservative stance on criminal justice policy. He presented both sides of the arguments and emphasizedthat liberal-conservative distinctions often do not hold; liberals and conservatives sometimes agree with each other and sometimes disagree among themselves. The syllabus is robust and consistent, including pertinent and thought-provoking topic areas. I enthusiastically recommend the course to anyone interested in criminal justice.",
    "This class is great -- you cover a good range of material related to criminal law and history of the criminal justice experience in the US. Take it.",
    "an emphatic NO. unless you really like the criminal justice system. there's a lot of reading. about 3-4 hours a day.some arrogant hotshot preps in the polisci department will tell you only freshman say this but trust me, nobody in my section did all the reading and the TF was often frustrated by this. seriously, be real...if you're not willing to put in 3-4 hours a day to prepare, take another class.and huber is wayyyy overrated. he isa pipsqueak, impatient, bad-tempered, short man who always has a cold. i mean, for real, how can a man be sick for like 3 straight bloody months? PASS!take another class!",
    "Absolutely. Not too much work if you don't take writing-intensive track. The readings can be a little dry sometimes but usually cover pretty interesting topics.",
    "This class is a really good overall introduction to crime theory. Take it as a good foundation course.",
    "I definitely would, the material is interesting and the professor is great.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you have any interest at all in the criminal law. This course has caused me to consider law school so if you have any interest in law school I would definitely recommend taking this course.",
    "Take it ! Its one of the best courses I've had here at Yale.",
    "This was a great class. Lecture and the readings were both interesting. Professor Huber is great and practical (he assigned an entire book to be read right after the midterm and then was smart enough to give a lecture assuming that none of us had read the book yet). The exams are open note, so the class is pretty stress-free, especially if you're good about going to class.",
    "I would recommend it! Really interesting course and makes you understand our justice system and why it is\/looks the way it is.",
    "Crime and Punishment was an interesting course, albeit a bit scattered at times. All of the lessons were interesting, but at times the broad range of topics \u0097\u00a0from political philosophy to the politics of law to specific \"edges\" of the criminal justice system \u0097 made me feel like there wasn't a unified point of the course. Overall though, a very solid lecture. Not too much work, especially if you take it writing intensive (which you absolutely should do).",
    "This class has a lot of work, but it is pretty interesting. Professor Huber is great, I would recommend taking the class just to have a lecture with him.",
    "No. Not in the least. Haphazard in points (trying to be) made and otherwise unengaging, I did not enjoy this course at all. Adding fancy terms and reams of sociological prognosticatory writings to what can really be boiled down to \"do you vaguely understand the law in America and have watched law and order,\" I did not enjoy this course at all. In lectures, stop raising potential concerns about the criminal justice system and start arguing a point for one side or the other. This is what made the drug war lecture the best of the semester (and what weakened every other one). There was also far too much reading to be beneficial to the class (and much of the reading seemed only tangentially related to the topic of the day).",
    "This may be the best lecture class I've taken at Yale, and I have taken a huge number of the \"must-take\" humanities and social science lectures at Yale. Prof Huber is incredibly engaging and makes the content of the class accessible and applicable to life beyond school. His lectures are meticulously prepared and effortlessly delivered. I took the class as a writing section which was great, as it only involved 2 8-10 page papers, then a final at the end. I recommend this class to anyone who would want to learn more about the criminal justice system in the US, which is absolutely fascinating and very relevant to our lives! Be mindful that there is a LOT of reading and you are held responsible for it in the writing assignments and the exams.",
    "Really really worth taking for a poli sci major, or anybody with a remote interest in crime and punishment or law school",
    "This is a survey course. If you are interested in an introduction to the criminal justice system, then I would recommend it. But if you are looking for something more in depth, then I would have some reservations. Professor Huber allows you to think about many of the big questions related to the criminal justice system, but if you have prior (academic) experience with it, these \"bigger\" questions may just seem like \"obvious\" questions.",
    "A great class that helps teach you about the criminal justice system and what's going on in our real world. Definitely my most interesting class of the semester",
    "A good foundation course for students with an interest in law. The lectures were mediocre with maybe four total that actually felt worthwhile. Lectures are inconsistent with course readings, meaning one nuance is brought up in lecture while readings discuss a whole set of other nuances. However, it's a good prep course to get you thinking analytically on the intricacies of the criminal justice systems (i.e., plea bargains,prison guards unions, purpose of criminal law, Foucault on punishment, racial profiling, insanity pleas, juvenile justice system and juvenile delinquency, right to counsel\/defense attorney). Be forewarned that midterm and final exams, while open notes, are oddly phrased and don't grasp the scope of course readings so they don't give you a chance to show everything you've learned. This could be both an advantage and a disadvantage.",
    "Recommend to anyone interested in thinking about the criminal law.",
    "This class is very interesting although it asks more questions than it answers. If you can get through the theoretical beginning it gets more practical, and in my opinion more interesting because Huber applies the philosophers to the practical arguments. I would recommend this course.",
    "This is a great class for teaching you about the criminal justice system, and Professor Huber is one of the best lecturers I have encountered anywhere. The class is both very useful and interesting, so I highly recommend it.",
    "This was a decent class. We learned a lot about the CJS and it was great as an intro level class. They're pretty tough graders, so don't take it as an easy class. You do need to do the readings and attend class to do well.",
    "BEST CLASS TO TAKE CREDIT\/D!!! Awesome lectures, but way too much reading. If you take it credit\/d, you'll get a ton out of it (even only doing a bit of the reading) and it'll be super non-stress.",
    "Yes!! Absolutely but take it as a writing credit otherwise the final is worth 55% of your grade.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in the criminal justice system! It's a great and comprehensive overview that looks at it from different angles and you come away with a lot of fascinating knowledge. I don't know who is teaching it next year, but I hope it's someone as engaging as Huber.",
    "A great introduction into law and the advantages and disadvantages of the criminal justice system. Definitely take the course if you're interest is law.",
    "Great survey class of the criminal justice system, examining criminal justice philosophy, the effect of expert witnesses, expanding defendants' rights, the educational justice system, rendition, private policing, and the juvenile justice system.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the criminal justice system.",
    "Mediocre. A waste of a Yale credit.",
    "Yes. But only if you have time to do *a lot* of reading. You won't get much out of the class without doing the reading, so make sure you do it!",
    "Crime and Punishment is a fantastic class, and definitely the kind of classic course you should incorporate into your Yale experience. It does a great job mixing political science theory with current issues in criminal justice, and Professor Huber's lectures are some of the most engaging and interesting at Yale. You'll look forward to coming to his lectures twice a week \u0097 they're well-rehearsed and the right length at 50 minutes each. Some weeks have a lot of reading, and the workload can occasionally be overwhelming, but it's all interesting if you can fit it in (and it's not all necessary to do well). The midterm and final are open-note, open-book, and the writing section is difficult but rewarding if you'd like to get a writing credit.",
    "a. Overall, I found Crime and Punishment to be a phenomenal lecture course. I enjoyed walking into every lecture and felt enlightened walking out. The topics were always enthralling and Huber\u0092s lecture style condensed multifaceted and complex issues into a logical flow of information. I was undoubtedly pleased with the course, and will remember the information I learned for a long time. If you\u0092re interested in going to law school, or interested in the law in any way, I highly recommend this course for you. If you\u0092re not interested in going to law school, but enjoy being an informed citizen aware of the complex issues facing America\u0092s criminal justice system, this class is also for you. Huber is excellent. I also would recommend taking the writing section, the exams are fair (open note, open book, and easy if you prepare!) but the writing topics are also interesting. Just make sure to get a good TA!\u2003",
    "Definitely recommend this course, professor in very engaging and knows what he is teaching. This course won't make you a lawyer, but a good intro into the American criminal system. Take it writing intensive.",
    "This course is really interesting, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the topic or looking for an interesting WR credit. Worthwhile to go to all of the lectures in terms of being prepared for the midterm and final.",
    "While I would say that the class touches upon a variety of really interesting topics within the Criminal Justice System I would say DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS CREDIT\/D\/FAIL. There are a lot of readings you are held accountable for, many of which are not discussed in lectures. Aside from that, a basic level of knowledge about the CJS is expected, but not completely required. Professor Huber is a great lecturer so Iwould encourage anybody not dissuaded by the above commentary to take this class!",
    "This class is excellent. It was divided into 4 parts: the first examined the moral\/philosophical basis for why we criminalize and punish behaviors, the second examined the politics of the law, the third examined the politics of the process, and the fourth part discussed the boundaries of criminal law (mental illness, juveniles, etc).Crime and Punishment is truly one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Huber is jaw-dropping as a lecturer. His lectures are the most polished that I've heard at Yale, and they are very engaging.I took this class under the WR credit. Two 8-10 page papers and a final. I've heard that the Law School TA that I had was harsher than others, I certainly heard several students complain of getting destroyed on papers. However I think this class is very much what you put into it. If you're taking the WR credit and put in a concerted effort to engage the TA and actually learn something, you'll feel very rewarded. I would recommend the class to everyone (it's a must for those who are interested in law school), and the WR credit to those who are looking to truly improve their arguments and writing.",
    "A lot of reading, but it's almost all very interesting. unless you're taking in WR, it's just a midterm and final, open book and open notes. I didn't feel like the tests presented any information that was unexpected or unfair.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Huber was a very good professor. Though he spoke quickly, he was able to get through so much information in a lecture. And the course has a terrific structure, where its interdisciplinary nature not only allows it to sufficiently cover many different topics from many different backgrounds and points-of-view, but allows it do so in a rather flawless way. I was really impressed with how well everything tied together. It was a great introduction to the complicated criminal justice system. I also appreciated that the course had two different systems depending on whether or not the student was in the WR. I did the non-WR and I'm not sure if I made the right decision. The exams were a lot of pressure (35% for the midterm and 55% for the final) whereas the non-WR students didn't have to take the midterm and the final only counted for 15%, but they also had to write two papers that counted for 35% each, I believe. While I was expected to have done all the readings for the final, it is open note (which was extremely helpful). Go to every lecture though. Huber is fantastic and everything on the exams was covered in lecture. Great course - I learned a lot.",
    "Great class to take as a writing credit because you get a choice of two interesting paper topics, but be prepared to do most of the readings because you'll likely end up with a really intense TF if you take the writing section. Professor Huber is easy to follow in lecture and does a good job of relating\/comparing the authors to one another. Exams are open notes, which is excellent because you can study focused on concepts and understanding of the court cases and then refer to details of each during the exam.",
    "Crime and Punishment is a great overview of criminal law. It reviews key thinkers, the rights of the different parts, the aspects of punishment, and even the fringes of the law. Everyone should take it, since criminal law may affect all of our lives. It will be especially interesting for those who want to pursue Political Science or Law. I would recommend this course.",
    "Maybe. The class is really really broad, so at times it feels disjointed. There's something for everyone here, but that also means that you may end up being bored by a lot of it. You'll end with a lot of unresolved questions, which I think is a good thing because it will inspire you to do further reflection and research on your own. Don't expect to be an expert in criminal law and philosophy after this class. If you're thinking about Credit\/D, do it and stick with it because there is a lot of reading.",
    "Take this class writing intensive for an ideal writing credit.",
    "The class is informative but at times questionably engaging. Huber is a good lecturer, but the course can drag at times. However, if the ins and outs of crime and punishment interest you, this class will provide you plenty of information on a variety of topics. Be sure to get a good TA.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Take it if you want to go to law school or are even considering law school--it gives a great overview of how the criminal law works and why it functions as it does. We also discuss ways the system might be improved. I'm premed and don't plan on going to law school, but even so, it was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Lots of reading, but it's all interesting, and Professor Huber is great.",
    "Crime and Punishment is a course about the criminal law and the criminal justice system. I would recommend the course to any student at Yale. However, be warned this is not a law school course. This course will make you think about the problems in the criminal justice system of this country and the world.",
    "Good class - really enjoyed the material, but be warned that it's much more work than you'd think. I'd Credit\/D it if you're not a Poli Sci major. I found the essays to be really hard (for the writing section) - they're more like political philosophy than the papers I'm used to, and it seemed like much of the class was also unaccustomed to the style that was expected. There's a ton of reading that's pretty much impossible to complete. Grading is pretty subjective and depends on your TA's taste and whether or not they like your writing."
