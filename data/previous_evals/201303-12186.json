    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student. I found myself talking about the books read in class to other people. The course materials were so interesting that the information stayed with me.",
    "The class is a historical exploration of capitalism and mainstream culture in the US. I would recommend it to a student who is comfortable with the cultural turn and cares about US history; not so much to a student who is interested in fleshing out the material interactions of capitalism and culture.",
    "Great, small course for students across disciplines",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course as a great way to explore and evaluate recent and compelling arguments about American history, and an excellent opportunity for understanding the different means and methodologies through which historians have undertaken these works."

   "comments": [
    "I really appreciated the final assignment--a book review of three books about a topic from the course. I was able to read three more books on a topic that interests me and which expanded upon a previous reading.",
    "The course helped me to build a wide span of knowledge on course topics",
    "As a student of a discipline adjacent but sometimes disengaged from the field of American History, this course helped me understand many of the strengths and deficits each disciplines, and challenged me to think of how they might better engage with each other. Moreover, this course provided very useful and close attention to methodology and argumentation, attention I now realize is often lacking in my own discipline."
