    "This class is difficult to describe. On one hand, the workload is very light: there were only 5 problem sets and two presentations (no midterm or final!). However, the problem sets sometimes took a very long time to complete, because it was hard to know where to start. So there were quite a few late nights involved in figuring out how to start the question, but once a group of us figured that out, the problem sets didn't take long to complete.The lectures involve a lot of math. If you're comfortable with that, take this class by all means. Make sure you know linear algebra and inner products though!",
    "This class covers some quantum mechanics (Bloch equations, schrodinger\/heisenberg picture, etc) and a lot of quantum computing (qubits, error correction, some about algorithms, circuits, etc). There were 5 psets and two presentations. The psets were a lot of algebra basically - they weren't hard but it was tough to figure out how to start. The book was absolutely worthless. Reviews from last time said you could just follow the book and skip class, but they're wrong. Prof. Barrett goes over a lot of the homework material in lecture, so go to lectures!Prof. Barrett is very nice and knowledgeable. He really is a great guy and very involved with the students. I think I learned a lot of conceptual things but don't really know how the theory ties in with the math I did for the psets, but the presentations were a great way to learn more about quantum stuff and reinforce my understanding. The class is pretty easy but you learn a good bit. It's a solid 5th credit.",
    "Probably not. There are more interesting physics classes in this range. I took 343 last year and it was way better.",
    "If you've taken quantum before, don't waste your time.",
    "This was an interesting and not overly difficult course. If you know QM already it might be a little slow in the beginning but it does get better. There aren't very many problem sets and they are very doable but even though coursebook was listed as required notes were incomparably more useful when doing the psets so, either go to class or be friends with someone who does. Also journal club is a great opportunity to familiarize yourself with real research in the field and is a great feature of the class. If you are a physics major take it as an easier and interesting elective. Also take it if you are Comp Sci or interested in quantum computing, and how does the theory behind it actually work.",
    "If you need an easy physics class (easy by physics major standards--it's sort of a linear algebra bash so if you haven't had linear you might struggle), take it. I didn't get that much out of it, but Professor Barrett is really nice and we only had 5 psets and no tests.",
    "pretty much the definition of a gut class. you do like 5 psets and 2 short presentations in one semester. it's pretty hard to mess up.",
    "lots of math.",
    "PHYS344 is a look into the world of quantum computing. I would only recommend it to another student if they need it for the Physics major, as it was a hard class to follow and not overly enjoyable.",
    "I'm actually an Econ major, and I would highly recommend this class for people in my circumstances who need to fill their SC requirement. I know that seems weird just based on the fact that the course is an upper-level physics elective, but hear me out. The prerequisites are just basic physics and then a fair amount of math (you definitely need to know linear algebra and diff eq would be helpful but not required). But the course is a really interesting survey of the math behind quantum physics and quantum entanglement, and I enjoyed it a lot more than I would have enjoyed something like planets and stars. If you're a non-science major who just wants a way to use your math background to get you through a science credit, this class is for you. The workload was very reasonable (we were supposed to have 8 psets but actually only had 5), and the final is just a very informal presentation about a quantum mechanics\/information\/computing journal article. Professor Barrett is great - I felt that he explained things very clearly, and he obviously cares a lot about working with his students and making sure they understand the material. I thought the class was really interesting, and I found it to be a really enjoyable (if somewhat unorthodox) way for me to get my science credit.",
    "It's a lecture on quantum physics that focuses a lot on quantum computing. It's a great relief after all the really difficult 400 level courses. Two journal club presentations and a few problem sets that are very straight forward. Even if the material is pretty difficult, Barrett is very eager to meet with his students. I would definitely reccomend this class to others, especially if you're considering doing the major or not.",
    "This is basically a class where you learn some about quantum computing. If you can do math, this course will not be difficult. There are 5 problem sets and 2 journal club presentations. The class is pretty low-key.",
    "Easier problem sets than most physics classes. Quick presentations instead of exams",
    "I would definitely recommend this as an advanced physics elective. It is low stress, well taught, and very interesting.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Easy yet interesting, and Professor Barrett is very chill and awesome.",
    "I would strongly recommend this as a Sc credit for non-majors. There is a lot of math, but not all that difficult once you are acquainted with the bra-ket notation. Physics, math, and CS majors will get through this course just fine.",
    "Not a lot of work.",
    "This is an ok class that you should take only after\/while taking quantum. Without it, you will feel lost. Lots of rather tedious math. That said, Prof. Barrett is an extremely nice guy who is very personable. This class is rather unique in that you read real papers and have to present them, which is something I encountered only in this class.",
    "Not as difficult as the required courses for the major. Neat topics--NMR and quantum computing are great and genuinely cool. Take it if you haven't completed quantum yet or just want a better comfort level with quantum."
