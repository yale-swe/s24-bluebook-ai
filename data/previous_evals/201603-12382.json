   "comments": [
    "Excellent course, which greatly helped foster my critical eye towards medieval translation theory and aided me in my overall research agenda.",
    "I think we received a good overview of the relationship between French and Middle English. I think we also nicely explored the problematic relationship between the ideas of translation and sources.",
    "One of the key things I learned in the course was to think across genre and language when looking at medieval literature. I was accustomed to asking some of these questions with regard to more modern works, but exploring the connections and context of the assigned works in a classroom setting gave me a new perspective.",
    "I had never before taken a class that so skillfully blended the study of medieval texts with the consideration of modern criticism and theory. The reading for each week worked as a coherent unit: it was necessary to process it as a whole in order to come to valuable conclusions. I developed a breadth of new knowledge not only about the subject matter but about the manner in which one can approach medieval texts.",
    "This course was one of the most inter-disciplinary that I've experienced. More so than ever before, I was challenged to think across different languages -- Old French, Italian, Latin, and Middle English -- as well as across different disciplines, including linguistics, music, poetry, translation theory, and methodologies of book history and medieval studies. In particular, the course made me question and think more deeply about many assumptions I'd held about the complications of translation, as well as about the boundaries between narrative and lyric, and between poetry and music."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course had many strengths, but one in particular was that it managed to engage broadly with much material, while also allowing room for in-depth discussions of more specific items when interest was particularly high. No discernible weaknesses to note.",
    "I very much enjoyed the discussions, and I appreciate that for most of the courses Prof. Butterfield had a set of topics that she wanted to cover and sought to involve participants by giving an introduction to the topic. Unfortunately, this is not at all common in Yale English courses, and I very much appreciated to see that kind of structure brought into a seminar here. I also appreciated that early on there were only a limited number of readings each week. That limitation allowed us to better digest texts and, I think, made our discussions quite a bit better. I think there may have been a bit of a rush at the end to incorporate many of the texts on the syllabus, which led to the final sessions not having the structure and level of textual engagement that defined the first part of the class.",
    "I liked the weekly blog assignment as it gave me a chance to write out my thoughts about the content of the reading prior to the classroom discussion. The interface of Classes V2 was a little frustrating (not having the option to edit posts was a particular challenge), but was workable. There was a fair amount of reading for the class, necessary to include both primary and secondary literature. I enjoyed both, but I wish that we could have spent a bit more time on the secondary literature in discussion.",
    "The class, while interesting, seemed to me to be in a strange middle ground between being a course of Chaucer and his sources and a course on translation theory more generally. While I loved having a mix of contemporary theoretical and medieval primary texts in each week's reading, I would have liked the connections between these to have been brought out more strongly in discussion. One of the most fascinating parts of the course, for me, were the small pieces of medieval literary theory and language philosophy that we read, and I think more of this would have been wonderful.",
    "The varied, and intertwined, ways in which the course considered \"translation\" opened up a number of interesting avenues for research and thought; the course encourages students to approach the issues it raises creatively and through different lenses. Given the breadth of reading that each week can encompass, perhaps setting two presenters per week might help improve the flow of discussion.",
    "The strengths: For such an inter-disciplinary undertaking, I thought the course was beautifully tailored for medievalists and non-medievalists alike. Class discussions were both friendly and insightful. The provision of English translations for all the French, Italian, and Latin material was very helpful, and I found that the classes spoke to all manner of interests represented amongst the students -- including those with backgrounds in French, linguistics, divinity, music, art and manuscript history, and numerous others. The weaknesses: The only one I can think of was the amount of reading\/workload every week -- I could easily have devoted all my time every single week to the course alone, because the material and topics for each session were so rich and dense."

   "comments": [
    "I would easily recommend this course to any student at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely encourage a student to take this course or another with Prof. Butterfield. She's a fantastic interlocutor. I can honestly say that this was the best seminar I've had at Yale thanks to her thoughtfulness and structured approach to the course.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The reading assignments were relevant and well chosen for each class and I think that students with a variety of interests would benefit from looking at how interrelated medieval texts of different genres and languages can be.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course not only to medievalists but to people working in other time periods; it showcases how fascinating the study of medieval texts and textual practices can be.",
    "I can't recommend this course highly enough. I found it exceptionally challenging, but it's invaluable. One has to put in alot of work to pull together and connect the threads of the topics each week, since they span languages and disciplines alike. However, the many rewards include learning to think meaningfully about a wide range of fields in relation to one another; learning to think about translation in general as something far more complex than binaries of word-for-word translation vs. loose translation; as well as acquiring a well-rounded understanding of medieval writing, and Chaucer's writing in particular -- and coming to understand that, with texts of this sort, one can never think about given works in isolation from those on which they draw or by which they were influenced. The course also offers ample opportunity to explore disciplines that one might have been unfamiliar with before, given its extremely cross-disciplinary nature."
