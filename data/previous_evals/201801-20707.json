   "comments": [
    "I honestly learned almost nothing. We read so many fragments of so many different thinkers that I came away learning very little about each sage. I came away with some nice general questions (i.e. how is wisdom transmitted? who is wise? how can wisdom respond to human challenges like suffering?), but few satisfying answers.",
    "I read through a wide range of ancient texts - from Chinese to Greece to Egyptian to Indian, this course provides me with a broad understanding of wisdom literature. I learned how to compare the themes and ideas of different sages. I also learned how to draw insights from these texts.",
    "Familiarity with ancient, often non-Western texts an how to read them, with a particular eye toward their representations of wisdom.",
    "A survey of ancient wisdoms from the Mediterraneans to Eastern Asia. Got to read about cultures that are not usually mentioned in the often Western-centric education such as the Bhagavad Gita.",
    "Reading and interpreting ancient texts",
    "I refined my philosophical argumentation, and learned to express the content, in an argumentative or logical way, of texts that are not expressly philosophical."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course is the possibility for comparison across Eastern and Western traditions, which is unusual for Yale. Weakness was far too much breadth and too little depth.",
    "Strengths: The great variety of texts that provides students with a broad horizon in wisdom literature Weakenss: Some texts are not discussed in detailed",
    "Obviously, the course focuses very clearly on representations of wisdom. That focus helps give the course thematic unity, but it can also feel somewhat constraining at times. I would have liked to have more leeway to discuss aspects of the texts we read that related less directly to wisdom. For many of the students in the class, it was their first time reading those texts. I would have liked having a chance to analyze the texts main themes before zeroing in on how the representations of wisdom fit into the the broader thematics. Also, I would have liked to have had more weeks like the last one, in which we dove deeply into a single, longer text rather than surveying six or seven.",
    "I like most of the readings. They are really interesting and engaging. Yet, it sometimes feels like we are just reading a lot of arbitrary texts without a central topic \/ uniting theme. Would love to know how the week-to-week topics \/ readings are related to each other.",
    "Too much reading. This is a lecture course with the reading load of a seminar.",
    "Idk",
    "The syllabus is magnificent. Truly great. Professor Hunter is committed to his teaching program and to his students. He's great.",
    "This course should be radically reconsidered. Rather than the weekly musings of Professor Hunter the course should track a set of ideas or thinkers, rather than making arbitrary comparisons where no one is right or wrong and the conversation goes nowhere."

   "comments": [
    "No. Take a more focussed course where you'll learn substantive things about ancient philosophy. This class covers so many thinkers at the cost of any depth.",
    "Yes, it is a good course into ancient philosophy. You develop a basic understanding of wisdom figures in different cultures and their doctrines. Even people who have no experience in philosophy class like me can handle the work and reading, and can definitely take away a lot",
    "Good course if your looking to familiarize yourself with a variety of ancient, often non-Western texts. If you're looking for a hardcore philosophy class, this is not it. The course focuses on analyzing and interpreting representations of wisdom, not on assessing texts' arguments in a rigorous, philosophical way. That isn't a bad thing; but anyone considering the class should know its focus is more on the literary\/intellectual historical aspects of texts than the philosophical ones.",
    "YES! You rarely get a chance to read about Egyptian, Indian, Chinese, and Greek philosophy together in one course! It is a great expansion to the often Western-centric education at Yale (especially in philosophy).",
    "Yes",
    "I certainly would. The narrative, lyrical, and philosophical power of ancient, Western and non-Western thought is brilliantly demonstrated. The readings are balanced, and the class discussion is both free and guided.",
    "Certainly not"
