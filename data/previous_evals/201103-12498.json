   "comments": [
    "Do not take it.",
    "Very high level of analysis. You'll get way more out of the course if you have a firm and recent grasp of American history. It would also help to have some art analysis. The course is a lot of analysis of texts and paintings, and not a lot of history.",
    "Whether you plan on doing the American Studies major or not, this gives you some pretty solid building blocks in the way of history, cultural history and art history as it relates to the formation of a culture whose aftermath we're currently living in!",
    "If you love history, don't take this course. If you love anthropology and art history, take it. Lotsa reading, but you don't need to do all of it.",
    "I don't recommend this course. Take Professor Jacobson's ForMac class during the 1920-present time period. So much better.",
    "Very insightful class about a historical period that is often neglected. The class is taught in a cultural perspective, ignoring politics and policy and more focusing on trends, art, music, and writing. Agnew delivers great lectures!",
    "Yes, in a heartbeat. It's a really good way of looking at American history - through its culture. Really changed the way I see documents as well.",
    "Take this class! Agnew is phenomenal. His lectures are amazingly crafted, and he has clearly put a ton of effort into them. He approaches the material in a unique way, and will push you to do the same.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are really interested in the information. Play close attention to the syllabus before signing up, and if it doesn't seem like something you'd be into, don't take it!",
    "This is a tough class but it is really worth it if you are interested. It's also a great class for students that don't particularly like history because Agnew approaches historical documents as literature. The lectures were really cool. We ended up doing a lot of art history as well! This is a true CULTURAL history class - different than any other history class I have taken. The weekly readings can be heavy if you do them all, but the course only has 4 true assignments - 2 papers and 2 exams. Your grade will depend heavily on how your TA grades your work, so keep that in mind if you are grade conscious.",
    "It is a condensed course on the creation of the American culture after the Civil War and ending at the first World War. If you are looking for a history course on American history I would 100% recommend this course. It provides wonderful insight in US history and the development of the modern American culture.",
    "Not a class you can disregard but definitely worth taking if you enjoy looking at history from a sociological perspective.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. The course instilled within me a new perspective of history and culture.",
    "I haven't taken FORMAC 1920-20whatever it is, but 1875-1919 what a great class. It was unlike any history class I've taken before, since we only readprimary sources (all interesting, all manageable; I considered it my most worthwhile reading of the semester). It changed the way I view American culture, which sounds wishy-washy but it's true. Section was sometimes a little precious but I appreciate a class where the readings inspire independent reveries...readings I wouldn't have encountered without this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend FORMAC to another student because it's a lot of fascinating history that allows you to go in depth in a lot of subjects while still getting a good \"big picture\" of what was happening from 1876 - 1919. Though some weeks are better than others in terms of reading, the lectures are guaranteed to be awesome. Furthermore, the grading distribution is very reasonable (2 papers, 2 exams, and participation, each worth 20%).",
    "Don't take this course if you arent really interested in the material because there are a lot of readings.",
    "If you don\u0092t like weekly reading responses or American historydon\u0092t take it. There are two 5-page papers which are extremely manageable if you consult your TA. They are close-reading analysis and from what I was told by my TA, we Yalies tend to struggle with this writing because we don\u0092t do it often. I think most people can find at least one lecture super intriguing. Some lectures were big misses and a couple were amazing hits.",
    "The formation of modern american culture from 1876-1919 through music, art, wars, industry, class and racial conflicts, politics, the frontiers, and modernization.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend this class for a fellow student. I enjoyed going to every lecture and expanded my methods of thinking of and analyzing history and American culture.",
    "I would totally recommend this class. You don't know enough about the cultural history of this period in America, and it's really amazing how much of the foundation of modern American culture was set down in this period. If you think you don't like history, but you like art or music or people, I would recommend this class as a way to get into history without much dry political stuff. And if you don't take it - pick a lecture and just go! It's so worth it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. A somewhat heavy reading load, not too much in terms of writing. The lectures are so brilliant and make it totally worthwhile. Professor Agnew is fantastic and this ForMAC is truly a must-take at Yale. Expand your knowledge of an important yet often overlooked period in American history.",
    "I would recommend taking this class only if you're an American Studies student and you need it for a prereq or you're just someone who happens to really love this time period.",
    "Fantastic class. Take it!",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in how American culture and society has been shaped. The course includes historic events, but people and culture are what truly make up the curriculum. It's not a typical history class.",
    "Yes I'd recommend it.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in America or cultural studies in general. Agnew's lectures are mini works of art, taking incredibly disparate facets of society and tying them together to create a compelling argument or observation. And while the class does deal chiefly with its specified time period, the amount of references to and observations about modern culture (hence FORMAC) and earlier eras in American history makes the class seem incredibly relevant. And you can basically just sit and listen to the lectures without taking notes because Agnew posts the slides, with explanations, online. This isn't to say you shouldn't or can't go to class--it just means that you can enjoy the lecture for being an incredibly engaging and entertaining talk as opposed to something you desperately need to remember for an upcoming test.",
    "Take it! It's a challenging course about a period that might seem less glitzy than the more contemporary Formac, but Professor Agnew is brilliant and makes the material engaging."
