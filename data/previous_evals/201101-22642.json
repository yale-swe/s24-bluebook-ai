    "Take this for the professor, Mimi Y. She is a fantastic instructor! She really is passionate about explaining, and is so friendly in office hours. She clearly takes the time to think about what she wants to say in each lecture. It is super easy too.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes, but beware of memorizing names of different Buddhas that are extremely hard to remember. Work on your mnemonics skills before enrolling in this class.",
    "A comprehensive intro to Buddhist art, ideal for those who know nothing (like I did) about Buddhism, the East, or its art forms.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "I really, really hope they totally overhaul this class for next year. I think the main problem this year was organization: we followed the Leidy book so strictly that there was absolutely no overarching sense of where we had been or where we were going. I don't feel that any connections were made between the art pieces we looked at, and as a result, I came out of the class feeling like I had had a confusing trip through too much space and time without any closure on it. Basically, they'll throw literally hundreds of images at you without in any way emphasizing what is important within them, or how they are important within a broader trajectory. This is extremely frustrating, especially because we just can't seem to get a really good, rigorous non-western art history program going here. I also should qualify that I took this as a senior art history major, so maybe it was better for someone who hadn't taken art history before. I just found it incredibly disorganized, and I really hate coming out of a class feeling like I'm no more informed than I was before.All that said, this was the first time they've ever taught this class. They are doing this as a two-semester program next year, and maybe stretching it out will let them take their time with the art a bit more, and spend more time emphasizing what's important about it.",
    "Yes, but you'd really have to be interested in the material. After a couple of weeks, you get tired of seeing similar pictures and discussing differences. The exams (IDs) were difficult.",
    "YES it's a great way to get an exposure to the Asian world, with a great professor, great materials, not too difficult",
    "Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to (ie seniors needing a non-Western class). Please don't take this if it's your first art history class, because it is not AT ALL representative of the department or the major.",
    "Yes - interesting and important material. Definitely rounded out my HSAR coursework as a major, even though I originally took it to fulfill the requirement.",
    "The material is interesting, the lectures are clear, the readings are manageable, and the exams are fair.",
    "It's an interesting alternative to the western art survey. Like any survey, it gets tedious at times and memorizing slides is a necessary evil. Mimi is very warm and encouraging, and I think everyone could benefit from taking one of her classes in order to broaden their view of art beyond the western world. Since it covers the earliest buddhist art, it is very sculpture heavy, so if that's not your cup of tea, I would perhaps pick something else.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone with an interest in Buddhism or art history."
