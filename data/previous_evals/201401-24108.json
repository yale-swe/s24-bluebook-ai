   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, but I would say that it is a course that mostly focuses on text analysis. It is not a course on measurement error, or estimation\/inference in traditional settings.",
    "See the answer to my first question for a summary. I wouldn't recommend the class to another student until he\/she knew that it wouldn't prepare completely for text analysis and that it had a lot of other topics that we skimmed but didn't learn as well. Also, the fact that it didn't have a Teaching Fellow to whom we could go with extensive questions was not ideal. John was available, but it's good to have section and another person to teach the same material again in stats classes.",
    "I'd recommend the class to any political science student interested in quantitative methods. The class is demanding but refers to many interesting applications. My programming skills have strongly improved over the course of the class, and I have learned a lot about edge-cutting techniques that do not involve experiments."

   "comments": [
    "I hope that I will learn more text analysis to apply to my work. If topic models is pretty much all we can do to analyze these texts, then it's really disappointing.",
    "I'm not sure if I will be able to use the skills I've learned in the class in my dissertation -- even if it were sensible -- given that none of the senior faculty in our department use these methods, but applying them well would require a significant additional investment in my statistical and programming skills."
