   "comments": [
    "Developed my skills in designing appropriate studies to test a question, gained skill in looking for potential problems and learned some more skills with data analysis.",
    "Wow. This course was brilliant. I came in with very weak research skills, I left with such a great understanding of how to do research.",
    "I learned a lot about research methods and a little about the evolution of cooperation.",
    "How to conduct research involving game theory.",
    "useless class. learned nothing. took it because i needed an easy class, but this was painfully useless. Rand was a solid guy, but it was very clear everyone knew this was his last semester and he was just cruising",
    "More than anything, I learned how to use Amazon Mechanical Turk. We ran a lot of experiments in class, which was absolutely a unique and cool opportunity.",
    "I learned how to effectively set up an experiment and to account for various challenges that might present themselves.",
    "I learned about how to run psych studies, identify confounds, and properly detail my findings.",
    "Designing experiments",
    "I learned about game theory and about how to conduct psychological research.",
    "Honestly, not much.",
    "I learned basic game theory and a good amount of experimental design.",
    "I learned really nothing from this course.",
    "In depth discussion and practice of various research methods and how to design, run, and analyze experiments in social decision making.",
    "Couldn't have asked for a better course to learn psychology research methodology from. I learned about a variety of psychology experimental designs and their applications, research ethics and proper preregistration, as well as utilization of online experiment platforms (mTurk), all while becoming much more informed about the topics prevalent in the psychology research scene today.",
    "learned how to conduct research",
    "I developed an insight into what makes a good experiment design.",
    "I learned more about game theory and its relevance in economic games, designing psychological and behavioral economics experiments, critically analyzing results, and learning proper experiment design methods.",
    "Learned a bit about different methods for doing psych research, especially online tools. Discussed common problems in research.",
    "Research methods and some game theory; good to take together with psych stats."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Though it was a less structured class, I think it worked well and can't think of any improvements.",
    "Strengths- great professor, great Teaching Fellow, responsive and comprehensive office hours held by Clara, quick responses to emails Weaknesses- would like to focus more on cementing understanding of statistics, more learning about decision making in the real world. I find that psych studies are often to correlational and specific",
    "This course consisted of writing pieces of research papers about class experiments. It was a very loose course structure, but Professor Rand was brutally honest about that up front. It was pretty fun. It was about what research is really like.",
    "Having a class or two dedicated to statistical analyses, conducting them, making graphs, and reporting results",
    "N\/A as Professor Rand is (unfortunately) headed to MIT. Yale needs more psychology professors like him - laid back in the classroom but also focused on research production and getting undergraduates involved.",
    "Strengths - very personalized to our class, really enjoyed critiques of research proposals individuals in our class came up with Weaknesses - social decision making lectures and research methods lectures seemed very disconnected",
    "This course was super fun and I really enjoyed it. I learned a lot and had no complaints with the course.",
    "Good student involvement",
    "I really liked it! Professor Rand is leaving Yale, so it seems like there won't be a chance to improve it. The one thing I would have liked would be to get more feedback. I didn't really get any feedback on any of my work.",
    "This course did not have a syllabus at the beginning, and it's probably one of the central faults. Also, some of the assignments we did were so pointless, especially because we got so little feedback about those assignments. Ok, so we got randomly graded on some assignments. But why did we receive the grade we did? How could we improve? We did not get that.",
    "Strengths - Very interesting course where the students has freedom to decide what we studied Weaknesses - the course was very disorganized at points.",
    "This course suffered solely because of David Rands terrible organization and teaching.",
    "Hands-on approach of proposing, designing, and analyzing studies individually and as a class.",
    "The structure of the course was very effective for me. While it may be a bit chaotic, the freedom to choose our own topics to pursue ultimately made the course much more engaging and therefore effective for my learning.",
    "I thought the strengths were that we did experiments as a group and that the professor showed us different ways to analyste the data in class. I also liked when he showed the flaws in published research. I thought there could have been more assigned reading.",
    "strengths: well put together",
    "This course was amazing.",
    "This course was definitely unlike any I've taken before. It was very much an \"adventure\" as Professor Rand announced at the beginning of the year, and I loved learning and discussing about game theory and how it could be used to test for various economic and social behaviors. Getting to come up with our own experiments and running them as a class, to then see the results and discuss them a week after, always made me look forward to coming to class. However, the class did not match its description in the Yale Blue Book, as it was instead a lot more focused on experiments instead of theory. I would have also appreciated, despite the large size of the class, for each student to get to design their own experiments, but running them as a class was also a really fun experience.",
    "Tons of fun, but learned very little. This course will also probably never be taught again though.",
    "Strengths: teacher\/TA are very clear about what is expected of students and assignments Weaknesses: disorganized (but not unmanageable)"

   "comments": [
    "Yes!! Granted, this course was very loose in structure so it was different than what many others will experience, but still a good and fun class.",
    "If you plan on doing research and are interested in psych, take this course!",
    "For the research methods requirement, absolutely! I have heard that research methods courses can be pretty boring, but this one was cool. Professor Rand talked about mistakes he had made in research. Lots of guest lectures.",
    "I would recommend it, but it isn't being taught anymore",
    "absolutely not.",
    "N\/A as the course will be very different without Professor Rand. In its current form, I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. It strongly exceeded my expectations of how much I would enjoy a class on research methods. I really liked it in the end and recommend anyone, especially psych majors, to take it.",
    "Every Yale student should take this class (with prof Rand).",
    "Yes",
    "Yes it was great!",
    "Well, Rand is leaving Yale, so does it matter? He also mentions he was leaving many times.",
    "I would recommend this course if it were taught by any other professor.",
    "Yes!!! If youre interested in research, take this course!!!",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone, regardless of academic interest. It's just a great way to see what research is like and gives you insight into how to interpret the literature in the field. Unfortunately Professor David Rand won't be teaching this course next semester, so I won't know for sure what is in store for this class for prospective students.",
    "yes because knowing how to put together research is a useful skill",
    "Yes. This is the best course Ive taken.",
    "Although this course will no longer be offered, yes, I would recommend this class to any student interested in game theory and designing social, economic or psychological experiments.",
    "If youre lucky enough to have a chance to interact with david Rand in your life, do it, hes cool. As to this course, hes leaving so I have no idea what it will look like, but the general topics were interesting, some fun game theory.",
    "Yes. If you are a psych student you have to take a research methods class anyway. It was really useful but not overboard."
