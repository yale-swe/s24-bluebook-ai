    "It is a historical overview of urbanization in China since the 1880s. I would recommend it, because it is a great way to put Communism in China in perspective using a very tangible framework, that of urban change.",
    "If Toby Lincoln teaches this class again, be prepared to take an Oxford-style tutorial as opposed to a Yale-style seminar. It's hard to explain what this really means except that he expects you to have a lot more existing knowledge about Chinese history than you might actually have. That said, he definitely knows his stuff and is extremely approachable outside of class if you need help with anything. No matter how you do in the class, you'll end up becoming friends with Toby by the end of the semester because he's just super cool. I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in uban histories and China."
