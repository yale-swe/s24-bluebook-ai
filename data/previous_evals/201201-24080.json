    "Overall not bad, but I didn't find it life-changing like it seems to be hyped.Definitely attend a session if you manage to get in and see how you like it.",
    "Take it. It will become one of those Yale legendary classes in just a few years.",
    "Want to learn who you are? No class will bring you to profoundly grasp where you stand in matters social, political, economic, philosophical, and the like. Enough said.PS Don't let your advisor turn you away because it doesn't \"fulfill\" some requirement. You are hear to figure out who you are and what you want in life. So take Great Big Ideas, already!",
    "Depends on how committed you think you'll be to the class. I'm saying this class is a lot of work because to really get something out of it you have to do a lot of thinking outside of class too.",
    "An extremely good class, one of the best you could take at Yale, but if you let the hype get to you, you will be slightly disappointed. It is a class with work which does not center around the lectures, but on disproving them.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale! Great Big Ideas really made us think and ask important questions, and it became an amazing community. I always looked forward to Wednesdays, when we'd have class from 3:30 to 5:30 and then would go to dinner as a class (and often with a special guest) for the next few hours, continuing the awesome, heated discussions. I feel so fortunate to have had the opportunity to be a part of Great Big Ideas - Can't say enough positive things about this course!",
    "I whole-heartedly recommend this course to everyone. It was the best course I have ever taken. You get to experience really intellectually stimulating conversations for an afternoon that leaves your mind spinning afterward. That's the best, I think.",
    "Most amazing experience I've had at Yale. This course changed my life. The course is all what Adam Glick and you will make of it, he gives it everything, so you should too. Go into it in the right mindset, and you'll start thinking about things you never thought about and discovering more about the world and yourself. However, this course is really only meant for people that are open for crazy debates, a very non-traditional teacher, and no structure or order - if thats not your thing, then leave this course for someone else. We had a few people in the class that just wasted a spot, and thats horrible, cause this is such an incredible opportunity.",
    "TAKE IT. If you want any class that encapsulates a liberal undergraduate education, this is it.",
    "I have probably gotten more out of this class than any other class I have taken at Yale so far. In Great Big Ideas, it's not so much about learning some material that you will then forget as soon as the semester ends. Instead, Adam wants you to learn something about yourself: about your opinions (and how to defend them), your approach to education, and how you want to live your life. Of course, you still learn about a lot of really interesting subjects, which you then spend hours debating with the rest of the class and with Adam, who has some very provocative views! The class is basically one video lecture by an accomplished academic or professional in the field plus some readings every week (readings are pretty optional since we rarely talked about them, but they're typically really interesting!). We always got dinner together after class and often had guests come to our classes\/dinners (for instance, President Levin, Dean Brenzel, Tamar Gendler, Paul Bloom). Adam also gives everyone piano lessons. Fairly light workload, fun class, great teacher-TAKE IT! I would especially recommend it to freshmen as it may change your mind about what classes you want to take in future years.",
    "GBI is a rollicking good time. Its core purpose and function has really nothing to do with its premise: this is a class in which you learn about yourself and what you believe, are challenged with new and foreign ideas, and have to find your own. It is not really about the lectures, which present only a starting point for discussion, though the videos are very well-produced and enjoyable. Adam is a maestro and, at his best, conducts the class as if it were a symphony. Don\u0092t enter this course if you want to stay silent or be complacent \u0096 this is a class to shock you out of that. That said, the workload for this course is quite light.",
    "If youget in, you should definitely take it. I was extremely skeptical just because I hate seminars and talking in small groups, yet I still went for it anyway. I didn't talk much in class but did much thinking and growing outside of the class, which I think is at least somewhat good. You will get out of the class what you put into it. But with that being said, pretty much everyone leaves a changed person, for better or for worse.",
    "It will change the way you think about the world in a great way. But you will get a bad grade.",
    "Take it. I don't care if you're a senior or a freshman. This class will change the way you approach your education. If you're lucky enough to be accepted into the class, you should absolutely take it.",
    "It is an interdisciplinary course that taught me the majority of what I learned my freshmen year. It is interesting, revelvant and fun. I highly recommend the course if you enjoy debating and examining questions that do not necessarily have answers. This has been my favorite course that I have taken at Yale.",
    "Take it if you are lucky to get in. The best class I have ever taken in my entire academic career. It is just mind blowing! It is extremely mentally engaging. It is probably the best course ever at Yale.",
    "Great Big Ideas is a weekly heated argument over the world's most pressing questions--consciousness, reality, your self identity--moderated by the brilliant Adam Glick. This is THE BEST class I have taken at Yale, the best class I have taken in my student career, and the best class I will likely ever take in college. I say \"class\" in a loose sense: this is unlike anything else you'll find. This seminar extends into dinner afterwards (not mandatory but if you want to get more out of this course, I highly recommend going). Carve out at least 4 hours for this class to meet. Trust me, it's worth it.Adam makes this is an entire semester about you. This seminar forces you to form opinions on controversial topics, argue those opinions ferociously with your classmates, and begin to internalize what your opinions might mean about who you are. WARNING: once Adam poses these tough questions, it is impossible to get them out of your head. Adam is extremely invested in each of his students and over the course of the semester he took the time to get to know us extraordinarily well as individuals. In fact, if he's reading these anonymous reviews, I bet he can guess who is who just based off our writing style--how often do you encounter a professor like that?! If you have the opportunity to take this class, please do. I know this may sound unrealistic, but I mean it when I say Great Big Ideas will change your life.",
    "Great course. Take it if you can!"
