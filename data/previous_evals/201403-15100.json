    "I highly recommend Italian to anyone who needs to fulfill the language requirement. I really only took Italian because of it's similarity to Spanish (which I already know) to make the requirement a little easier for me. It's a great class and I love the Italian department. Professor Quinlan is friendly, approachable, and a great teacher - take it with her if you can. Regardless, I think most of the Italian professors here are excellent, so if you want to take a language here, Italian is definitely the way to go. Yale also has a summer session of Italian in Siena, so it's a great language to pick.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. Italian is so fun and such a beautiful language!",
    "ITAL 110 is a very good course for anyone looking for some introductory Italian. By the end of the first term you will be speaking enough Italian to carry out a conversation with another person. I would definitely recommend the course to another student.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone planning on taking Italian during their time at Yale. However, I would not recommend it as a class for pleasure, but rather for distributional requirements."
