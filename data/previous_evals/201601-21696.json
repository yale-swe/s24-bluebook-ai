    "A survey course in American literature. I would not recommend the class to another student unless they were truly interested in reading the particular texts in the course. Otherwise, I would recommend taking a course in American lit more particularly focused on an era of interest for the student",
    "English 127 is a good introduction to America literature. It does a good job of offering a diverse reading list but this comes at the cost of the classics. The reading is manageable and the essays are interesting. Jordan was a great section leader, who made the class interesting and kept us engaged. I would take it again."
