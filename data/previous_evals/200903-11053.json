    "Yes, I would recommend it because it offers a very deep knowledge on the major issues regarding the study of Boccaccio.",

    "I would totally reccomend italian 715 to a fellow student, it was a very interesting and challenging class, and it totally changed my understanding of Boccaccio."

    "The class helped me to deepen my knowledge on one of the most important Italian authors and to understand what are the main issues in the scholarship today.",
    "This course was enormously helpful and will certainly be applicable to my future work, which lies in the department of English. I hope to continue to study Italian literature throughout my graduate career, and eventually to incorporate it into my dissertation research.",
    "I think that this course will contribute to the shaping of my further research. I believe that in this class I have begun a research project that will accompany me for the rest of my graduate years and Yale, and probably beyond that. Prof. Lummus was really helpful in helping me in my research."
