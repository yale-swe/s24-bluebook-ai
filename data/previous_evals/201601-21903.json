    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student (depending on the teacher). It's what you need to really round out your Hebrew education and the course is great. A lot of work, but if you've been taking Hebrew then you already know that.",
    "Definitely take this, even though it isn't required after L3--it's harder than previous levels, but you also learn a lot and become a lot more comfortable with Hebrew. Fun class with great professors!",
    "Very comprehensive overview of an intermediate level of Hebrew with an awesome professor",
    "I would recommend Hebrew 140 for all who desire to learn the language."
