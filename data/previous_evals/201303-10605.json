    "Like L1 and L2 smashed together and on steroids. Fewer tests, more writing, less oral practice.",
    "It is a lot of listening homework, which takes up time because you can't fast forward through the exercises. It is rigorous, but rewarding. Also, you read fantastic novels and watch great movies.",
    "Yes, your French improves somewhat and it's not insane amounts of work. The instructors are all good and you read good books and watch good movies.",
    "Strength: You learn a lot of French.Weakness: The workload is heavy.",
    "I would recommend French 130 to a student who... wants to take French and got placed in that level. I do think it is a well structured class, and that I benefited a lot from it. You will get out of this class as much as you put into it\u00e2\u0080\u0094 so while youcan get by, for instance, without doing much of the listening homework, you will improve much less."
