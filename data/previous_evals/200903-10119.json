    "Hip Hop music and Culture is the BEST class you will ever take at yale. Extremely light course load but you still learn a ton of information that is actually enjoyable to learn. It is not stressful whatsoever and the professor is very flexible with due dates. You have one 5 pg review of something related to hip hop and then a final project and paper. I LOVE Nick Conway. He is the best professor that you could ask for. So laid back and friendly, a really nice break from a lot of yale professors who tend to be too stuffy and formal. He relates to students very easily and his deep knowledge of hip hop really adds to the class.TAKE THIS CLASS...if you can get in.",
    "The class was fun and laid-back, without really any work. Becuase it's so laid back though, nobody really gets too into the material of the class and as a result it's not all that it could be. There are so many intense issues in hip-hop: class, gender, globalization, etc-- and I feel like we short-changed them.Still, you'll have fun taking it and the professor is really nice and fun, and definitely knows his stuff.",
    "Really fun, not too much work.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, if you're looking for a laid back, change-of-pace academic experience.",
    "This class was a joy. I truly enjoyed taking this class and learning about hip-hop. AWESOME INSTRUCTOR, awesome FOLKS.",
    "Best class ever! Nick is the chillest prof you'll ever meet, and class is never totally on track but always a blast. Def take this class if you've got the time.",
    "Loved the insight to hip hop it gave me, beyond the perception the media tries to paint of the genre. Learned about the theory behind the beat and discussion was always encouraged. He brought lots of different rappers for performances too.",
    "Definitely take this course.",
    "Highly highly recommended. If you can get in, you'd be a fool not to take it. It's also the most enjoyable way you're likely to get a Social Science credit at Yale.",
    "This is a really fun and deceptively informative way to learn about hip hop. While you're in seminar, it often feels like you're having a 2-hour discussion with friends \u0097 it's only later when you're talking to someone not in the seminar that you realize how much you've learned about the history, politics, and craft of hip hop. Professor Conway is infectiously charming, down-to-earth, and humble. He plays down his knowledge on the topic but is clearly incredibly learned and well-respected in the field of academic hip-hop (evidenced by the fact that both the BBC and CBS News came in to do stories on the seminar and by the shout-out he got in a BBC article from Jeff Chang, a renowned hip hop scholar). Because he also DJs, he is not only a part of the academic hip hop world, but also the performance hip hop world, which meant he could bring in a lot of emcees and artists. He led dynamic and engaging discussions with a sense of humor and really made an effort to make the 15 or so of us in the seminar feel like a little family.",
    "I would recommend it for any student with any level of interest in hip hop"
