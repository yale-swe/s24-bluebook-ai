    "This class is a combination of both concepts introductions and case studies, can help the student to learn by researching real-life cases.",
    "This class is best suited to those interested in business strategy. It provided a good overview of environmental, social and financial considerations of sustainability.",
    "The guest speakers were dynamic and interested, and the subject matter itself is intriguing.",
    "Case Studies - these were very challenging but an excellent way to learn the theory",
    "This is a really important topic for students to know about so I'm glad it's being taugh",
    "A lot of practical learnig.",
    "The case studies and applying the knowledge for them.",
    "The guest lecturers in the class provided a very real and applied perscpective about the world of metrics and materiality. The case based structure is relevant to this type of class because the students are put in the shoes of sustainabiltiy officers or consultants and need to tackle the problem from the view of the company. The urge to develop quantitative metrics was a painful process, but completely worth it since this effort pays off in the professional world as a valuable skill.",
    "Some of the guest lectures were very helpful.",
    "I think one very valuable aspect of this course is counting with the presence of several guest speakers coming to talk directly from their experiences in the field of corporate responsibility. Also, it's really useful all the studies cases we worked on."

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is not very systematic, next year the professor can structure the whole class contents into a more systematical way.",
    "This course gives too much emphasis on guest lectures and never covered the basics of corporate sustainability metrics. Before taking this course, I expected that the course will systematically cover the different methods of different types of sustainability metrics, similarities and differences, and pros and cons of each. For example, what's the difference between the source, calculation, applicable areas of Bloomberg, MSCI and Sustainalytics metrics, etc. This course did cover many examples of individual practices of different companies, but different sustainability metrics were never systematically compared.",
    "More OPTIONAL class reading is essential. The nature of a strategy focused class is it can seem superficial at times. Supporting literature is essential to make it feel more substantial. For example, this is best suited to background material and metrics. More literature is needed about how existing metrics work.",
    "This being Todd's first time teaching the course, a lot of work is needed to smooth out the progression from class to class, the speed at which he grades, and the extent to which basic, foundational concepts are covered.",
    "- Guest lectures must be reduced - More focus on class content\/theory - Maybe 1\/2 shorter assignments besides the cases on fleshing out a particular concept",
    "Way too many speakers not enough cohesion throughout course took too long to return assignments made students feel like they couldn't ask questions (would laugh at them)",
    "More classes taught by the instructor, a bit more structure. The instructor should share more his perspective and valuable real life experience.",
    "While there were guest lecturers, perhaps there could have been a field trip to see how a business does corporate metrics.",
    "More readings on the materiality analysis as well as a bit more structured requirements towards the students. The workload was not too heavy, but there could be more rigorous academic material.",
    "Conceptual material was not lectured on. Rather, it seemed that the case study assignments were intended to give us the experience necessary to have an understanding of the material. However, when case studies were discussed in class after the due date, it didn't appear that most people had a firm grasp of the material.",
    "In my view, the course could be somehow improved if the professor tried to be a little bit more organized, in terms of syllabus structure, assignments, etc."

    "Mostly. I get some basic knowledge of corporate sustainability metrics, but would still prefer a more structural approach though.",
    "As a whole class i found it very valuable. However, individual classes felt superficial because they did not use RELIABLE data e.g. bias consumer surveys; poor correlations between financial and sustainability performance.",
    "Not quite. I expected more of a foundational exposure to CSR at the beginning of the course, which we did not receive.",
    "Though I think I might have gained a general idea of business sustainability metrics, I am not sure that if I was to join a company today, I know how to do a robust analysis of sustainability.",
    "I did not learn as much as I had hoped - I leave feeling confused and not sure how to really apply any of the frameworks to real world settings as I just feel like this whole field is still very vague.",
    "yes!",
    "Actually, I did not know what to expect so the class exceeds my initial perceptions about what I could learn in a Metrics class.",

   "comments": [
    "Great for presentation skills and addressing topics in new ways. Working with students from different departments was very valuable and should be enforced.",
    "Because the course is a fairly even mix of students from both SOM and FES, group work was nice in enabling people with a diverse set of background and interests to collaborate. This often made for more well-rounded, interesting projects.",
    "In the beginning, I worked on my own but it was much better to work together in the group to take a crack at the cases because of the diversity of perspectives which made the discussion and learning process much richer. I would definitely suggest continuing such group work activities in the future.",
    "Discussing cases with a group of people was very good, so many perspectives, closer to solving a problem in real life.",
    "It was nice to have teammates.",
    "The group work is very useful for this class because it closesly resembles a real situatuion where a team is faced with a sustaianbility challenge. The group work also provides different perspectives.",
    "Although I worked in groups on the homework assignments, it was unclear to what extent group work was encouraged\/allowed. Group work was very helpful though.",
    "The way I feel it was a very useful experience to work in group for this course. We worked together for all assignments along with the same group, in my case, and it was really interesting to discuss among peers the ideas we came up with. It was definitely very productive."

    "This is not a class about how to use sustainability metrics. It is also not a particularly quantitative class in relation to learning established techniques. This class is strategy focused. It also teaches you to question the assumptions behind the established sustainability measurement tools",
