   "comments": [
    "Prof Pelkonen lectures in a traditional way. Slides with narration. At the beginning of the semester the structure feels a bit out of date, but it grows on you throughout the semester. I found Prof Pelkonen to be engaging even if the themes existing throughout the course were never fully explored.",
    "For architecture majors, I would strongly recommend taking the course your sophomore year if it isn't going to be offered when you're a junior, because taking it senior spring can be difficult. It's also good material to be exposed to while you're starting to have design studios. For non-architecture majors, I would recommend the course if you are interested in the topic, and I think that having taken art history or other architecture classes before might be helpful. Also, ARCH 261 is differently structured than ARCH 260 - there are five synthetic essays, a midterm, a final, and a term paper.",
    "Not if you're not an architecture major. I can't imagine having to do all of the stuff we did and even remotely enjoying it if you aren't seriously, seriously into architecture, in which case I would assume you're already studying it.",
    "I would definitely recommend ARCH 261 to a fellow student--it's a great class. The material is interesting, the lectures are engaging, the professor is nice...what more could you want?",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "It was a great course, but if you are taking it as a non-architecture major, you might consider taking it credit\/D. The final exam did not focus on the major buildings and projects like the professor said it would.",
    "Unless the syllabus tells you one of either synthetic essays or the final\/final paper is cancelled, expect this to be a lot of work for just one credit. You learn a lot, Eeva Liisa is great, but you won't benefit if you don't already have a great interest in art and architecture.",
    "I think the history of architecture is a relevant subject to all students, and particularly when taking a look at the last part of the course covering contemporary work. Nonetheless, the class did cover a ridiculous amount of material, and having a midterm, a final, 5 short papers and a final paper seems like a bit much.",
    "If you have an interest in architecture then yea",
    "This is a great class. Eeva is a passionate lecturer who speaks with her heart in describing the beauty and significance of these buildings, movements, and ideas. There might be a bit too much work for this class, especially compared to the first semester of history of architecture, but I got much out of all the work I did.",
    "No. A lot of work but if you do take it, take Eeva-Liisa's section.",
    "A great survey lecture on the Modern movement in architecture, with a focus on placing different architects and their work within a greater context. I would recommend, especially to any student interested in modern art. Required for Architecture majors.",
    "Prof. Peel known is super sweet but a little difficult to understand. There's quite a bit more work than a normal art history class (probably because it also qualifies for architecture).",
    "This class is a lot of work for what it is - 5 2-page mini papers (called \"reading responses\" but they are expected to be more fleshed out than a reading response) and one 12 page final paper, two exams. Eeva-Liisa's section was wonderful, but I heard very bad things about the other sections in terms of fairness of grading - definitely take the section with Eeva-Liisa if you can. The exams are a lot of memorization, so if you're into that go for it. I enjoyed writing my final paper, which you can write on just about anything. Start it early.",
    "Great great material and eeva Lisa is a great lecturer. But the course was kind of disorganized and there was a huge grading discrepancy between the TAs and the professor. Still would recommend.",
    "This class is so much better than 260. It also requires more work, and of a higher quality. It's one of the most rigorous humanities classes I've seen at Yale, and that needs to happen more often. However, as an architecture major it's pretty difficult to do your best in this class because you're mostly focused on studio and fall behind very easily. If you're not an architecture major, you should definitely take this.",
    "This class is required for architecture majors, so it might be difficult if you have no background in architecture, but I would recommend it to anyone. There is a lot of work though throughout the semester.",
    "Much more work than Sherer's class in the fall. Attendance at lecture is crucial for exams and assignments, which creep up quickly and consistently. Eeva Liisa is a treasure though, and if anything, take it to appreciate her take on modern architecture.",
    "This course is a fantastic lecture about the history of Western architecture since the Enlightenment, with an emphasis on the first half of the twentieth century. Professor Pelkonen masterfully weaves together the formal and social history of architecture with broader narratives of intellectual, political, social, and cultural history. Although the course is required for architecture majors, it should also be of interest to students majoring in the humanities, particularly in history and art history. It would have been best to take this class after taking ARCH 260, but I was able to get a lot out of it without taking the first half. The workload is hefty but manageable\u2014a midterm, final, and research paper, along with several two-page \u201csynthesis\u201d essays and substantial weekly reading. However, it is well worth the effort: the readings (mostly primary sources) add a lot to one\u2019s understanding of the buildings; preparing for the exams productively helped one to place all of the buildings in context; and the research paper was an exciting opportunity to conduct original archival research. Don\u2019t be intimidated if you are interested in the material!"
