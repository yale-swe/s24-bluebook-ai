   "comments": [
    "A worthy attempt at a hefty selection of Chaucer's poetry, and probably as freeform and digressive as Chaucer's work itself seems to be. I recommend it: the professor is nice and knowledgeable; the course's focus on \"discourses of dissent\" lends itself to close reading and character criticism; Yale offers few courses on Chaucer, let alone on Chaucer's work apart from the Canterbury Tales.",
    "This is a great class! The standard of discussion is very high. Chaucer is a tremendously interesting poet, and also (I believe) quite a lovable guy. You'll read two of the early poems, the Book of the Duchess and the House of Fame, but unfortunately not Parliament of Fouls or Troilus and Criseyde. Then the bulk of the semester is spent on the Canterbury Tales. Despite the title \"Discourses of Dissent,\" the class is more of a general critical overview of Chaucer's work. There's room for a range of approaches. Secondary reading is helpful for both seminar and general understanding, but none is specifically assigned. Twenty pages of writing total; I think most students chose to do a 5-page midterm paper and a 15-page final.",
    "A wonderful pre-1800s credit and here we are speaking of pre-pre-1800s and an opportunity to work with an expert in the field.",
    "If you want to learn about Chaucer, this is the class to take.",
    "All Chaucer texts, rich analysis; sufficient intellectual freedom to apply your preferred academic approach; Chaucer's not particularly popular even among English majors so you get a lot of attention and concern. All good things."
