    "Yes! If you want to critically examine the study of masculinity, this is the class for you. The workload is manageable except for the weekly 2-page papers. Although some of the readings can be dense and a bit boring, there are only 3 each week.",
    "This is a great relatively open-ended course that analyzes many different facets and productions of masculinity in different cultures. Prof Reid does a really great job of helping you get the important information out of each of the readings, and generally leads really engaging discussions that I always found eye-opening and personally valuable. He also is committed to make his class roster diverse which really added to the breadth of class discussion. Every class a different student does a short presentation analyzing some piece of (usually current day) media relevant to the course, which was great in getting us to apply our class discussions to the real world. Workload was also very manageable. Only good things to say-- no matter what your background or identity is, this course will be important and fun for you! Take it if you can!",
    "Take this class!"
