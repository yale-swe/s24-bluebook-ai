    "I would recommend Music and Melancholy to everyone.",
    "The class starts with a rather heavy focus on the \"melancholy\" half of \"Music and Melancholy\": a lot of readings on the history of melancholy as a disease, an evil agent, etc. However, you will get to the music eventually, and when you do, you will spend a LOT of time on specific pieces. We focused primarily on a series of Dowland pavans and the song \"My Melancholy Baby\" this semester, although I imagine the specific musical works can change from semester to semester. While I did enjoy the projects we had to do for these two sets of pieces, especially the classification system for \"My Melancholy Baby,\" I was disappointed that we skipped from pre-Baroque music to contemporary pop music, barely covering any classical music at all (imagine Bach to Schubert crammed in two weeks, tops). I was really hoping to study Brahms, whom we never mentioned at all. Also, if you're looking for a music-intensive course, keep in mind that this is a Freshman Seminar open to students of all capabilities and backgrounds, so you will not be delving into music theory or history as a class--you do have the option of pursuing these paths individually, if you choose to do so for papers\/project\/etc. Those criticisms aside, I do think the class is a creative, engaging view of music and melancholy; after a few classes, you'll certainly be cognizant of the pervasive presence of melancholy in everything you do, and you'll likely be humming some of the music you're studying in class. Professor Brodsky is quite a colorful character, and I imagine that next year's class will develop a fruitful relationship with him and with each other.",
    "I think that this is a really interesting course, but it is not for everyone. There are some really cool projects, but unless you are really into Melancholy and doing a lot of reading... don't do it.",
    "MUSIC AND MELANCHOLY. What a strange title. One might think it's just about melancholic music, but it's not; much talk about melancholy as melancholy and music as music.This class is very collaborative. The Black Humors can be better warded off that way. Students take an active role in the class.Knowledge of music theory is NOT by any means a pre-requisite. Only a curious mind required. In all, highly recommended.",
    "I highly recommend this course for anyone even remotely interested in the topic of music and melancholy, and to those who are not interested at all because this course definitely will make you interested. I have never taken a course that made me think as much as this course. A majority of the class time is discussion-based, and there is no strict structure to the class. The intersection of music and philosophy is very interesting. The only weakness of this course would be that it may tend to linger on one subject for longer than intended, but that is only because the discussion is interesting. Professor Brodsky is by far one of the best teachers I've ever had. It's obvious that he is very passionate about his subject, and his enthusiasm is contagious. He encourages everyone to speak up about their ideas and truly values the discussions we have. He likes to go off into tangents sometimes, but they are pretty amusing.",
    "Great class. Amazing discussions go on in class and Professor Brodsky really knows how to facilitate them. The readings are pretty interesting, although eventually they get a little repetitive in terms of their ideas. The music we go over is decent, although it'd be nice to have more symphonic works. The writing we do is not overwhelming at all (except for the final paper, I guess) and is fun to do anyway since it's about music.I think the coolest part of the class is that all the students\/professor get to know each other well. The atmosphere is chill, not formal and all, and jokes are being made all the time. And if he does another Lachrimae performance like we did this year, you will become an official member of the melancholy cult.",
    "This class is absolutely incredible. It will change your view on a lot of things, but most obviously writing. The writing assignments radically challenge what you've learned about writing up to this point, as far as structure, tone, and voice goes. Prof. Brodsky is also an incredible professor, who will push the class to explore and in the end teach itself. The reading for the class is always interesting, sometimes dense, and often undiscussed, but it is all necessary and it will help you grasp the material. There's eventually a large shift from reading to listening, as you cover a range of music from medieval to post-WWII era classical music, and you even explore popular music, even if it's only one song. Anyway, just take the class. Seriously, its one of the best, and you're missing out if you don't take it.",
    "Music and Melancholy is about what it sounds like it's about: the concept of melancholy as understood over the course of Western history, and how it has been treated by philosophers, artists, and especially composers and musicians. It's Professor Brodsky's creation, and although the material itself is incredibly interesting, it's because of his intellect, his engagement, and his excitement that the course is so good. There will be a lot of reading, but you don't have to do all of it and it's generally interesting, if a little dense. Also for a WR, it requires fairly little writing. And in what other course will you have a chance to perform something you've written about a piece of music, then have your professor and other highly trained musicians perform the piece live? I would definitely recommend M&M if it's offered again, most of all because it's an experience totally unlike any other class you'll take.",
    "It all depends on a) whether Professor Brodsky has his act more together next year or b) whether or not it bothers you when professors are inconsistent with their assigning habits. If you're like me and it really irks your organization when a teacher gives you reading the night before it's due, then I'm undecided as to whether or not I would recommend the class. If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, then I would definitely recommend it because this class has so much else going for it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone that has the slightest interest in learning about this history. I would say, however, that although the writing required from the instructor is not a great amount, the amount of thinking required in the class is definitely more than I would ever have thought. You can not show up to this class without your brain working well, so definitely get good sleep the nights before you have this class. All in all, I would say anyone (and especially any humanities\/music majors) should take this course. Extremely interesting, and well taught.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Hands down the most phenomenal class I have ever taken with the most phenomenal professor. You will grow in ways you never thought imaginable."
