    "German 125 is a great class if you want to learn a great deal of German grammar very quickly. After one semester of German, I can already construct and read fairly complicated sentences\u0097irreal wishes, open conditions, indirect discourse, the list goes on! And while you are learning many concepts in quick succession, it isn't nearly as overwhelming as it sounds, especially if you are interested or enthused. (Liking or appreciating grammar also helps.) It is a double class, and does meet in the morning, but it's a good way to start the day, and I haven't felt the work load to be oppressive. However, if you want to do a lot of casual conversation, this would not the right class. You will end up with a much better reading knowledge than a speaking one. You have to take the initiative to speak, rather than it being often incorporated into the class.Also, never come late to class. It would be exceedingly ill advised.",
    "Howard Stern is a brat, but a very smart one. This course is not that difficult if you don't want it to be, and very difficult if you want it to be. Be forwarned that you may hear more about how glorious the pedagogy you are receiving is than actually getting glorious pedagogy. I think Howard Stern could be an excellent teacher, and does somewhere have a heart for teaching, but often finds himself aimless when the students become lazy. There are two problems here. One is that the class itself probably wasn't working very hard to learn German, but Stern responded by spending more time talking about how hard we needed to work in class, rather than actually working more in class. Some days Stern would come to class with excellent handouts, but other days the class was all just him talking and us occasionally answering questions. A second problem: Stern is a strong proponent of self-discipline and self-teaching, but he has confused these two things with self-control, which he often lacks in class. Many classes invovled Stern telling stories or rambling, while we were yelled at for not getting exactly on time to class. It's difficult to take the class time so seriously when the frame is so tight but the content is often weak. All this being said, I do know a lot of German at this point: but perhaps not as much as other intensive languages I have taken, even those that talked a lot less about how \"intense\" they were.",
    "German 125 is an intensive course and I would only recommend it to a student who is prepared to put it at the top of his\/her priority list. It's two hours of class every day, plus at least two hours of homework each day. There are weekly tests and daily homework assignments. Prof. Stern is very dedicated to his students and really cares about what he teaches. His teaching method does not suit everyone, however, and the material is complex. The pace of the class is very fast, which can cause confusion, and in general there is not enough reviewing of the material discussed in previous weeks. However, at the end of the course I felt like I had a firm grasp on basic German grammar.",
    "Take this course if you are passionate about German, classical music,and poetry. Herr Stern teaches life lessons through the medium of German grammar.",
    "i would. it's a beautiful language and if you're willing to do the work this class will get you there fast.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to any serious student interested in learning German.",
    "Be prepared to work a lot.",
    "German=life. If you don't the time for it, don't do it.",
    "I would only recommend this class to a student who is very serious about studying German. This is not a casual language class. It is very exhausting and you are required to understand the grammar a lot. This class is very challenging and it will not necessarily be the easiest. Also, since it is an intensive class, note that this class will take up a lot of your time."
