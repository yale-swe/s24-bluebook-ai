   "comments": [
    "Lots of French, very quickly",
    "I learned basic\/intermediate writing, speaking and reading skills in French.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of the french language as well as about french culture. I learned the skill of inferring and filling in information when I didn't know every word in a sentence. Having Madison as an instructor also really was wonderful because she also was able to give us a realistic view on the language and the culture please.",
    "I learned not only how to speak and write basic French, but I also learned different techniques for studying the language.",
    "As someone who had taken French in high school, I was extremely shocked to see how fast the class progresses in difficulty. In a few weeks we were learning material that I had not learned in high school. However, this fast pace definitely forces you to keep track of all the material every day so you quickly learn what works for you when absorbing material. For example, quizlet and the course packet review pages were invaluable when studying for the weekly test since they condensed the vocabulary and grammar structures.",
    "Good basic understanding of the workings of the French language",
    "General French understanding and fluency"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Lessons based off videos was good. Set a good base for the course. Vocab learnt seem relevant to things we may actually want to say in french to allow us to actually have basic conversations Weaknesses: Having a whole immersive french experience is good, but I think a bit more English is needed in the course. Especially since many of the words used to describe new concepts and words we don't know yet so aren't able to understand exactly what is going on",
    "I would have liked more partner\/small-group interactions because it's really helpful to work in those less scripted, more intensive, and less high-stakes conversations, rather than engaging mostly with the instructor. The test grading seemed quite picky, which seems to me antithetical to the immersive nature of the material, in which the idea is to learn through speaking and working beyond the limit of one's ability, and through making mistakes, not about speaking perfectly.",
    "The weekly exams, while stressful, improved my language skills. The skit was a lot of fun, but it was tough making one during reading period.",
    "The strengths are that because it is fully in french, I feel as if I really learned a lot throughout the semester. With the weekly videos I also feel like my audio comprehension skills are also very well off. The only weakness is that at times, due to the fact that the weekly videos are from the 80s, I feel as if some of the material we are learning is out of date.",
    "Strengths: Pushes students to always be on top of the French workload. My teacher was always open for 1 on 1. Weaknesses: So much work it gets overwhelming. Biased grading on the auditory section.",
    "French is definitely one of the more work heavy languages. This could be both a strength because it means I definitely learned a lot, but also a weakness given the difficulty I had balancing French work with the other coursework on my plate. However, it's extremely rewarding to see the progress I made with French. Although the audio recording portions of the weekly test were useful, I do wish we could hear our recordings again to see where our oral mistakes occurred. I think it would help with my pronunciation.",
    "To be completely candid, I found the entire method unproductive. It was confusing and at many times frustrating to me to be taught concepts and words I didn't know with other concepts and words I didn't know. The idea of an immersive class is admirable, but simply too much for an introductory level course. I would have benefitted much more from a traditional language experience that strived for both speed and thoroughness in teaching the material -- not merely the former."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course! The instructor was terrific and French in Action is a great way to learn the language.",
    "I would!! I had a wonderful time this semester especially because Madison was my instructor. She always made the learning fun as well as putting us in situation in which we would speak in front of the class without making it uncomfortable or awkward.",
    "I would only recommend this course if someone really wanted to learn French. If the person was only looking to \"get the language requirement out of the way,\" then I wouldn't recommend this course since it has a very high workload.",
    "If you've had an interest in French, whether to study abroad or to simply learn, I think this is definitely a very thorough and great introduction to the language. My skill level now is a lot stronger now than it was after multiple years of learning French in high school.",
    "Would recommend only if you have prior experience with French or a very good understanding of another Romance language",
    "Absolutely! It is a great introductory course."
