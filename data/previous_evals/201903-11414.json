    "The course was highly organized and each topic was introduced properly. I also appreciate how we were able to rely on Professor Koubkova's teaching of the material and that the textbook was only used as a supplement, which made it easier to learn. Professor Koubkova was intimately familiar with the language, and it was evident that she had studied it extensively."
