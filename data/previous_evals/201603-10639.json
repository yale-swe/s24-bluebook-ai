    "I learned about microeconomics, but this course also taught me how to better think critically in a problem solving fashion. It challenges students in many ways, but the total benefit of taking this course is larger than the marginal cost and yields economic profit (which takes into account opportunity cost).",
    "I think this was a really good intro to microeconomics. I feel like I've learned a lot in the class about not only economics, but how to think in rational terms.",
    "I learned how to think critically and make decisions while ignoring how my emotions might factor into it.",
    "Rethinking economic concepts, understanding judgment heuristics and biases.",
    "Throughout the semester, this course changed my worldview and brought me a newfound love of studying economics.",
    "I feel comfortable with the basic principles of microeconomics and ready to move into macro.",
    "Very good introduction to economics. As someone who had never taken an economics class before, it was the perfect overview of the topic to reveal to me whether or not I wanted to take more of the class or not. Some recommend taking the lecture, and I would probably agree with them. This course is mathier than the lecture, which I tend to enjoy, but it can leave some of the more abstract concepts in the dark.",
    "Basic Econ Knowledge",
    "Learned how to analyze microeconomic trends and behaviours."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course include the small class, the students and the professor.",
    "I really appreciated the smaller environment of this class. It really helped me feel like I could approach Professor Simons for help and she was always willing. I also liked getting to know the other members of my class so that we could use each other as resources if necessary. I would've appreciated a little more feedback or review in terms of homework, but there was in-class feedback on in-class questions.",
    "I liked how this class was a seminar, making it easier to ask questions and engage with the material, however I thought that it could use more discussion and seminar structure, rather than being taught like a small lecture.",
    "I wish there more practice problems to help prepare for final exam.",
    "Lack of serious usage of the textbook. The textbook also did not get proper explanation in class time, which could have made the class better. Slides and lecture for a seminar style class doesn't woork to well.",
    "This course was well suited to a seminar format. I appreciated the buzzgroups.",
    "Problem sets and exams were very fair, though the 40% for each test seemed like a little too much. First exam came a few weeks into the course and was still at 40% of the grade. You are left to do a lot of reading on your own, which not many people do. Problem sets are a very good overview of the topics.",
    "She wasn't very good at allowing for open questions.",
    "More student engagement"

   "question_id": "YC409",
   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course. This seminar is challenging and requires students to work and practice outside of the lectures and problems sets to have a complete grasp of the material. The small classroom environment promotes group studying and a better connection to the professor. This makes asking questions less difficult that I would imagine in the lecture. Be prepared to study, but you will ultimately learn bunches.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are seriously interested in economics. It is a more intense environment than the micro lecture and the curve on the tests can reflect that. It can be a really rewarding experience because of the collaborative environment of the class, but you have to make sure to stay on top of learning the material.",
    "Yes. I would strongly recommend taking this over the lecture if you are interested in Econ. The curve is harder, but I found that I enjoyed learning econ much more than my friends in the lecture and felt that I got more out of it. While the lecture might be better for your GPA, the seminar will help you learn so so much!!!!",
    "Yes but only if they are well prepared in math and ready to do a lot of out of class learning.",
    "Yes for students that have limited microeconomic experience, no for students that have already completed IB or AP economics.",
    "I would recommend it if it is absolutely necessary for a major. Other than that, it causes too much unnecessary stress and I feel like I did not learn much.",
    "I would recommend this to students like myself who learn better in groups and through discussions.",
    "Id consider taking the lecture version of this course. Not only does it have a better curve, it is also with a more esteemed professor and there are many many more people taking it which seems to cultivate a better learning environment. Certainly cannot go wrong either way.",
    "Yes",
    "honestly probably not. unless you're really into econ and feel like you're definitely going to be really successful in it, i would recommend taking the lecture. It was not exactly an environment that felt comfortable to make mistakes in and classroom discussion certainly didn't cater to those who weren't very comfortable with the material.",
    "Only if they are more interested in really learning microecon",
    "Yes, awesome course and very interesting subject! Well taught."
