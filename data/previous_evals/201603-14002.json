   "comments": [
    "I was able to practice writing and talking about film through many different lenses (social, political, theoretical, formal). I learned a lot from my peers and from Professor Grewal. The movie choices on the syllabus were fantastic, I never would have been able to pick those out on my own. I definitely felt much more knowledgeable about documentaries and film after this class.",
    "I think I was pushed to look at the world very differently. To criticize it at all angles from a tough but fair perspective",
    "This course changed my outlook on the way I view information and film. Zareena is an amazing teacher and always makes the material incredibly interesting and really engages the students. It was truly fun and interesting to learn this material and it really changed a way I look at the world. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "I loved this course! It not only taught me how to critically reflect upon and engage with documentary work but also pushed me on my world views.",
    "This class focussed on the ethics of image making and cultural representation.",
    "I learned how to think about stories who has the right to share them, and when is it ethically to share them at all?",
    "I gained so much from taking this course. From theory about image making to postcolonial theory to the practical aspects of documentary making to the ethics of documentation this course covered an immense amount. It challenged me to think critically about all forms of documentation, and it introduced me to new concepts through the subjects of the documentaries. I gained an immense amount from this course and Professor Grewal is absolutely incredible."

   "comments": [
    "The class size was great.There were many people from all walks of life and it added a lot to the discussion. Professor Grewal was always excited and engaged which made class always enjoyable. The syllabus was a bit disorganized and correspondences were sometimes confusing, but it always worked itself out in the end.",
    "Since Zareena was constantly discussing with the class about the content and the strucutre I dont really think there was any more room for improvement it was a great class!",
    "I love how full and varied the syllabus was but also that Professor Grewal never felt obligated to stick to it but was flexible in order to meet the class where we were. We covered a lot of material but it always was interesting and worth it. I LOVED the journals that helped us keep track of the work and pieces we had done\/engaged in over the course of the semester.",
    "The guest speakers were a huge strength of the course. They were all really cool and very educational. One weakness was that you weren't really held accountable for the readings or even the screenings sometimes, so if you didn't prioritize this class then it was easy to fall behind on the readings and you wouldn't get very much out of the course.",
    "I think the one weakness is that we didn't directly engage with the movies enough. I think we often talked about the subject matter of the films, but I would have liked to talk more about the filmmaking process, and about whether or not the director was making the right\/ethical choices when making the film.",
    "Having a set screening time for documentaries would be helpful.",
    "This course was fantastic. The readings were interesting, and the documentaries were riveting. They complemented each other well. The course was well put together and built on itself well. I can't say more good things about it."

    "Absolutely. Professor Grewal is a passionate and insightful teacher. No matter what the subject was, I'm sure she could find a way to make it interesting.",
    "Absolutely! You have to take a class with Zareena - she is the absolute best. If you love watching documentaries and discussing them, then this is the class for you.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this course. The material is interesting and very relevant to current events. Zareena is my favorite professor I have had at Yale.",
    "Intro doc is a great class and getting to know Zareena was a privilege. She is extremely knowledgeable in her field and is an awesome resource to have at Yale.",
    "Yes! Professor Grewal will never just allow you to be comfortable within your understanding of the world. Instead she pushes the entire classes and teaches comfortable about discomfort. This is one of those classes where you are learning not only about the subject but also about the world.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're willing to make it a priority, as it is a very self-motivated class (no tests or evaluations for whether or not you've done the 200+ pages of reading for the week). It was certainly an interesting class, with engaging discussions and really cool guest speakers.",
    "Yes! You watch fascinating movies and get to talk about them with Zareena which is always fun and thought provoking.",
    "Yes, especially if Zareena is teaching it. Zareena is a fantastic teacher and really interesting to learn from.",
    "Absolutely. This is one of if not the best course that I have taken at Yale."
