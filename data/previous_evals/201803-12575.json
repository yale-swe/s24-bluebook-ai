   "comments": [
    "I understood the fundamentals of ecosystem interactions. I also understood key concepts like the law of diminishing returns which are applicable in many other fields of study.",
    "Basic ecology principles.",
    "Unclear -the class was not clearly structured.",
    "Basic understanding of ecological systems and their interactions.",
    "Ecosystem services and products analysis and trade offs, evolution and natural selection and a variety of perspectives.",
    "I acquired basic knowledge of ecological science that helped me in my Core class with Professor Bradford. However, because I took both courses, I found the information from this Foundation was also able to be gained through my Core Ecology & Landscape course.",
    "All the material was new to me. The professor was very good and engaging. I could learn all the concepts in a very interesting way.",
    "Before coming into this class I didn't properly know what ecology was. Now I do, and more importantly I have been been introduced to some of the leading conversations that are happening in the field. I think that my biggest takeaway was the development of a novice skillset for analyzing the functional aspects of a ecological system. I understand what \"tipping points\" are are the interconnected value of ecosystems and ecosystem services in a way that I can explain to other people now. When asked about this course I mention how preserving and duplicating the functional relationships within an ecosystem is more important than the strict biodiversity of a species...Often times conservation is targeted at a human selected species and not one that is integral to ecosystem health and productivity. This was a very salient point that I will take with me.",
    "I learned some ecology terminology, but the course felt disorganized and cluttered with too many anecdotes to promote solid learning of core ecology concepts.",
    "Great introduction to ecology that really provided a framework for thinking about the biosphere.",
    "-Ecology and how it's applied in managing environmental issues -Group work -Assessing evidence offered in scientific literature",
    "I learned some of the fundamental principles of ecological science, with one of the biggest lessons being the importance of putting everything in a broader context of causes and effects. This course was a helpful introduction to the concepts of the field and exposed me to many ideas that questioned several assumptions I had about ecology.",
    "Learned lots about ecology. Fair bit about natural selection, etc.",
    "An understanding of the complex interactions within the ecosystem. Solutions to ecological issues should be vetted within the context of the the surrounding environment since the world is not a closed system.",
    "Learned further information regarding ecological processes and the challenges of modern day development. Helps to provide insights in potential fashion in bridging those boundaries.",
    "Basic knowledge of ecological concepts and how to implement them in real-world situations",
    "Systems thinking",
    "Ecological fundamentals especially as related to biodiversity.",
    "basic ecology, systems thinking, synthesis of ecological principles into management strategies",
    "Overall understanding of ecological patterns and processes. Appreciative of willingness of Os to engage conversation and questions even though there was a very large class size. Understanding of subjective nature of environmental decision making. Biases always brought into it. Very well and clearly outlined consequences of this.",
    "Decent grounding in basic ecological principles"

   "comments": [
    "Exceeded my expectations",
    "Fine.",
    "Not well. This did not seem like a coherent class but instead a random assembly of things taught consecutively.",
    "Was pretty much as expected.",
    "Very well. It gave me a good foundation of ecological processes.",
    "Well.",
    "Higher than my expectations",
    "I didn't know what to expect but I do understand the importance of ecological perspectives for environmental mangers. This isn't the primary field that I hope to work in, but for a core class I think it was complementary to my work and an appropriate amount of time \/ effort.",
    "I was caught off guard by Os' perspective on ecological challenges of the world. He gave me more confidence in the resilience of natural systems.",
    "I learned less than expected.",
    "Having never taken an ecology class before, I didn't have any expectations going into the class. I was a little nervous to take it, but really enjoyed the lectures, particularly the case studies, which I found to be the most helpful in really understanding the concepts.",
    "Exceeded my expectations",
    "In some respects the course aligned with my expectations (e.g. in terms of the exposure to food webs and broader ecological systems), but often the material was presented in unexpected ways. Although I generally connected with the themes of the class, it felt at times that it was presented in a moralizing way that made me feel talked down to.",
    "I learned a lot but it could be beneficial to have TAs and more opportunities to go over sets, etc.",
    "I learned things I didn't know. Do I think they will be directly relevant to my future career path? No. Do I think that it has made me a more astute reader, questioner, and observer of environmental proposals? Yes.",
    "I had no prior expectations.",
    "Aligned quite well!",
    "Knowledge, skills and insights generally in line with expectations, but could have been taught better so as to have been more effectively absorbed.",
    "I didn't have any expactations as this was part of the basic knowledge classes and not related to either my background nor professional interests.",
    "I had a few expectations going in, but the class was overall quite informative.",
    "Very well",
    "Very well.",
    "It was very helpful, but I think there is potential to learn even more fro it"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The knowledge and skills gained in this class exceeded my expectations as there were more in-depth than I had anticipated. I appreciated the fact that problem sets and exams involved an application of concepts learned.",
    "The course material was elementary, but the assignments were more nuanced. Both should be balanced in their level of intellectual rigor. Not requiring a basic knowledge course would have facilitated greater engagement than a required course that many people did not feel like they needed to take.",
    "Not what one would expect from an ecology course.",
    "Course content was fine, but the lectures could have been more engaging. It's tough given a course in which all of the participants were compelled to attend, but perhaps some small group work or breaking up of the monotony of lecture might have helped.",
    "It was too intense for a half semester program.",
    "S: Interesting, new material W: very short class",
    "The presentations were long and at times confusing. The professor definitely had a point that he was trying to make but sometimes the focus was on driving that point home rather than integrating discussion and other relevant dialogue from the class. We looked at a lot of ways in which conservation efforts have failed but very few in which they were a success. I would have liked to see more of those. I felt like some of the theory in ecology is pretty loose, so it made producing appropriate work difficult at times. One of my favorite parts of the course were the graphs illustrating carrying capacity, top down controlled trophic ecosystems and other theories.",
    "Weaknesses: Course felt disorganized; powerpoint slides were cluttered and confusing; homework problems felt like they were designed for undergraduates or even high school students (contrived and way too easy); too much emphasis on instructors opinions of flawed past research\/policy and not enough on core ecology concepts. It might be helpful to follow a textbook.",
    "I think the course's weakness is that it's a half semester class that tries to pack in at least 3\/4 of a semester's worth of content into it. Also, I think that the homework was very helpful, but also extremely time-consuming for a foundations class.",
    "STRENGTHS: the homeworks were challenging and they allowed me to apply the lessons from class STEENGTHS: The professor was accessible and helpful",
    "The instructor is very experienced but the course is rushed.",
    "Given my lack of academic training in biology and ecology, it was difficult at times to fully grasp the concepts covered in the articles we were assigned to read. It might be helpful to supplement the academic articles with more approachable sources (videos? writings aimed more at the general public?) in order to aid our understanding of the material.",
    "Oz is super knowledgeable and the course material was interesting. I found the grading pretty subjective. He just looks at the essays and kind of judged how much to give. Oz seems to like some students and not like others.",
    "The book was great. The lectures were engaging - but could drag on about some topics for too long. The homework in particular was really poorly written. I don't believe in having things handed to me on a silver spoon, and I am happy that some of the questions required critical thinking and not regurgitation to solve. That being said, I questioned myself over and over again when reading the question to understand what the heck was being asked and if it was double trick question. The may be a specific critique that the terms used were not consistent across the lecture\/reading and homework which made it hard to go to a reference material to determine if my initial interpretation of the questions were correct.",
    "The course was good. That being said, I strongly object to the concept of prerequisites being implemented in the fashion they were. It is not fair to the student body to emphasize the importance of there being only four semesters to pursue what we came to the school for and then take a semester away. I don't think it's fair to do to the Professors either to demand so much of their time on such fashions. Many of the prerequisites may also have been better applicable within specific concentrations. As some, although interesting, will not further the trajectory of a some students. As well, it is an incredibly overwhelming prospect to begin school, choose an intended concentration, have no room to explore any of the others, and have the prereqs and core classes staggered on one another, and was not an enjoyable experience. For the sake of future students, I hope the process changes.",
    "It was quite intensive for a 6 week coursegood intro and applicable to the real world but perhaps negate the last group project at the end.",
    "Assignments were unclear, open-ended, time-intensive, and did not necessarily help students to better understand the concepts. Instructor's unclear expectations impacted how final exam questions were answered (unclear on how much detail to provide), which in turn negatively impacted score.",
    "The content is interesting and useful, however it is too much. Presentations of over 100 slides per class. Assignmets required too much time (more than the rest of the basic knowledge courses) and were not clear.",
    "Assignments were too time consuming. I think the questions were too open ended without clear expectations, leading to for more research and estimation than I think was necessary for weekly assignments.",
    "Lectures were clear, visuals were excellent and helped to describe principles well. Assignments were challenging but in a good way.",
    "Enjoyed final group problem set. I thought it was spot on for half semester course - in workload and rigor.",
    "Oz is a good teacher and he has an interesting, and challenging point of view, which I really liked. His care for the course and students really showed and he is clearly highly knowledgeable. In terms of suggestions I felt like often the lectures rattled through too many 'examples' from research, such as cropped out graphs, that in themselves would take 5 minutes to comprehend and probably a read of the whole paper \/ a half lecture to understand. These were more confusing than useful and instead we should have focused on one specific research that is representative\/topical, etc. We often covered a lot of ground, but instead of trying to rattle through all this at a high level and then leaving us more confused and potentially having learnt less, we should have covered the same core knowledge per class and then gone in-depth on one piece of research or case study that is representative, cutting edge, interesting etc. per topic(=class) and gained some depth. We sometime did this with case studies - and those were truly useful. The final problem set, brining it all together in teams was a great idea and worked out really well."

    "do the readings",
    "Go to office hours with Oz or you will get very little feedback (other than written on psets). This is something but more face to face interaction could be helpful.",
    "Even if you have to take this course, when taken from Oz it is entertaining and comes with some hard truths and \"ah-ha\" moments. Worth the work.",
    "Seek extra help, ask for clarification where you went wrong. Prepare to spend alot of time on the subject.",
    "Professor Schmitz's book could serve as an adequate substitute for the content addressed in class. If unclear on the expectations of assignments, seek advice from Professor Schmitz as early as possible so as to avoid wasting time.",
    "If you are not interested in taking the class and have the option to do it, do it. On the other hand, if you are familiar or interested in the subject, it is probably worth it.",
    "Get the instructor to revise the assignments from this year.",
