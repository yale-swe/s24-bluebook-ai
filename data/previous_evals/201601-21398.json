   "comments": [
    "Taking this course instead of MATH 115 was the absolute best decision I made. The material is a million times more interesting, varied and applicable to science research. Professor Frame has a real gift in teaching, and his lectures of incredible clarity. He is additionally one of the most helpful and passionate professors you will meet. This is however not a gut, and the sheer amount of things we touched on made the course challenging but manageable. Absolutely recommend, this will definitely make you love math and appreciate traditional methods of teaching.",
    "I absolutely would recommend MATH 116, as it is, to another student. However, I would add that since Michael Frame, who is essentially the heart and soul of this course and the reason it's so quirky and fun, is retiring, I am not sure what the course will look like next year, if it is taught by a new instructor. If it's possible, I would recommend waiting a year to see how the new course is structured and what the new instructor is like, before deciding whether or not you want to take the class.",
    "Pretty good course! Glad I took it. Study for the midterm and final even though it's open note, or you'll be SOL. You won't actually get a good understanding of how to use the technique you learn in real life because not enough background info is given. Basically you learn how to plug and chug.",
    "Michael Frame is the best teacher and the kindest person Yale has to offer. He has created this class as a beautiful balance between biological systems and calculus, and it was the most interesting and applicable class I have taken thus far at Yale.",
    "Calculus, with some more advanced topics, under the framework of medical application. Totally recommended.",
    "MATH 116 is a great \"calculus\" course that doesn't dwell on the \"calculus\" part too much. Instead, it focuses on different mathematical concepts, usually in relation to concepts in biology. It's a great course.",
    "This course was amazing. I would absolutely recommend it, even though I know this is the last time it is going to be offered.",
    "It's a much better alternative to Math 115, although I'm not sure how the course will be next semester, since Professor Frame is retiring. Problem sets every week and two tests (midterm and final) weren't that difficult to accomplish and the material is interesting and varied yet still prepares you for Math 120. I definitely recommend it for any science majors.",
    "Loved the course because it presented math with a cool biology spin.",
    "Of all the classes I have taken and likely will take, I could not recommend a class more highly. While I was prompted to take this class in order to fulfill the calculus pre-med requirement, I very quickly realized this course was anything but an obligation. It was a joy to attend and learn from Professor Frame.",
    "Math 116 is wonderful, way better than other math classes. It's clearly taught, it's not too hard, and the material is interesting. Take it if you can.",
    "Overall, Math 116 was a solid course. Many of the concepts learned, however, were pretty obscure, and did not have much relevance in anything else besides the extremely specific topics that they covered. Still, Professor Frame taught well, and provided many more resources to facilitate learning. This makes the open-note exams pretty fair.",
    "Difficult to understand material at first, but you get the hang of it as it goes on.",
    "I'm not sure what this class will be like with the new professor (who is not Frame), so I'm not sure. I basically took it to fulfill premed requirements and because of Frame. I guess it's cool that some of the course is biologically relevant, so take it if you're interested in that."
