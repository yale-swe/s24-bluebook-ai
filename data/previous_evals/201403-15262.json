   "comments": [
    "Yes, yes, and yes! If ANY student is interested in phylogenetic methods or is considering using them or has used them, I think this class is perfect for wherever you're at in that spectrum. We went from very basic \"trying-to-define-a-field\" discussions to game-changing \"so-what-does-this-mean-looking-ahead\" projections. It is helpful to come in with knowledge of the field in general or at least a passion for genetics\/systematics, but I think students that didn't have a background in either still benefitted astoundingly because of the basic approach that quickly advanced into interesting topics. Tom also allowed us to pick specific topics\/papers to discuss that relate directly to our research, both useful and fun! This is an A++ class, and I would comfortably recommend it to anyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It was fun, low work load, but I learned a lot. As far as I'm concerned, that's the perfect combination. (That said, I don't think that the work load was TOO light, it was just appropriately light.)",
    "A great, independent introduction and examination of the current status of phylogenetics. I would recommend this class to any student interested in doing phylogenetics or understanding the field better.",
    "This seminar provides an in-depth analysis of the literature in topics of species delimitation. Each week, a different student selects a couple of papers from the scientific literature for class discussion. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and would recommend it to anyone interested in advanced topics in evolutionary biology.",
    "EEB 730 was a great course and provided a good platform for thinking about species delimitation, an introduction to the new methods out there, and a thorough reading list of relevant literature."

   "comments": [
    "I think this class radically changed my outlook on the topic. I went in as a total skeptic, and through the class, I learned and evaluated so much from both Prof Near and my classmates. It has been a long time since I woke up on a Monday morning and leaped out of bed because I could not WAIT to come to class. That must sound banal, but it is certainly true! Tom is a phenomenal lecturer and discussion leader. Again, I learned an incredible amount about the subject, and it has forever changed how I look at and ask my research questions. Truly excellent.",
    "I learned a lot about species delimitation, but also about how scientists have described species in the past which is very useful to know, to keep in mind how mushy a lot of these boundaries are. I learned about a bunch of programs that may very well be useful to me in my own research, and learned about their theoretical underpinnings.",
    "This course has really expanded my professional knowledge. Phylogenetics is more and more a fundamental party of biology, and this course helped me better understand and apply that perspective. My dissertation will most likely have a phylogenetic component, and taking courses like this will help me execute that goal.",
    "This course was a great recap of species delimitation concepts and methods. It was very relevant to my interests and I know it will help frame how I think about delimiting species throughout the course of my research and career."
