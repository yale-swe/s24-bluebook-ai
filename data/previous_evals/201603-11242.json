   "comments": [
    "Multi-variable calculus",
    "I extended my knowledge of calculus into multiple dimensions. This helped me a ton in physics! I learned cool and useful methods of integration.",
    "This class has greatly improved my spatial reasoning skills, and revived my interest in mathematics. This is one of the most interesting math courses I have ever taken, and presents a side of calculus that has almost no overlap with anything I've ever learned before.",
    "Multivariable calculus.",
    "Three dimensional parameters, integrals.",
    "The only thing that I learned in this course is that math is probably not for me. The course heavily emphasized evaluating line integrals of vector fields and surface integrals of vector fields. Although the course was extremely helpful for the evaluation of the integrals themselves, we haven't gotten the chance to apply such skills.",
    "I learned a lot about how to approach problems in different and creative ways.",
    "I developed better test-taking skills, and more quantitative abilities in Mathematics.",
    "The course challenged me to pick up material at a fast pace. I have a greater appreciation of math than ever before, as I enjoyed completing psets and working through problems, although I've never had as much difficulty with math before.",
    "I gained a lot of multivariable knowledge and learned how to study effectively.",
    "I gained many more skills at evaluating integrals - line, surface, double and triple and developed a much better understanding of multivariable calculus.",
    "In this class, I learned a great deal about the different theorems involved in multi-variable calculus and how they can be used to solve challenging problems. The class was interesting because it didn't simply rely on rote memorization, but rather required students to apply their knowledge and determine the best method to solve the problem. In this class, I was able to apply the skills I learned in class to more complicated problems on problem sets and exams.",
    "My knowledge of multivariable calculus and more specifically why it was used was taken to new heights. Mainly the proofs were the most beneficial way to understand why this stuff matters",
    "Besides learning about multivariable calculus, I think the concepts in this class really pushed my ability to conceptualize mathematical fields and functions. It's pretty great!",
    "I gained insight and understanding into the applications of calculus in multiple dimensions. By the end of the course, I felt I was able to connect the seemingly disparate topics into a more complete conceptual understanding of calculus outside of one dimension.",
    "I solidified my understanding of multivariable calculus because I had taken the course in high school.",
    "In this course, I developed a lot of skills in terms of thinking in multiple dimensions and then specifically learning tools in calculus in order to evaluate line integrals and surface integrals, which have many practical applications. By going to the office hours provided by my professor and the peer tutors, I was able to clarify a lot of confusing topics and concepts regarding how to think about math and calculus in general in addition to the details entailed in the various topics we covered in the course."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Very well organized Resources available for help Weaknesses: Inconsistency of notation across sections",
    "It's a work-heavy class, but a good one. You will frequently curse your many long PSETs but will learn a bunch about calculus.",
    "The course itself is pretty procedural and a little tedious, but I'm not sure how easy it would be to make it more engaging, like all college math classes are probably like this. My instructor was great.",
    "Very interesting and elaborate; good amount of challenge.",
    "The assessments are graded harshly and don't necessarily reflect accurately comprehension of the subject.",
    "I thought that this class was good and very fast paced, but the number of review sessions\/office hours were incredibly useful for the test. However, I saw a disconnect with the material that different teachers gave their classes to prepare for the midterms, which seems a bit unfair.",
    "A lot of students have already taken multivariable calculus and for those who hadn't learned the subject previously, found it more challenging. I think there should be separate classes for those who have taken it versus who didn't. Also, I thought there should be more practice material for exams. In terms of strengths, I thought the material presented was clear and Miki is a great teacher who holds enough office hours and review sessions.",
    "I think that there could be more student involvement in the course so that students actively engage during class, rather than just having the information handed to them. I thought that the instruction was excellent, though, and there were many opportunities to ask for help.",
    "I though the course was very strong overall. I really learned a lot and felt like the course was structured very well. It moved at a fast pace but the workload was manageable and interesting.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in it's goal to help students understand the key concepts and uses behind theorems, rather than just memorize what they say. In doing so, we were able to approach a problem and determine which theorem would be most applicable. The only way in which I think the course could be improved would be to standardize the teaching a little morethough I loved Miki, I've heard from other students in other sections that they were taught the material in a different way that didn't make as much sense to them. A weakness that I see in this course is in the grading. I've noticed, as have other students, that a simple algebra mistake on a problem set or exam can result in a large number of points being taken off. I think that demonstrating a clear understanding of the main concepts, but simply making an algebraic mistake, shouldn't have the same cost to a student's grade as making a mistake on a more conceptual level.",
    "Problem sets are weighted essentially nothing compared to midterms. Gave me not much motivation to do them or do them well.",
    "Miki rocks!",
    "Strengths: This course is very strong in that I was fortunate enough to be taught by an amazing professor! Miki makes the difficult course material conceptually easier to understand, and she is always available to help students whenever we need it. It was also a good idea to divide the course into sections rather than put everyone in an entire lecture because I believe that it would have been extremely difficult to understand the course material if this course were to be a lecture instead. Weakness: I believe that the pacing of the course (especially before Midterm 1) was covered too quickly. However, this is understandable because there were a lot of content covered throughout this course.",
    "Having not taken multivariable calculus in any capacity prior to this course, I often felt that the class moved at a pace beyond my understanding. It was only by taking charge of my learning, and reviewing notes with the textbook, going to my professor's office hours etc. that I was able to grasp the material. That said, the office hours were an enlightening experience and Miki did an excellent job of patiently walking me through my trouble spots. Furthermore, she did give ample opportunity for questions during class time. However, I often did not know what question to ask when I was confused about a topic, and would have perhaps benefited from a slightly more conceptual approach to some of the trickier topics.",
    "The course does a good job laying out the material efficiently. I do think some more time could be spent on the later material, as some of the last topics are also some of the most difficult, and they tended to feel rushed. Perhaps less time is needed introducing basic vector operations, as at least for me, the material there was somewhat familiar.",
    "I liked the pacing!",
    "This course has strengths in terms of covering a lot of important and interesting material. It covers topics that really push you to make connections between what you have learned in math beforehand to what you learn in this class. If you take the time to ask questions to your professor, peer tutors, and classmates, you can learn a lot; it is really important to learn and work on math with other people. I think you just need to come into this course ready and enthusiastic to learn and put effort into learning the material. The main weakness that I observed is the large variability in the way the class is taught depending on the professor you have."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if they need to learn multi-variable",
    "Yes! If you want to learn multi, this is the course for you, especially if you hate proofs like I do. There are very few proofs.",
    "This course is really interesting, and the material is really fun to mess around with. I have wasted a good many hours just thinking about cool 3d shapes to parameterize. I would highly recommend this course even to people who aren't thinking about continuing in math because the material is so fascinating.",
    "If you feel that you are not prepared for Math 230, this seems to be your only option. This course is good if you want to have an easier first semester. Some students taking Math 120 will have already taken multivariable calculus in high school, but if you have only taken up to AP Calc BC, you will be more than prepared. This course begins right at the beginning of multivariable calculus and moves at a fairly slow pace. I would highly recommend that you purchase a copy of \"Div, Grad, Curl, and All that\" to supplement your learning in Math 120. Math 120 offers a very application-based approach to vector calculus, but does not go into enough depth in discussing the important conceptual aspects of vector calculus.",
    "If you're taking this class, you probably have to take it. The quality and difficulty seem to really, really depend on the instructor. Try to get Miki for the most easily understandable and best course, but of course it's a lottery, so have fun with that.",
    "Yes, it radically boosted my critical thinking skills.",
    "This course essentially has no curve whatsoever. So don't go into the course thinking that the exams will be curved like other classes. The problem sets are long but they are manageable. As long as you manage your time well you won't have to pull all nighters finishing the problem sets. The material is pretty intellectually challenging, especially when studying for exams when much of the concepts blend and get jumbled in your head. But if you really enjoy math, this course should be no problem for you.",
    "It's a lot of work and quite hard to get a good grade.",
    "I would recommend it if they need the math credit but definitely not as a \"lax, filling my time\" sort of class.",
    "If the student is STEM\/need it for their major then yes. If taking it purely for the fun of math, I would not recommend as the grading is harsh.",
    "Yes, I thought that I learned a lot from the class and enjoyed the instructor.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I really enjoyed it and found the pace to be good. The exams were difficult but very fair.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, because unlike other math classes I'm used to Math 120 really focuses on helping students understand the core concepts rather than memorize formulas. By making flowcharts for what theorem to use when, for example, Miki was really able to help us understand why we use certain theorems in the first place.",
    "I would only recommend if very comfortable in math and confident in test taking, as your entire grade rests upon your ability to perform on a few exams well.",
    "I mean, if you have to take it you have to take it.",
    "Yes, if you like math and are willing to work hard.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Even though this course was very difficult, it was manageable because I had Miki as my instructor. I would definitely recommend going to her office hours! My advice for any prospective students is to pick an instructor with a teaching style that fits your learning style very early in the course. Not surprisingly, the course jumps right into difficult content, so make sure you understand each lesson or you'll be completely lost in the next few lessons.",
    "I would recommend this course, with the caveat that the student should be willing to put in the effort to ensure they understand the material, whatever time commitment this entails. Again, the office hours were very helpful, I just wish some of the in class explanations were a broken-down a bit more for those of us who didn't understand the material right off the bat.",
    "Yes! I think the math learned is very relevant.",
    "If students want to succeed in this course, they should be enthusiastic about the prospect of expanding their minds in terms of how they think about mathematics and the importance of being able to make connections across various topics of mathematics. This course takes effort, so I would mainly recommend this to students who are excited about the material that this course covers."
