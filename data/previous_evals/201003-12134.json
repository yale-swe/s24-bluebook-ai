    "Yes!",
    "If you're interested in Joyce, certainly take it. It doesn't teach you something specific, but you're exposed to a lot of interesting work in the process of looking at Ulysses, and you get to write interesting papers. The professor was sympathetic to an unsympathetic view of the work itself.",
    "Ulysses is a difficult book, and you'll probably be sick of it by the end of the semester. The material is superb, though. Professor Lewis is great, and he conducts this seminar better than any other professor with whom I've taken a seminar. I really enjoyed listening to and learning from my classmates as well. I would only recommend this class if you think you would enjoy writing a senior essay on Ulysses. I find writing about Joyce extremely frustrating, but also quite rewarding, so I took the course and I wrestled with Joyce. If you aren't sure that you will have the time or if you aren't excited about writing a long essay on Ulysses, then don't take it. I wouldn't take it just to grow more familiar with the work. It's tough for me to say that, but it will probably be more frustrating than rewarding if you have doubts.",
    "This course is an in-depth reading of Ulysses and what might be called its most famous source texts (the Odyssey, Hamlet and Portrait of the Artist). We read Portrait and Hamlet toward the beginning of the course and the Odyssey sort of as we went along. The bulk of the course consists of reading one episode of Ulysses for each class, which is introduced by a particular student each time. I would gladly recommend this class to anyone interested in Joyce, epic literature or modernism.",
    "Yes I WOULD if you likea) modernismb) joycec) homerd) ulyssese) pericles lewis",
    "A great introduction to Ulysses - but also to Joyce, Modernism, and Epic. This was a perfect Senior year course since it brought together so much of what I've been learning and the novel requires such in-depth analysis to be worth it. The reading is not bad until the last few weeks and then it's manageable, especially since by then you're invested in finishing the book.",
    "Taking \"Ulysses\" as a senior seminar would be a complete fiasco with anyone but Pericles Lewis. It's a very difficult book, often not very \"fun\" to read, but of course it's amazing and taking this class is a great way to force yourself to come to an understanding about this book and not only that but modernism in general. It's also an amazing looking at living, grieving, wanting, trusting and has some beautiful moments in those respects. But I think Pericles understands what being a senior is like and doesn't make it too intimidating.",
    "Excellent seminar. Get real with yourself for a minute: When else are you going to read \"Ulysses,\" and when else will you have a really funny, warm, intelligent teacher to guide you through it? This was one of those classes that gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling, in part because the novel is incredible and reading it is rewarding on its own, and in part because the class dynamic was great. Pericles Lewis is a fantastic professor.Our seminar had a chance to contribute to and help build a new digital resource for Joyce scholars, which was a trip in itself. If you take the class, which you should, definitely participate.",
    "YES. TAKE IT IF YOU WISH TO KNOW ABOUT ENGLISH OR LITERATURE (However, since the reading assignments are very long \u0097 and worthwhile \u0097, balance it in your semester with other classes that aren't be so demanding of your TIME. It's probably not a great class to take with another senior seminar in your schedule; but it's definitely a great class.)",
    "Ulysses brings together a very talented group of English and Lit majors - the caliber of contributions was unique. But the seminar itself was not quite the English major finale I had hoped it would be. A lot of time was spent on the Odyssey. Most of the memorable work with the texts happened individually or in pairs as part of out of class assignments. So the seminar was good and I enjoyed writing on Joyce, but it was not intensely engaging.",
    "Recommend!! Ulysses is a beautiful novel and getting to study it w someone so sensitive to its nuances is a very special experience."
