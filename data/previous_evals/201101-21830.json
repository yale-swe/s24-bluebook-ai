   "comments": [
    "Yes! Easily one of the best history lectures I've taken (though there are non-history majors in the class who seem to enjoy it as well). Wonderfully detailed and engaging lectures; Prof. Walton clearly commands vast knowledge of the field and conveys his own fresh interpretations--it's easy to come away from the class with 4-5 pages of interesting notes. Perhaps most important, he gives a strong sense for the historiography of the Old Regime and Revolution, allowing students to make their own critiques of interpretations. The syllabus is well-structured and work spaced out fairly evenly, with a good mix of primary and secondary sources. Very relevant to contemporary political issues (and Walton helps make these connections). Take it!",
    "The Road to Revolution is exactly what it sounds like - a great exploration of the lead-up to the French Revolution. I recommend it if you have any interest in French history whatsoever.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "HIST 274 is a small lecture course focused on the last century and a half of the Ancien Regime in France, beginning primarily with Louis XIV and continuing through the Revolution. There is a map quiz, a midterm, a 5-7 page paper, and a final. The class is fairly reading-heavy, but the material is very interesting and Prof. Walton brings a lot of passion to the subject. If you are interested in modern European history, this class is a great choice.",
    "Absolutely--an underappreciated lecture on a seminal period of history, with a great lecturer and interesting readings.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. the books are all very interesting, and the lectures are always fascinating.",
    "HIST 274 is a good class to sit and listen to. Professor Walton is a good lecturer and the material is interesting and presented coherently. There is a lot of material, backed up by a LOT of reading. I have never taken a history course before, so maybe the reading level was pretty average. However, I felt there was a lot of it. There is also a required section where you go to discuss the reading. At least it helps solidify major concepts in your mind. Grades consist of a midterm, a map quiz, a paper and a final (in addition to section participation). Reasonable grading, but not much help for non-history majors in terms of writing the paper.",
    "I'd take this course. The readings are great, and while the lectures can get kind of boring, the topic is really interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class because the French Revolution was a very important time in history, and all students would benefit from knowing more about it.",
    "Yes. Professor Walton is a great lecturer. If you go to class you will do very well. There is a midterm, paper and final. The midterm and exam cover a lot, but professor Walton gives you a study guide beforehand, which essentially gives you everything you need if you fill it out beforehand. The paper is 5-7 pages and not difficult to write. Overall this a good course in that you learn a lot throughout the semester AND it is easy to do well.",
    "Yes, it's fun class.",
    "Okay. Could be significantly better. I would really recommend reading a textbook about the period instead.",
    "Yes, I'd definitely recommend this class. It's a great survey of the Old Regime and the Revolution - actually focusing more on Old Regime, and only getting to the Revolution fairly late in the semester, which I thought was great. It's a really cool look at France in the early modern period, which is a really exciting time politically, socially and philosophically. It's also really great if you're interested in enlightenment philosophy - though I suppose if you've already taken classes in which you've done a lot of that kind of reading, it might seem basic - but I thought it was a great intro\/overview.",
    "Yep, take it! Great course, not too overwhelming.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. Professor Walton is great! If you're interested in the rise of public opinion in France (in addition to studying more academic, High Enlightenment thought), this class is really informative. Be aware, though, that most of the class is on Old Regime France. Only at the very end (last two weeks) do you actually learn about the French Revolution, and it's kind of rushed. Also, there is a ton of information in the lectures and a lot of reading, so it's not an easy class. You come out of it learning a lot about the Enlightenment and France, though, so I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class but I would stress that, unless if its curriculum changes, it really is on the \"road\" to the French Revolution and not on the Revolution itself. Out of all of the lectures assigned for the class, only four of them were on 1789 and beyond. When I signed up to take this class, I was confident that I would walk away from it with a much better knowledge of the French Revolution than I actually did.The class can be boring at times. Professor Walton is a pretty good lecturer, but not all of the material is super entertaining (especially when we delve into the intellectual history of the Enlightenment). I would definitely consider the course, but just keep these criticisms in mind if you decide to take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It deals with a fascinating period. The reading is fun and engaging, and the lectures are great, too."
