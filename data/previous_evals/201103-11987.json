   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class for anyone interested in ancient history or how nations construct themselves. This is also a great opportunity to take a class mostly composed of graduate students and to hear what each of them can offer from their various areas of expertise.",
    "Terrific class, a little disorganized but you do somehow end up learning quite a bit about an ancient and fascinating people. If you leave the course without even a slight appreciation for Merodach-Baladan II's diplomatic prowess, I would be very surprised.",
    "I am more than glad to have taken this course. I was intrigued by the title and description, and as the semester played out, I found a genuine interest in a field I hadn't known much about beforehand. The course was very well taught, and the workload was very manageable, with only a midterm and final paper for grades. The small class size, amazing professor, and the impressive resources in the Yale Babylonian Collection make each student feel like they are being treated a cut above their peers in other classes.Eckart Frahm is one of the rare gems of the Yale professorial faculty, who is both the leader in his field and a great, personable and approachable friend. His lectures are so rich and thorough that, even when they take an entirely different branchof course than the syllabus announces, there is a tremendous amount of information to be gleaned from them. Professor Frahm accomplishes with great finesse the difficult task of condensing the entirety of Assyria's 3000 year history, culture and historiography into twelve lectures, a truly remarkable feat.",
    "I highly highly recommend this course.",
    "I would summarize it as above, and would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in the material."
