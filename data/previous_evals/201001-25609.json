    "This was a very interesting course. The course was well coordinated and taught by the two Professors. We had a lot of useful, healthy and thought-provoking discussions about invasive species. The field trips were superb.",
    "3. Was frustrating when we were asked to bring papers to class for discussion and then time wasn't allotted to discuss them.4. Readings were well chosen and informative.6. Would have like to have a bit more time for unstructured discussion, especially at the end of the semester as it would have allowed us to better synthesize what we learned and how our opinions of invasives changed over the course of the class.7a. Ann and Mary complimented each other well, although Mary was missed during the last month when she had many competing obligations.7b. Marlyse was well prepared, contributed significantly (especially with some worthwhile supplemental reading), and was always engaged. One of the better TAs I've had at FES.9c. Field trip to Mystic was FANTASTIC!"

    "The relevance of the topic to the research I wish to pursue.Its small size, amount of discussion, and engagement of all students.As much as it was difficult to present on our paper topics so many times, it was great to hear our peer's presentations which were, for the most part, very well done.Examining and debunking some of the oft cited invasive species 'facts'.",

    "Carefully select your topic for the presentations and paper, as you will spend a lot of time working on it. In selecting your topic think not only about what interests you, but also what will be appealing to the class because they will be hearing about your topic many times over the course of the semester.Come prepared to discuss. This was the first class at FES where I was able to ask almost any question I wanted and was able to talk concerns out. Use the discussion based atmosphere to its utmost.Attend all of the field trips--they're worthwhile and often don't require a full day."
