    "Yes! If you are interested in writing, it's a really cool way to work on a longer piece -- and have mentorship along the way. I did my writing concentration in nonfiction with Fred Strebeigh, which was really wonderful. He was very devoted to my project and taught me a great deal. As someone hoping to go off and do journalism, it taught me so much about what working on a longer project might look and feel like.",
    "Yes! I almost didn't apply to the concentration but I'm SO glad I did. You'll never have this opportunity again. Working so closely with an adviser was extremely helpful, and the other concentrators are fantastic people.",
    "A really great opportunity to work on an extended writing project. Highly recommended!",
    "If you have a strong idea for a project and a willing and capable advisor, definitely apply. I should mention that I was accepted having taken fewer than the requisite number of creative-writing classes, so if you find yourself in that situation you shouldn't be entirely discouraged from applying. That said, I went to great lengths to explain my situation to Cynthia Zarin and to demonstrate my abilities, my writing-workshop experience beyond Yale, and my general seriousness of purpose."
