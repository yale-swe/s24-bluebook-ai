    "This class was actually a lot of fun.",
    "This is the class for people with some background and theory and want an interesting postcolonial take on it.",
    "This course was incredible! So much better than I had expected it would be, at least based on its previous iterations. The syllabus covered a wide range of theoretical traditions and philosophical schools of thought--take it no matter your major. Some depth may have been lost to breadth, but it felt more realistic to ask us to place these authors in conversation with one another. The workload was totally manageable, and the reading material adapted itself well to individual and group interests. Plus, I enjoyed the interdisciplinarity of the conversations and debates we ended up being asked to partake in. That being said, Prof. Erami will not equip you to name-drop; she will instead encourage you to make the ideas on the page come to life in a truly original way. Class discussion was never as pretentious, performative or obnoxious as classes with titles like these can be at Yale. Classroom discussion became increasingly warm, honest and informal, yet the course was no less intellectually rigorous. It really made me engage with complex and diverse texts in a way that made them relevant without resorting to the superficial and predictable formulae you run into in so many social science and humanities courses. I could go on, but basically: this class will push you to reconsider your conceptions of theory and of the scholarly endeavor as a whole.",
    "I would take this class if you want a base in anthro theory, or at least understand something when someone namedrops somebody in class as people are wont to do. I would highly recommend this class, especially if Professor Erami is teaching it - she is TRULY a fantastic professor, a teacher at heart, and a great sharer of ideas.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking to ground their views in the historical timeline of anthropological thought. This course takes students through each time period and the major schools of thought of Anthropology.",
    "While the quantity of disparate readings and disorganization of the class can be frustrating, the class is an accessible yet thorough approach to foundational texts, concepts, and dilemmas in modern anthropology.",
    "Everyone interested in social science should take this class. It gives a great historical background on anthropological theory without making it seem irrelevant to how we understand the world today. Professor Erami keeps the texts fresh and relevant, and class was always an energetic discussion."
