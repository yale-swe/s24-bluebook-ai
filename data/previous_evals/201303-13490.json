   "comments": [
    "First of all, definitely take ENGL 120. It not only introduces you to the art of creative nonfiction, but basically forces you to realize that everything discordant, everything paradoxical or somehow wrong or even just a weird story is interesting. After you take it, everything will seem interesting. and then you'll be like, \"WOW I JUST WANT TO WRITE ABOUT THAT but wait I'm not David Foster Wallace.\" Sadface.If you decide to take ENGL 102 (which you will), take it with Prof. Koenigs. He is awesome and nice and just super insightful, adding that little burst of vivacity into class discussions at exactly the right moments. his comments are balanced and extremely useful.Take this class. There is none other like it at Yale (at least, one that doesn't require an application), and you will have a chance to weave stories from reality. It doesn't get much better than that.",
    "English 120 is a fantastic seminar to engage in fruitful discussion with peers and improve your writing greatly, all while speaking from your personal experience. It helps you learn how to be a better writer, a more conscientious reader, and look inwardly to improve all of the above. You will write many different types of essays, read different things, and explore different genres and approaches to writing similar ones. I would definitely recommend it - you learn A LOT in a close-knit supportive environment. Take this class with Tom Koenigs. He is the bomb.",
    "I would recommend English 120, especially for students who feel their writing did not get enough individualized attention in high school or previous years at Yale. While the workload is relatively light, you get a lot out of the class.",
    "I have been enthusiastically recommending ENGL 120 to my friends. It dramatically improved my writing, both in style and in level of analysis. I am now much better at reading for craft and applying what I observe to my own writing.",
    "Take it. The reading selections are great and while the papers aren't easy, writing them will be enjoyable. TK is a great teacher who offers great insights and feedback for your writing, and he facilitates interesting class discussions (though they were formulaic at times). It's a great class.",
    "The course involves studying a selection of modern essays on cultural objects, figures, and phenomena in order to better our own writing. Students analyze the essays for the tools which make them effective at communicating ideas and work to emulate those skills in their own writing.I would definitely recommend! Though I don't feel I made drastic improvements in my writing, I do feel my writing has become more sophisticated and I've picked up some subtle, necessary skills for improving my written communication. And the pieces themselves are their own sort of cultural education.",
    "We read modern essays, analyze them, and apply them towards our own work. Students workshop their essays once a semester, which means the class is given the essay to edit and add suggestions to. Fantastic class!",
    "English 120 is a really interesting class in which you can learn a lot about modern essay writing. The readings are very interesting and the discussions, when engaging, are wonderful. I would recommend this class to a friend, but with the stipulation that they do their research on their professor. It's a very interesting class, but a good professor is needed to lead class discussions. The material, while interesting, cannot stand on its own, and it needs a professor able to lead class discussions. But yes, I would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to a peer. The readings are awesome and the workshop format works well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class. It is a remarkably engaging introduction to creative nonfiction that will vastly improve your writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who plans to live in the world."
