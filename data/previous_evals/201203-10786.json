    "A study of Classical Hollywood in its broadest sense, taking into account industrial organization (roles of studios and major players; self-regulation through the Hays Code; internal responses to American and global politics) and external forces on film aesthetics.",
    "Yes.",
    "An overview of Hollywood history from the early days until around the 60s, with links constantly being made to the period from 1970 to the present. It changes the way you watch the kind of movies you go to the movies to watch (action films, block busters, romcoms, etc). A lot of interesting theory, but also a lot of practical stuff that people wouldn't know without good research - basically, how studios work. Recommended to everyone.",
    "Fantastic course, consistently the most stimulating three hours of my week. The class looks at theoretical approaches to individual films and historical issues within a broader systemic argument about Hollywood film as an industrial art form. JD Connor is brilliant, an outstanding teacher, and utterly accessible. His style of leading the seminar will keep you on your toes and then some - the tenor of conversation in class often feels calibrated to the sharpest mind in the room, and the effect can be intimidating - but the challenge of keeping up in itself yields incredible rewards."

   "comments": [
    "This material has radically changed the way I've thought about my dissertation, which will make the case that many of the greatest products of 20th century literature are the product not of an author's nationality, but of her affiliation with the film industry.",
    "The course definitely deepened by knowledge of the way classical Hollywood cinema was made. It especially made clear that social context is extremely important.",
    "I'm a Film Studies grad student. This is a course about Hollywood. As essential as it gets.",
    "The course provided welcome, substantive exposure to a sampling of theoretical approaches and methodologies, and the opportunity to practice meta-critical readings of a wide range of texts. The treatment of topics in the history and industrial context of classical Hollywood was coherent and much-needed, and struck the right balance between breadth of subject matter and depth of inquiry."
