   "comments": [
    "No, there are far better science credits out there.",
    "Don't take this class. You can learn everything on your own because the lectures were not helpful at all and people stopped going to them.",
    "This course was quite easy, but also quite interesting, which made it a perfect 5th class for fulfilling a Sc credit. I was sometimes a bit disappointed by the hand-wave-y nature of some of the physics explanations, but I really enjoyed learning about the technologies I use every day.",
    "Sure - you still learn a lot, but expect a lot of trivia too.",
    "There isn't much work, but it's kind of hard to do well on the test.",
    "This course covers how fundamental pieces of technology work (eg. LEDs, transistors) using BASIC physics. I would recommend this course to someone looking for a science credit who has no background. If you do have any background whatsoever, this course will be too easy.",
    "Hard class for Sc",
    "You actually do learn how everyday technology works from a layman's perspective. It's really cool to be able to describe to someone how a CD works and fully understand it. Definitely recommend to anybody. If you're a sciency person great! The class will be easy for you and you'll learn a lot! If you not a sciency person that's okay too! You'll learn important physics equations and be able to apply them to modern technology.",
    "I liked this course, and I appreciated that material covered early in the semester was relevant to subjects covered later (i.e., Faraday's law & generators related to wind turbines). It was very interesting to learn the concepts behind technology that I use every day, such as LED lighting and CDs\/DVDs. However, I felt that there were a few questions on the exams that were significantly more specific than we had discussed in class, or that we had only briefly mentioned and wasn't really covered in the note slides, which were quite difficult to answer. (For instance, I don't recall the relation between antenna length and signal wavelength, which was on the midterm, being mentioned in class--but I could be wrong.) Professor Prober is good at explaining physics\/technical concepts in a way that makes them simple to understand. There were a few times during lectures, however, when more time\/slides would be spent on picture examples (e.g., of satellites in space) than on concepts or mathematical examples. It wasn't a big problem, but I think having a few more specific\/math examples would be useful and would make lectures more engaging. It's also important to mention that at times I felt I did well mostly because I have prior experience in physics (from high school classes). For a student who has never taken physics, or did not feel s\/he did particularly well in the subject, I might not recommend this class, though it is otherwise a perfectly fine way to fulfill the science requirement.",
    "The Technological World is meant to teach the underlying physics for various technological devices. For example, in one week one might learn about Faraday\u2019s Law and the relationship between magnetic fields and currents, and find that these concepts are applicable to AC generators. There are weekly problem sets. The professor, Dr. Prober, was not the usual instructor for the course. He was not very good at explaining things, and often would assume students had knowledge that had not been discussed. Problem sets often required some sort of outside help, as the skills or information needed were not covered in class. Completing the problem sets can be done if you find this outside help, but the frustration can put a damper on the course experience.",
    "Only take this class if Professor Prober is not teaching it. He is very nice but a terrible teacher of this material.",
    "I fully recommend this course if you like physics but aren't majoring in it. It's not as technical as I would have liked but it certainly taught me a truckload."
