    "Highly recommend. You'll be spending 20 hours a week in lab, easily, in most projects anyway. This way you can take fewer extraneous classes and spend more uninterrupted time in lab (which is really important for some time-sensitive experiments).",
    "You're probably trying to decide whether to take 485 or 495. If you think you'll be spending 20 hours a week in lab anyway, you might as well take 495. It's not that much more work (just one extra presentation, which isn't bad once you've been through it once before) and a few extra pages for the final paper) if you're going to be putting in that time anyway.",
    "Yes",
    "I would probably recommend intensive research since it gives more time to send in lab. The major downside is that there still is a time pressure to complete the entire project within a year, which is not always feasible.",
    "Sometimes fully engaging with a laboratory requires much more than 10 hours a week. I found that, when working with animals, I needed 20 hr\/wk to fully engage. It's not as scary as it seems to sign up for intensive research because you can set your own schedule.",
    "After working in a couple of different labs, whether you take 485 or 495 and your experience depends on what you want, your mentor, and your PI. Personally, I wouldn't have gotten anything done on my project if I only spent 10 hr\/wk on it. When things were really going, I even spent 25+ hr\/wk on it. It took up the majority of my time, but that's how I wanted it. Don't take this and three or four other classes - you won't get out of it what you want."
