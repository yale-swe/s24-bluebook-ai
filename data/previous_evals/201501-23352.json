    "Instructor: Gordon Geballe \u00a0Professor Geballe is very approachable and definitely gave to the course an interesting approach.",
    "Instructor: Gordon Geballe \u00a0Gordon is a caring and passionate teacher.",
    "Instructor: Gordon Geballe \u00a0He is a great man--kind, patient, caring, with a good sense of humor. However, my only wish is that he was a bit more structured. He did not seem to take that much ownership of the class at times."
