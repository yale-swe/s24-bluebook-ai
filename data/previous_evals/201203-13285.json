    "If you can find a lab whose research is interesting to you, I would highly recommend research for credit.",
    "Do it, it's a great option. You can start your senior project early and do all of the trouble-shooting this semester so that you can really get into the experiments during Spring semester. I am so glad that I started this semester, because we had so many problems initially, and had to wait for things to arrive before starting on experiments. Had I waited until next semester, I would have been a nervous wreck. Start early to get all of the problems out of the way, you won't regret it.",
    "I strongly recommend.",
    "BENG 471 is research for credit. Be sure that you're aware of the expectations of your PI at the beginning of the semester. I would recommend the class because it makes you accountable for making progress in your lab.",
    "Research, if you're interested."
