   "comments": [
    "Great class, not a lot of work, but you go through a ton of cool readings. Two 6-8 page long papers and a final 1-2 page response paper. Take it for Professor Chang!",
    "Highly recommend if you want a minimal pressure environment to approach Chinese literature. Two 7 page papers plus a 2 page reading response makes the workload very light, and the course has wonderful reading assignments that show an entire spectrum of Chinese poetry and literature.",
    "If you've ever been concerned about the lack of Eastern representation in our learning of literature, take this course. Professor Chang and Alec, the TA, are among the most knowledgeable, passionate, and genuinely kind people I've had the pleasure of meeting at Yale.",
    "Take it. Even if you have no knowledge of Chinese literature, you will enjoy this class. On the other hand, if you find literature and East Asian cultures to be uninteresting, I'm not sure what you're doing searching this class in the first place.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're looking for a relaxed class in which you will still learn a lot. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes take it.",
    "This course is a great overall introduction to Chinese literature. We covered a wide range of styles and genres spanning over 1000 years of Chinese history, which I liked since it gave me a broad sense of the range of Chinese literature. I had no prior experience with Chinese language, literature, or history, and though I may have missed some of the nuances I was still able to keep up easily. I learned an incredible amount about these topics--Professor Chang is so knowledgeable and does a great job of explaining the historical and cultural context of the works. Plus she's really funny and kind, which made the lectures enjoyable, and very willing to help you with planning papers and such. The workload is not bad--the readings are not horribly long, and there are only two 6-8 page papers plus a 1-2 page final response. I thought it was an awesome course--if you're at all interested in Chinese or literature, take it!",
    "A great and fun survey of Chinese literature. Prof. Chang is engaging, and the course is not too difficult or time-intensive.",
    "This is a class where you go in and leave with how much you put into it. Really, this is wonderful. Readings, discussions, and life changing talks. I know so much more about chinese lit. But actually.",
    "This is a great class for those who enjoy Chinese literature or for those who are even remotely interested. The professor is amazing, friendly, and laid-back. The course-load is light and the readings are very interesting.",
    "Literature 172 is a good introduction to Chinese literature and philosophy. The readings are definitely manageable, and there are three essays that are a reasonable length. I enjoyed the readings and felt that they broadened my mind (Chinese literature is very different from Western literature). I would recommend this course.",
    "Take it! Highly recommended.",
    "Chinese 200 is a very low-stress introduction to Classical Chinese poetry through the ages. With the exception of the one novel just before Thanksgiving break, the readings are not usually long. Poetry is very subjective, so class discussions were sometimes a bit disjointed or esoteric. But Professor Chang is a wonderfully brilliant and kind woman, and even if you never do the readings she will make sure you gain something from the class. I would definitely recommend this class to another student looking fora low-workload class that provides exposure to a whole new way to interpret the world. Chinese poetry really is different and beautiful.",
    "Take this class! It's really a philosophy, history, and literature class roled into one. There are some really interesting stories you read here, like Journey to the West with Sun Wukong, and folk stories with mythical fox spirits. Since the readings are in translation, however, you do lose a lot of the brilliance of the original poems. But for those who have no alternative, an excellent course!"
