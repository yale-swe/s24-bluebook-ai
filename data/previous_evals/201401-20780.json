   "comments": [
    "If you're looking for a class that will give you a broad exposure to an eclectic collection of ancient texts, take this one! Very well instructed.",
    "I took this class because I only have background knowledge about the East Asian tradition. I thought it would be a wonderful opportunity to expand my knowledge by comparing different traditions. After this course, I'm a little more confident that I will be able to read unfamiliar texts. It may not teach you a lot of knowledge since it is not about memorization but you will learn a lot about how to approach different texts.",
    "This is a great look at the difference between the sages and wisdoms of the ancient world. There was an emphasis on comparing ancient Chinese and Greek texts, but we also looked at the teachings and ideas from India and Egypt, among a number of other places. There is a fair amount of weekly reading, though, but it's definitely worth it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student if he\/she is interested in ancient readings and the compare\/contrast analysis between different literary traditions. Be prepared to do all the readings because it really helps with class discussion and makes the time fly. If not, the two hours drag on.",
    "A somewhat rushed survey of a whole bunch of traditions and texts that you can come back to in greater depth in another course.",
    "This was a fantastic seminar. As my first introduction to philosophy\/wisdom teachings outside the western tradition, the class far exceeded my (high) expectations. Professor Hunter assembled intriguing reading selections, of moderate work load, and led very good discussions each week. He gave us the opportunity to shape the syllabus topics and the class discussion. I enjoyed this collaborative nature of the class. The midterm was very fair and Professor Hunter was generous with his time (and quite helpful!) when it came to advising for the final paper. I looked forward to this class every week, and would absolutely recommend it to another student.",
    "Absolutely take this course. This is coming from a terrible student who took this class senior spring with no intention of doing any actual work. However, I don't think I have ever done as high a percentage of the reading for a class as I did this one - I at least skimmed everything and probably did > 85% total of the readings. The class was just excellent. The readings themselves (ancient wisdom texts from various traditions) were fascinating and not terribly demanding. The professor and in-class discussions were actually engaging and productive (as a veteran of DS, let me tell you how rare that is). Speaking of DS, this class is the perfect complement as it bridges the gap between the Western Canon and the traditional Eastern texts. Comparing Confucius to Socrates is genuinely fascinating. One of the best classes (top 3) I have taken at Yale."
