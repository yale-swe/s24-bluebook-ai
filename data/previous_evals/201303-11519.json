   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It wasn't exceptionally difficult, and this is a topic that is something everyone should understand.",
    "A phenomenal intro to political science course. Focuses on American government, with an emphasis on the rational choice framework. Good for people at all levels of political knowledge and contains a ton of interesting info that is very applicable to everyday life. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested. Interesting readings, great teacher and section leaders.",
    "Only if you need the social science requirement, otherwise, another course would be more useful.",
    "Political Science 113 is an interesting class for those that want to study political science. The TFs ask a lot from their students and can be difficult graders. The course required between 100-200 pages per week. Professor Rader isn't the most enthusiastic lecturer but it's easy to get a good grade in the class with an average amount of work. Worth it if you want to study political science and are able to sit through 50 minutes of Rader lecturing.",
    "This is a reasonably good course if you want to learn some of the major political science concepts and apply them to American government. This isn't a 'politics' course in the sense that you will analyse current affairs.",
    "Very textbook and reading heavy with really unenjoyable lectures",
    "Take it for the information that you learn. Be prepared for a boring lecture of textbook re-reading. Prof. Rader is consistently late, and speaks way too fast to really grasp any knowledge. Also if you intend to skip class, 5% of your grade is randomly distributed 5-minute papers.",
    "This class can be extremely easy or extremely hard, depending on the TAs that teach it. The professor is a bit dry, and seems jaded about the course. She said multiple times that she wasn't a fan of teaching this course. She also canceled class two times because she was sick, and between 5 or 10 times, she would come to class 10 minutes late, leaving the students and the TAs sitting and waiting. That means we probably missed 3 or 4 classes total. The material is very easy to understand and the test questions are pretty open ended (just make sure to take notes or do the reading), but the harder TAs can give you no partial credit for something that is wrong. Rader isn't very lenient about grading, and will always side with the TA unless you officially have her regrade the test, which can make your grade go down. There are also random in-class papers that aren't graded - they're just there to tally and make sure you've been coming to class - a specific way of doing roll call. It's not that great, but it forced me to go to class every time.",
    "What you might expect from an intro course on American Politics. It can get pretty boring.",
    "sure... especially if you haven't taken ap gov",
    "I would recommend against taking this class.",
    "Not really. It is helpful because you learn a lot about the government and its workings but sitting through lecture was kind of painful.",
    "This class introduces many models through which American Politics can be studied, but I would recommend a seminar or higher level course to an individual who already has familiarity with the American political system.",
    "Very boring.",
    "YES! I took AP US Gov in high school (with a score of 5) and I still found this course very interesting. It will not be a \"review\"--you cover the basics but with much more in depth exploration of the topics. So if you're interested at all in American government, go for it!",
    "A very broad introduction to US politics. If you read the textbook, you don't need to go to lectures and vice versa. Very \"pure\" traditional lecture style, this is neither a positive or a negative, if you learn well by listening and typing notes, this will suit you, diagrams are rarely used.",
    "A survey of American politics. Nothing in depth. Very boring. Avoid it at all costs. If you think it's a gut, believe me it's not. And this is after taking a year of politics class in high school as well.",
    "Great class. Lectures informative, detailed and interesting. If you've taken government before, though, you've probably already gone past this course, but if you're a foreign student or someone without a great grasp of American Politics, this course should be compulsory."
