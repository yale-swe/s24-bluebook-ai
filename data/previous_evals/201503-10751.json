    "An overview of some of the methods\/techniques in studying ceramics and how they were\/are used by societies. I would highly recommend it to students interested in developing a background in ceramics analysis for archaeology and anthropology. A predominately lab based course that allows students to apply techniques to the study of actual ceramic vessels and sherds, allowing for trial and error to understand the significance behind analyses.",
    "This class is all about hands-on application of archaeological knowledge. It was an absolute blast to be in and I would definitely recommend it to another student, whether they are Ian archaeology major or not."

   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to develop a comprehensive background in the study of ceramic analysis. While working with ceramics, I am now able to understand the importance of form and function, as well as consider the various levels of analyses I can use to determine the uses and components of different vessels and sherds found in the field.",
    "This course definitely deepened my knowledge of the processes of ceramic analysis in archaeology, and the real-world applications of experimental archaeology. In addition, this course helped me make contacts in the Peabody Museum which will (hopefully) assist me in the writing of my Master's Thesis next fall."
