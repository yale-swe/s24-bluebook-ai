    "An absolutely wonderful way to start your Yale career -- and a topic that, being 90 miles from Cuba, we could all know more about!",
    "The sheer amount of readings and small-size discussions proved challenging at times but also really rewarding. It's a fascinating introduction to Anthropology, since we approach contemporary Cuba from the angles of Public Health, Santer\u00c3\u00ada, Cultural Productions, and the Economic\/Political. Compared to friends' descriptions of other freshman seminars, this class will be more work but also more fun. The readings are heavy, especially at the beginning of the term, and you have to prepare discussion questions every single day. This actually facilitates discussion, though, since if forces you to think critically about the readings before each class. There are 10 short reading responses, which were not particularly fun, and a completely independent final research paper, which was awesome. And we got to go lookat Cuban art in NYC, and have Cuban food the last day of class! Take it if you can - Brotherton's going on sabbatical but if he's teaching it in two years, do it!",
    "I would definitely recommend Contemporary Cuba to another student. Great freshman seminar about race, gender, politics and public health in post-Revolutionary Cuba. If you have any interest in Cuba, take it. If you don't, it will still be a great freshman seminar. Small class and great professor translates to a great first-year experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Regardless of whether or not Cuba is of a particular interest to you, the readings are fascinating and the topics discussed are pertinent to a wide variety of fields. More than that, you'll leave thinking about the world from a different angle. Professor Brothetton is dynamic, engaging, and very accessible. He provides lots of feedback and will help you develop your ideas. He also does a great job fostering a sense of community in the course. That being said, know that you will need to work hard and the reading load can be quite high at some points.",
    "ANTH 014 was the most interesting class I've taken this semester. Through engaging group discussions and really interesting readings, I feel I have a comprehensive grasp of Cuban society today. I highly recommend taking this course if you are looking for a Freshman Seminar.",
    "Definitely! It was a discussion-based seminar that was fascinating, no matter what discipline the students were interested in.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a student. It gave me as comprehensive a picture of Cuba as I could get, and before taking this class I knew close to nothing about the island.",
    "The course is interesting, but very reading. For me, it was definitely a good introduction to university-level humanities courses. The small size is another huge benefit. It made it easy to get to know my classmates and the professor very well. I would recommend it only if you are willing to put the time in to do the reading.",
    "Though I am very interested in Cuba, I do not, in general, think I would recommend this class to fellow students because I am not interested in anthropology (which I learned by taking this class). However, if I had a friend I knew was interested in anthropology, I would recommend this class to him or her because I think the class was well taught and the curriculum well designed."
