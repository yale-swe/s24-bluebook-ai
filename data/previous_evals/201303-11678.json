    "You will meet with your fellow THST seniors each week to discuss your progress on the senior project. There are short reading assignments, a portfolio, and words of wisdom. This is in addition to your project and essay. If you're doing a project you have to take it, so enjoy it as your time to get inspiration from your classmates and professors, reflect on your process, and craft your final essay. It's really your time. Dominika, Nathan, and Tom have lots of great advice, both academic and artistic, so make use of their expertise. Also, ask Dominika if there are any copies of the Emergency Index available! It's a compilation of experimental performance projects that are sure to get you thinking out of the box!",

    "Because this is a necessary class for the theater major, you will have to take it. However, if you write your project it is not actually mandatory for you to attend the class."
