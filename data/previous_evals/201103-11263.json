    "Graeme Berlyn is an FES institution, and everyone should be required to take at least one of his classes. There was an excess of complex material, including a lot of subjects that I will likely never understand or need in my career, but it was great to have my eyes opened to their presence.",
    "This course is very useful to my study field.The instructor is excellent.The TA is very helpful.",
    "Graeme is wonderful. His knowledge is encyclopaedic, and he is happy to share his knowledge with students. I feel honored that I was able to take this class."

   "comments": [
    "I loved the moments when Prof. Berlyn would grow passionate about something (such as the simultaneous decision of fusiform initials to create vessel elements all the way up and down the stem of a tree). I also loved his stories, gripes, and color commentary.More broadly, his ideas and teaching style are different from those of almost all other professors at FES, and this is what makes the class experience so valuable.",
    "I can always explore my interest field in this course.This course provides lots of useful knowledge and at the same time makes me relax-it is not pushing at all, but very helpful.",
    "Graeme is very knowledgeable and personable.Its good that the test questions were somewhat open ended. It would have been a nightmare to try to study all of the material, if expected to master every detail.",
    "The best part was that the application was emphasized over simply repeating the information. The use of the knowledge gained in the class was more important than knowing one specific detail that may or may not be relevant to actually affecting change in the world.",
    "Graeme's infinite stock of examples and stories. Graeme also takes questions seriously - he stops his lecture, thinks, and then gives a thoughtful response. I appreciate that."

   "comments": [
    "The posted lecture notes are so jumbled and difficult to decipher that they become almost useless. If Prof. Berlyn does not want to take the time to sort it all out, this is understandable, but someone should take the initiative to do it with him.",
    "A field trip to mountains or woods could be very helpful.",
    "The lecture style of the course was not very engaging. The material is so detailed and \"cell-level\" that its hard to get the bigger picture. I did not find the lectures especially helpful when it came to preparing for the tests.",
    "The slides go way too fast for note-taking. This is fine in the end, because not every detail is needed to be documented for the style of the final, but it would be nice for personal knowledge to be able to jot down more stuff.",
    "more review sessions?"

    "The instructor helps me with my term paper.The TA helps me with the exam preparation.",
    "Martin was available to help and hosted several review sessions.",
    "Very good TA, held effective review sessions, answered most questions thoroughly, and obviously spent much of his own time preparing extra material to aid us in studying for the midterm and the final.",
    "Graeme was always available to help and talk to us after class, before class, or in his office.Martin was extremely helpful and put in a lot of time into organizing review sessions that were an excellent resource for exam preparation. You'll be a fantastic professor - you're very talented at making complex matters seem straightforward. Thank you!"
