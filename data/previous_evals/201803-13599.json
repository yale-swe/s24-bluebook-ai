    "Most importantly, I learned how to create and to understand rigorous mathematical proofs.",
    "Knowledge of process of doing a rigorous mathematical proof (even if I couldn't always do them right...)",
    "I gained an introductoy knowledge of real analysis including the main theorems and results from sequences\/series, point-set topology, functional limits and continuity, differentiation, functional sequences, and Riemann integration. We followed the first seven chapters of Abbott relatively closely although we did skip a few sections\/theorems (one or two bigger concepts (i.e. Taylor series) but mostly smaller extensions\/theorems that were at the end of chapters (i.e. double summation, perfect\/connected sets, etc.)). During the last two weeks, we did a brief introduction to probability theory.",

   "comments": [
    "The course was extremely fast-paced. Although I consider this to be a strength, it would have been a better learning environment if we slowed down for the more abstract material.",
    "Really struggled to understand why we were learning what we were learning. Have no idea how it is applicable to political science.",
    "Strengths: Clear instruction; HW that made us engage w\/ material; some broader comments on the usefulness of all of it Weaknesses: Probably not enough HW; sometimes class material was a bit tough to fully understand -- especially how deeply we should understand something (not always easy to see the line between superficially and deeply understanding some concept of proof)",
    "Overall, I appreciated this course and felt like it provided a solid introduction to concepts from real analysis. While I had previously encountered some of these concepts, I think this course brought them together nicely\/in a more coherent way and made some nice connections (i.e. between sequences and functions). I also felt like the workload was reasonable (we had 6 problem sets) and liked the check-plus, check, check-minus grading as well as the fact that solutions to homeworks and the midterm were posted. I felt like most of the time concepts were presented in a relatively clear way although there were times during which I felt it was slightly less clear\/when Professor Li got stuck in the middle of proving a concept. For me, I think the main weakness of this course was the probability theory at the end. I had previously encountered probability theory so was fine during this section. But, if it was my first time coming across those concepts, I think it would have been too fast and in not enough detail to truly grasp all of the concepts (we covered what would ordinarily have taken maybe half a semester in two weeks). While we were never held accountable for the more advanced concepts (i.e. only the more basic elements appeared on the problem set or final exam), I think it felt somewhat disconnected from the rest of the course and that it would be better to replace the probability theory entirely. Personally, I would have preferred us to have gone into a few of topics that we skipped over (Taylor series being the major one) and then maybe one or two of the advanced concepts from chapter 8 that would be helpful for future courses in analysis (I think metric spaces and a brief introduction to Lesbegue integrability could have potentially been good candidates).",

    "Definitely, I am amazed by how much this course developed my ability to construct mathematical proofs.",

    "Yes",
    "Yes. It wasn't much work and definitely caused us to build conceptual\/proof math skills.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as a way to get an overview of analysis as well as techniques for proof writing. I think it could make for a good course for undergraduates instead of the equivalent courses in the math department (i.e. math 300 or math 301). There were a few flaws (i.e. it felt as if we didn't have enough time in class and lectures frequently ran over, and while most concepts were explained clearly, a few were less clear), but I think that the course is still worthwhile and that my understanding improved.",
    "Yes."
