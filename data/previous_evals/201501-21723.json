   "comments": [
    "A series of talks about autism from a variety of perspectives.",
    "Take this class, there is not a lot of work, and the community service is worth it.",
    "excellent. Do it",
    "This is a series of lectures about autism. You will learn a lot from the observations, and the final paper is quite useful. There is little work!",
    "Great class! The guest lecturers give a wide range of the current issues and research involved in studying autism, and the placement teaches you so much about how each individual with autism is incredibly different from the next.",
    "Highly recommend it!",
    "This is a lecture course without tests, so people don't have much of an incentive to go to class. Cool guest lecturers though.",
    "This course is good for people who are interested in learning more about autism. There are speakers from different fields who come in every week and talk about a topic related to autism. The class is very interesting and you learn a lot from it and from the practicum.",
    "This class is very low-stress, and wonderful because you get to spend time working at one of a number of places, getting to know people who have the disorder that you learn about in lectures. The class ends up being a fair amount of time, but very little work (the time that would go towards homework in other classes is filled with the three-hour weekly practicum). But again, almost no work during the semester, and very interesting lectures each week from great minds in the field. Don't expect a tight-knit class communityand expect to learn what you put in the work to learn (it is very easy to be distracted in class, as you are not accountable for any of the information presented - no exams, etc.).",
    "YES take it!",
    "Take this course! Gives you amazing insight! Even if you aren't a psych major! Teaches you empathy!",
    "Autism is a great course. However, the placement is what really makes it worthwhile. I got so much out of being able to meet and work with children on the spectrum as well as people imbedded in the field in all manners.",
    "If you get the chance, absolutely take this class! Although it is sometimes frustrating to have a different instructor every week, the practicum placements are amazing and the material (although sometimes highly theoretical) was incredibly interesting and engaging."
