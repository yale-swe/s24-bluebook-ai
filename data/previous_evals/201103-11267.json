    "Too much lecture and reliance on powerpoint slides. When discussion occurred it was forced. The material is interesting and this course could be great with a little tweaking.",
    "The course is essential for MFs or MEMs with an interest in forestry. The material could have been presented in a much more interesting way, though, with more attention given to students' different backgrounds and levels of experience (it was a small enough class that this was possible). Reading discussions were a good interactive experience but more direction or interaction might have spurred better discourse and deeper understanding of the material.",
    "It would have been great to have another field trip with only our class. The combined field trip with the taxonomy class wasn't all that helpful. I found the field examples included in the tests very helpful and it would have been great to work through similar examples during class."

    "The lecture slides were very detailed and good to study from.",

   "comments": [
    "Directions for the final project could have been more clearly articulated.",
    "Another field trip later in the semester would have been helpful. The one field trip we did have was early enough in the semester that I'm not sure if I got as much out of it as I could have if it had been a little later.Ann made time for discussion with classes dedicated to it but with the literature we are reading in the class its hard to just sit down and say what you thought of the papers you read. Maybe assign a couple students to lead discussion and give a presentation on the readings? Something to make discussion sections more interesting and help us understand the material better.",
    "The instructor read from the slides during lectures, which made them boring and un-engaging. We only went on one field trip, which isn't enough for a class about stand dynamics.",
    "Expectations for assignments, such as the term paper, were unclear. Better, explicit written instructions are necessary.Could have used more time in the field. Lectures are necessary, but forest dynamics need to be observed\/studied in the woods more than one day\/semester.",
    "Lectures.",
    "TA - not always informed about the material covered in class. Somewhat available, but didn't always have answers to basic course questions (or explanations could have been clearer).Teaching style - hard to learn from powerpoints only. Also, a lot of material is discussed for each slide, but there was rarely time to note it all down. Maybe more explanations on the blackboard etc. which might be helpful on exams as well.",
    "I think this course could use some assignments that might drive home the material a little better. The literature review was helpful in understanding the topic we chose but it might be helpful to have a few smaller assignments to wrestle with other concepts."

    "The instructor was responsive to emails. The TA made a point of following up if there were any lingering questions from review sessions.",
    "Ann always made herself available to students outside of class and these one on one meetings were helpful.As the TA, Kris made himself available but was never that helpful. I understand that he's a PHD student and is busy but he never knew what was going on in class and review sessions were poorly run. I dont expect to get my hand held but compared to all of my other classes, his involvement and investment in the class was subpar. With that said, I thought he did a good job running the Great Mountain field trip.",
