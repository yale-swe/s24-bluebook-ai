    "Two thumbs up! A very relaxed course, with a component of sociability that makes developing Spanish speaking skills engaging and interesting.",
    "This Spanish class is an extremely fun, engaging class that is mostly a discussion class. Participation is essential to have a fun time, but if you are not one who likes to participate, the professor will ease you into it and still make sure you have a good time. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student - it is one of the best Spanish courses I have ever taken. Although the class can range from freshmen to seniors, the level of proficiency in Spanish is about the same, and many if not all of the students come out knowing much more about Spanish culture, the Spanish language, and simply how to speak Spanish better and with more confidence, presence, and authority than when they came in.",
    "It is an easy way to do a language requirement, or a nice class to refresh your Spanish.",
    "Definitely would recommend this class! Not too much work, but helps improve Spanish reading, writing, and speaking skills. Profe Tortora is very engaging and encouraging, and you will feel comfortable speaking in class, even if your grammer\/vocab isn't perfect!",
    "Yes, take it. The class is not stressful and its a great L5 class for freshmen.",
    "I would very highly recommend this course. I think it helped me become more fluent in Spanish and learn a great deal more about Spanish cultures. I would also recommend taking the class with Prof. Tortora. She's awesome!!",
    "Spanish 150 is a good class for anyone who wants to improve their Spanish speaking skills. The work load is not too bad, and the reading assignments are fairly interesting. Professor Tortora grades assignments rather hard, but her feedback is very helpful. She is a good teacher and leads engaging discussions. I would recommend this class as a good opportunity to practice Spanish.",
    "This course had a pretty light course load, which fit for me because I was only taking it to fulfill distributional requirements. Our readings were also always very interesting, so I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I would not recommend the course if you are not at least decently fluent in Spanish and familiar with grammar rules because the instructors assume that you have a good foundation in Spanish. My instructor went over usage rules sometimes but only because people made mistakes on homework and she wanted to point the mistakes out to the class so we could all learn.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student as a good way to keep up or refresh Spanish speaking basics and build some vocabulary."
