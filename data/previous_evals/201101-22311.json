    "I find it astonishing how a class that held such promise ended up being such a terrible waste of time. While it would take the rest of my natural lifetime to list all of the failures of this course, I think I can lay the lion\u0092s share of the blame at the foot of the instructor. The overwhelming impression I got was that the instructor had set up the course and readings according to what interested him, with little regard for the students he was actually supposed to teach.<p>The readings were almost entirely chosen from the modernist canon and while this may make interesting reading, they were hardly works that could easily be learned from. Sometimes they were really interesting poems but most of the time they were black boxes. So many of the poems were just aloof, academic, and purposefully opaque. Forgive my ignorance, but how is a poem which actively seeks to exclude the reader and prevent any kind of analysis of what\u0092s going on a useful teaching example for people who want to start out writing poetry? That\u0092s like a painting 101 class starting off with looking at a Jackson Pollack piece. And I wish this were the exception, but so many of the lessons would have the grad student saying \u0093Well I\u0092m not really sure what\u0092s going on\u0085\u0094. It was clear that his poem selections were just those that excited him as an academic analyzing poetry. There seemed to be little regard for the student perspective, especially in a class that was supposedly directed towards nonmajors.<\/p><p> But maybe I\u0092m wrong. After all, this assumes that the objective of the course was actually to help us become better poets. And I have to wonder, if it\u0092s the unusually good teacher who makes a lecture feel like a seminar, is it an unusually bad teacher who makes a seminar feel like a lecture? Because so many classes just were just a dry examination of the text. The instructor would list one Greek term after another to describe the different devices used. The hilarity of the situation was that it wasn\u0092t actually all that helpful to improving poetry writing. If someone describes all the different parts of a boat to me, it doesn\u0092t mean I\u0092ll know how to actually build one. In a similar vein, the grad student failed to recognize that we could break down any piece of poetry all we wanted, but unless there was active discussion about how to incorporate that into our own writing, then it doesn\u0092t actually make us better poets. This analysis without any guidance on how to use the different poetic devices just made writing a frustrating task. There was always that desire to express something beautiful but the constant frustrating inability to express it and without knowing the reason for failing..<\/p><\/p> But if I had one major bone to pick with this class, it would be that it was really !@#%ing boring. As I said, it felt like another dry poetry analysis class. While I might stop short of calling this class a pedagogical crime, the grad student certainly wasn\u0092t a good teacher. Rarely in the discussions did the poems ever feel \u0091alive\u0092 or engrossing. When they did, it was more through the overpowering beauty of the text than any inspirational instruction. Maybe this is why grad students get a bad rep. Justin certainly seemed smart and could probably tear apart any piece of poetry, but he seemed to lack the sense of perspective and pedagogical nous that a more experienced professor might have. Alternatively, maybe this is why Yale English is criticized for being a department that breeds critics and not writers. Whatever the cause, this was the saddest part of the class. It lacked imagination. It lacked inspiration. Hell, it even lacked poetry.<\/p>",
    "I think my poetry improved a lot this semester :)I think it could use less reading and more writing.The writing assignments were usually interesting, but I think I could've learned a lot from more free assignments as well.",
    "The course wonderfully complements my study of poetry as an English major. It helps me see the craft that goes into writing a poem and to see beyond the words of a poem. Like any creative writing class, you get out what you put in.",
    "good for if you want to spend time working on your writing.",
    "Reading and writing-- pretty self explanatory. Not as much writing as I would have liked. Fantastic syllabus but there's a lot in there and it's a pity you can't really appreciate it all with the time allotted.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for anyone interested in poetry or creative writing. It's an excellent class.",
    "If you have never written poetry before this is a relatively good introduction to how to write\/analyze poetry and how workshops work. If you have written poetry before I would not recommend taking this course, a lot of it will seem rather repetitive.",
    "Totally. I hadn't written poetry much before and I learned a lot...you spend a lot of time reading and writing poetry. Reading other students' work was especially cool. Class was fun and pretty casual. And John Taggart visited class and dispensed lots of fun rambling poetic wisdom, mostly about jazz music. Cool stuff!"
