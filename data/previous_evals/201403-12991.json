    "Take it!",
    "There is possibility for excellence in the course; Roach is brilliant, but doesn't care if you understand him unless you walk up and ask him a good research question. With initiative, you can cull much from the extensive readings. The topic is salient, ever-changing. Largely self-directed, from the term paper to section presentations, with class not a requirement but a supplement for interest, so I strongly advise against taking this course if you are not genuinely interested in the future of China. I had a section of 50% SOM students, from which I learned very much of contemporary culture and de facto urban China.",
    "Great class. Interesting and exciting to learn about.",
    "A surprisingly thorough overview of China and its relationship from the US. Everyone definitely does not show up to lecture, though I find it helpful.",
    "A current events class that can get boring sometimes.",
    "The Next China is about the steps needed to keep China's economy on track. You've read the other reviews... Yes the course can be repetitive. But at the same time, there are some insights that you will not get on your own, which might be extremely valuable. Professor Roach is a solid lecturer. The class is very open-ended when it comes to work: You can make it very hard if you attempt to read every \"required\" text. The reality is that nobody does all the reading, and the course degenerates into somewhat of a gut. The paper is fun, the midterm is not so bad, and the final is take-home. Take this class if you want a manageable workload and an economics credit. If you just want the knowledge, buy Roach's book \"Unbalanced,\" and read it.",
    "Helps bring to light the economic, political, and social issues of China. very informative and worth taking.",
    "Yes, this is a crucial economic topic right now. The class is not challenging, but you will gain a lot from it.",
    "Take it, even if you don't think you're necessarily interested in China. It is a great qualitative Econ course and the topic is extremely relevant. Lectures are interesting and you only really need to do the reading that's written by Roach, and you'll be set for tests and essays.",
    "This is a good course. Interesting but somewhat repetitive. Roach is really good (little boring) and you will come out of the course knowing a lot more about China. I also liked how it took some of the theory we've learned in intro and intermediate macro and gave real world examples.",
    "Dry lecture, interesting topic and readings. Take it if you are seriously interested in the topic and want to read and learn more about it. Attending lecture is not necessary to do well -- slides are posted and much of what you can take from the course is in the rather lengthy (but interesting!) readings, pulled from a great variety of sources.",
    "good",
    "Very interesting and enjoyable class. I knew very little about China going into it and now I feel very confident that I understand some central concepts about the Chinese economy. Rather than lightly touch on a few concepts, this class goes in depth about a few crucial concepts so the student really understand what the lessons are about. Many of the topics are recent and applicable to understanding China today, which makes the class far more interesting (especially compared to classes that are ver theoretical and not applicable to today).",
    "Econ credit but feels more like a poly sci. Really helps you understand China and where the nation could go.",
    "Definitely recommend taking if you are looking for a class with little work during the semester. However, if you are procrastinator like me then you will be hit hard during Reading Period and Finals Week because you are required to write a 15-page paper and a 2500-word take-home final exam within the same week. So if you take this class, I recommend getting a head start on your final paper instead of cruising along throughout the entire class. By the way did zero readings the whole semester and did just fine in the class.",
    "It's good.",
    "Yes if you have no knowledge of China and want to learn more, but no if you've already taken another China course (as I don't think you'd gain too much more from this class).",
    "Econ 338 is a solid lecture class--taught by an incredibly knowledgable professor, TA'd by competent grad students, and structured in a logical way. The lectures can get redundant because Professor Roach likes to highlight a few key ideas, but there's still always something interesting and new in each lecture. The workload is not bad at all (1 midterm, 1 term paper, 1 final exam) and seems not to be graded too harshly. I would wholeheartedly recommend this class for econ and non-econ majors alike!",
    "GLBL 318 is a very interesting course that goes over the current drivers that are shaping the Next China. From consumer led growth to environmental sustainability China is moving towards a new era. The course illuminates what the Next China will look like. I would recommend it to another student. The material is very interesting and the professor is an expert in his field. Great course for those looking to learn a broad overview of the comings and goings of China.",
    "A pretty good class overall. Roach is a veteran in the field (having been with Morgan Stanley for ~30 years) and his book (Unbalanced) is great. His lectures get pretty repetitive-feeling toward the end of the class though, and it takes some effort to keep going to class and taking notes\/paying attention (but you should). In terms of grading, the class weights toward the end of the term -- the final paper (15 pages) and final exam (10 page take-home) are both due within a few days of each other, and it feels like you're writing words after words for the sake of Next China. That said, still an interesting, somewhat gutty class that's good for Econ majors and also globally-minded PoliSci or History majors too. Overall, recommend.",
    "great econ course about china",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student looking for a good Econ elective, or anyone even vaguely interested in China. It provides a good background on the political and economic history of China, as well as its status in the present-day, and changes it needs to make in order to perpetuate its incredible economic growth.",
    "Detailed description and reasoning as to why China experienced their 30 year miracle and a solid outline of their current plans with a framework leading to presumptions of what will happen in the next 30 years.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Knowing about China is essential, especially now as it rises towards being the most economically powerful country in the world.",
    "It was good. Learned relevant info + will retain that info.",
    "A must-take if you want to know anything or a lot about world's 2nd largest economy. Beware of the end of year cram- a paper and a take-home, otherwise a great lecture, very relevant to current affairs!",
    "A course for which the material is fairly intuitive but still should be known by everyone; no matter what field you go into, knowing about China will be essential. Pretty easy if you're into China\/any econ in general. Try to get to know Roach - he's a great mentor, very resourceful, and also hilarious.",
    "Enjoyable course, I would recommend if interested in China's recent history and economic transition.",
    "Yes take it. You will learn a lot about the Chinese and US economy. Not a lot of work until the end, where it does get overwhelming.",
    "Definitely! Enjoyable econ elective. Great professors. Great TAs. Well structured. Done. Take it.",
    "This is a good course on China, especially if you are economics oriented and know relatively nothing about the country. It is not super specific, but goes into their broad issues (energy consumption, savings, exports, pollution, etc). Roach is very knowledgeable and the class can get boring but if you pay attention will be worthwhile.",
    "Yes absolutely. Fascinating class and need to take it with him.",
    "Everyone says this is a gut, and in some aspects they're not wrong - midterm is open-note and finals are open-book. That doesn't necessarily make them easy though, since the prof is still looking for a specific answer and it's easy to miss the point he wants. But it's true that after the midterm especially you get to kind of space out.",
    "Learn a ton about china but hard to stay focused on lectures",
    "Good course with a good professor.",
    "If you don't know much about China, it's good to take.",
    "A good class, Professor Roach has good insights from a long career in the private sector. The class gets a bit repetitive, but that can be a good thing - I sometimes feel like Yale classes try to fit too much material into a semester. I'm quite sure that I won't quickly forget the material that I learned in this class. Assignments are a midterm, 10-15 page paper, and take home final.",
    "Interesting topic, slightly boring lecture",
    "Take it. Great Survey Course.",
    "Take it if you're interested in projections on China's future",
    "I highly recommend The Next China, for anyone who wants to have a solid understanding of how the Chinese economic miracle occurred, and why its economy is in the state it is now. The course studies the Chinese economy from various angles, and it also is very helpful in following China's current economic events, as this course is closely tied with the present occurrences of the Chinese economy.",
    "Pretty easy workload throughout the semester (end of the semester is a bit hectic with final paper and final take home exam that was basically another single-spaced 5-page paper), great professor\/TAs, and you come out of it having learned A LOT of useful, relevant info. Definitely recommend.",
    "It's an alright class, take it if you're looking for an Econ field credit. You get out of it what you put in. Required sections, but you just sit and listen unless it is one of your two days to present, midterm which allows 5 typed pages of notes, final paper and take-home final exam. All in all a good deal, relevant topic.",
    "Decent class and very manageable. It is what you make of it.",
    "Pretty good course for an econ credit, especially if you like politics\/current events. A lot of reading that you don't have to do. Kinda annoying that there was a take home final and final paper, but overall the workload isn't too bad.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's chill, and the work is minimal, but you end up learning a lot over the semester. It's not as repetitive as people tend to say.",
    "Pretty dry class but an interesting subject",
    "Really great course for someone unfamiliar with China's politics, economics, governance, etc. If you're very familiar with China already, maybe not worth your time. I learned a lot, though, and the workload is not bad at all.",
    "Yep! Good econ class; not too much work.",
    "Great class. Manageable course load. Take it if you are looking for an Econ credit and you are interested in China",
    "great class for an econ major and if you want to have some knowledge about the world economy. i would recommend as a good fifth class",
    "Good lecture class that provides an interesting look at the future of China's economy. The assignments weren't too hard and the exams were fine."
