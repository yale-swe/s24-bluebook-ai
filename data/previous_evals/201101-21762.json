   "comments": [
    "This is not a hard course. Neither is it a good course. Bruegemann isn't bad, but consider other profs.",
    "Required course. Sometimes interesting topics.",
    "It's boring, and I don't reccomend it.",
    "if you're an econ major you have to take it--don't need to read the textbook, not an insane amt of work, 1 pset a week, fair exams, decent ta help. if you're not an econ major you won't get much more out of this class than what you could get from intro macro. bruegemann's fine",
    "It's much easier than Intermediate Microeconomics. The material is interesting and the math is not difficult so I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A course on macroeconomics with micro foundations. Unlike intro macro, spent most of the time developing mathematical models. More focus on research and less on current events. I would not recommend it to non-econ majors.",
    "Pretty boring class.",
    "I mean, you gotta take it for the major. It's not nearly as bad as intermediate micro, especially because I had taken it with Samuelson, so after that this class was much more relaxed. You don't have a choice, so take it.",
    "Very mathematical based course which is pretty tough. Only take this class if its going to count towards your major.",
    "If you're an econ major you have to take it. My only recommendation is don't take it at 9 AM.",
    "Professor Bruegemann is a very competent, clear, dedicated, accessible and nice professor. The course was very amazingly well organized, building models gradually, and everytime I was reviewing the material, how everything all fit together made me really fulfilled. It is a great great course with a great professor!",
    "ECON 122 is a class that will let to think about macro in an different way, and if you are thinking about heading in the econ direction, I would recommend that you take this course.",
    "It's math and algebra-heavy. It is difficult, so if it's a major requirement then take it, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. The professor does a great job of helping with study aids\u00a0though.",
    "Easily one of the worst Econ courses I've taken. Though the instructor tries to be really helpful and answer questions and put forth his thoughts concisely and clearly, he fails to keep the attention of the students. I attended the first month of class and then it got too boring and I preferred the extra hour of sleep in the morning. The course content is very good, and the effort put in by the instructor in assigning psets and review material it is admirable, but the rest of it is just a sham. Make sure you get a good TA. My TA seemed really aloof and distant and never really got down to explaining things very well. I attended just a single section and then gave up.Maybe it's just me, but I thought that this course is unnecessarily hard. And the people who take it are really intense - the median for the midterm in this class was somewhere in the 90's - definitely not for the faint of heart.Try to skip it if you can, or do a summer session class somewhere. Hopefully it'll be better taught in the future.",
    "Professor Bruegemann was very generous with his model summaries and online material. He made the course accessible and manageable, and his organization of macroeconomic concepts is one of the greatest strengths of this course. His content, however, was sometimes obscured by his verbose form of expression. His verbosity in lecture and in his notes were good in that they logically laid out the concepts, but bad in that they overwhelmed his notes with text and necessitated the student to distinguish his points from his paragraph-form notes.Further weaknesses were the low level of interaction and discussion, and drawn-out lectures. Professor Bruegemann should assert some level of grading to be calculated on behalf of participation in section, or perhaps Bonus Points for participation in lecture. Macroeconomics is a very exciting field, but the early morning time of this class in conjunction with Professor Bruegemann's tendency to ramble were not conducive for reception of this excitement.The textbook was also a waste of money, as the problem sets along with rofessor Bruegemann's notes were sufficient to grasp the material. Not needing the textbook, however, is a positive reflection on the thoroughness of Professor Bruegemann and the dedication he has to this course. He was very accessible outside of class (or so I felt, since I never went to office hours), but his willingness to communicate with his students via email and after class fostered an atmosphere of intellectual discourse if desired. Overall, this course can be improved with more interactive lectures and more concise notes, but it is nevertheless a necessary and interesting course.",
    "Although prof. Bruegemann's lecture can be a little dry, the effort he puts into it does make the class rewarding. The problem sets are easy but make sure that you understand the concept behind the problems so when the class gets harder later, you will know what's going on.",
    "Take it only if you're an econ major",
    "This class is very pedantic and boring, and you do not learn anything additional to intro macro in terms of theory. All you'll do is learn if an economic variable goes up or down when another one goes up or down under different model assumptions. That's the whole course. It's not terribly difficult however, and the professor provides so many study guides and summaries and handouts that I found attending lecture was unnecessary.",
    "This course is a requirement for the Econ major. I would recommend this one over the more theoretical one, as I heard that one is too difficult to be of any use unless you want a PhD. This class can be a bit dry, but it's useful and not too hard if you attend lectures and do the problem sets with help from section.",
    "I would highly recommend this class! It was great!",
    "The course is not the most interesting, and sometimes I even felt like I lost my intuition about macroeconomics and the way things work in the economy as a whole. But at the same time, it gives you a good look at how modeling is done in macroeconomics, and I suppose the conclusion is that intuition is sometimes insufficient in learning about macroeconomics. The exams and problem sets seemed fair.",
    "It's overall a good class, and one that you have to take if you want to be an econ major. The class is less stressful than Intermediate Micro and much less math oriented. It might be worth exploring how it is with Nordhaus in the fall.",
    "If you are an econ major then take it since it is mandatory. But if you are not, I do not recommend. It is very abstract, and personally I found it pretty boring.",
    "Ican't imagine why any non-Econ major would want to take this class. Simply put, it's incredibly boring. I've never fallen asleep in class before and I did in this class...multiple times.The problem sets are really tricky and EVERYONE went to office hours if they wanted to get a good grade. Plus section. It was a lot of extra time, since there's a problem set every week. At least the TAs were helpful with problem sets, which is more than I can say for my intermediate micro experience. Also a midterm and a final, which is to be expected; the midterm was reasonable but the final felt like it was plucked out of thin air.I took this class after intermediate micro, which was helpful, since this class is lot more mathematical than intro macro; you use micro principles to derive models of the macroeconomy. It's actually a cool premise, except that it's really, really boring to sit through lecture.All that said, Bruegemann is a really nice guy. He puts so much work into this class, posting all kinds of materials and summaries and guides. I've heard his office hours are helpful, though who really wants to go to Friday office hours for a problem set due WEdnesday??",
    "A thorough if sometimes tedious overview of the basics of macroeconomics. The methodology is rigorous, yet subsequent conclusions are not too enlightening. I would have liked to see less emphasis on building and rebuilding a model of the macroeconomy and instead more emphasis on general pocketable intuitions. A requirement for econ or continued economic studies, but not the most exciting of courses.Bruegemann is extremely dedicated and nice, but unfortunately he won't be teaching next year.",
    "Intermediate Macro is a prereq for most of the cool Econ seminars, and Br\u00fcgemann's class is good because he puts a lot of extra time into helping students.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student interested in macroeconomics or economics in general. It is an interesting course and essential for advanced study of macroeconomics.",
    "Do not take this class. Take the more advanced economic math class if you actually want to learn about economic models."
