   "comments": [
    "Professional Ethics was a great class in which we learned a lot about ethics in the work place! Professor Carreras is a wonderful professor and any student would definitely love her! I would recommend this class to other students! Students should definitely take this class before graduating.",
    "This class is so ridiculously little work, it's amazing.",
    "Interesting and light course load.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! The lectures are mostly fun (maybe not always interesting) and the workload is not bad at all.",
    "Easy course, not a lot of work but daily homework assignments are assigned that will take 1-2 hours each. All assignments are take home though, so no stress of finals or examinations\/actually knowing the material. The class is essentially completing busy work for an A.",
    "A great course with a great professor",
    "Low key class with a good deal of work on weekly basis, but minimal.",
    "A lot of people don't come to this class. I find this sad. Mercedes is one of the nicest professors at Yale, something slightly humorous always happens in every class, and we tend to watch a lot of Eli Stone and Suits. There is a semi-substantial amount of weekly work, but nothing is difficult at all.",
    "work isnt hard, you just have to do it. the prof isnt very well organized but the readings are interesting. very good 5th class to take. however, there is a 15 page paper at the end so you do have to do that. pretty much the only big thing you have to do all semester though.",
    "An easy, painless class. A lot of the people in the class don't really care that much about it, and attendance is very, very low. But meeting Professor Carreras makes this class worth it, because she is so nice. The work is tedious, but if you do all of it, you will do very well in the class. An easy 5th credit.",
    "Great class, definitely recommend it.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you need a solid 5th\/6th class in your schedule, really light workload - weekly case studies, a midterm and final (which are just doing one case study) and one 12 page paper on a topic you pick.",
    "Take it. easy.",
    "Yes.",
    "This is a very easy class and taught by a very chill professor. The only work consists of a weekly homework assignment, a take home midterm and final exam (which are also homework assignments...?), and a 10-15 page final essay on any topic regarding ethics.",
    "Not a lot of work that can be enjoyable. Yes I would recommend a class if you are looking for a lighter workload. The professor is energetic and engages the class and readings are in depth and interesting.",
    "Extremely easy fifth class. Not a lot of work, just weekly homeworks, an essay and a take home final. Mercedes is the best, you should take as many classes with her as you can.",
    "definitely take this class if you are taking 5 courses",
    "Definitely take it at some point in your carreer. I loved this class. Professor Carreras is the sweetest, most hilarious professor ever! Relevant coursework without being overly-challenging.",
    "Definitely take this class. Grading was extremely fair and the professor is great.",
    "If you want to learn more about different ethical viewpoints in a colloquial setting, this is a great class to do that. It is very relaxed and introspective.",
    "Take this class. No brainer. The homework assignments are basically reading comprehension, and you don't have to go to class to be able to do the homework, though class was actually interesting. Prof. Carreras is quite the character. We were supposed to have a midterm paper but it ended up just being another homework assignment. The take-home final was basically another homework assignment also. The only annoying thing is that there was a 15 page paper worth only 15% of the grade, so it felt kind of like a waste of time. Otherwise, really a gem. If you need an easy fifth class, this is definitely the one you want.",
    "Amazing class, take it.",
    "Take it. It's easy and relaxing.",
    "Great class to learn about some of the classic theories of ethics and a moral life. Mercedes does a great job of introducing the theories, and no previous ethics knowledge is required.",
    "Absolute must at Yale. So Easy!!",
    "A gut. Plain and simple. The majority of students in the class will be athletes, many will not show up to class on a regular basis, and Mercedes knows this. The class format keeps things interesting every week, but don't expect to get anything substantive out of this class except a nice GPA boost.",
    "Professional Ethics was an interesting class, to say the least. It basically involves you reading an article once a week and then answering about 10 reading response type questions and submitting them for a grade each week. If you go to class, you pretty much just listen to Mercedes talk - it is kind of like a mixture of story time and her stream of consciousness. But overall the class was enjoyable - definitely a good 5th class.",
    "It's such a gut, so keep that in mind going in. It's very easy once you know what the professor is looking for. Take it if you're looking for a very easy class with not that much work.",
    "Professional ethics covers interesting topics but on a very basic level. This class very easy and requires very little work. PE is a good 5th class if you are looking for a class with a nice professor and not much work but don't go into it expecting to learn a lot.",
    "A gem",
    "This is the best class I have taken at Yale. I would recommend you take this class as soon as you possibly can. Mercedes Carreras is my favorite professor and is a hoot to learn from.",
    "I would if it was offered as a seminar. Material is really quite interesting.",
    "Great course, weekly homework's that are very straight forward. Both the exams were take homes and were no different to the homework's. There is a 15 page paper, not sure how its graded as I haven't got my grade back yet.",
    "Interesting and relelvent course",
    "This class is an interesting introduction into the professional world, and ethical issues that one may face in the workplace. No matter your future profession, every student can benefit from the ethical lessons taught in this class with regards to decision making in the real world. I would recommend this class to another student. Not too much work and interesting material.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Bear in mind though that the material can be a bit dry if you aren't willing to put the time and effort into truly understanding it.",
    "Meets twice a week, Professor Carreras is amazing, take this class, one problem set a week, paper and final.",
    "Fun class overall, for those who aren't incredibly into philosophy or understand it much, this class is a great way to learn about the ethical behavior and useful professional skills",
    "Yes. Interesting class with light workload",
    "Great class and highly recommended. Always a fun time in lecture and the workload isn't too heavy. Weekly HW, midterm, final, and paper.",
    "Take this course. It is really interesting and there is not a lot of work.",
    "An awesome way to explore ethical behavior from a business perspective",
    "ENAS 335 is perfect if you are looking for an easy class with a very light workload where you'll still take something away. Professor Carreras cares very deeply about her students and for that I am very grateful.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who is looking for an interesting, lighter class to round out their schedule.",
    "A great class to take",
    "No. What a waste of a spot on my schedule. Infuriating that this is even a class, and at Yale of all places. The worst part is that the topic and material could actually be really important and interesting... If this were a real class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student but there is quite a lot of work. I don't really know why some people say it is a gut course, because it is not. Although it is not the most complicated course I have taken at Yale, it is still challenging. .",
    "This is a class that is supposed to be little work, but the weekly homework assignments are a waste of time and annoying. Writing a 15 page paper was somewhat difficult as well when you are not really learning much. Also, the midterm and final were just basic reading assignments. Overall a low stress, easy course, but don't expect to get much out of it.",
    "Professional ethics could be a good option to counter balance your course weight. The homework is really manageable and easy--at the end of the day it's a course on ethics, so a lot of answers come out of common sense. Professor Carreras is really sweet and interesting. You will get to see more about major proposers of ethical theories but in a superficial way; if you're looking for a deep analysis of ethics, this is not a course for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Interesting material and easy course load.",
    "Definitely worth taking, highly recommend. Does not cover very much material but class is fun and its not a hard course.",
    "I would take it. Weekly homework assignments. Classes were for the most part enjoyable. Very low stress.",
    "Yes, this class is a gem. Interesting\/engaging\/fun lecture, and just right work load.",
    "An overview of ethical issues faced by professions from a more rigorous academic viewpoint (by incorporating philosophy into the course of discussion).",
    "This is a very easy class- quite the gut. Don't be scared off by the \"weekly assignments\" or inclusion of both a \"final\" (which is take home) and a paper, it really is not a lot of work. It's an easy class, and relatively fun.",
    "Super easy class. Not sure how much you learn. The homeworks were pretty much busy work. The hardest part of the exam was the 15 pg paper but its worth getting through it for the easy A",
    "haha",
    "very great class into ethics in the corporate world",
    "Great class. You learn a lot. The material is not too difficult, neither is homework.",
    "Provides a solid ethical framework for considering issues\/problems in the workplace. Definitely take this if you're thinking about doing ANY job that involves other people...The study truly applies to everyone.",
    "Definitely take this course.",
    "The best possible 5th class, but you won't learn that much.",
    "A good fifth class. You learn about some philosophers, different thoughts to take into consideration when making decisions, different case studies in the field of ethics, and watch some cool videos, too. Easy grading and Carreras is a wonderful and kind professor.",
    "Very easy and you can actually take away some important issues in the business world.",
    "Good course on applied ethics that covers numerous important Western philosophers."
