   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend CHNS 132. Everyone in the class has a different background in Chinese, which makes it interesting and a little intimidating at first, but your Chinese skills improve a great deal.",
    "I definitely recommend this class especially if you only know how to speak but not how to read or write. After one term, you will be able to write 600+ characters and recognize 1000-2000 characters; this is very fast paced, but your reading and writing in Chinese will improve drastically. It does require one to devote many hours to learning the characters, but it will be well worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend CHNS132 to another student. It's important for a heritage speaker to learn more about his\/her culture, and that begins with an understanding of the language. As a heritage course, CHNS 132 is very intense and fast-paced. One negative aspect of the class is that it is possible for everyone in 132 to be at extremely different levels of proficiency in writing. Most of the grade in the class is based on writing and grammar rather than fluency in speaking, so those who already know a good number of characters will probably find the class easier than someone who knows no\/minimal characters. However, the professor and TAs work hard to answer any questions you may have, and the fast-paced nature of the class forces you to learn to quickly master many characters, even if it takes a lot of time. By the end of the course, you will have visible improvement in your mastery of the language.",
    "Definitely take it! Chinese is such a useful language and you won't find a better teacher. Make sure to put in consistent work everyday so you won't fall behind. I'm talking about 2 hours everyday, no excuses.",
    "The class is structured in a way that makes it hard not to improve in Chinese - you have class everyday, class is small so everyone participates a lot, homework everyday, quiz basically every morning. The homework load is pretty consistent though and sometimes doesn't take more than 30 minutes, so it was not too stressful. Speaking Chinese is awkward for everyone at first but Liu Laoshi is good at breaking that, so that by the end of the class had a good rapport."
