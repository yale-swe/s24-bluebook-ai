    "it's definitely a class you read for but you want to rad for it. take it. just take it.",
    "If you can get in, do not hesitate to take this class.",
    "YES IT IS A MUST TAKE. In addition to covering all sorts of interesting material, the class is run in a fantastically organized way that fosters great discussion and group participation. Also Chun fosters a great relationship between him and his students, such that the class becomes way more than any other seminar. People get close and really enjoy spending time together",
    "This class is excellent. It really changes the way you think about some issues and exposes you to really cool new research. The workload is really not that bad, but you do need to do the readings. The class is heavily based on in class discussion, so students who are uncomfortable with that should reconsider taking this course. At the very least, I can promise that you will learn lots and it won't be a waste of a credit.",
    "ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES I'VE TAKEN AT YALE. This is what a Yale education is all about. TRY TO GET IN AND ENJOY IT!!!!",
    "The weekly debates are really interesting and you will learn so much. The material itself is super current and interesting, and the discussion spurred by the debates should be very lively.",
    "Mind, Brain, and Society was a good class that will hopefully be even better in the future. The topics were all awesome, but I didn't love the class format.",
    "This is a FANTASTIC course! It is definitely one of my all-time favorite Yale courses and I would HIGHLY recommend it! Class discussions are fascinating and Professor Chun is great!",
    "If you are lucky enough to get in, absolutely take MBS. The course topics are fascinating, at the cutting-edge of neuroscience, discussions and debates are lively, and there are few professors\/seminar leaders better than Marvin Chun. Professor Chun, in addition to being an excellent seminar leader with an impressive mastery of his field and uncanny ability to express complex ideas and topics accessibly to lay people, is an excellent human being. His tireless dedication to his class and students is both genuine and inspiring. The workload is not that heavy (weekly responses), and if you're interested in the course topics, you will love to do the readings (this is one of the rare classes where I did all of the reading every week). Probably the best class I've taken at Yale, and it's a great way to end the psychologymajor.",
    "This course is amazing. Marvin Chun is awesome. He treats the students really well, and he is a great instructor and moderator. The course covers many interesting topics and the work is not too onerous.",
    "YES YES YES. This was by far one of the best learning experiences I've had at Yale. And a Psych background is not necessary. Our class was that much better and had stronger debates simply because we had students of all disciplines: law, medicine, evolutionary biology, philosphy, etc. The issues discussed in this class have an immediate application to society, and class time is incredibly interesting. Marvin Chun is a marvelous professor, and you should absolutely take this class, if you're lucky enough to get a spot.",
    "Take it!!!!",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. This class is hard to get into but its SO worth it.",
    "GREAT COURSE. You read a variety of neurobiological studies along with papers discussing the societal and ethical implications. IN-class, you do debates and discussions which are ALWAYS totally awesome and made more so by the variety of majors represented in the clas (poli sci, econ, psych, bio, and more!). It's tricky to have a reading response due every monday at 9:00 AM, but you'll get it done (and will really enjoy doing it). Professor Chun is SO SO AWESOME and you HAVE to seize the chance to have a course with him, especially a seminar. Each day was incredibly interesting, and this course is probably the one that comes up the most in everyday conversation and in other classes!I cannot recommend this course enough. TAKE IT! WOOHOO!You'll come out of it with a bunch of new friends, abunch of new ideas, and a bunch of renewed enthusiasm in classes.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Neuroscience is changing the landscape of so much that if you have any interest in the future of the legal field, marketing, and really any component of modern society, you should take this course. Also very accessible to non majors",
    "Amazing. If you can get in, take it; when I took it there were 100 students and he took 22.",
    "One of my all-time favorite courses after 8 semesters at Yale. It is difficult to articulate just how amazing Professor Chun is in this course- he is a brilliant scientist with an infectious enthusiasm for the subject matter and also cares deeply about his students. Some of my favorite moments at Yale were in this class, sitting in the Berkeley Master's House and discussing fascinating topics about neuroscience and life. The all-star group of students Professor Chun selects makes the class what it is, and an amazing sense of community developed over the course of the semester (against all logic there were many pictures of MBSers sent to a GroupMe we made for the class during the senior Myrtle Beach trip...what other seminar could that happen in?). Overall the seminar was an extremely rewarding intellectual experience while also being a ton of fun. Such an amazing and quintessential Yale experience that I hope I will never forget. Join the MBS Society!! You'll be glad you did.",
    "I definitely recommend this class! A lot of people apply, but if you get in, take it! Professor Chun picks a great group of students, so not only is the discussion interesting, but you get to meet some really cool people. Professor Chun is also really funny, and I always looked forward to class.",
    "YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS. This was absolutely my favorite class this semester, and one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Chun has perfected this class, from the reading list to the students he selects to take it. The topics are all really interesting, and the format of the class (student presentations, discussions, mini-lecture by Prof. Chun) is conducive to class discussion and creates a great academic atmosphere. The environment is very friendly and collaborative, and the discussions are always both fun and academically stimulating. And, of course, Professor Chun is AMAZING, whether he's talking about neuroscience or just chatting with students at the BK Master's House, and there's no way not to love a class with him. Take this class and enjoy it - trust me, if I could, I'd take it twice."
