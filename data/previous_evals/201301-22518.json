    "Great class ! Su laoshi is the man ! definitely learn a lot about china and improved a lot on reading, listening and writing. If you can take it, TAKE IT",
    "It covers a good selection of pieces from \u00e9\u00b2\u0081\u00e8\u00bf\u0085\u00e3\u0080\u0081\u00e5\u00b7\u00b4\u00e9\u0087\u0091\u00e3\u0080\u0081\u00e8\u0080\u0081\u00e8\u0088\u008d\u00e3\u0080\u0081\u00e8\u008c\u0085\u00e7\u009b\u00be, etc. There is some discussion on the literary qualities of their work, but most of it is still focused on key terms and grammar.",
    "Good to keep up reading skills",
    "I think the materials that we read in this course are fantastic, so that alone makes the course pretty worth it. However, I would often get frustrated at what I felt was a slight lack of organization in class. It's not really a bad thing per se just a matter of different preferences. I am used to, and prefer, the super organized and structured classes of Zhang Shucheng and William Zhou. In this class there was a lot of Su Laoshi going off on tangents for a while, which were almost super interesting things like his time in Hainan during the Cultural Revolution, but it just depends on what you want from the class. But again, the reading materials are fantastic!",
    "Yes, this was a great class."
