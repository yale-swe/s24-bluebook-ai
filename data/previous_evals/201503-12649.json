   "comments": [
    "It's an \"ask whats on your mind\" about policing in America to a very well informed police chief and his officers (who visit often).",
    "If you treat each class like it's a Residential College Master's tea, then it's fun and interesting. It requires very little work\/preparation for class, and it isn't very rigorous. But we learn about a fascinating framework for policing, which Chief Esserman has experience implementing in New Haven. It's also a personal look at our police force in this city.",
    "Take this class. Very minimal workload, phenomenal discussion, and a great professor. The class requirements are 2 5pg papers, and a few reports on a police ride-along and community statistics meeting.",
    "If you have questions about policing, this is a great class for you. Chief Esserman cares so much about his job and about making sure students get their question answered, and the guests he brings in are incredibly interesting. Class is definitely not fact-paced, but if you come in with questions, Chief is more than happy to answer them and to connect you with other people in the department.",
    "Great class. Not a ton of work, but rewarding and eye opening. Forces you to observe policing around you in a new light and engage with real problems facing the New Haven community. Chief is great, and he really does care a ton about this class and his students.",
    "Take it, but sign up early. Very tough to get in.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was truly unique and my favorite class at Yale.",
    "Chief Esserman is a patriot and I am grateful for his service to our community and country. His course provides a realistic, unedited picture of policing in America through the lens of New Haven's Police Department.",
    "Yes, not your typical professor and not your typical background",
    "Very unorthodox class but honestly one of my favorites. You should definitely take it if you're lucky enough to get in. The readings are interesting, but the heart of the course is the discussions each week with the chief. Everyone goes to CompStat and on a ride-along with a police officer at least once each, and those experiences are really enlightening. Don't expect this course to be anything like your other seminars, but it's one of Poli Sci's best.",
    "Amazing class. This are the types of classes you come to Yale for",
    "Great class"
