    "Being forced to watch myself on video was very helpful.",
    "Content, Pace and the coaches",
    "The weekly practice in our group.",
    "Very broad overview of different topics in short time. Thus, the course was very intensive but very helpful to learn tools of effective communication. I think a class like this should actually be mandatory for everyone! Maybe this can be integrated into the syllabus this way. I especially liked the presentation skills and the exercises we did in the group - I also learned a lot about the different type of roles within a group\/team (very helpful) and enjoyed to work with others on theses topics and exchange our experiences & learnings. I appreciated the structure of the class, in particular that we had a coach who was attributed to each group and guided the exercises. I also appreciated the video format so we could experience us on video and be more aware of how we communicate. Great class!!",
    "The course is very practical and constantly based on communications practice. It is a must for every student, regardless of their interests and area of expertise. It teaches valuable skills for public speaking and clear communication.",
    "I really enjoyed the break out sessions",
    "The feedback from the communication specialists and peers was very valuable. Also being able to watch my presentations on video afterwards was great in terms of defining what I need to do to improve.",
    "Although it was a bit tough to follow a practice session, I felt that I was challenged and learned more about communicating skills. Also it was useful to have various possible occasions in the practice time.",
    "Practicing speaking in real time, and getting more of a framework for how to participate in meeting and lead panels.",
    "Presentations, speeches, pannels",

   "comments": [
    "The course was well designed in spite of the cancellation of a couple of classes.",
    "- Any activity that involved playing pretend was essentially useless. It does me no good to \"practice\" participating in a debate or meeting if I'm also pretending to be someone whose views are entirely opposed to mine. Our time would have been better spent with more speaking - There's no good way of adopting feedback. We do an activity, get feedback, and then never do the activity again. It would be better to have the public speaking run 1\/2 as long (a 2 min preso instead of 5), but run through it twice. The 1 time I saw a student do that, the impact was huge. - It would be REALLY helpful to have a session spent reviewing our actual coverletters. At the very least, we should be required to write one prior to the class so that we have something to improve. That is a very relevant skill. - Evaluations should be submitted (even just on paper) immediately after the course, not 2 months later",
    "Offer a full semester version of this course, and\/or directly integrate the material into other courses.",
    "Nothing.. Everything was perfect",
    "None",
    "Unfortunately, because of weather conditions we had to move some classes to same day. I do think that for this class it is actually better to have several classes over a longer timeframe instead of long classes once or twice because the material needs to sink in and it helps to repeat it over time so that the lessons & messages are really saved on the \"hard-drive\" of our brains. Thus, if something similar would happen next year I would rather extend the class instead of reduce the length in weeks.",
    "More sessions for practice.",
    "I would have preferred to take this course my first semester so that I could use the skills learned right away. Also, the instructor seems a bit formal and \"old school\", networking and communication these days does not always take this approach.",
    "I would rather the course build on the skills taught at the beginning rather than adding new modules. For instance, there are other resources available to students interested in learning to negotiate. That time would be better spent doing additional presentation, panel, or group work practice. The negotiation module, in particular, required a certain degree of inventiveness and improv that was difficult for some students. Perhaps instead, the course could culminate in a final class in which each student makes a very short power point presentation and then participates in a mock panel interview. (just one idea)"

    "Good relationship! Lecture was short and informative and lab section gave us enough time to experiment with learnings from lecture. I liked the amount of time attributed to the sections we had enough time to discuss and exchange learnings. I have following suggestion for class exercise: more role play in the sense of real-life examples for us: group of 5 where 4 for example play SOM students (or law students, engineers at a company,...) who are not at all interested in environmental issues. 1 person needs to convince them that it is important. and then switch around (other are 4 people in that role and 1 person tries to convince them). Also, this is a good example for women leadership and communication within men-led culture - 4 play men with traditional view (not taking women very seriously) and 1 play women. Or age difference 4 play 50-60 year old and 1 play 26 year old who want to convince them of new idea\/mindset\/... then discuss: What are the learnings - what are the tools that help convince people. How can you promote your voice and message?",

This was because I was surrounded by the native English speakers and I felt I was really vulnerable in terms of what I speak and how I speak. It was really good experience for me to try to convey my messages under such an 'uncomfortable' conditions. Thanks for the great class!",
