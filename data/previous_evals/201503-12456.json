    "If you're passionate about research, then definitely do it!",
    "Research is what you make of it. Make sure you have a good PI and mentor and you'll be fine.",
    "Nice to get a credit for something I was going to do anyway.",
    "Research for credit.",
    "I would recommend this course to any MCDB major who plans on conducting research during the school year - it requires the same amount of time as the student would probably invest in working in a lab without getting a credit and writing the paper at the end provides great practice for writing other scientific papers, lab reports for classes, and the senior requirement.",
    "There's not much to say about this class, since everyone's experience will be different. If you like working in your lab and would put 10-12 hours a week into it anyway, you may as well take it. Don't take it every semester. Also, just because it's mandatory Pass\/Fail (assuming you're not a senior) doesn't mean it won't be a lot of time and work. I put more work into it than into any of my other classes, because I cared about my research more than I cared about the grade.",
    "I think this class is worth taking if you're planning to do research in a lab anyway. The only work required is a research proposal at the beginning of the semester and a final report due on the last day of classes, both of which I found helpful to shape my understanding of my research experience.",
    "If you are interested in research this is a great course to get lab experience for credit prior to the senior thesis."
