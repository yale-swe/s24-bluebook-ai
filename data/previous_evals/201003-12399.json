   "comments": [
    "Be prepared to learn a lot but also to do a lot of work. I personally found the tests rather difficult. Quizzes are also frequent. However in the end, you do have a great command of the Japanese language.",
    "it's not as fun and interactive as japn 110\/120, but i learned a lot nonetheless. the teachers are really great and funny (their homemade videos are hilarious!); you can tell they love what they do. we switched from the jsl textbook to sura sura halfway through, which was kind of jarring. lectures weren't as strictly organized (which could be seen as good or bad). a couple of classes fell flat for me--talking about crime in new haven is difficult with 3 semesters worth of japanese. but if you're serious about continuing to learn japanese, by all means take it.",
    "I thought it was a good effective course in intermediate Japanese. The kanji gets a little bit fast paced, but considering the number of kanji one should learn to be functional, it's a good pace.",
    "Take it if you took Japanese last year, definitely worth it!",
    "Take it if you want to take an eastern language. Also, if you want to use light fellowship, you will have to take two terms of the target language. Japan is a great country and I'm pretty sure hanging out in Tokyo is a fun thing to do over the summer.",
    "Definitely take this course! It is a very fun class, you learn a lot, and the teachers are extremely friendly!",
    "Yes. If you want to continue your Japanese study, this class is no doubt worth taking.",
    "This course is a great continuation from the first year of Japanese. The classroom style is similar in the beginning, since the third part of the JSL textbook series is used. Halfway through the course, you switch to a textbook called Sura Sura that finally has other topics to read about besides daily life conversations.",
    "Japanese 130 is similar to 120 except in the last part of the class you start using a new textbook and there is more emphasis on kanji.The class is silly and fun but there is a lot of homework.",
    "If you want to get better at Japanese, this is the way to go. There is a lot of work, but if you do it all (thoughtfully, and well), then your skills will improve, guaranteed. The professors are great, the materials relatively well-organized, and the class will make you study and will give you a life skill at the end - better than any other grade.",
    "Definitely take it! By the time you get to 130 your knowledge of Japanese is pretty strong, and your confidence in listening and speaking will improve dramatically. The work is definitely manageable, especially coming from L1-L2.",
    "L3 is much more work-intensive than L1-L2, so be prepared to step up your game. Nightly homework takes longer, and there are many more grammar points to be learned. But anyone who is taking this class is taking it for a requirement's sake or personal reasons, so it's not the sort of course one recommends or doesn't recommend.",
    "This is a fun class. Both Seto-sensei and Maruyama-sensei are amazing, understanding, and friendly, and the class is quite entertaining. You can really tell how much the teachers care about the class; they've made dozens of adorable videos to go along with the lessons. In addition to translation exercises and kanji review, our homework occasionally included things like listening to Japanese songs or watching clips from Japanese television shows. Though I didn't love JSL, everything gets better when you switch to Sura Sura. There's something really satisfying about looking back at a Japanese passage that's a couple pages long and knowing you can read it. All in all, it's a great class. Several times I left class wishing it had lasted longer.",
    "Yale's Japanese faculty is probably the best you'll come by on campus. They are accommodating, nice and at the same time very thorough teachers. I'd definitely recommend this course, given that you love the language enough to not mind the course load (which is quite tough, by the way). The laid-back nature of each class makes me look forward to my mornings.You'll also learn a ton of Japanese."
