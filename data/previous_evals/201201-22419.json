    "Difficult exams, but great class.",
    "***YOU MUST EMAIL DR. KLEIN EARLY TO GET IN (like a semester in advance)***BEST LAB EVER. YOU GET TO DO REAL STUFF like in vitro fertilization, making a chimeric embryo, extracting sperm and eggs from mice and frogs. You do dissect lots of animals, so if that makes you uncomfortable, you should think about that first. The practical exam was really hard and really specific. The final was more manageable. There are no weekly write-ups; only the two exams (50% and 50%).",
    "It's good, take it but prepare to be really frustrated.",
    "i recommend it. though it is 2 test each 20% of grade. so be prepared to study your ass of for them. also the first one is a bunch of slides so it is mostly hit or miss and a lot of guessing is going on but at least the first test is before the drop date. the second test is more essays and understanding what you did. it is not so bad",
    "A lot of memorization. No labs but the tests are hard and cumulative.",
    "Extremely good lab. We did so many things that I never dreamed possible for an undergraduate class. I came out of each session feeling accomplished and enlightened, not worn out and cranky like I felt after all other labs I've taken.",
    "Two midterms, 50% each. First is based on slide identification, dissection identification, and some short answer questions (for example, identify the structure on the slide\/in the dissection and explain its function). Very difficult to prepare for, and low average. Second midterm was short answer\/essay and comprehensive, but fair. Memorize the procedures and understand the concepts.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The techniques you learn are great, as long as you are okay with dissections.",
    "This is a super fun lab class! You do dissections just about every week and get to learn some really complicated (and rewarding) techniques. Lab performance doesn't factor into your grade, which is kind of annoying, so don't worry about getting every procedure perfectly. It was great to enjoy the class without writing lab reports, but the midterm and final both required lots of studying.",
    "Best lab at Yale! Take it. No write ups. One midterm and one final. The exams are challenging, but if you study you should be fine.",
    "This lab is very chill and relaxed since there are no lab reports or assignments outside of class. However, your grade is entirely dependent on the midterm and final: the midterm is a lab practical that's pretty difficult (memorize the slides!!), and the final consisted of several essay questions. I would recommend this lab to anyone looking for a bio lab with an easy workload, and you get to practice useful lab techniques.",
    "yes, its a great lab and really the only undergrad lab where you get to do dissections and cutting edge lab techniquesno lab reports are awesome, although the tests are hard and the curve is terrible",
    "TAKE THIS LAB RIGHT NOW. It's probably one of the best bio labs at Yale. It's probably one of the best labs at Yale. Klein is great, the labs are great, everything is great. Sessions tend to run long, but you won't notice because it's fun. It helps at lot with the class (which you should also take). Your grade is dependent on one midterm and one final, which isn't totally fair since you'll be spending so much time in lab, but you can fix that by memorizing everything and then acing both exams.Try to contact her a year in advance. This lab fills up super quickly.THERE ARE NO LAB REPORTS. HALLELUJAH.",
    "I would take this course if you need an upper level laboratory class in the field of biology.",
    "Recommended! Warning: you really do need to e-mail very, very early in order to get into this lab course!",
    "This is a great lab because it is really heavy on hands-on learning and does not require weekly lab reports, but BEWARE OF THE LIBERTY IT GIVES YOU. The only graded assignments are a mid-term practical and a final exam so be prepared when they come along.",
    "definitely - but be prepared to do well on the midterm& final, since they are the sole determinants of your grade",
    "I took this to fulfill premed requirements and it isn't a lot of work except for the midterm and final but if you're not okay will recently killed animals for the purpose of your studies you should think twice about this lab.",
    "It's the best lab I've taken: you get to dissect a lot of mice and frogs, and perform really cool procedures like IVF and making chimeric mice embryos. It's probably the most interesting biology lab Yale offers. In terms of workload, it's basically nothing but reading through the lab manual and physically going to class and performing the labs... until the midterm and final, which are each 50% of your grade. The midterm is a bit ridiculous, it's a practical format and stressful, and very difficult (almost impossible) to prepare for and do well on. The final was much more reasonable, a normal short-answer test. I would definitely recommend the course, but only if you're willing to risk not getting a particularly good grade. (We didn't get our midterms back until after the credit d deadline, although before the drop deadline) Even if you're willing to study an exorbitant amount for the midterm, there's really no guarantee. That being said, compared to other labs I've taken, this one was consistently engaging and Dr. Klein is awesome!",
    "I really enjoyed this lab! There are no lab reports, so the work load is manageable when taking other difficult classes. The midterm is a practical that requires a lot of studying, and the final is written. Each is 50% of the grade.",
    "Take this class, especially if you're interested in surgery or reproductive health. You learn so much about human reproduction and the course is just immensely interesting. That being said, this lab can be really frustrating at times. You might spend hours working on something, only to get no results. Also, this course uses animal models, so don't take it if you're squeamish around blood. Finally, the only grades are the final and a 50% midterm lab practical, so you go out of the class not really sure what your grade is.",
    "The variety of dissections was really great. The lectures were informative. The flow of the course was a little choppy at times. It would be better if it matched the lecture course for reproductive biology. The heavy emphasis on the two exams was not ideal, because if one messed up the midterm, doing well on the final wouldn't necessarily help. Perhaps a bigger distribution of the grade would be better. Take this concurrently with the course because it does help somewhat.",
    "It easy in the sense that there isn't much work during the semester. However, the mid term is hell (I'm a pre-med so science classes are the norm and this was unusually difficult). Its all practical recognize the slides sort of thing. The final is reasonable, but since you will likely feel crappy about the midterm, your grade will be lower than you would like.",
    "You get to do really awesome experiments that bring light to a lot of stuff we talk about in bio classes but never get the hands-on experience. The professor is really great, she cares for her students. Expect to spend almost the full amount of time in lab every week, towards the end some of them get quicker. The only flaw of this course is that it's only based on the 2 exam grades - midterm and final 50\/50. The final is a lot better than the midterm, but be prepared to memorize lots of slides for the midterm practical.",
    "Recommend the class. One of the most exciting Bio Labs in the MCDB department",
    "Be prepared for less work than most labs because it lacks lab reports but a very challenging midterm (the average was a 68 this past term).",
    "Yes, if you are pre-med",
    "This is one of my favorite classes I've taken! If you're considering it, take it!!! You'll learn a lot, do really cool experiments, and enjoy the entire experience. The midterm and final are challenging, but if you take learning in the lab seriously and study for the midterm and the final, you'll do fine!",
    "Like I said, make sure you know that the exams are really tough. Otherwise it's nice not to have lab reports."
