    "I don't think I would recommend it to another student unless they were passionate about the subject matter.",
    "Olympic\/sport theory NOT Olympic\/sport history at all whatsoever. I would recommend the class, however, if you are interested in the philosophy behind sports; and just taking a class on sports in general is intriguing.",
    "Really great course. If you have any desire to learn more about Olympics or sporting in general, take this course. Great professor, great subject.",
    "Definitely take it! Not too much work and even when you don't do the readings super thoroughly you get so much out of class discussion.",
    "While a Junior Seminar, this course certainly doesn't slam you with work. However, there is still a fair amount of reading and the papers are valued more off their controversial nature rather by their written skill, which is a good thing."
