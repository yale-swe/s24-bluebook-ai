   "comments": [
    "Yes! Everyone should take this class just to be an informed citizen.",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in the important questions of American politics. Prof. Hacker is awesome and you will find something to enjoy out of this class.",
    "This class is okay. The topic is pretty interesting though it does get repetitive. The discussion in our seminar was not that engaging. Professor Hacker is very nice, responsive, and knowledgeable. Overall it's a pretty good seminar.",
    "Great chance to learn about inequality and American democracy from one of the topic's foremost academics!",
    "Probably. If you can deal with the 9:25am time, it's a good course. You won't find anyone more knowledgeable than Hacker. That said, check out the other students in the class - if it's not a lively discussion, the only thing that'll keep you coming back is how hilarious (and brilliant) Hacker himself is - and it'll devolve into a more lecture-like setting, though this isn't a terrible outcome.Watch out for the VERY LONG final paper. If you're a senior with no particular senior essay goals, write it for this class - b\/c he expects thefinal paper to be senior-essay length anyway.",
    "It's a great way to learn about the pressing issue of inequality. A good overview with a professor who is prominent in the field, and a nice guy.",
    "Highly recommend it. You'll learn a lot about one of the most pressing issues of our generation and Professor Hacker is great.",
    "This class has a decent amount of economics in it. To get the most out of a lot of the readings you really need to put some time into it. If you are interested in a lot of data and statistics on American inequality, this class is the best. Reconsider if you are interested in a more theoretical approach to explaining inequality.",
    "Inequality& American Politics is a great class for anyone with a background in economics and political science wanting a better understanding of the the ways in which federal policy influences income inequality and vice versa. Professor Hacker is an excellent seminar leader and an expert on the topic. The work load is very reasonable and all the readings are all rather interesting. I would highly recommend the class for those interested in American politics.",
    "This is a good course to take if you want to clarify your thinking on our country's current political economy. If you're even a casual follower of American politics, you're familiar with the basic material of the course - rising inequality, the dominance of the financial sector, the resurgence of the Republican Party, the rapid growth of money in politics, the decline of unions, etc. But it's good to take time to sort out which of these phenomena are real and which are illusions, which are consequential and which aren't, which are fixable and which are inevitable. That's basically what Jacob Hacker tries to do here. I took this course with a pretty great group of students, so there's no guarantee that next year's class will be as awesome. But I'd still recommend the course because there aren't too many alternatives in the department that let you think this carefully about practical politics and policy.",
    "An unexceptional Poli Sci seminar. Wake up early on Monday morning, walk through the literature, listen to other people go off on tangents, and occasionally Hacker will say something brilliant. Reading list is dull -- tries to re-focus on the big issues but gets bogged down in the mundane details."
