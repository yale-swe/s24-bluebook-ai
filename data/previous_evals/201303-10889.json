   "comments": [
    "The course formatting was very strange, not because of the instructor but because of the curriculum itself. I really disliked the concept of reading a couple chapters of a book or part of a movie, and then writing an essay about it. This class focuses on composition and it's hard to think critically about literature when you've only read a tiny portion of it. Anna is great though, and very very sweet.",
    "If you are looking to really improve your spoken italian, and expect to be in a class with other near-native speakers, this is not the class for you. It is a very easy class, because it depends so much on the other students, and as other students (or yourself) may often be lazy, it does not facilitate complex meaningful discussion. Anna tried many times to get us to talk more in depth, but as there is only one teacher and so many students overloaded with other work...",
    "This was a great class! It was nice to focus on conversation rather than grammar. Professor Iacovella is the best - take the class with her if you can!",
    "Yes. Anna is great and the course in general is excellent if you want to improve or maintain your Italian skills but do not want the workload of an introductory style class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for another student. If you are interested in Italian culture and want to have a greater understanding of the language then take this course! The speaking and writing assignments really help with becoming more familiar with the language.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is trying to maintain and approve their ability to speak and write in Italian! You read some interesting literature, watch some great movies, and get lots of practice speaking and hearing Italian. There are frequent, small writing assignments that are great for working on grammar and vocabulary.",
    "I definitely recommend this course especially in terms of improving speaking and comprehension skills.",
    "Italian 150 02 is a class where you read and discuss Italian literature and history. I would recommend the class to another student because I thought that I learned quite a bit in class."
