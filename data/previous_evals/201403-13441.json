    "Would highly recommend, but do take prereqs first.",
    "Great class if you've taken a lot of the other graphic design classes. Gives you the chance to spend all semester on just two projects.",
    "If youre far enough along on the design track to be reading this, you are definitely prepared to take this class and should. This class will have comparatively fewer projects than other design classes youve taken; Julian and Henk each teach for half the semester and you work on one project per half. Because of this, they can drag a little and it can be hard to feel like youre making consistent progress. On the flip side, projects were able to change course if things werent working, which seemed like a more accurate replication of what real-world projects might be like. The projects are also more personal and are really flexible in subject matter, so the work can be as good and as interesting as your ideas. I highly, highly recommend this class if you want to grow your personal point of view as a designer (and have one last chance to design things you care about before launching into the real world).",
    "We worked on two projects, each taking half the semester: a set of 3 posters based on a single cause, and a dynamic identity. Both teachers were good, though crits pretty regularly ran overtime"
