   "comments": [
    "I wasn't an art major and enjoyed it.",
    "Unlike other studio courses it is very difficult to do any of the assignments passionately. It is well taught but the nature of the class is such that you radically change projects each couple of weeks. In any case it is very useful to gain confidence in the basic elements and principles of art.",
    "Take it if you are thinking about majoring in art.",
    "I would highly recommend this class as an introduction to art at Yale. The level of stress and work is challenging but not overwhelming, and the assignments are fun without requiring high levels of technical skill. Some of the assignments and topics seem basic for those with a lot of art experience, but if you are willing to check your pride at the door and engage in the fundamentals of form, composition, color, and texture, you will learn a lot about the structure of images and how to plan and respond to your own making.",
    "This is an introductory class that helps the student learn more about composition, form, and color. We completed abstract projects including collages, oil pastel pieces, sculptures, and even a video. It was a fun and hands on class- completely breaking the monotony of other schedules. I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "Expect to have projects to work on almost every week. Some are really tedious and take up a lot more of your time than you think.",
    "Yes. I good class to take if you have never taken an art class in Yale. I am an engineering student who took this class as my humanities, and while it was a lot of work, I found the projects refreshing to do. Don't be afraid to participate in critiques! I found the class maintained positive environment to experiment with art."
