    "Phenomenal course. Teaches you about the role of parties through history and to today. You really come out of this course with a great understanding of what parties do, how they do it, and how they've been successful\/unsuccessful over time. Take it if you can!",
    "Overall a good course. Small class size was really nice, Henderson was great. At times it moved a little fast and I would have preferred to have a little bit more discussion on certain topics but other than that it was a good course.",
    "I would recommend this class, but probably not to someone who isn't a poli sci major. Professor Henderson was great and really cares about making sure you understand the material. Also the workload was very manageable (a couple short readings a week that you can skim) and he tells you exactly what to study for the midterm and final.",
    "Although this class was interesting in that I learned something new each time, it wasn't always so exciting. At times, Henderson's lectures were quite dry; the course itself focuses on a very theoretical analysis of the two-party system in American politics. Henderson was a decently good professor who was very well versed in his field. I learned most in this class by asking him questions during the lecture. This class also doesn't require much work it is possible to get by in the class without doing the readings as long as you take detailed notes."
