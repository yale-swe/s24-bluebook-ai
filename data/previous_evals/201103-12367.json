    "I would highly recommend Printmaking I. Techniques covered include linocut and\/or wood cut, linoleum reduction, collography, etching, and monoprinting. The assignments for each technique are conceptual bases, like imaginary architecture or the surreal figure. I think this approach effectively encourages both technical and conceptual exploration as well as consideration of connections between technique and concept.",
    "yesbut it can be dificult when you are the only non art major",
    "Printmaking is an excellent introductory class that will teach you a concrete skillset that you can have for the rest of your artistic career. You will also have access to the printshop, inks and paper, which is pretty great. Your class will be small and will bond quickly. I recommend this class as a must for every painting concentrator -- it really expands your repertoire -- and for every art major who wants to leave a class having learned very specific skills. For non-majors, it will be time-consuming, but do prioritize this class and take it during a semester where you have other classes with fewer work. You don't want to be the non-major that shows up with sloppy work!",
    "Yes, but be willing to put a bit of time and effort into the course work."
