   "comments": [
    "Behavioral economics is becoming an indispensable part of an economics education, this is probably the best course on campus to gain quality exposure to it",
    "Depends on her background.Generally, yes.",
    "Great class to take to see the world differently. Best way to have spent three hours on a Friday afternoon.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have some background in behavioral economics from the start. Most people in the class (from undergraduates) tend to be in the Cognitive Science or Economics majors, so expect to be surrounded by people who know what they are doing. That said, Professor Frederick does make sure to provide a thorough introduction to each complex topic, so if you are just interested in the topic and want to gain a foundation in Behavioral economics class, you can still do it in this class, but it will require extra work. If you are in the latter case, I would recommend shopping the MBA version of this class co-taught by Professor Frederick and Professor Chen. It focuses more on the application rather than theoretic aspects of behavioral economics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Really interesting material, good reading and enlightening discussions.",
    "Sure. It's really interesting stuff.",
    "Absolutely. Take this course! We have so few behavioral economics courses at Yale, especially as undergraduates, so this course offers a lot that normally is glossed over outside of psychology (which doesn't stray greatly into economic analysis enough on its own). The workload is very manageable, but be warned that the grading can be very difficult. That said, you should absolutely take this course to gain some sense of actual human behavior in decision-making.",
    "I highly recommend this course. The knowledge learned, interesting standing alone as theoretical knowledge, helps you to identify how you can make better decisions and where you are making mistakes in your current decision making processes. The workload is manageable. The biggest problem is the lack of clarity in grading.",
    "I would recommend",
    "This course achieves just what its title suggests: providing the foundations of behavioral economics. I highly recommend the course for those with an interest in the field.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The things you learn are applicable to your life regardless of the field you enter into. The class gives you an insight into the biases and irrationality of your own economic mind."

    "Behavioral economics is integral part of health economics, particularly in the study of health behaviors and related decision-making. I will use the concepts from this course in several of my current papers and in much of my future research work",
    "It was less technical, but the content was still intellectually valuable. Different is usually good.",
    "Convinced me to remain an Economics major.",
    "I am not a Ph.D student. As an undergraduate, I had actually not previously considered doing research in the School of Management. This class has interested me enough that I now hope to."
