    "This seminar gave an overview of various topics in the social history of 19th century Japan. Each week's reading gave a fairly detailed focus on a particular theme. The work consisted of weekly readings, several short assignments, and a final paper. I found the readings quite interesting, and the variety of topics covered meant that there was a little something for everybody. The assignments are structured such that you can explore areas of interest to you, which I always appreciate. Prof. Drixler is a wonderful and thoughtful instructor who really enjoys discussing the materials with his students. Coming into the course without much background in Japanese history, I occasionally felt left behind at the beginning but quickly got up to speed. A course I would definitely recommend.",
    "This class provides a cultural history for Japan during the 19th century, tying together the aspects of what was going on at the political and governmental level with how this was reflected in the everyday lives of Japanese people. The class is modeled roughly on the lifespan of the average Japanese person during this time, starting with topics surrounding birth, and ending in how death was handled at this time. As a result, this course strives to give a fairly clear view of not only the dates and the facts of Japanese history at this time, but also of the ways in which people actually lived, particularly at this transitional time in history. I found this course fascinating and would recommend it to anyone that has even the slightest interest in Japanese history, whether their primary academic interest is in the area of East Asian Studies, or whether they are completely new to the area. The course is both engaging and accessible to anybody willing to take part in it.",
    "If you have any interest in Tokugawa or Meiji Japan and took either \"The Great Peace\" or \"Japan's Modern Revolution,\" then you should take this course.",
    "I would recommend this to students who are interested in East Asian history, and those who would like a better understanding of the organization of premodern societies.",
    "Highly recommend! Japanese history is something that you rarely get a chance to study in depth in the US, which is a real shame. This course is nice in that it doesn't focus on certain historical events or follow a timeline, but divides the discussion into a variety of different topics, such as dealing with bereavement, sustainable living, taking vengeance, etc. Drixler is also very insightful and good at leading discussion. For anyone who wants to know what it was like to live in Japan during the age of the samurai, take this course!",
    "I will be straight: if one enters a history class only to learn about the events of any particular period, you'd be just as well off with Wikipedia than ever taking any history course. A study of history (as history) is necessarily also the analysis of the methodology of that history, taken simultaneously, consciously or not. The historical events proper reveal themselves only when subjected to a critical analysis, by you or by someone else; \"historical evidence\" does not spring from the ground like a flower to be plucked at leisure, but is more similar to a gem, hidden deep underground, its true nature concealed until the gem itself is discovered and then subjected to refinement until it reveals every facet of it. This latter process is never finished. It is a constant project of refining methods, refining understanding. Even in the analysis of secondary sources, the project then becomes one of understanding exactly what critical method was undertaken in the investigation of the original history, and to pry it open to reveal the secrets hidden underneath. Against the objection \"what methodology? I just study historical events!\" I say, subject yourself to critical scrutiny, try and get at the assumptions you have already made unconsciously, and bring those assumptions to bear in the open. From there, one can investigate if this is a proper methodology that provides a useful analysis, or if it ought be discarded or refined. All historical study requires methodology. Yes, this is a course on 19th century Japanese material culture. If you wish to take it to learn about how they lived, how they died, and how they grieved, you can. And it will be educational. But you will lose out on so much. But if you undertake this course with the mindset of subjecting the study of these events to deep scrutiny, then you will emerge having refined ones' own study as well."
