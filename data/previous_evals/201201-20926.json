    "Chemical reactors and reaction fundamentals. I would recommend to any student interested in chemical reactions at the graduate level.",
    "The course covers basic reactor and kinetic knowledge for chemical engineering course. I would recommend a chemical engineering student to take this course.",
    "A must take class to fulfill the requirments.Great for ChE students.",
    "It is a compulsory course for ChemE. Otherwise, I wouldn't reccommended for non-majors as it would be potentially useless if you aren't considering chemical engineering.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, especially to those who was not in a chemical engineering major as an undergraduate. Because this course helps build a more solid backgroud in chemical reaction engineering. The homeworks related to coding are also very useful in the future.",
    "Great critical thinking course."

    "This course contributed greatly to the knowledge of the profession and to my dissertation.",
    "This course provides basic knowledge for the chemical engineering study.",
    "Learn a lot of programming in this course.",
    "Of the discipline, yes it did. However, I don't see myself using any of it in my dissertation or research.",
    "This course helps me understand the process of chemical reactions better and deepens my knowledge in solving real problems. Now I am familiar with four types of reactors and I can estimate the potential mechanisms of chemical reactions, which is very helpful in understanding the process of a chemical reaction."
