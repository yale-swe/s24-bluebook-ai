    "This seminar was a comparative course in vocal polyphony, taking into account questions of performance practice, originary discourses, its traditions (\"invented,\" \"revived,\" or otherwise), and its transmission (oral or written). The seminar achieved its comparative aims through the juxtaposition of two case studies of polyphonic traditions: 11th-century England (the Winchester Troper), and Georgia (the country).",
    "It's an exploration of what polyphony has been, is, and can be, in its broadest sense but focusing on materials outside of the Western canon. I would absolutely recommend it to other students. It provided several concrete of historiographical issues that we only see sketched out theoretically in other courses, and so can be of great help to us in deciding what kinds of work we would like to be able to write. Also, the specific sonic material is amazing."
