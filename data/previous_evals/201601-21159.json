    "Great class. Really interesting classroom discussion",
    "I learned a lot in this course. At times the reading can be a bit long and dry, but discussion is always interesting and Professor Lawrence does a great job of keeping everyone engaged. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in the Middle East but be warned, this is not a current events class.",
    "I took this class for the Research Design requirement in Global Affairs. I would not recommend it to anyone who already has in-depth knowledge on the topic. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the Middle East.",
    "It's a great class even if you come in knowing very little about the Middle East. You'll leave with a better understanding of the region, even if it's not the specifics of history. The theories and arguments that underly Middle East Exceptionalism are unique and will change the way you view current events there.",
    "great class. laid back feeling of class discussions; normal grown-up assignments, no surprises, no stupid crap--very predictable and straight forward; very cool professor who is a total badass.",
    "Take this course if you have an interest in the Middle East. It is super relevant to current events. The professor is very nice, grades fairly, and keeps the class interesting. The assignments are reasonable."
