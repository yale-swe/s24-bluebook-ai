   "comments": [
    "I learned how to make the world more sustainable for the future.",
    "I learned a lot of the fundamental ideas behind environmental science, where the world is now on environmental issues, and a lot about the solutions being proposed.",
    "Mix of history and current news about sustainability, all while learning about the current workings of politics and some science.",
    "This class was the perfect crash course in sustainability. I learned about a wide range of approaches to sustainability: carbon taxes and dividends, changes in consumer values outlined in the Green New Deal, and policy approaches to encourage innovation in the private sector. Although Professor Esty takes fairly centrist positions on the environment, he never lets his own views influence the course material. I learned how to write cogent policy memos and consider points of view in international negotiations. My writing skills improved considerably--if you take advantage of the option to write three policy memos (as opposed to the required two), the writing benefits from this course are considerable.",
    "I learned a lot about the current state of sustainability and environmental policy in America, and even a bit about environmental finance.",
    "Covered lots of the basics of the environmental problems and policy solutions of the 20-21st century",
    "I learned the basics of US environmental policy and history, and that econ majors & assorted other people somehow truly believe markets can solve climate change.",
    "I learned a lot about the implementation of sustainability and how Energy, Environment, and the Economy are all intertwined.",
    "I was exposed to many different aspects of sustainability including policy, economics, and history. I learned how environmental policy is made and implemented, what policies are good and bad, and how change is created.",
    "A breadth of knowledge on the widely encompassing topic of sustainability.",
    "I learned SO MUCH about how domestic and international policy governs environmental issues, and how business relates too.",
    "I learned about many current sustainability issues.",
    "This course gave a broad overview of many aspects of environmental history, law, and relationship with industry and business. The course gave enough background on each topic to understand its historic role in environmental history and also to propose ways in which it can be recast or reformed to become part of the solution to climate change. Overall, this course gives a comprehensive understanding of how we got to the place we are at in respect to climate change and sustainability and allows students to envision ways forward.",
    "the course did a good job of teaching about the political aspects of sustainability. I learned how to write a good policy memo and how international agreements are formed. the simulation was really cool and I think a good way to learn about a lot of different countries' perspective on climate change.",
    "I learned a lot of general knowledge about sustainability\/challenges to achieving it. However, as an EVST major, it was mostly material I already knew. I learned policy memo skills, but the class could get really boring with hard grading. T",
    "SO many. This class helped my writing, helped me express my opinion, helped me cultivate my interests and dive into research. I think this class is whatever you make out of it and I got so so much from it.",
    "Learned about the history of sustainability and the challenges we face today.",
    "Only a few. This course is incredibly surface-level and it's very hard to actually gain any information that isn't just vocab.",
    "I learned about the problems future generations will face due to climate change and the various steps we can take to prevent catastrophe.",
    "I learned everything about the American history on environmental sustainability practices, and the difficulties from transitioning to an environmentally sustainable lifestyle given the western capitalism we've set as the norm. Essentially, we were given the \"sustainability cannon,\" a strong introduction of different aspects of sustainability. Probably the most interesting skill learned from this course was the art of international negotiation as we simulated the Conference of the Parties in 2015 (i.e. the conference that made the Paris Agreement in 2015). As someone who also is not familiar with economics, there was a basic introductory level of certain concepts of business strategies and economic ideas also involved in this course by nature of the topic.",
    "I gained a basic working knowledge of how the world should address climate change practically.",
    "We discussed the challenge of climate change and sustainability and how the world might move forward in the future. The big questions we asked were: is sustainable development an oxymoron? Is capitalism inherently bad for the environment? How do we get international cooperation on an issue that requires such drastic changes? The class was sort of like a seminar in substance; we focused on questions and arguments rather than definitive answers. For example, once in class Professor Esty asked whether it was ethical to slow economic growth in favor of protecting the environment, and people raised their hands to argue either side. There were a lot of questions like that, which had no real correct answer but which prompted an interesting argument.",
    "Having had little previous exposure to sustainability policy, I learned a lot about various approaches to tackling climate change, particularly with respect to business and finance. The course focused most on international climate agreements, and a bit on national policies and business strategies. I also gained practice in writing policy memos, which was a useful skill! While I didnt always agree with Professor Esty, I learned so much from hearing his perspective.",
    "This course taught general trends from the 20th century attempts to achieving sustainability and suggested methods to achieving sustainability in the 21st century.",
    "Understanding core concepts and common themes through synthesis of readings, tools that can help deal with climate change in the 21st century, writing policy memos.",
    "Learned about the problems and (potential) solutions to environmental degradation. Learned how to write policy memos and the general structure of an international conference.",
    "I learned a lot about how climate agreement negotiations work and how government and business tries to help the environment.",
    "I gained a great foundation of knowledge on various issues regarding sustainability. I also learned how to write policy memos and how to negotiate on controversial issues like climate change.",
    "How to take lecture notes without any visual aids",
    "I learned how to write a focused, brief, well-researched policy memo.",
    "I learned how to write a clear and concise policy memo, as gained an understanding of the field of environmental law.",
    "Overall I found the content of the course to be very interesting. I learnt a lot about the policies need to enact environmental progress, especially the 'green light\/red light' policies.",
    "I learned that global warming is not a death sentence and that there is a modern more optimistic business approach to solving the problem.",
    "Learned a holistic and integrative approach to 21st century policy affecting energy, the economy, and the environment. Great overview of sustainability fronts, the history, and how modern day policy is crafted.",
    "Gained knowledge in sustainable practices and policies across disciplines and areas.",
    "I learned how to write policy memos and how to memorize tons of information. My writing also improved greatly.",
    "Economics of sustainability, international relations in the context of sustainability.",
    "I learned how to evaluate environmental issues from many perspectives.",
    "Learned about a variety of components of the political landscape in regards to environmental regulation and sustainable development.",
    "I didnt learn too much taking this class. I think it needs some more case studies and real life examples of concepts.",
    "I learned a lot about political procedure and the technical side of actualizing policy.",
    "I gained a better understanding of global governance, environmental policymaking, and the threat that climate change poses to the world. By writing policy memos, I improved my writing ability by learning how to make clear, concise, and well-researched arguments.",
    "I developed an understanding of the environmental problems that the world currently faces, and how the concept of sustainability must play a central role in guiding the requisite policy responses.",
    "I gained much knowledge about sustainability and practices to maintain a healthy environment.",
    "This is a great overview sustainability and climate change concepts, mostly focused on policy and law but also sometimes on scientific and societal perspectives.",
    "The intersection between policy, business, and innovation in efforts to address issues of sustainable development and the integration of renewable energy in our 21st century economy.",
    "This course taught about the legal procedures and the steps to get international agreement on climate issues.",
    "I learned a lot about the different political approaches to sustainability and environmental activism, and how that connects to technology, community\/diversity, and international relations",
    "I learned about methods of how we can move in a more sustainable direction for our future and how there are problems with the current ways we live as a world society today.",
    "In this class, I learned about the different perspectives on environmental policy and the economics of energy. This course also allowed me to consider different levels of analysis for environmental action, ranging from the sub-national\/local levels to global levels.",
    "Different sustainability-related concepts, much focus on market-oriented policies and iniatives",
    "HOw we got to the climate action landscape of today where we need to go and what we will need to do to achieve climate action that actually works"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Not enough guidance on assignments. Unstructured lectures can be hard to follow.",
    "Should have powerpoint slides",
    "I think this class covered a lot of material in the semester. I think this class could have been improved by more closely following the syllabus' key terms and by having sections that more closely addressed the readings. I also think it would have been helpful if more information was given about policy memos\/ the COP 21 simulation further in advance.",
    "Very interesting lectures, but it all felt very impersonal, and I felt like there was no reason to do the readings outside of personal interest.",
    "Professor Esty is an incredibly esteemed and knowledgeable professor. He is also kind and compassionate. Although he is extremely busy, he takes time to learn the names of students and hold office hours for undergraduates. The teaching fellow team is outstanding. Professor Esty clearly selects highly knowledgeable Yale Law students for his teaching fellows, so section is productive, interesting, and engaging. This course is also one of the most organized courses I have ever taken at Yale. We don't stick entirely to the syllabus, but each reading is carefully selected to make valuable points about sustainability. I did every reading and never felt like they wasted my time. There is a little bit of inconsistency in instructions for policy memos depending on your teaching fellow. For example, some teaching fellows prefer endnotes to footnotes and other formatting differences. Since teaching fellows don't necessarily grade their own section's papers, feedback on formatting and style is sometimes applied inconsistently.",
    "Strengths: the content we learned was very relevant and interesting. I enjoyed the policy memos because they were different from your typical papers and exams and I felt like it was easy to do well on them once you had figured it out. Weaknesses: the lectures were way too long (should be 50 minutes) and a bit disorganized, even though the professor was interesting ALSO the COP simulation. It was a good idea but not all that well executed -- did not need to be 3 hours. I feel like the simulation should happen again next year but it needs to be organized better.",
    "Strengths: it would be a very interesting class if you had time to do even just most of the readings. Weaknesses: There are too many readings. Esty doesn't use slides which makes lecture boring and pretty useless if you're a visual learner. Further, lectures are incredibly repetitive and barely build off each other. If you want to get what you'll probably get out of this class, just read Esty's law article \"Red lights to green lights.\" It contains everything you'll learn from this class! His whole thing is needing to get more actors than the federal government into climate action putting us on a path to sustainability, but we never did any in-depth case studies that might have actually shown how this ever did or could happen. Maybe they were in the readings but not in any that I did. Plus, what's in lecture shows what the professor actually cares about, and from what I could tell, Esty only cared about himself. Doesn't even hold regular office hours, or show up to class when he gets a guest speaker which seems rather disrespectful to them and to us, at least to me. All of that might make this class sound boring but easy, but there are a ridiculous number of assignments. 2 papers, a midterm, a 5 hour long final simulation, AND a final. Don't do it, please, don't do it.",
    "Lots of really good content and readings, engaging and pressing topics covered. There were so many readings that it was overwhelming and many students to do little reading. If just the most important readings were assigned it would be much more effective. I wish we had more opportunities for discussion and debate in class, a massive lecture made for droning lectures. I wish professor Esty would have used visual prompts or something to make the lectures more engaging.",
    "I think one of the strengths of this course was section. In section we were able to connect the topics in class to current events. I also surprisingly really enjoyed the climate negotiation simulation. However, if it had served as more of the final project\/grade, I think we could have put more time and effort into it and more people could have engaged in the debate. One of the weaknesses of this course was that the readings, which were on the longer side, were usually summarized in lecture and rarely discussed in section causing there to be less incentive to read them. Also, I think the class could have been improved with the addition of visual aids in class to supplement the lecturing since not all of the daily topics were included or easily explained in the readings.",
    "The lectures were very engaging, sections were very helpful. Because lectures didn't have slides, it could be hard to make sure you registered all the important points. Also, if you missed lecture, you had no way to access what you missed. So it could be helpful if lectures were recorded or something. Also, it was really rough that the policy memos were due before the relevant lecture. It was really hard to write policy memos having to basically teach yourself stuff that would then be covered in lecture a day later. I know the point of this was that we would be writing about stuff from the readings and not just writing about what was said in lecture, but the readings often didn't help too much with the memo prompts anyways. I think I would have gotten a lot more out of the memos if the assignment had been to expand upon what we learned in lecture, rather than to write about stuff ahead of a lecture about it.",
    "Pretty good course with a light work load. Time in section could have been better utilized to give more time for discussion about the course content. The COP simulation was interesting.",
    "I think the simulation is really cool, and I liked writing the policy memos. I think the lectures would be much more engaging if there were visual aids like slides or SOMETHING, because even though Esty's usually talking about something really interesting, it's hard to pay attention or find any structure in the lectures. I also think the exams should be structured differently, because right now the terms we have to learn are just regurgitation, and we aren't given the points we're expected to regurgitate when we write about them. Which would be okay except some of the terms aren't even mentioned in class, so it's tricky.",
    "Strength: lots of general PolySci EVST knowledge, interesting guest speaker Weaknesses: harsh grading w minimal feedback\/help on how to get better, harsh TAs",
    "I enjoyed the policy memos but I found the climate negotiations a bit difficult to navigate.",
    "Lecture is incredibly boring. Professor Esty explained the course as 'discussion based', like a law school class, but he mostly just spoke at the class for the entirety of the class. The readings weren't always interesting and section, while informational, didn't help that much.",
    "The weaknesses were that the class had no structure. He would just pull up and start talking about random climate change stuff. Repeated himself a lot. The strengths were the content as a whole. I think it developed an awareness about the importance of protecting the environment that will affect my consumer decisions moving forward. I thought the simulation was really cool because it helped me understand the conflicting perspectives as the world tries to come together to solve this problem.",
    "The professor could provide an outline for the lecture on the board or on a screen. It helps to know what information in lecture is crucial for the . topics he covers. Not having it in lecture made it hard to distinguish what info was really really needed.",
    "Strengths were the readings and the simulation. Weaknesses was the size of the class in combination with the lecturing style -- it made it somewhat difficult to remain engaged. Additionally, while the syllabus was very clear from the start, the topics of each class fluctuated in a way that did not correlate with the terms we needed for the tests. Potentially structuring the ID terms a little differently so all of them corresponded to ideas gone over in lecture would seem more beneficial to synthesizing concepts learned throughout the semester. Lastly, the guest lecturers were all super interesting -- particularly Alex Munoz and Sue Biniaz.",
    "Strengths: the professor was really knowledgeable. Most of the TFs were good. Weaknesses: there were way too many readings. It was impractical that any student would have the time to complete the homework. The class really was just an overview. It went over a lot of materials super fast but didn't really go in depth.",
    "The strengths of this class were the interesting ethical questions that Professor Esty raised in class. For example, is it okay for China to develop their economy if it means degrading the environment? I loved pondering questions like that-- sometimes I thought about them for a while after class. They made me appreciate the difficulty of the issue of climate change. As for weaknesses, I do think there are a few small but important ways that this class could be improved. In general, I thought the class needed more structure and organization. For example, the syllabus listed a topic and a number of key terms for each lecture. That seemed good, but Professor Esty did not systematically go through the key terms in lecture, and he often did not define them. The key terms were then tested on the exam. The exam included a handful of IDs, which the students assumed were chosen from the key terms on the syllabus (I was never told that for sure though...). Anyway, I found myself googling terms that I had never heard of in class to study for the exam. That was confusing to me because the lectures focused heavily on weighing ethical arguments (which I really enjoyed!), but the exams prioritized facts and memorization. The exams did also include essays in which we could argue different positions, and these reflected the skills we learned in lecture much better. The key terms thing leads me to my second suggestion, which is that the class needs slides. Slides could have defined the key terms and indicated to me what was most relevant for each day. Although the syllabus clearly listed a topic for each lecture, we often meandered into other days' topics until the topics seemed to blend together. Also, with the blending and lack of slides, I was never sure what was important to know and what was not. I wrote down everything Prof Esty said in case it would turn out to be a key term or an ID. Again, that didn't make sense to me because the lecture felt more like a discussion, not a frantic effort to memorize terms. Slides would have made clear what I was expected to know. I know this is long, and it's not to say I didn't like the class. I really did enjoy it, I just think wanted to suggest some minor improvements that might facilitate learning. Substantively, this class was great and very engaging.",
    "This course was really well-taught. Lectures were engaging and informative, and I thought Professor Esty did a great job of going in depth and teasing out complexities without getting too in the weeds. If future iterations of the course include the simulated UN Conference of the Parties, I think more preparation would be really helpful. The way the simulation turned out for my half of the class, a number of people who had experience with Model UN knew what to do and led the charge, but those of us who didnt have that prior experience could have been better prepared to navigate the process.",
    "This course is taught by a well-reputed and highly qualified instructor. However, it is taught in a sort of stream-of-consciousness manner. Professor Esty does not use slides or visual aids, and the lectures often ramble or stray from the topic. Additionally, the grading process is extremely unclear.",
    "Due to the large quantity of readings it was sometimes hard to keep up. It does help A LOT that Professor Esty 1. Organized the readings by required and supplemental, and 2. Provided a list of key terms for every lecture (really helped guide my studying and reading). The topics were interesting and important. The lectures were informative and the guest lectures, especially Alex Muoz, were a great additional resource.",
    "Material was interesting, but got a bit repetitive. Readings were also fascinating, but there were sometimes too many. Enjoyed the COP, but it went on for far too long.",
    "Strengths are the content and the relevance of the material. The readings are very interesting, although often too long to finish. The weaknesses can generally blamed on the disorganization of the class due to the spike in number of students. It is difficult to follow and hard to understand what is going on.",
    "Strength is you learn a lot while having minimal homework. Weakness is the lack of slides etc that make it hard to obtain all info needed for the tests",
    "This course's actual assignments were really interesting and calculated to facilitate learning. The lectures needed to be 30 minutes shorter. Professor Esty actually had a lot of information to impart, which was, for the majority of the semester, buried under the approx 30 minutes of repeated material every lecture. The best guest lecture was the one about ocean conservation. The COP25 simulation was very time consuming but overall very worthwhile.",
    "This class I found was quite unorganized. The simulation was not a very useful exercise, and I think it could have been better substituted with something else.",
    "Professor Esty is great and the content of the class was interesting. I think a few lecture slides with some of the post important points\/ lists would make lectures slightly easier to follow. I also think there were too many assignments",
    "This content of the class was very well-organized, and Professor Esty's lectures were always insightful. I think the grading by the TAs was a little bit harsh and arbitrary, but nonetheless they gave relatively clear feedback. Discussion section also felt like a waste much of the time.",
    "Overall I enjoyed this course and learnt a lot about environmental policy. However, I found the lecture about environmental law to be hard to understand, especially as an international student not familiar with the American law system. I found that the feedback for the midterm was slightly unclear. The midterm was very limited in time and it seemed like they were expecting more content in the definition answers than was allowed by time or recommended sentences. However, I think that the feedback on the policy memos was better. I liked the guest lecturers.",
    "Strength was the material. It was very engaging and changed many peoples basic understanding of solving climate change. The answer is more than reduce reuse recycle. The weakness was the manner the course was taught. The professor prided himself on the lecture style but it was impossible to tell if he was rambling on a tangent or we were talking about an important concept that would be on the final.",
    "Great course! Esty is the biggest asset, one of the best professors at Yale. However, his lectures are really hard to follow at times. Biggest weakness is he just rambles and its really hard to follow all the great content he is spitting out at you. Lecture slides? Please",
    "Strengths were depth of knowledge and breadth of subject areas. Weakness was that the simulation wasnt well organized and left some students shut out of participating deeply in it.",
    "Classes were very interesting, but there was too much material to know for the exam. An exam outline of the terms that we needed to know for the exam would have greatly helped. Even a list of 30 terms and only 15 would be tested would have been better than 200 terms to know.",
    "Esty's practicality and experience are a major strength of the class.",
    "Great TAs and lectures were very interesting, I especially liked the three guest lectures. I think lecture notes could be a little more formalized.",
    "I think that there was too much reading to really get much out of it. However, the lectures did a great job of distilling the information to the most important parts.",
    "Professor Esty successfully integrates much of his real-world experience into the course material, which both helps to bolster his lectures and provides great context to the topics covered in class. For weaknesses, I would have liked the readings to be better organized on Canvas, and I would have appreciated less review at the start of each class\/during each class, as certain ideas became repetitive while others weren't fully covered.",
    "The strength of this course lies in the fact that it covers an incredibly broad range of topics while always making clear how those topics are connected. The syllabus included a really interesting collection of readings, and the topics of the writing assignments fit in well with the lessons. One weakness of the course is that format of the exams, especially the midterm exam, meant that they could only cover a small and somewhat random assortment of the material we learned in the class, and I felt that I could not wholly demonstrate my knowledge and preparation.",
    "I enjoyed the structure of the course, but I think we could have gone into more detail on most of the topics. Also, some of the lecturers overlapped greatly with others.",
    "It seemed like all of the information given in the class was essentially the same, just with different terms.",
    "Strengths: Lectures, feedback on policy memos, preparation for the COP simulation, reading lists. Weaknesses: Prof. Esty lectures law-school style with no blackboard or slides, but more visual aids would be helpful sometimes.",
    "Grading feels quite arbitrary. TAs expect a lot from answers on tests even though we have limited time. It seems their expectations are not reasonable, and that its unfair to purposely give only a few students the top grades and clump most people as average. What if a lot of people simply deserve the higher grade because they studied well? And lots of time was spent on the cop21 simulation when it only counted for 10% the grade. Lectures were a bit dry.",
    "Strengths: well organized, interesting readings, Weaknesses: lectures weren't too engaging, but the material was interesting so it wasn't difficult to stay on top of the work",
    "I think some of the information was a bit repetitive, and if we could have more review on how the themes all connect to each other that would be extremely helpful, because all the information taught have interlocking influences on each other. A strength of the course is that it covers a broad range of perspectives on how to tackle the climate change problem, does a cool climate simulation with different countries that was intellectually stimulating, and brought in great guest lecturerers as well. I wish there was more clear feedback on the papers as well.",
    "I didn't like how there weren't slides in the lecture, it made things difficult to follow.",
    "I really liked this course! Lectures were always engaging even without visual aids. The readings were also very interesting and I enjoyed the simulation. However, I would prefer it if the feedback was given back in a more timely manner and if there was a bit more communication about the expectations of the short answer questions.",
    "I felt that a big weakness was the randomness of the midterm grading, which many students in the class discussed. This was felt particularly in the identification section, where we were supposed to define big concepts and were penalized for not including specific, minute details that seemed pretty random when defining such a broad topic.",
    "Interesting content and very relevant, amazing guest lecturers big time commitment - 6-hour climate negotiation simulation at end plus challenging policy memos, 1hr15 classes plus section, TONS of reading"

    "I would recommend this class to someone who wants a deep-dive into environmental science, but perhaps is not majoring in it.",
    "Yes. It is not very hard, but interesting, and covers important topics.",
    "Yes. This course, like many large lectures, is what you make out of it. I have the impression that most students in the course do not complete all the readings, and therefore take the class for a broad overview on sustainability rather than an in-depth look. Since I had the time (which I realize many other students do not), I completed all the readings. Learning beyond the classroom about sustainability inspired me to pursue environmental policy as a career.",
    "Maybe. I thought the content area was interesting, and I really liked my TA. That being said the class feels like a gut when you're in lecture, BUT IT IS NOT A GUT. The policy memos are graded out of 10 (no submitting drafts allowed) and the average was like a 7 or 7.5. And the TAs graded the Term IDs on the midterm is sorta a harsh way. I think I did okay in the class, but the problem is that I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY GRADE IS. I could literally get any grade like I have no clue because it is curved at the end. I still liked the course though, because the workload isn't too bad and the material is very interesting.",

    "Yes, but you have to be ready to stay engaged without much push from the class\/instructors. You get out of this class what you put in.",
    "I think this course was a really interesting way to think about climate change, sustainability, and other environmental issues. I thought Professor Esty's lectures were interesting, albeit dry\/redundant at times. I thought that the COP simulation was a really fun exercise, and I actually felt that I learned a lot about the climate negotiation process in doing that. I hope they continue it for next year's course. Don't take this course if you are looking for a gut- Professor Esty got mad that this was the case this year, and cracked down on grades. Take this if you're genuinely interested in EVST\/sustainability, and are willing to show up to lecture regularly.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, it was one of my favorite courses since being at Yale. I feel much more knowledgeable about environmental policy and sustainability, and the course was facilitated in a way that made it engaging and interesting.",
    "I would as it is a great survey class and introduction to not only the topic of sustainability but also to policy writing and to the business and government side of environmental issues. However, I would warn that it is a heavier workload class.",
    "Highly recommend to anyone and everyone! This is the kind of class that everyone should take in order to be a better citizen in our world. I wish that all Econ majors and people who want to go into finance and business were required to take this course.",
    "Yes, this is a fine course that covers a range of issues in sustainability. The two writing assignments are fairly short, and readings aren't necessary for the tests or section.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any students, regardless of major. This course provides students with a profound understanding of the history and present state of climate change, which is one of the most consequential challenges that our generation faces. The knowledge I will take away from this course helps me better understand the causes and envision potential solutions to the global challenge of climate change.",
    "I would because I think it teaches a lot about an aspect of the environment that you don't hear about in other classes, and it gives you a good basic political knowledge about sustainability. But I think both the lectures and exams need to be restructured before I would wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "This is a requirement for the EVST major, and it just feels like a PoliSci class. I feel like none of it really enriched my learning- I dreaded going to a class that I'm supposed to like! It was graded so harshly for no reason, and the TAs weren't great either! If you're an EVST major and need a EVST Social Science Core Course credit, there are plenty of other classes to choose from!",
    "YES! This class was amazing. I learned so much and got so much out of it. This class improved my writing skills, helped me to express my opinion, cultivated my interests more and allowed me to dive into niche topics for policy essays. I think this class is whatever you make out of it and I got so so much from it.",
    "Yes, Esty is one of the experts in the field and very knowledgeable. However, bear in mind when taking the class that he has been active in the field for a long time, so what you are getting is a lot of his opinions and not so much an unbiased look.",
    "Not really, unless you want a pretty easy gut or because it's required for your major.",
    "yes because we all should know how our decision will impact future generations to come.",
    "Yes, wonderful for those not in EVST because it gives a baseline (and plus that) of knowledge for sustainability that some would otherwise not know",
    "The simulation was super fun and awesome, the literature is a lot but all interesting to read, and everyone should try to attempt thinking about sustainability and its history in the climate crisis we are in!",
    "NO! The class was run by TFs (even though they pulled it together, it was still honestly taught by them). The professor was distant. The material felt repetitive and shallow. The class was not structured in a way for students to get a deep grasp of the information. We were only taught enough to know that problems and solutions exist. As someone who didn't know much about the issue of sustainability, I do not feel as though I was taught much about the subject effectively. The COP simulation was a joke. No one knew what was going on until about a couple weeks before it happened.",
    "Sort of. I thought much of the material was interesting, especially the difficult ethical questions about environmental and economic tradeoffs. It was more work than felt worthwhile, though, and the class was not very well organized.",
    "I would recommend this class to a friend! I think the material is important for anyone to know, since we all have a stake in the climate, and Estys perspective is unique and valuable to hear.",
    "I would not recommend this course because of its lack of organization and lack of clarity.",
    "Yes, it covered important topics that helped us understand and address the pressing issue of climate change.",
    "Yes, if youre interested in climate change, sustainability, environmental degradation. Its a better course for global affairs\/political science candidates rather than environmental studies.",
    "I would recommend it if there is no other introductions to environmental studies available. Otherwise, I would not.",
    "Yes it is a great way to learn a lot about environmental issues without drowning in work",
    "Yes, if you're interested in sustainability\/politics\/business this is a great class to take. Etsy is a talented lecturer and assigns a lot of snippets of readings that are all pretty interesting",
    "This course gives a good overview of several major sustainability issues.",
    "This is a broad survey course. There are a lot of topics covered. If you are looking for something like that, take it. If not, I would recommend going for something more focused.",
    "This class is a great introduction to the field of environmental law.",
    "Yes! Its an incredibly important time to be taking about this topic and I think the course does a really good job covering the whole idea of climate change from a historical and a contemporary Lense.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. The content is extremely interesting and it served as a great intro to environmental politics.",
    "Yes but I would warn them of the lecture style and the COP 21 simulation which involved lots of preparation and public speaking.",
    "Yes!!! Must take. Everyone at Yale needs this course it should be required. You need to learn about sustainability regardless of your major, and moreover the law students will really teach you how to write a policy memo",
    "I would. It was comprehensive and interesting, but it did cover quite a lot of subjects.",
    "Only if you really are interested in environmental science. This course gave me a great foundation for the field and was very interesting.",
    "Would recommend. Great intro to enviro studies.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in environmental issues.",
    "Yes, as long as you are ready to deal with the learning curve for what the TAs and Professor Esty are looking for in regards to grading of the policy memos and the midterm.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who can handle a large reading load and is willing to commit to the class work.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the lectures were engaging and salient.",
    "Possibly if they are very interested in sustainability",
    "Yes. This was a great introduction to the concept of sustainability and has sparked my interest in the field as well as energy studies.",
    "Yes because all of the faculty involved were so knowledgeable in the field.",
    "I would recommend this Cousteau for anyone who wants to learn more about sustainability in there modern world and how to start to address the root causes and future of climate change.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it to a peer, I'd just tell them what the workload is like.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in environmentalism, finance, or policy.",
    "Yes, but I would warn them that studying for the midterm could feel like a task without guidance, since the terms were so broad.",
    "yes. professor was interesting and engaging",
    "Despite the work, YES for EVST people. Super relevant, has lit me up for wanting to pursue more in the sustainability field. Esty is so knowledgeable and great to hear from, even if a bit dry. readings are all by important environmental theorists."
