   "comments": [
    "L3 is great if you've taken a bit of French before but feel that your foundation still needs improvement. It is a more reading-grammar-centric than L2 classes I've shopped, which is more listening and speaking. Madame Vysosias is extremely nice, and great in preparing you for each evaluation.",
    "I would recommend French 130 even for people who do not want to continue french in future, it is a good place to establish good ground in the language",
    "FREN 130 covers most intermediate level grammar topics in French and has a diverse and engaging literature component as well. It very much emphasizes increasing a student's ability to have conversation in French. I would definitely recommend French 130 02 to another student, especially if he or she is placed into the class. It is a great class to review many previously learned aspects of the language while introducing students to some new ones as well. The books read in the class are also widely diverse in the sense that some are less serious and more of a pleasure to read while others are more philosophical and in-depth.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 130. It was a lot of work, but my French has shown very obvious improvement.",
    "French L30 is an intermediate French course that covers basic, intermediate, and some advanced grammar, while placing an emphasis on speaking. The medium through which most discussion takes placeis through a series of texts spanning the jovial to the more serious, including novels, poetry, and film. Two brilliant highlights included Camus's L'Etranger and Truffaut's Jules et Jim. Having taken AP French previously, much of the grammar was review, although the clear presentation of the material and constant practice helped more deeply ingrain the 'rules' of the language. Moreover, with Mme Vysosias and daily discussion, I found that my speaking ability, something I felt was incredibly weak previously, improved tremendously. For most people taking L3 French, the class is probably simply a requirement to fulfil, or else a gateway to higher level language courses, but I found the class incredibly valuable as well sa enjoyable in itself, and Mme Vysosias a wonderful professor.",
    "Take it if you like French, there are interesting books to read and movies that provide decent entertainment.",
    "French 130 is a class to build on your French grammar as well as your speaking. If you have some background in French (say 2-3 years of high school French) it is a good way of building\/reviewing your grammar to increase your confidence as a French speaker. It greatly improves your listening skills because of the audio programs and the videos. I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is well taught and effective.",
    "If you are prepared to work hard and come to class everyday, TAKE IT. French is a beautiful language and the professor is great. You will enjoy it.",
    "It's a good class that requires daily effort. As long as you attend every class, do your homework every night, then you'll be fine.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. I think that it is impossible for your french to not improve by taking this class, and it was also just an overall enjoyable experience. The readings are ok, and although the workload is definitely significant, it is worth it in the long term if you enjoy the language and are willing to put in the time and effort."
