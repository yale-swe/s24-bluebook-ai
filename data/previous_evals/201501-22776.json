    "If you are looking for a non-intensive language, take Hindi. Although you probably won't become fluent, it is an excellent way to fulfill your language requirement. The professors really care about their students, and cater the class entirely to their needs. We sing songs, watch movies, and eat food too, which makes it a very cultural and well-rounded experience.",
    "Worth it!",
    "Yes, take HINDI 120, if you are serious about learning Hindi. You'll come out of the class with a better understanding of the language and an appreciation for its complexity. It's also just a fun class with great instructors!",
    "Definitely was an incredible class, well taught! I learnt so much being a non-heritage speaker but from Indian decent, but knew out non-heritage speakers without any prior exposure though exactly the same about how approachable the class made learning hindi!"
