    "Engl 158 was a wonderful seminar. The class was small and the discussions were provocative. The workload was manageable and the readings were time-consuming but rewarding. I would recommend Engl 158 to any student interested in Middle English, or for any English Major looking to do pre-1800 courses!",
    "The course deals with a broad range of texts that will stretch the abilities of anyone who's interested in the texts and contexts of writings in Middle English. I would definitely recommend this to my peers who share the same interest."
