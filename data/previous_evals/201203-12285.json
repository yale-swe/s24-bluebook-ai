   "comments": [
    "It's a course that evaluates the essence of being human by evaluating how humans view animals. The readings are interesting and sometimes heart wrenching or gross, but the are all informative and cross disciplinary. It's good for science and humanity majors.",
    "Take the class if you're interested in our emotional and philosophical understanding of animals. The readings and discussions are very lively and open and inclusive, and cover everything from factory farming to evolution to human-animal bonds and comparisons. Our relationship with animals (mentally and physically) is so complicated, and this is a really nice environment in which to discuss it. It does often involve reading a book (or many pages) each week, so be prepared for that - but the readings are all very interesting.",
    "Take this class if you need something to fill your semester, because it's enriching and interesting without being too time-consuming.Professor Berger is a great professor with a really amazing seminar presence.Our class benefited specifically from the fact that there were only six of us, so I can't speak to how the seminar would feel if it were larger. That being said, this class being small was a fantastic experience--just as long as you keep up with the reading (which is totally doable, by the way).My only major beef (heh.) with the class was that it was very different from what was advertised on the syllabus: \"Animals in Modern American Fiction.\" What I ended up taking involved a lot of things that were often neither modern, American, or fiction! Nevertheless, it was all very stimulating stuff.Berger is great. Soft-spoken, but sharp-witted. He has a keen way of prompting you without forcing you to feel that you must speak, if there is a lull in the conversation (which there usually is, because it's a once-a-week course which lasts two hours).Honestly, he's an extremely low-stress person to learn from, and for me at least, that made all the difference for my willingness to offer opinions and analysis to the mix.",
    "Recommended to vegetarians or people interested in the factory farming system more than English diehards. I wish I had taken another course and read the two great pieces of fiction from this course - Boyle's \"Friend of the Earth\" and Coetzee's \"Disgrace\" - on my own time. The class is too small for its time slot. It was enjoyable, but I don't think it was the best use of an English major's time. Students looking for a less intense writing credit might appreciate it more.",
    "Really interesting, multifaceted course that will expose you to a wide variety of thoughts on animals. The literature we read was great and the class discussions were very interesting."
