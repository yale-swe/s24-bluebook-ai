   "comments": [
    "I learned crucial biological techniques that will serve useful for future lab endeavors.",
    "This was a great introductory lab class. I had very little experience with wet lab skills, and now I am competent with multiple lab techniques. I'm incredibly grateful for acquiring this skill set, and it was taught in a very effective way.",
    "This class teaches you how to stain and view different types of reproductive tissue. This class teaches you a lot, with very little work.",
    "This course teaches immunohistochemistry, some other staining methods for tissue pathology and identification of major structures, and Western Blot techniques. Professor Guller and Tina (my TA) also did an excellent job of teaching how to interpret the results of these techniques, as well as explaining why techniques worked to identify structures and pathology.",
    "I learned about immunohistochemistry, reproductive anatomy and cell type, and western blotting.",
    "I have never performed a western blot and I learned how to use a microscope much more efficiently.",
    "I learned all about the reproductive organs, especially the placenta! I learned IHC, staining, and Western blotting.",
    "Learned many new laboratory techniques.",
    "I feel like I actually understood the lab techniques in this course whereas other lab courses I don't feel like I absorbed the material and the reason for each step.",
    "I gained a foundational knowledge of reproductive biology and experimental techniques used to isolate relevant proteins. I appreciated that this lab was not just theoretical but very practical in teaching us how to perform different lab techniques like Western blots, gel electrophoresis, and immunohistochemistry.",
    "In this course, you will learn a lot about human reproductive organs as well as research techniques. We did two western blots and two rounds of immunohistochemistry and examined tissue slices under the microscope."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: we learned a lot with different scientific techniques and had ample time to critically think about the reagents and steps taken to complete each experiment.",
    "There are no weaknesses about this class. This class is one of the best things I've ever taking.",
    "I thought this course was an awesome survey course. Would definitely be improved by mice models, but I thought it was an amazing lab.",
    "I really appreciated the weeks in between where we just evaluated the results of the work we did in the lab the week before because it allowed me to really understand what we were doing in the lab.",
    "Strengths: Access to real human tissue--that was sick! Not making the labs ridiculously long like other classes love to do, and actually making feasible and reasonable length labs! The expertise of all of the profs who lectured. The cookies brought to the last day of class! Weaknesses: Honestly, none. I loved this lab so much. In terms of lab skills, it was a little basic for me personally, but I'm glad I got to work with live tissue and just go back to the basics. Lots of fun!",
    "Classes were well organized and facilitated learning. The TA was great and always available to answer any questions. The lab questions focused on the key information and were not excessive. This was the best lab I have taken at Yale.",
    "I think the strengths were the structure of the course (lab over two weeks). More labs could be done if the labs overlapped a bit (looking at last weeks slides & start the next lab).",
    "Strengths of the course are that it is structured to best facilitate student learning through short Powerpoint presentations and lab work that is only necessary to get across the point. TAs were extremely helpful in the class. There is no busy work in this class. Weakensses are that labs were graded by letter not numbers, which makes grade distributions across a class kind of confusing, thought the professor did mention there is no cut-off for certain grades. This lab could be improved by having numerical scores for lab reports.",
    "The many strengths of the course include Seth's obvious passion for his students and for the material, the fantastic TA's, the mini-lectures given during waiting times, and the ability to repeat an experimental technique. This allowed for mastery of both the material and the techniques."

   "comments": [
    "A fantastic course covering varied biological lab techniques, this lab is a great chance for people to conduct experiments, learn new biology concerning reproduction, and spend time thinking about questions posed by the lab critically.",
    "Take it!! This is a great lab. Very minimal work outside of the lab itself (short questions due roughly every two weeks). I learned so many fundamental lab skills, and the topics were really interesting. Definitely enhanced by taking the lecture, but the lecture isn't necessary to do well in and appreciate the lab.",
    "Please take this class. If you ever want to take a 4 hour lab, and get out after 2 hours, this is the lab for you. This class is so chill.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material was interesting and the labs were engaging and fun.",
    "This is a great lab course--it is a very chill environment, reinforces what you learn in MCDB 250, and teaches a couple essential skills. Grades are based on lab reports, which are due once every two weeks. When I took it, Professor Guller was out for a while on medical leave, but he's great, and my TAs were amazing.",
    "100%. Take this lab. It's interesting (looked forward to lab every week) and it's also a low workload, allowing you to focus on concrete goals and takeaways. Really take it.",
    "Yes! This lab was very fun and I learned a lot. This was the best lab class I have taken at Yale!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. BEST LAB AT YALE. NO BAMBOOZLE. YOU ALSO GET TO WORK WITH HUMAN TISSUE AND KEEP THE SLIDES AFTER. THEY SELL FOR A TON ON AMAZON! JUST JOKING. BUT JOKES ASIDE, THIS CLASS IS GREAT, SETH IS GREAT, PLACENTAS ARE GREAT, TAS ARE GREAT, SCIENCE IS GREAT. ALSO SETH BROUGHT COOKIES ON THE LAST DAY AND HE IS A PLACENTA-LOVING-EXPERT ANGEL.",
    "The best lab I have taken at Yale and highly recommend. The material is very interesting, you learn new lab techniques including Western Blot and immunohistochemistry, and the workload is light.",
    "This lab course was excellent. Most lab classes make you feel rushed and you end up not learning anything. This class had a relaxed schedule that took the time to drill in lab techniques and concepts without feeling overbearing. Most of the time you will get out early, which is such a relief, and the workload just involves some questions after every lab. The questions are meant to emphasize the main points of the lab unlike other lab classes where lab reports get tedious.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are looking for a chill but still intellectual stimulating lab on reproductive biology. This has been my favorite lab at Yale.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. This is a phenomenal lab course! Not too much work but you end up learning just as much. Extremely chill environment. Seth is an amazing, dedicated, erudite professor who is the new gem of the MCDB department!"
