    "Literature of the Renaissance is a survey of major late medieval and early modern writers, mainly from France, Italy, and England. The quality of readings could vary a bit (why only one woman writer?), but overall I was pleased I had chosen to take the class. Professor Manley has a wealth of knowledge about the Renaissance, and he provided generous writing feedback. I did feel, however, that he could have created more space for student voices in the seminar--often he would talk for some time without interruption, and I might have preferred a more open-ended and participatory discussion format. But if you like pre-1800 lit, you will enjoy this class!",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student. Why: (i) The syllabus is good: I missed only Cervantes. (ii) The class is small--I assume that it will remain around the same size in the next years--and students need to participate for it to go on. (iii) Prof. Manley knows a great deal about Renaissance literature and is interesting to talk to.",
    "Read the syllabus. If you're interested by the authors take it. Manley knows a ton about each author and you will certainly learn a lot from him. As far as workload goes, it's pretty much the same as every other seminar.",
    "ENGL 180 provides a solid introduction to the literature of the Renaissance. It is structured as a \"great books\" course, so the syllabus is designed around laying out the general ideas of the period and tracing their developments through the centuries. I would definitely recommend this course to other students; it provides the background knowledge that is necessary to understanding many later texts in the European tradition."
