    "Required if you're econ\/math. Not a heavy workload at all relative to other courses for the major. Problem sets took a couple hours each. The material is very interesting, but lecture can be quite dry.",
    "All-around pretty abstract, so don't take this lightly. Truman is a really nice guy, but he's an awful lecturer--he talks softly, into the board, so lectures are basically useless. The book, which he wrote, is decent. The class also follows the book very closely, so going to lecture isn't that essential. Truman also posts a ton of practice exams before the midterm and final, which is helpful. Work-wise, it's standard: a problem set every week, a midterm, and a final. You probably have to take this if you're considering it, either for Econ\/Math or for some sort of grad school. If this isn't required for you, at least start it Cr\/D\/F and make sure you're not in over your head.",
    "Some mathematical models of a simplified economy.",
    "Eh. I was excited for this class--it's, ostensibly, one of the capstones of the econ and math major--but I didn't find it very interesting. It was mostly a lot of different sets of equations, and there were a few results that were pretty cool, but it definitely left something to be desired. Problem sets and tests were largely just figuring out little algebra tricks to get the equations to work. Professor Bewley is a legend in the econ community, and invented some of the stuff we went over in class (and wrote the textbook), but he speaks extremely quietly so it's easy to get bored in lecture. Work-wise, the class was harder than an average econ class, but quite a bit more manageable than an average math or stats class, so absolutely doable (maybe a few hours a week per problem set but nothing extreme). Overall, I would say it was a very average class; not my favorite that I have taken at Yale, but also definitely not the worst.",
    "I would recommend Econ 350 to anyone who wants a mathy econ class. It's basically intermediate micro on steroids, so don't take it if you struggled a lot with that.",
    "Take it. Don't pay attention to any of the proofs in class, just understand the basics of the theory and the problems won't be too terrible.",
    "Its a whirlwind tour of all the major results from General Equilibrium presented in a proof theoretic manner. If you take the time to internalize all the concepts that get presented in class and in the lecture, theres a lot you can take away from this class. If you dont, its easy to get lost.",
    "While ECON 350 did give me a pretty strong understanding of economic theory and General Equilibrium models, I do not wholeheartedly recommend it. Professor Bewley's lectures are quite uninspiring. He mumbles a great deal, spends much of his lectures proving theoretical minutia that is not relevant to understanding the central ideas of the course, and presents precisely the same examples and proofs outlined in his textbook. For this reason, attendance at lectures is quite low. That being said, I think that ECON 350 is good preparation for future study in economics (especially for students thinking about grad school). I learned a lot from doing the problem sets, which are challenging, but certainly not unreasonable. If you have to take this class for your major, fear not--you will survive. But ECON 350 is unlikely to be one of your favorite courses.",
    "Take it but study hard from the practice finals and midterms - that's literally the only key",
    "Definitely don't take ECON 350 unless it is required for your major. The class isn't bad, but there are a lot more interesting ones in related subject matter available.",
    "put in the effort to study and work hard. the hours are long, but you will be a beast if you study hard.",
    "I wouldn't take this course unless you need to for the econ\/math major. It's not exceptionally difficult, but it's a bit boring. If you really want to learn the material, just buy Professor Bewley's book. The core theory is not much better explain through this course than it is in the book.",
    "You have to take this class for econ\/math. Just do all the practice exams he posts and start studying way before the exams.",
    "Econ 350 is a basic introduction to equilibrium theory. The lectures and the book are nearly identical so class is not much help. Truman all but reads from the book in lecture. The book is more proof based while the homeworks and test are computational; that said they are doable. I wouldn't take this class if I had the choice, but I did.",
    "A great introduction to general equilibrium that will prepare you well for grad school. Rememeber to learn offer curves early on and try to stay on top of things. The proofs are good but not tested.",
    "!AAAA Bewley is extremely nice and always willing to help go to his office hours and you will be fine. You dont need to take detailed notes during lecture because most of the models are fully described in Bewleys textbook. Do take notes when he does examples in class, though. All you need to do to study for the exams are to look at the practice exams that he posts online (there are a lot of practice exams but you will start to see the same types of problems in each one so you dont actually have to do all of them). The lecture was not exciting but I enjoyed the class because it was a rigorous development of some of the more interesting topics from intermediate micro.",
    "Totally recommend it if you want to do a higher degree in economics, if not it is not neccessary"
