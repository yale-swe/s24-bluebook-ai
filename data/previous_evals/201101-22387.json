   "comments": [
    "No, not worth. Only take if you must have a writing credit.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want a general overview of Middle Eastern politics. Although the lectures weren't incredibly steller, you still learn a lot and the information is interesting.",
    "Take a history course instead, since that's all that's useful in this course.the rest is just nonsense arguments and non-rigorous uses of data",
    "I would not recommend this class. Boring, disorganized lectures. I found lecture to be way too general, and didn't feel like I learned a lot from the class as a result.",
    "Ok class, don't really recommend it, shop it if anything.",
    "This course was disappointing. I took it hoping to learn more about the modern middle east in order to be a more informed citizen, but honestly think I would have benefited more from just reading the NY Times for 2 additional hours every week. The course ignored actual tangible information about the countries and current events in favor of political science jargon and overarching theories. This semester (spring 10), the middle east was especially fascinating because of all the upheaval that went on, and I don't think the course addressed those current events adequately (or much at all!)-- it just stuck to its jargon-filled syllabus, ignoring the fact that learning about the current events in Egypt would be MUCH more important to us going forward than learning about theories without concrete examples.If you are very polisci-minded and want to talk about theory, take it. If you, like me, have never taken a poli sci course before and just want to learn more about the region to be an informed citizen of the world, avoid it. You'll learn more relevant information by watching the news.",
    "A good overview of the politics of the region. Lecture could be a bit discombobulated but that was largely due to the current events in Spring 2011. Lust has a lot of personal experience in the region which is interesting. Beware, lecture became quite seminary towards the end.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Even though we were in the midst of the most fascinating time in recent history in the Middle East, the course was simply not compelling.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to another student absolutely. It's a great class and you can learn about a region of the world that most people claim to know a lot about, but usually don't.",
    "pretty recommended",
    "Yes definitely. The course gives a concise over view of the history of the region and some of the challenges it faces in the future.",
    "Yes, i'd recommend it",
    "This course covers interesting material, but the course itself is not that exciting. Prof. Lust's lectures are not very exciting, and some of them seem to lack much material. The opinion poll paper and the Arab-Israeli simulation are really cool, though. Also, the workload is not bad-- 2 short papers, a midterm, section, and a take-home final (for the non-WR version).",
    "For students looking for a great spectrum of information on the Middle East, this is a great class. It's a lecture that feels more like a seminar with fascinating reading.",
    "It's an introductory course to the history and current politics of the Middle East and North Africa. It covers everything from the political economy to regime type to the role of religion. Each country is explored and broad trends are discussed as well.",
    "Professor Lust obviously knows her stuff, but she is not a good lecturer at all. We spent a lot of class time doing \"group work,\" watching movies, having awkward discussions, etc. and when she did finally lecture she was really hard to follow. The class is all over the map, goes through history of the Middle East in about a week and a half and then devotes about a week to each topic. It could be so much more interesting, but was so disorganized that I felt like I had to teach a lot of the information to myself. There are SO many other interesting political science\/Middle East related classes at Yale. I really don't recommend taking this one.",
    "Yes, mostly because it is a very important region of the world that we should understand. It is also a decent class.",
    "This is a good class for those interested in Comparative Politics. The lectures aren't great, but overall the course is pretty good. Professor Lust is nice and the readings are interesting - the work, though slightly annoying, is managable.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have an already-existing and strong interest in the subject or need the WR credit.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS--TRUST ME. I did not listen to the mixed reviews and I got burned. This is a terrible introduction to Middle East politics. The lectures are scattered, there is no organization, the readings are on absurdly specific issues and lecture is just really annoying. Professor Lust starts early and runs late, demands you come in early multiple times throughout the semester and makes you discuss the readings in lecture, in addition to mandatory sections. This is NOT a good introduction to the politics of Middle East and North Africa and it is NOT a lecture. Save yourself the trouble and take a different class or just read the NYT--that's all you'll get out of the class in the end anyways.",
    "This course should have been amazing given that the Arab spring was occurring during the semester I was taking this course. Unfortunately it was not very good. I don't know what to say, but don't take this course. The readings are boring and the class in general is uninteresting. If you want an intro course to the Middle East, take Ben Foster's course, he's awesome.",
    "I would recommend it as a good fifth class. It does not take too much work and is informative.",
    "Informative but a lot of reading and a bit boring.",
    "A great course that you should take if you want to learn about the Middle East.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It is attractive because it seems easy, but don't be fooled--the assignments are a pain and don't help you learn the material from the class in a deeper way.The lectures are largely uninspiring and often difficult to follow. The topics interrogated and the readings themselves are quite interesting but the course flies over them too much for you to get a real sense that you are learning anything in particular.It doesn't explore the particular politics or political mechanisms of countries, so the only things you can really learn from this class are sort of broad generalizations about things in the region.The Middle East is worth learning about, but this is not the best avenue to do that.",
    "If you know about current events and the world, you won't learn anything new. But it's not that hard, and you don't really have to attend lecture. So, if you're interested in current events and need an easy WR, this could be an option."
