   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Your writing and thinking will improve immensely - and it's such a satisfying class.",
    "You will read legal cases and discuss different legal tools\/methods of argument along with them. You will learn to write more concisely and argue effectively.",
    "GREAT English course. If you have the chance to take ENGL121 with Professor Ehrgood, take it in a heartbeat.",
    "If you're interested at all in the way the law works, this is a hidden gem. Daily assignments can be a bit taxing but they are actually front-heavy, and get lighter toward the end. Professor Ehrgood's very fair about evening out the workload. He also spends an incredible amount of time with his students, on workshops and consultation, and the class is really rewarding because of it.",
    "Yes: if you wish to work intently on your writing-- and think you can manage the significant workload, and the time required to do well (hopefully, you think you can)-- then do take it. If not your writing itself, then at least your understanding of good writing, will vastly improve.",
    "If you have any interest in the law, take it. If you don't, take it. Ehrgood is a master teacher and a complete genius. Take any class with him if you can. It's completely worth it. Not too much work, you learn a ton, and have the amazing opportunity to spend 150 minutes a week with an incredibly enthusiastic, warm, interesting individual. One-on-one meetings with Ehrgood was extremely helpful. My writing was strong coming into the course, but I saw my writing in all of my classes improve dramatically over the course of the semester because of ENGL 121. Do it.",
    "This class is very interesting, but mostly just because of Ehrgood. It's an incredible amount of work, and not an easy grade by any stretch. That being said, it will make you a better writer, and a better thinker. Don't take this class if you want to learn about substantive law. Take it if you want to learn how to make arguments (especially in writing) that are clear, focused, and effective.",
    "Yes, yes, a million times yes. This is the best class I've taken in my life. It's equal parts hard analysis and fun, creative assignments. Plus, you get to know both Prof. Ehrgood and the rest of the seminar really well. I ended up just hanging out with many people in the class, and working on the papers\/assignments rarely felt like work. The first month can get frustrating due to the amount of work, but decreases sharply after midterm season. If you're AT ALL interested in writing leanly (or just law in general): TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "It's a good class! You learn to write more clearly and concisely- largely undoing the damage of high school. You spend most of the time on a single but interesting case (Speluncean Explorers). The class focuses about equally on good arguments, good sentences, and good composition. I would recommend it. It teaches a skill that we otherwise wouldn't develop until later but that is necessary, particularly for scientists, economists, and lawyers.",
    "This is a pretty good course that teaches lots about clear and concise writing and the different forms of writing that lawyers will have to do. Professor Ehrgood's really quite knowledgeable, though also pretty quirky, and cares about his students and their work. Those with significant legal background may find parts of the course plodding though. But it definitely improved my writing, especially for professional documents (not just in law) that I'm bound to write a lot of.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to any student interest in law or just learning more about argumentation (which does not have to necessarily be legal in nature). The workload I would say is more front-loaded although there are some larger assignments toward the end. While the workload is definitely manageable, I wouldn't take this course as a fifth class. Again, Professor Ehrgood is a great, responsive, and flexible teacher, and the course material is both didactic and engaging.",
    "If you are interested in the law and thinking and writing about the law, I would absolutely recommend this course. English 121 teaches you English within the constraints of a certain subject area and Professor Ehrgood's law section is excellent. Professor Ehrgood is a wonderful English professor - take a class with him if you get the chance! - and this class is all about learning, thinking, and writing. It teaches you the basics and fundamentals of law and how lawyers and judges think and it is so rewarding. The class discussions are always interesting - Professor Ehrgood leads thoughtful discussion - and the assignments can be tedious but are always worthwhile. If you have any interest in the law, take this course. It also helps that you'll fulfill distribution credits!"
