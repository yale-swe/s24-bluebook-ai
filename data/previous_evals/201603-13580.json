   "comments": [
    "I got to review all of the grammar I previously learned in Spanish and discuss the nuances of the language I hadn't really delved into before.",
    "I mainly took this course to review the Spanish I had learned in high school. I felt this course provided me with an overview of advanced grammar and helped me feel comfortable speaking and writing in Spanish.",
    "I gained a comprehensive understanding of Spanish grammar and practiced my writing skills through the form of creative essays. In particular, I developed my use of the subjunctive which is a more advanced topic. I also learned how to better analyze and understand texts written in Spanish, because short stories form the basis of our grammar exercises.",
    "It increased my proficiency in both oral and written Spanish",
    "As the course name goes, \"Advanced Spanish Grammar.\" I was able to solidify my existing understanding of Spanish grammar and learn more about the more subtle differences in Spanish grammar. I felt that my essay writing skill in Spanish also improved through taking this course.",
    "I have a much more solid grasp of Spanish grammar than before and feel prepared to take other higher level Spanish courses."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Both a strength and a weakness: reviews a lot of material super fast. Never felt like I could get so far into a topic that I would understand it fully. But it was nice to see everything again for review.",
    "Advanced Spanish Grammar is beneficial in that the course ensures that students master fundamental Spanish grammar rules. However, it is extremely repetitive of the previous Spanish courses. While there may not be many more advanced concepts to study, I think the course would benefit from looking in to teaching concepts that are not covered by the lower level courses.",
    "I think this course could be improved by increasing the amount of discussion in class among students. We read many short stories and watched several movies, and I wish we could have discussed our interpretations of them more in class.",
    "The course is very well organized, and is taught by an amazing and thoughtful professor. The exercises, worksheets, and assignments are all very well coordinated and designed to allow you to practice and develop your grammar fully. You always receive written feedback on your assignments, which is very helpful!",
    "Strength: The course material is very organized. Profesora Asensio is very attentive, caring, and helpful. I recommend that students who have difficulty with the material reach out to her for help. I also enjoyed the \"conversation partner\" program, in which you have a Skype conversation in Spanish with a native Spanish speaker for an hour every week for six weeks. Weakness: I feel that the course tries to cover too much ground in a limited amount of time. Also, the workload could be adjusted.",
    "This is a very helpful course to develop a strong foundation in Spanish. By the end, you'll be able to understand the nuanced changes in meaning due to a simple change in grammar\/structure.",
    "The course does a great job of integrating grammar, literature, cinema and culture. However, it is lacking in terms of workload distribution. On some nights the workload is overwhelming, whereas on others there is barely any."

   "comments": [
    "It is a lot of work but good for people to review. Unfortunately, I think the tedious assignments and heavy workload were a lot for me and drove me away from ultimately pursuing a Spanish double major. It's not for everyone. And also, when you hear it's not a class to practice conversations, it REALLY isn't. And I missed that.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is looking to master fundamental Spanish grammar rules before taking other advanced courses in the major. However, I would not recommend this course to anyone who has taken L1-L4 Spanish at Yale or is looking for a very in-depth look at Spanish grammar. The course is simply a reiteration of grammar rules that have already been covered by the lower level courses. While the course is beneficial in allowing students to practice writing and make sure that they have a grasp on fundamental, supplementary grammar rules, it does not offer much outside of that. Conversely, I think this course is absolutely perfect for anyone coming from high school Spanish needing to review before taking additional Spanish courses at Yale.",
    "Definitely yes! If you want to get your grammar skills down before you try out other Spanish-based classes, this is the way to go!",
    "It depends on the student. If a student has placed into L5 but feels he\/she is not ready for a literature course, then this course could be a good option. Also, this course provides a good foundation of written Spanish. That being said, a student who wishes to take this course must be ready to devote a considerable amount of time into the course, since the material covered in this course is definitely challenging. Also, if you feel that you are a good Spanish writer, then this course may not be the right one for you.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to solidify their control of the Spanish language, especially to those who may want to take Spanish courses beyond this one.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking for a first L5 Spanish course to take. It prepares you well for other L5 Spanish courses."
