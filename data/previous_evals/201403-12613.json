    "Do not underestimate the 15 page, single spaced grant proposal. Yes, this is correct. You will write a 15 page. Single spaced. Grant proposal. It is not easy, and you need a lot of time to do it. But it is definitely possible if you give it the time. Other than that, the class is not too difficult. Prepare for each weekly session by reading and understanding the figures of the papers and you will be fine. Preparing for the Monday section took up most of my Sunday's, but other than that, everything else was chill. If you want to learn how to read primary literature, take this course. You will come out with more than knowledge in biology. You will leave with a skillset you will use for the rest of your educational and professional pursuits. Having research experience really helps when taking this course.",
    "If you're an MCDB major even vaguely interested in research, you absolutely must take this course. This class is taught by one of the most highly-esteemed faculty members in MCDB and is extremely well-taught at that. Prof. Crews is extremely knowledgable in the field of cell biology and is a pleasure to learn from. The class environment is also one of the more special aspects of the class that MCDB majors often don't get the pleasure of having. This seminar highlights all aspects of cell signaling and really teaches students how to conduct thorough research. Prof. Crews taught us methods, science, and even the history behind many of the cell signaling pathways we studied. I absolutely recommend this class to any student and think that this course has been a pivotal point in my MCDB learning.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It is the best MCDB class offered. It is a fair amount of work and the final project is very difficult but it is worth it.",
    "This was a great class. If you get the chance, you should take it. If you're a bit worried about the grant proposal, I'm not going to lie, it was definitely a good amount of class, but it's definitely doable. You learn a lot about many of the big signalling pathways, and the process of writing the grant proposal is a great experience if you plan to go into grad school or anything like that. It was really nice to get to know Prof. Crews, as he's a pretty amazing guy, and his stories (which sometimes relate firsthand to the subject at hand--ask him who discovered MEK) are great. You really learn a lot in this class.",
    "The class teaches you to read and evaluate primary literature regarding cell signaling pathways. Each week you read two papers and discuss them in class. Once in the semester, you will have to present background information on a signaling pathway. I would recommend the class. It is very informative, especially if you find cell signaling interesting (you should!). The grant proposal at the end is very difficult though. Make sure your final schedule will allow you to spend a lot of time on it. Also the class usually meets on Monday evenings, so prepare for that - coffee! Be sure to come to class prepared.",
    "Great class for any student who would like to learn more about research techniques and how to read papers though it only meets once a week, it may be a bit of a struggle to keep up with the work! Also make sure you pace our your grant proposal throughout the end of the semester!",
    "Highly recommend! Must take to understand scientific reading and writing."
