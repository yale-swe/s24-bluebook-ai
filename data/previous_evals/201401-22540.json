   "comments": [
    "Physical methods in biological inorganic chemistry. Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "The class discusses briefly the spectroscopy used in bioinorganic chemistry.Would recommend if they are a bioinorganic chemist.",
    "I learned a lot in this course. The physical methods section went a bit fast, and was hard to follow. Overall, it was a good course.",
    "Very interesting survey of important spectroscopic methods in bioinorganic chemistry. It was very challenging, as most of the details on the methods you have to learn yourself. Prof. Brudvig is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. He explains things fairly well in class, but sometimes it is unclear what level of detail he expects us to know for the tests.",
    "Chemistry 554 01 is an overview of several of the techniques used to study bioinorganic systems with several classes devoted to actual metalloenzymes in the last third of the class. I would recommend the class if you are comfortable with coordination chemistry and quantum mechanics.",
    "Chem 554 primarily covers the experimental methods used to study the coordination structure of metal ions in proteins. Due to the passive teaching and lack of continuity between the exams and problem sets I would not recommend this class to graduate students who aren't certain they will be working in a Bioinorganic chemistry lab.",
    "As it is currently outlined, I'd recommend it to inorganic students."
