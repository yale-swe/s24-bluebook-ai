    "A fabulous fiction workshop taught by a fabulous professor. Every week, three students bring in stories to be workshopped the following week, so everyone ends the semester having written and received feedback on three short stories and one short-short. The only thing I would say is that both the quality of the stories you read and the feedback you receive hinges on the group, so make sure it's a good one!",
    "If you are planning on taking a creative writing course, definitely take it with Emily Barton. The structure of these courses is always pretty much the same, so choosing the professor becomes especially important.",
    "Take it if you are willing to WRITE WRITE WRITE. You'll be reading several student works each week, and need to come prepared to seminar. You really should be a pretty committed writer to want to take this class.",
    "Professor Barton is an excellent workshop leader. I have had some workshop leaders who are hesitant to ever be critical of anyone's work, but she is not, and her honesty as as refreshing as it is helpful.Of course, in writing workshops much depends on the quality of the other students, so I encourage you to try to find out who you will be in class with if you are choosing between workshops.",
    "Absolutely recommend this class. You write three short stories, one revision, and one short short. And you read three short stories and one short short from every other member of the class. Because the class is very new-writing rather than revision heavy, there's a lot of room for experimentation. You're free to totally go off a limb and try something crazy, and Emily really encourages that. She also nurtures all genres--we had such a diversity of styles in our class and as a group we took delight in the low-brow as well as the high. Most importantly, I looked forward to attending every class (even when my own work was due).",
    "Totally take this class! This class is one of those special gems that not everybody at Yale gets to enjoy, so you should totally take it if you get the chance.Fiction is a ton of fun. The small workshop setting is amazing, and the opportunity to read so any fellow students' stories taught me a lot. My only regret is not making more extensive use of office hours and for not consulting Professor Barton more, because Professor Barton (aka Professor Emily) is great! Her humor made class really enjoyable, and her comments were always constructive and really helpful. She has a really good knack for guiding and following class comments, and makes really good suggestions (reading-wise, writing-wise, etc.) I think I learned a lot from her this semester.Also, writing stories is such fun, enjoyable work!"
