   "comments": [
    "I was excited to take this class because the Middle Ages had always somewhat interested me and I wanted to learn more. I don't know if I would really recommend the class, however. Some of the information was definitely cool, but more than a few of the lectures were extremely boring and seemed like a waste of time (I'm not kidding-there was a lecture for FIFTY MINUTES on why Wikipedia is a bad source to use for research papers...like okay). There is also a LOT of reading and the papers you have to write are graded pretty harshly. The lectures need to be made more interesting and engaging, since some of the material is DRY as the Sahara and it's often unclear what things are important to know and what things are just irrelevant factoids.",
    "Take this class if you have any interest in the Middle Ages. Professor Winroth is a great lecturer and the work load is very doable. I imagine this class would be great for those really deeply interested in the period or those who just needed a HU or WR credit. Winroth is also very engaging and keeps the class interesting and the material relevant.",
    "I would not recommend this course, really to anyone. Even if you love the Middle Ages or are a history major, since this class is much more trouble than what its worth. It was a constant thorn in my side. I really wish I had just satisfied my curiosity for this period by watching a documentary instead of killing myself over five ridiculously short and pointless essays (that somehow took hours upon hours to write), a midterm, a long final paper, a final exam, and endless readings. Professor Winroth is a nice guy, and he's very interesting as a lecturer and a person. However, lectures weren't always clear and didn't necessarily follow a logical or thematic path. It seemed like we were having to do all the learning from the textbook and the readings. The course philosophy of giving terrible grades on the essays that gradually improve over time is just demoralizing and should be stopped. Section was absolutely pointless and consisted of my TA showing off his Middle Ages knowledge and favoring students who had taken previous courses in the field (this is an intro course and we're not supposed to know anything!). The midterm was graded pretty harshly, I think, but I never got a chance to clarify that since my TA never responded to my request to go over the exam (I didn't do as well as I'd hoped, though I'd studied very hard, and wanted to figure out what to do in the future). Though the questions were very specific, I thought the exams were fair overall. Interesting subject, interesting lecturer, but my TA was just terrible and the course gave me constant anxiety. There's a TON of reading and it's constant, which was really stressful alongside my other reading-heavy classes. Also, even if there are new TA's next year, the harsh grading policy seems to be a constant among the reviews for this class (I should have listened), so unfortunately my experience isn't just isolated to one bad TA. Not worth it, don't do it, don't \"take it for the challenge,\" like I did (stupidly). Do yourself a huge favor and pass this one up. I promise you can find a better option somewhere in the bluebook.",
    "A really fascinating class! Would definitely recommend taking it, even if you have no background whatsoever in the period. Professor Winroth is absolutely fantastic, and the workload is pretty reasonable (a short two-page paper every two weeks, which is workshopped in section).",
    "This class is an excellent and fascinating foray into the subject of the Middle Ages. Professor Winroth is knowledgeable and engaging, and a wide variety of subjects are beautifully intertwined underneath the umbrella of this time. The readings were well connected to the course material.",
    "I would recommend this course mainly to history majors or students who are absolutely sure they want to read a ton of materials written in the time period under study. It is interesting, but by no means a gut, so do not expect it to be easy. Also, the essay grading is pretty harsh, especially in the beginning.",
    "Ultra easy, pretty interesting class if you're good at writing. If you struggle with writing or get a bad TA this class might be a bit tough because it's pretty subjective. Sometimes you'll feel like class was a waste of time, but mostly the lectures are engaging and relevant.",
    "Middle Ages is representative of everything great about Yale; the professor is a leading expert in his field, the coursework is enlightening and in-depth, and the subject material, for good or ill, is extremely Eurocentric. If you're okay with learning a predominantly white, western version of history, you simply cannot get a better version of it than this class. It is fun, exciting, and interesting. The workload is dense but manageable, and the reading is the most unique and interesting I have encountered at Yale. It is the perfect middle ground between writing intensive courses for humanities majors and fun diversions from STEM classes for science majors.",
    "I am torn on how to respond to this question. While the content of this class is fascinating and Professor Winroth a great professor, the assignment and reading workload of this class is prohibitive and its grading harsh. Therefore, I probably would not recommend this class to another student unless the workload were lightened significantly as suggested above and the TFs re-trained."
