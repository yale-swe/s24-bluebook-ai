    "Sitting around and talking about the environment, man.",
    "Take it if you are genuinely interested in the subject, but otherwise you will find many other great EVST courses that are more engaging and helpful in your understanding of today's environmental issues and their potential solutions.",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in environmental politics but if not it might be better to steer clear",
    "Good 5th class. Section once a week. Readings are mostly interesting. Final is before finals week which is awesome and the final paper was really fun to write.",
    "Lecure can be slow, but section helps a ton.",
    "If you're looking for a fairly easy class without a whole lot of work, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I definitely recommend this class, especially for anyone interested at all in environmental issues! The class is very interesting, though be prepared to become fearful of the environment in which you live in. The workload is very easy: only a single paper and two exams, and for each exam he gives you the possible essay questions beforehand. Either read all of the readings or go to all of the lectures; to do both would be redundant.",
    "Look, its not that much work. Its also boring as hell if you arent interested in the topics, and even what you are interested in can be ruined by the bad lectures. Oh and dont waste money on the books - we barely even acknowledged one of them one time in section",
    "yes, take it!",
    "Yes! Great class! Pretty easy and straight-forward, but you learn a lot!",
    "I would recommend it if you have an interest in environmental issues or if you want to learn more about them, because you can start from knowing a lot or knowing nothing and you will still learn and be challenged.",
    "Good class to take. Get out of it what you put in.",
    "Sweet class. I would definitely recommend this to other students. You will learn so much about the environment we live in and the risks and laws associated with it. You may become a little depressed by all the bad things but its definitely worth taking.",
    "Interesting topic, but the art school auditorium is really sleep inducing.",
    "Interesting class but a bit too easy.",
    "One 2500 word paper, two exams (For both exams, he gave 6 essays questions beforehand, and 2 of them would be on the exam. You had to pick one of the 2 questions and answer it.) A fair amount of reading, but you don't have to do all of it. Grading seemed fair. Lecture was very informative. I respected Wargo as a professor because he knew the material well. He was neither a fantastic nor an abysmal speaker, but somewhere in the middle. Lecture slides were online.",
    "Yes!! It made me decide to apply for environmental policy jobs, which is what I'm doing next year now!",
    "Be aware this is a massive lecture course. Two exams, one longish paper, and readings that you don't technically have to do (unless, god forbid, you want to actually get something out of the course). If you're a committed EVST major looking for a hardcore, focused group a course this is not for you; you will be made miserable by hordes of jocks making dirty jokes out of legal acronyms. However, this class is probably necessary if you want a good introduction to environmental law with lots of open-ended questions. The professor is committed to reaching as wide an audience as possible, and encouraging everyone to reach their own conclusions. Admirable- but make sure you understand what you're getting into.",
    "I would not recommend this class, although it's a useful thing to have on your transcript.",
    "Relatively easy and interesting plsc and so credit",
    "Take it. Not a lot of work, and you get some good insight on past environmental and ethical issues.",
    "EPL is an awesome class if you are interested in environmental issues, but beware that your classmates will mostly be very crunchy Harvest types. As someone who identifies as a pragmatic liberal, I was probably one of the most conservative people in my section. Wargo is awesome (albeit a little quiet), and he brings a great perspective to all the issues. The first half of the course is slightly better-organized than the first, but it was consistently good throughout!",
    "First, if you are interested in the environment, take this course because John Wargo is a great scholar, eloquent speaker, and thought provoking individual who should make you think about the role that you want the environment to play in your life. Second, because this course provides an overview of a wide variety of environmental topics and events and the legal statutes that go with them, it is a perfect introduction and overview to the subjects of environmental policy and law, so you should take this course if you want any level of exposure to these subjects. At the end of the day, this course is what you make of it.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone UNLESS: a) You are an environmental studies major and need it to fulfill requirements b) You are looking for a social science course without a huge workload (although I think there are more interesting ones than this) c) You have a really passionate interest in environmental law",
    "YES! Easy class and you learn so much about pertinent issues if you are interested in teh environment\/ human health.",
    "I'd totally recommend this class to everyone. It's super cool material and not a ton of work and very important to life, I think.",
    "Take this class. Just take it.",
    "Great course. Interesting. Great Professor. Makes you see the environment and humanity's attention to it in a whole new light.",
    "Very informative and interesting; it identified specific themes that are common across different environmental policies and laws that I didn't see before. A good comprehensive overview of the history of American environmental law\/policy history which shows how far we've progressed and the steps that made us change to more regulatory based policies and how effective they are. Extremely knowledgable, and very eager to help students, however he isn't the most engaging lecturer, he's pretty good, but there's room to improve. Part of the difficulty in paying attention is probably due to the fact that the class was in the Art auditorium which is dark and not very conducive to a good lecture environment.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Great fifth course, with a light workload and interesting readings. Prof. Wargo is a pretty incredible speaker too.",
    "Low stress. Eye opening. Interesting.",
    "Take it! Not much work, interesting lecture.",
    "Midterm, final, and paper. He gives you six possible essay questions he will ask before each test, of which he chooses two for the exam. Of the two, you get to pick 1 and answer it. So you only have to prep 5\/6 essay questions. Not very difficult at all. Wonderful class - take it!",
    "The class gives an introduction to a number of relevant and interesting environmental issues. Wargo is a sage in this field, and it's interesting to hear his point of view on many environmental issues and how they either cause the promotion or stifling of human health.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in learning about various policy and law related environmental issues.",
    "Yes. It changes your way of thinking environmental laws. And you might come up with really good suggestions for law improvements.",
    "If you want an easy, low commitment class, take this...but you're not going to enjoy it. Lectures are boring, the tests are really dumb (but not hard to prepare for \u2013 6 essay questions are given to you ahead of time, two of which you are presented with at the time of the exam and one of which you have to answer). Easy paper at the end of term, you basically write about whatever you want.",
    "It is a great course if you want to learn about environmental law.",
    "EVST 255 is a great class if you are at all interested in environmental issues and how American legislation plays into many of these challenges. I would certainly recommend it.",
    "Interesting, important, and very topical class. Lots of reading but it's really not necessary to do all of it, and the tests aren't too bad. Lecture is really good and informative, and covers a broad range of environmental issues.",
    "Mehhh",
    "If you are interested in environmental policy, take this class.",
    "Amazing course! Highly recommend it for fellow students. I think this course is very important for other students to engage in, no matter what major. It deals with all the of current environmental problems we have today and works through possible solutions for this generation. It is very manageable but you can really throw yourself into your work.",
    "This was a good introductory class that concentrated on environmental law through the beginning of its development to the contemporary era. It was a good course, well taught and planned though the inicial subjects covered were much more entertaining than those at the end of the class.",
    "Great class",
    "Would recommend. Interesting class, although some topics are better than others. Some get a bit boring and drag. Overall not a ton of work (final paper, midterm, final) and Professor Wargo is very knowledgeable and passionate about the material. A solid class",
    "EP&L was a great course that I recommend to anyone trying to get a broad education. Although I will not use this course towards my major, I am glad that I took it because this is a field which I had no knowledge of before this class.",
    "YES! Absolutely. By far one of the better classes in the topic here.",
    "This class was enjoyable and not too stressful. I thought that we moved through the material a bit too slowly. Other than that, the topics were interesting and very applicable to the real world. Professor Wargo was a great guy and very knowledgable about environmental issues.",
    "No one goes to lecture but you should! Got a lot out of it. He does post all the slides online, though, and his book is basically exactly what he goes over in his lectures. So if you go to lecture, you don't have to read his book and vice versa. Two midterms and a final paper on a topic of your choice. Really enjoyable overall but a bit boring.",
    "This is a class you don't want to miss if you're interested in the environment. Professor Wargo does a great job going through important environmental topics and presenting them with their strengths and flaws.",
    "A great overview of big environmental issues. Take it if you want to work in the field, but also take it if you want to be an informed citizen of the 21st century. It's not super hard, and you get to think about a lot of really interesting things.",
    "Great class. Take it",
    "Great survey of the history of environmental law and politics starting in the post-WWII nuclear era. Covers a lot of very different interesting material. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to gain a good overall understanding of environmental law, history, and the greatest environmental problems we face.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, the graded work is not a lot but to get the most out of it you really have to keep up with the readings.",
    "Class is eh. I didn't really enjoy the material, save for a couple of issues like nuclear testing. Relatively easy though, and the fact that the exam is before reading week is obviously nice so if you're a \"green guy\" I'd definitely take it.",
    "It's a cool course. Not too much work besides the paper but interesting material.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course if you actually want to learn about the issues in a useful context. Take science or econ courses instead- the way environmental politics are presented here is so general that you don't learn anything tangible.",
    "EVST 255 is a slight dip of the toe into the ocean of environmental politics, and has a main point in showing how closely intertwined human health is with environmental hazards. The class is pretty low-key - a few articles\/chapters to read each week for section, a couple midterms, and one long paper.",
    "Great class, definitely worth taking if you have any interest in environmental politics. Do not take this if you do not have any interest in the subject. Workload is manageable.",
    "If you're looking for an interesting 5th class, this might be the one for you! Wargo is an excellent lecturer, the material is interesting, the paper process is really manageable because you have to turn in outlines and drafts (no waiting until the last minute), and he provided the midterm and final questions beforehand (7 essay questions, 2 will be on the test). Definitely will recommend to friends!",
    "Great introductory course to enviro entail politics and issues.",
    "EP&L is pretty cool; it definitely gave me a comprehensive overview of environmental problems and the policy that deals with them. Lectures weren't always the most exciting, but overall it was good.",
    "take it because it broadens your understanding of environmental issues and also you get the chance to write a potentially interesting essay",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. Not too hard at all, and pretty interesting course material if you're concerned with current environmental problems. It's kind of depressing, though.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. It was enjoyable and definitely not boring.",
    "Interesting class with a light workload.",
    "Not a lot of work, you'll learn a lot. If you're interested in the environment, a great plus because this is a pretty easy and informative class. A lot of people never showed up to class, which you can do from time to time, but going to lectures made the information easier to understand.",
    "The class is not extremely difficult and you still learn a lot! In many ways it is what you make of it, as in if you decide to do te readings or not. I'd say this is an important class everyone should take because it can apply to any field or profession as well as individual life choices.",
    "I would recommend this course to others! It teaches you a new way to think about these issues and learn some of the details between how they were resolved or what still needs to be done.",
    "EPL gives a survey of key case examples of environmental controversy and identifies the ethical and political questions they raise. I learned a lot in this class, and would recommend it to anyone interested in environmental dilemmas. It's not a ton of work and contains a lot of cool material.",
    "Yes it's a great fifth class.",
    "I would recommend the class if you are interested in the topic, but it is really up to you how much you can\/want to learn from this class. The lecture can get a little dull sometimes when Prof. Wargo just reads out his bullet points, which are great but abbreviates the process of learning, but otherwise it gives you a good understanding about environmental law overall.",
    "I found this class to be extremely interesting, and I would recommend it to anyone who is at all interested in environmental issues. The workload is not heavy at all - a midterm, in-class final, and a final paper - but I wouldn't really consider it a gut. Professor Wargo is a great lecturer and a very thoughtful and interesting guy, and I felt like I came out of the class with a much better understanding of important environmental issues that everyone should be familiar with.",
    "A survey course of environmental issues with a lot of breadth. You will find an issue you are fascinated by during at least one of the weeks, guaranteed. You really got to practice my critical thinking skills and debating skills in section as well.",
    "If you are educated in environmental issues, this class will be interesting for you but also very frustrating. You are asked to create solutions for problems without fully understanding the problems or the tools environmental policy people use to solve them.",
    "If you find environmental policy interesting, I would definitiley take the course.",
    "I found EVST 255 to be mediocre. The topics are interesting and important, the workload is medium-light, the exams ask you to synthesize not memorize, and you can take the final paper in any direction that interests you. But on the downside, I found the lectures to be dull, I didn't feel I was asked to think for myself all that much, and I don't think I did much deep learning in the course. In sum, I wouldn't take this if I had the choice, and wouldn't recommend it, but other people might enjoy it, especially as an intro to environmental issues and as a 4th or 5th class.",
    "This class will teach you about many of the environmental problems in the world and how difficult it is to solve them. If you are generally familiar with the environment (if you know about pesticides, what climate change is, how plastic is bad for you, etc.) then you won't learn much. If you've never thought about the relationship between humans and the environment, then you will learn a lot."
