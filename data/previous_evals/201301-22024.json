    "ForMAC is a must-take class at Yale. Professor Jacobson is wildly knowledgeable about the subject and willing to talk about the topic outside of class too. Lecture is super enjoyable because of all the cool music, TV show, etc. examples presented- but make sure you actually go to them because the slides are not detailed at all and you'll miss out on important info if you skip. There's a ton of work though (a book every week, required reading responses, 2 essays, a midterm, and a final) but it's pretty enjoyable work if you have the time for it. For instance, the second paper allows you to choose any cultural text you want and write about it. I'd take this class again in a heartbeat.",
    "Amazing fifth class (or sixth for me -- eep). This class really made me think about culture in new ways. You don't have to do all the readings, just make sure you know the main ideas of the books. Go to lecture though!! The best part of this class was getting to witness Jacobson's brilliance twice a week, and if you pay attention the tests will be easy. Take Formac, whatever your major is.",
    "I would recommendthis class if you need a background on cultural history from the 1920s onward, if your friends are taking the class, or if you are specifically interested in film. The first half of the class is not even close to being as interesting as the second, so if you do decide to take it, remember that the lectures get better and better once you reach the 1960s.",
    "One of my favorite courses at Yale. Incredibly interesting readings and lectures. No students should leave Yale without Professor Jacobson's insight. This course makes you THINK.",
    "As a senior history major, I would have loved this class as a freshman. Cool ways of thinking about things, but some of the arguments Jacobson makes are questionable and tainted by the knowledge that what he says isn't always hard-fact, even though he uses facts from history.",
    "If you've ever wanted to delve into the culture and the decisions behind the culture definitely take it. The lectures are really interesting. Professor Jacobson is super left politically, so you need to be prepared for that. If you can't take listening to Marx get quoted at at least half the lectures then don't take it. But if you can value the methodology even if you don't agree then you'll really enjoy this class (I barely agreed with anything he said but loved hearing his reasoning for it). It's also just a really fun class with kind of a lot of reading but usually interesting reading.",
    "TAKE IT WITH YENISEY",
    "I would definitely recommend the class for it's interesting and eye-opening topics! It's a great filler in your schedule even if you don't plan to be a history major.",
    "recommended, take it if you want history from a more interesting and engaging viewpoint.",
    "Great class, really cool \/ different perspective on things.",
    "I would not recommend ForMAC to another student. I was interested in taking it because the course sold itself as a new way of learning American history through culture, but I felt that the course was less about interpreting cultural artifacts thoroughly and from all angles as it was about learning the same US History as in high school with songs and movies as examples for the obvious point. I often felt like Jacobsen had an agenda and did not treat all angles of an issue fairly\u00e2\u0080\u0094for one, he spent a lot more time on racial tension over the past century than on gender issues or issues of American culture at large (even if this culture often excluded other races, it's still a part of American cultural history). While I appreciated learning more about racial tension, I felt like we missed out on some really interesting opportunities for analysis by focusing too heavily on one theme.",
    "History 106 is a great course that provides a solid overview of American culture from 1920s to today. Even if you've taken history courses in the past or here at Yale, this will still provide you with new ideas and insights. Prof. Jacobson is one of the best lecturers I've ever had, and he brings up really interesting examples and ideas. The sections are some of the best I've been in at Yale and I absolutely recommend this class to anyone!",
    "ForMAC is a great class, especially if you need a humanities credit. It's fun, the material is interesting, and the workload isn't too heavy (reading, 2 five page papers, a midterm, and a final). There is a ton of required reading (a book a week, usually), but the books are interesting and you definitely don't have to do all of the reading to do well in the course.The class is taught from a very leftist perspective, which some people like and some people can't stand, but Prof. Jacobson is very upfront about his views and everyone knows that he is going to teach with a heavy bias.Also, Yenisey Rodriguez is a fantastic TA- although she is a much harsher grader than the other TAs.",
    "I took this Credit\/D (and would recommend that). Class was very interesting because elements of culture familiar to us (think Pretty Woman, Britney Spears, Muhammad Ali, Janis Joplin) were explained as a part of the fabric of American history. However, lectures were somewhat hard to follow because lecture slides are all pictures and quotes. It wasn't stressful taking it Cr\/D though!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student, no matter what you're studying at Yale. This class makes you look at American culture in an entirely new light, and all of the information is important and enjoyable to learn.",
    "If you have any interest in American history, cultural studies, or just know about American history in the tiniest bit it's an interesting class to take. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes. Take this class. It's not that much work and it's super interesting. If you go to class, you will do very well. Go to class. The lectures are fun anyway.",
    "Sometimes, you just need a class that reminds you to check your privilege.",
    "This class is a must-take at yale. The lectures are very interesting, the work load is manageable and fair, and the material is great to learn no matter your interests or major.",
    "Take it if you haven't taken an AmStuds class or take it Credit\/D. Probably better as an underclassman. Beware - pretty heavy on the reading (one book a week).",
    "ForMAC is an incredibly fun and interesting class that everyone at Yale should take! As an American Studies major, I found it fascinating and a great summary of the American Studies methodology. Each lecture, in a nutshell, includes the history of a particular phenomenon (the course goes chronologically, with each week being about a decade) and then transitioning into an analysis of the cultural works that have responded to and informed this phenomenon. It really makes you look differently at American society and the constructs that we just assume to be natural. I found myself enthusiastically talking about the class with family and friends--it just prompts so many interesting questions and conversations. TAKE IT! And GO to lecture!!! Honestly, why would you take a class this fun and skip lecture? It's amazing EVERY time. You won't besorry.",
    "Take it!",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes, interesting class. Not my favorite though.",
    "Yes! It's a great course, whether or not you like history. The books are great as well.",
    "If you are interested in a cultural history of the US, take this course. If you want to try out American Studies, take this course. If you're not into talking about oppression and think white privilege doesn't exist, you will be incredibly annoyed by this course.",
    "FORMAC was a great American Studies class. I learned so much about how to interpret and analyze cultural artifacts in terms of their historical context, and I really enjoyed all the material presented in lectures, including music, movies, commercials, poetry, and more. Our professor generally explained the historical context of various cultural movements and then showed us artifacts that showed how popular culture metabolized these movements.",
    "Awesome class. This was so interesting. Jacobson recasts American history in a new light. Some of his lectures are just okay, but most of them are out of the park awesome. A must-take. Not much work, 2 papers a midterm and a take-home final (because why would you take the in class one?). Really fun assignments. My one complaint is that for the most part the reading is only for section and feels very detached from the rest of the course.",
    "If you want a good survey class about parts of American History that you didn't learn in high school, take this course. If you're a conservative who can't stand to hear a liberal take on history, don't take this course. If you're a conservative up for a lively debate, Jacobson will love you. Take this course. Take this course; its great.",
    "Overview of American culture in the 20th century. Good lectures, though Jacobson will randomly just say things that make no sense or have weird interpretations. Recommend as long as you are comfortable reading a book a week (they're not too bad).",
    "Formations of Modern American Culture, or \"FORMAC,\" is a survey course in 20th century American history. Big themes for the semester include racial struggles, gender roles and the changing economy. Professor Jacobson lectures along with long powerpoints of images and videos of cultural products that illustrate the era. The lectures are fairly well organized, but it is important to go to class because there is little text on the slides. The workload is a midterm and final and two easy papers. There is also about 200 - 300 pages of reading a week -- it is possible to get by doing very little of it, but the book selection is quite good and you'll get more out of the course if you do the reading, as well be able to speak more intellectually in the weekly required sections. Overall, the course is not mind-blowing -- you've heard a lot of it before in US History -- but if you're into culture or want a fun lecture class, then maybe FORMAC is for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It is a great survey course of 20th century culture, you learn a lot, and the lectures are really entertaining. If you take the class, actually GO TO LECTURE though. A lot of people didn't, it was a shame, and the midterm and final are only easy if you actually GO to class.",
    "It's a look at the political history of America from 1919 to present from a cultural perspective. It is really interesting and was totally new to me. I loved this class.",
    "Yeah, its a great class.",
    "As a rising senior, this is honestly the best class I've taken at Yale. Seriously, you will not regret taking it. No matter what your major, this material is not only extremely interesting, but necessary for anyone engaged in American culture (which is everyone). Professor Jacobson is by far one of the best lecturers at Yale, so GO TO LECTURE! You can get away with only doing about half the reading or less, as long as you go to lecture. Lecture is the best part of the course. I cannot stress enough how much I loved this class and think every Yalie should take it. I honestly couldn't stop talking about it all semester. TAKE IT!",
    "Definitely take it! Interesting material, great readings. I would have liked to spend a bit less time in the 60s and 70s and move later into the 80s and 90s, which we touch on for almost a moment. Still, overall great course! And the TAs were great.",
    "I think some people really enjoyed and did well in this class. I think in order to, you have to see the relevance of finding racism, sexism, or classism in cultural media. This was difficult for me; I enjoyed learning about history without the artifacts (though watching tv and music videos in class was fun!) more.I don't regret taking the class because it opened my eyes to interesting cultural assumptions. But I did not enjoy any of the cultural analysis papers, find the lectures particularly innovative, or enjoy discussion section. I wish I had taken a different history course at Yale, even though the midterm and final for this class are theoretically quite easy. For the midterm, you just have to regurgitate things said in lecture.The books actually take awhile to read and many are pretty boring. It doesn't seem as though you have to finish reading any of them, since they are briefly incorporated in lecture and you get to select one or two (that you hopefully read) for the take-home final.For some reason, the class just doesn't come together for me. I think I'd summarize the class as a \"flirting\" with American pop culture. You get exposed to a variety of mediums, famous songs and politicians and tv shows, and get a BRIEF history outline from 1920-present. Great for general knowledge, which is what I wanted.",
    "Everyone gushes about this class, and it was neat to be able to watch clips of \"cultural artifacts\" like Mulan...but while the course starts off promisingly, it quickly devolves into a list of Jacobson's personal vendettas, both against people who were nasty to minority groups in the past and against students who don't attend lecture. I didn't find the class too difficult, and the 2 small essays, midterm, and final were all pretty doable, but the content was not as fun as I thought it would be. Oh, but it is kind of a bummer that you have to read a 200-300 page book per week.",
    "An interesting survey AMST course, that focuses (when Jacobson teaches it) especially on race. Take it if you are interested in analyzing media and pop culture (which is fun). It is also a low amount of work, which can get even lower depending on how much of the reading you do. Lecture is interesting and to its benefit uses a lot of videos and media clips, however it can wander and get unfocused. Papers and tests have good prompts. Overall, solid but not spectacular.",
    "ForMAC is a great, fun and interesting class. It requires some work, but I always looked forward to section and lecture, and the reading is just fun and doesn't really feel like work. Don't skip lecture - Jacobson deserves your full attention, you won't regret it! You'll understand American culture in a totally new way.",
    "I loved ForMAC, it was so incredibly interesting and its topics were very relevant in today's world. Lectures are easy to pay attention to and the freedom of paper topics allows for creativity and fun. Take it!",
    "Yes with a caveat--- it's probably not what you think it is, especially if you're a social scientist.The lectures are great in many ways, but they really could situate themselves in the time period more. I know that the tagline for the course is \"the cultural is political\" but at the same time the class spends a lot of time talking about politicians and activists and a lot less time talking about what ordinary people are doing---- and culture is about ordinary people. Hegemony and all that is great, as is superstructure, but to really get a grasp on how that affected Americans and American culture, you have to actually treat those subjects! The best lecture was definitely the atomic bomb one because it talked about the daily lives of American people in relation to political developments that were going on at the time. All the lectures should be more like that.Also, the books often had little to nothing to do with what we were discussing in class. hopefully that will improve.",
    "midterm, take home option final, 2 papers. reading is a book a week (but fairly optional)",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. If you do not, you are missing out immensely and your Yale education is incomplete. Jacobson's lectures will change your life, and the material will never allow you to think about this country and its culture int the same way. It is a wonderful survey class on American cultural history throughout the 20th century with a super manageable workload, two very fun papers, and very fair grading. Take it, that's all I can say.",
    "yes. recommend it.",
    "This class is interesting and the work is manageable. Especially if you feel like you come from the kind of the school that teaches you America is the greatest country in the world, we've overcome racism, and the Civil War is the \"War of Northern Aggression,\" you owe it to yourself to take this class. I always was happy to come to this class.",
    "Yes. Cr\/D\/Fail. 2 5-page papers (they're pretty fun to write). an easy mid-term and a take-home final. Lectures are entertaining, so be sure to go!",
    "Nice course, one of my favorite at Yale. If you want a critical look at American history instead of just learning about your typical crap, take this. I liked a class that would unabashedly take a look at the cultural issues in America. It's definitely a survey course, and if you're aware of political cultural movements in America much of it will be review to you. Jacobson was great.",
    "Take it! Amazing class! Jacobson is a fantastic lecturer. Almost all of the readings are enjoyable. The hour and 15 minutes flies by, especially because we listen to music and watch videos every class.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!",
    "Learned a lot in this class. Jacobsen gives interesting lectures and papers\/tests are not too bad",
    "YES. PLEASE TAKE THIS. THIS IS GOING TO BE YOUR FAVORITE CLASS OF THE SEMESTER. but actually. I would take it again if I could. The material is fascinating and Jacobson really connects the material and themes very well so you get mind blown. This class makes me want a double major in American Studies.",
    "If you like cultural history, its perfect. It is definitely more culture than history, it is NOT for history majors (I hated it). Also, the grading on papers and exams is more intense than expected.",
    "I would really recommend this class. Itwas very interesting to learn about history through American culture. I would really recommend to do most of the readings, they actually really do help give students a better understanding of the material. I would advise that students who take this class have a solid prior knowledge of American history, it makes the class easier to follow\/understand. I thought all of the assignments (papers and tests) were really interesting and fair.",
    "Please take this class. Going to lecture is really enjoyable, and you might get irritated with the students who end up blowing it off. You can gain a great deal from this class if you do even most of the readings, attend lecture, and ATTEND LECTURE. If you are an AMST major, you'll be taking it anyway, but even if you are not, try finding room in your schedule to take it. Lectures can kind of stink because of the impersonality, but Professor Jacobson is really engaging, and the material is wonderful.",
    "I would recommend Formation of Modern American Culture, 1920-present, to another student. It is a fun, informative, engaging class. Lectures are enjoyable and it clearly explained how culture is shaped and developed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's interesting, not too much work, and the lectures aren't boring.",
    "Good modern American history class, with something of an emphasis (maybe less than you would think) on cultural artifacts like film and music. Not much work, a lot of fun.",
    "This class is fabulous. It will make you feel more American by introducing you to the cultural events that have defined the world you live in. It will teach you to analyze things in a way that makes you feel smart at family dinners. This was a class I always looked forward to attending. Don't miss lectures. Maybe skim the readings. But definitely take the class!",
    "This was a really cool lecture that covers American history from a very nontraditional angle. I learned a lot, and definitely am able to see American history and culture through a different lens.I don't think its a must take, but it was a great fifth class. Extremely manageable workload.",
    "Easy fifth class.",
    "A great intro into American history.",
    "absolutely take it. If you go to the lectures and do half the readings you will do great in the course. I don't understand why a lot of people didn't go to the lectures, this class is fun its a lot of watching movie clips and hearing interesting music, quotes etc. It's super interesting and you'll learn about cultural things you've always wanted to know about. That being said I had already taken some upper level american studies courses, so a lot of this stuff was repeat but it was still very interesting. Not a ton a work at all. Really just two 5 page essays, a midterm and a final exam.",
    "Not a very difficult course. As long as you attend lecture and section, take thorough notes, and listen, you should have not trouble. Not a very demanding workload. Very interesting course, I had never really studied recent American history in so much depth until this course.",
    "It is an excellent course and you should definitely take it if you are an AMST major or if you are interested in learning about American culture. You will be surprised by how much you learn about yourself and the U.S. Jacobson is amazing and his TAs were great too. Also, you get to watch music video and film clips in class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. If Drew is TA'ing it, get him as well. The class in incredible, and fundamentally changes the way you view culture as political work. Many people might say that the course only leaves you with a few cool pieces of information to discuss with some friends, but I really believe that if you engage the course, the critical framework you use for understanding the world around you will develop in important ways. This class is an important one, and one that will allow you to start confronting cultural works and seeing them as more than just modes of entertainment. Take this course.",
    "This class is really interesting, you'll learn a lot and I would recommend it to everyone, even people who aren't particularly interested in the humanities or social sciences. As a senior social science major some of the material were things I'd already covered in other classes before, but it was still really interesting. Everyone should shop this course! And while no essays or finals are ever really \"fun\", the assignments for this class were as close as could be.",
    "It was a good class, glad I took it.",
    "A little over-hyped, but good intro class.",
    "TAKE IT! So interesting and makes you re-look at the culture that surrounds us every day.",
    "take formac early in your college career - it's a great overview of american culture. I think the class wold benefit from reading more primary sources rather than nonfiction summaries. Overlooking literature in the realm of US culture seems to be a mistake.",
    "Yeah it was interesting. Take it but it isn't a game changer by any means.",
    "Everyone raves about this class, but I was very disappointed. If you've taken any us history class, or ever had the thought that you might be able to learn something about history by looking at a cultural object, this class is not very exciting.",
    "Take this class! And actually go to lecture- the lectures are very interesting and helpful for the exams. This class makes you much more aware of the culture around you and gives you the tools to critique and examine the cultural items you come in contact with.",
    "Great class. Requires a little more work than one would initially expect, but if you do it, you'll be fine.",
    "ForMAC is an excellent course for anyone interested in cultural studies. There was less cultural theory than I anticipated, which I think prevented students from engaging more deeply with the examples presented in lecture. But all in all, you get a great survey of cultural history (as it relates to American political history) from the 1920s to today. The lectures were less stimulating than I hoped for, but definitely an improvement from most large lectures.",
    "Formations of Modern American Culture is a great class that will change your perspective on American culture. The class goes over some of the major movements of the twentieth century, and explains how different perspectives shaped American culture. There is a heavy focus on economic and racial theory, and the professor relies a lot on marxist theory, but it ends up being very insightful. There is a significant amount of reading involved (1 book a week, usually between 200 and 300 pages), and certain sections require reading responses every week. In addition, you will do 2 essays and have a midterm and a final exam, so keep the work in mind. I recommend this class to every student, regardless of your major. If you think you know American culture, this will probably prove you wrong.",
    "YES YES TAKE IT. Such interesting material that has an impact on your understanding of our culture. However, this is definitely a class where you get out of it what you put it. My friends who didn't like the class were almost exclusively the ones who skipped lecture or didn't do the readings (which are only tangentially related to lecture). Though this could be taken as an easy fifth class, I definitely feel that I only enjoyed it because I really put some time into the papers and readings.",
    "This is an awesome class! Professor Jacobson is a fantastic lecturer, and class is never boring because he frequently draws on movie clips, songs, and stories to enrich his lectures. He is the best lecturer I have had so far at Yale. Overall I really enjoyed this class; it really changes your opinions and interpretations of cultural pieces\/ historical events. I typically struggle with straight history (dates, facts, etc.), but this class examined everything through a cultural perspective, which made it totally manageable and interesting for me.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The class is basically modern American history from a cultural angle- you will learn different ways of looking at everything in culture and our lives.",
    "The material is challenging, not in its difficulty, but because it demands you rethink why American culture is the way it is. Formac examines the things that structure our lives, and oftentimes the insights of the class directly impacted how I understand my life and how I live it. In that sense, it's the best kind of class; it's not restricted to the classroom, and the ideas I learned in it I carry with me going forward. It's a class that can change you if you engage with the material, whether you agree with it or reject it.More generally:I found it to be a fantastic overview of American cultural history, and I love the multidisciplinary approach which is exciting and encourages many different ways of interpreting and understanding politics. I also love that the course considers a much wider range of \"texts\" than most undergraduate classes seem to, including movies, movie trailers, posters, propaganda, songs, poems, etc (in addition to the more typical mediums, like books).The lectures were extremely well designed and their thematic organization (as opposed to chronological) made learning the material much more engaging and memorable.",
    "Take it! It's a fairly easy course that you can gain a lot from if you invest some time to reading. It's a really light workload. The material, particularly as we near modern times, gets very interesting.",
    "FORMAC is a great class. I'm a biology major, so was worried I would be a little out of my element. Instead, I found the class to be pretty accessible. The class is really centered on lectures, so you want to make sure you attend. Fortunately, Jacobson is a great lecturer and his presentation is really what makes the class great.The class assignments are otherwise pretty laid back. They allow you a lot of creativity and I found myself really enjoying working on the assignments. There is about a book to read every week (along with a reading response), but you generally only need to understand the bigger picture. If put a reasonable amount of effort in the class, you'll get a good grade and you'll probably develop your skills as a historian.I'd recommend taking it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's a nice introduction to American Studies, the syllabus has some great reads, and lectures are never boring.",
    "I would definitely recommendthis class to someone considering the American Studies major. In general though, I would recommend it to anyone because I think culture is a concept that touches everyone and culture has shaped all of our lives. This class is key to helping us understand how and why it is that this happens, and I think this class helps broaden our understanding of how society functions. It presents important take aways for everyone (even if you don't always agree with Professor Jacobson).",
    "AMST 191 01 is a great course to take, regardless of your prospective major. Most of us are completely surrounded by American culture and we take cultural norms at face-value. This course provides an opportunity to think about things like gender and suburbanization more critically. It provides a very relevant historical background. It is also very entertaining!",
    "FORMAC is a great class to take both for AmStud\/History types and for anyone who wants a fun humanities credit that isn't a total joke. People take this with incredibly variable degrees of seriousness, so find people in the class who are taking it the way you are and stick with them for studying. For me, it was tough studying with friends taking the class Credit\/D because I was taking it for my major. This class covers 20th century cultural trends BUT is also heavily rooted in the chronology of American history, so it helps to be pretty familiar with the Cold War, Depression, Vietnam, etc. If you need more of a push, topics I wrote papers about included Gwen Stefani and early 2000s teen TV; there's A TON of flexibility in paper topics, especially the second paper and the take home final, which means you can really make this class about things in which you're already interested.",
    "Excellent class.",
    "AMST 191 is a cultural history class. I would recommend it. I wouldn't say it is as life changing as some people suggest but it is still a great and interesting class.",
    "American Studies 191 is a history class that focuses on the cultural aspects of major time periods from the 1920s to present day -- i.e. not necessarily the facts, but how events influenced writing, art, music, film, etc. Although it's probably not as dry as otherhistory classes, it definitely isn't a gut class. The readings tested on the midterm and final are a book a week (usually 200-300 pages), but they're usually interesting, so if you don't have strong feelings about history and have the time to put in the work, I'd definitely recommend ForMAC.",
    "At first, I didn't love the class, but I really started to enjoy it during the second half. This is the first American Studies class I've taken, so I think the format took some getting used to. I had also had much experience with American history from the first half of the 20th century from high school and other classes, so that material felt much more obvious and repetitive. Overall, I'm really glad to have taken the course and I think I learned a ton. The workload is light and the class is interesting, it's pretty easy overall and was a good interesting, fun class.",
    "AMST 191 is a wide-ranging survey of American history from the 1920s through today, focusing particularly on cultural artifacts including TV, film, theater, dance, and music to underscore key historical shifts and trends over those eighty-odd years. I would recommend it to another student, especially a prospective American Studies major (as I am), because it will provide the outline and historical 'scaffold' for any future courses on twentieth-century America, if not always the details.",
    "A wonderful lecture if you are at all interested in American music, art, history, any of it. It's a class that's basically telling you how we came to be who we are as a country. Doesn't get much more exciting and relevant than that. Take it if at all interested!",
    "Take it. It's not that hard (really depends on your TA though...), and it's interesting. Good introduction to American Studies.",
    "Yeah, it's pretty cool as an introductory history class with a cultural spin. 2 warnings: 1) Jacobson is somewhat Marxist. 2) grading is dependent on TA. Start with Credit\/D and switch if you have a chill TA.",
    "Great lecture. Take it and go to class. You can just browse the readings.",
    "Definitely take it! If you're at all thinking about the American STudies major then this is definitely a class you should be taking anyways. It's fun, you look at cultural texts in a new way, and there's a lot of movie\/music clips in lecture (definitely go to lecture--Jacobson is fantastic).",
    "This is not a run-of-the-mill history class, but an examination of American culture and its roots and progression. That said, the material is fascinating, and the ideas presented were intriguing and made one think about and question the sources of the culture we take it and are a part of. Take this class!",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody who is looking for an interesting but not too difficult lecture course. Readings are good but not necessary to understanding the material, and you don't have to do them in order to succeed in the class. You will see ForMAC everywhere once you take this class, which is cool!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anybody interested in American history or culture. The class, and its broader arc, literally traces the sculpting of American culture, and it certainly makes me look at the world in a much different way than I do now. I think anybodywho takes the class stands a lot to gain in perspective and the ability to see our society around us for what it is.",
    "AMST 191 is an examination of cultural history\u00e2\u0080\u0094a look into how culture interacts with and shapes the political atmosphere. The class focuses on key periods between 1919 and the present (although for the most part we stopped after 9\/11). It is important to understand that the point of the class is not to gain in depth historical knowledge, but to gain the thought processes necessary to critically examine the role that culture plays in society. AMST 191 is particularly fascinating in that it applies to our own lives\u00e2\u0080\u0094once you know how analyze cultural artifacts in an economic\/social\/political context, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start doing so in everyday life. This is really the underlying thesis of AMST 191\u00e2\u0080\u0094that every person should be able to critically evaluate, and understand the impact of, the cultural artifacts surrounding them. In terms of workload, the class has few requirements. We read a book a week, but they weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t too long and were very interesting and therefore enjoyable to read. Section focused on discussing these readings. There were 2 five page papers (analysis of a cultural artifact\u00e2\u0080\u0094very fun to write!), and a midterm and final (with the option of a take home final). AMST 191 has the reputation of being an easy class, which I suppose it could be (in that it requires little memorization and has a light workload), but you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gain much out of it. I found the class to be very fun and eye-opening, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d definitely recommend it to another student."
