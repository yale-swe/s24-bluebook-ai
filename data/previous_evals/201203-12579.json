    "Take it! Was an awesome course with a manageable workload. Work can be difficult if your Chinese is rusty, but I skipped 162 to take this and found it okay. Homework can get heavy but everything is graded very fairly. Zhang Laoshi really wants the best for his students and is understanding and engaging, one of the best professors I've had so far. We also learned some really helpful and applicable things.",
    "take it! you learn very practical skills and most of the essays you write will be about real-life things like copyright issues, business dealings, real estate bubble, etc.",
    "Good overview of essential sectors of the Chinese economy, Professor Zhang is really nice and understanding. On the other hand, lessons were extremely dry (lots of statistics) and not very in-depth, so if you were already familiar with the Chinese economy there's not much new here.",
    "Take it, but you really have to apply yourself to get something out of the class. It is very easy just to coast by and not learn anything.",
    "Yes. There isn't a lot of vocabulary drilling that many other Chinese classes focus on (but probably because this is a upper L5 class) and I actually learned a lot about the Chinese economy.",
    "If you're good at Chinese, take this class! I learned a lot from it. I had only taken 142 and 143 before this, but I think the transition was all right. The topics are interesting. The downside is that there is a constant flow of work, whether it be memorizing characters, reading, writing essays, or prepping for oral presentations. That said, it does really help introduce you to a broad selection of business Chinese topics.",
    "The course introduces a lot of professional and high-level vocabulary (~20 words per night, 3 nights per week) that will be important to anyone who wants to converse intelligently in Chinese about things like the stock market, IPR, etc. However, there is very little external motivation to do a thorough job preparing - tests are super easy, and tingxies are relatively rare. I was also very disappointed in the percent of class time that Prof Zhang spent speaking, as opposed to encouraging conversation among students as a way to really internalize new vocabulary. That said, having spent a year in China followed by a year at Yale with no Chinese courses, this class did a pretty good and none-too-taxing job of keeping me \"in the game\" and on my toes, so I'd definitely suggest it for those in the same boat as I was.",
    "Great class if you want to learn Chinese through an economic lens. You get a much more comprehensive and detailed account of things like the banking system, state-owned enterprise infrastructure, and real estate market than you would in a standard survey Chinese language class.",
    "Great overview of practically relevant topics in Chinese business, law, and politics. Emphasizes technical vocabulary, equipping students with the tools to discuss complicated topics. Zhang laoshi is engaging and fun. Great course.",
    "Want to do business in China? Then take this class."
