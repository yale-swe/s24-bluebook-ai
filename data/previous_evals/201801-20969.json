   "comments": [
    "This is an intense workshop class where you really learn to read your fellow writers' pieces for themes, character development, voice, etc.",
    "learned how to think critically about what elements make fiction work, and to revise radically",
    "This is a really great class; we focused much more on editing stories, and therefore learned what makes a story, a story. It was so fun to see everyone's stories evolve over the course of the semester, and the class really felt like a community, which was great.",
    "My writing has seen serious improvement as a result of this course and all of the careful writing and rewriting, thinking and rethinking, that it necessitates. In focusing on a single story throughout the course of a semester, rather than a series of separate written pieces, I think the class uniquely allows for a more accurate representation of the writing process in the real-world--the endless succession of drafts between initial concept and final product. I saw, in my own story and others, just how transformative a single new draft can be for a work. It's inspiring and encouraging and frustrating and everything in between.",
    "This class seriously pushed my writing in a way that very few others do. With three drafts of one short story, I was able to really comb through my writing and was forced to look at the serious flaws of my work. Editing is more than just looking at typos, and this class really helped me see the true challenging process of writing.",
    "I learned how to better construct a story, with special attention paid to the development of characters and the emotional undercurrents which run through the narrative. I also developed a better appreciation for other people's writing. This course helped me become a better writer and editor."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is a great workshop course. There's not much outside reading, but that's because you spend so much time with each other's writing. Cunningham is an amazing professor and you learn so much from working so hard on one story.",
    "strengths - great to read the work of other students, hear their thoughts. weaknesses - wish that we spent more time discussing stories by published writers",
    "I loved the editing process; I felt like I could really see some big changes in everyone's work by the end. And the workshop was always a really positive experience--everyone clearly cared so much about each other's stories, and always wrote really thoughtful feedback. The three-draft format definitely made each individual story better, but I also think that, by the end of the semester, the conversation seemed to slow a little, I think in part because everyone had by that point seen so many different permutations of all the stories and it became harder to see them with fresh eyes. Which is not to say that people weren't always helpful and kind, but rather that three drafts of the same twelve stories felt like a lot to read, by the end. But again, the third drafts really made a lot of the stories better--maybe offering people the option, for the third round, of writing a new story would shake things up a bit?",
    "This course is truly wonderful. I really don't have any suggestions for improvement going forward, beyond the fact that I wish it met more than once a week and allowed for some time to discuss famous writers' stories amidst our own. I wanted every class to be longer. We packed our discussions from start to finish, and it always seemed we could have gone on far longer, lost in our conversations about these stories, which gradually became so real and so important to all of us.",
    "I was particularly pleased with the fact that we drafted the same story three times. I've never written a story that I've been very happy with, and I usually have a hard time revising. This course forced me to revise and revise again until I got the story (almost) right. Oh, and Michael Cunningham is amazing."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course! Cunningham was amazing and getting to spend all semester with one story made me really appreciate the writing process. You'll get to see everyone's stories change so greatly and get very fine-tuned. A great course if you can take it.",
    "yes absolutely, it changed the way I think about writing and revision",
    "Yes--it's quite a lot of work, but it feels like a different kind of work from my other classes, and at times felt refreshing. If you find reading\/writing fiction to be a good outlet for you, and you're really down to commit to editing the same story for a semester, I think you'll get a lot out of this class. Michael is so committed to his students\/always made time for us, which I really appreciated; if you're willing to put the time in to grind on your story, he'll totally be there for you. And the assigned (non-student) pieces are really great.",
    "I'd absolutely, unquestionably recommend this course to another student. If you're lucky enough to get a spot in it, take it. Workshopping three drafts of the same story and paying such close attention to the process of excavating the story you mean to tell, in its most powerful form, from a cloud of initial ideas, is a difficult and incredibly valuable one. And Professor Cunningham is unparalleled in his ability to guide and encourage throughout this process. He's kind and unbelievably insightful and truly just a genius in the way he thinks about writing, and stories, and humanness in general. It's awe-inspiring to listen to him discuss and unravel the most meaningful parts of your work, and if the class as a whole is a good group--which I think he has a knack for assemblingthe amount of feedback and careful attention paid to your writing will be humbling.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their writing. If you can get in, Michael Cunningham will change your life."
