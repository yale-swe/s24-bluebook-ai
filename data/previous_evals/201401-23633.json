    "I really enjoyed this class. The topic isn't really covered in any other at Yale and is very interesting. The lectures were engaging and the assignments were fun to write. The visiting professor probably didn't know how Yale does take home midterms and essentially assigned a regular, hour long, closed note midterm two days before when most of us were expecting open notes and at least two days to do it. Aside from that hiccup, though, the class was fantastic. The timeline of the assignments wasn't too stressful and the discussions were interesting. Professor McKenny chose readings that were, for the most part, relevant, easy to read, and thought-provoking. In addition, Oryx and Crake, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Gattaca, and Blade Runner were fun and helped expand the class into my everyday thinking.",
    "RLST 218 is a course that focuses on biotechnology and analyzes the ethics behind multiple issues surrounding it. It uses religion as one of multiple ethical lenses through which biotechnology can be discussed and covers multiple religions. It sticks with some of the same authors throughout the course, so You can follow their logic through different ideas. Overall, it's a fair amount of work, especially when You have books assigned to be read (not really when it's just articles) but it's a fair and interesting class!",
    "Fantastic class that I believe everyone should take in order to think critically about the role of biotechnology in our world today and in the future. Great Professor, highly interesting readings, very doable workload and fair grading.",
    "This class was really cool. I highly recommend it. Reasonable about of reading and Professor McKenny is awesome. At points I felt somewhat existentially challenged, which was difficult on top of dealing with sophomore slump. Be prepared to be challenged in a way that most Yale classes do not challenge you."
