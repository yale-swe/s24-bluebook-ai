    "I felt like I learned quite a bit from Professor Bazell's perspective, and I really enjoyed much of the discussion we had in class. I think the course will improve as Professor Bazell becomes more used to the classroom atmosphere, but sometimes it felt like we were spectators in a newsroom.AMAZING guest speakers though - do take this course, I learned an immense amount.",
    "It's worth it if you like cancer; prepare to have some classes where you are bored and some classes where you are thrilled.",
    "Yes! Definitely take it! My favorite class at Yale",
    "This was the first time the seminar was offered and I hope it will continue to be taught in the future. Prof. Bazell is a very engaging professor and",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone with an even remote interest in cancer, no matter your background. It is incredibly interesting and having people with various perspectives really added to the discussion.",
    "It's a fairly easy class that will leave you able to talk about the largest issues related to cancer in a superficial way. The best part of the class is the lineup of awesome guest speakers. There is just one midterm paper and one final paper, not too bad at all. The majority of the class is made up of students presenting recent newspaper articles, which is interesting, but not the most intellectually stimulating exercise. Also, if you are already familiar with the science side of cancer, you don't really need to do the readings...Prof. Bazell is really great and it's fun to see his news reporter side when he interviews the guests.Also--he only accepted seniors this year, so be aware of that before assuming this will be a part of your schedule.",
    "This was a great course because we got to meet so many influential speakers. Prof. Bazell was very knowledgeable and did a great job involving people in meaningful discussions about cancer. Although we did not spend as much time focusing on the science of cancer, the course was nonetheless an interesting exploration into the disease and how it is being treated.",
    "You can do most of the reading independently. I would not waste a credit on it.",
    "This course was taught as a College Seminar as its first iteration. It was mostly juniors and seniors and met once a week for 2 hours. It seems like it's going to be taught again under a different name as a freshman seminar in the spring. I have very mixed feelings about this class, but here they are: Bazell is an amazing man, he is an inspiring person, brilliant, and he has more connections than I could have possibly imagined. That said, he's a little relaxed in class. Like too relaxed. He once joked in an interview \"I can't teach biology\/immunology because I've forgotten it all\" well that's something I definitely agree with. I'm sure he knew his stuff once before and he knows the scientific details when he looks them up in advance or if he's covered (on TV and then only in about an expected level depth) them before, but that's not super useful when you're in a seminar setting where the topic changes freely based on what people bring up. Considering the class was a mix of science and non-science majors, I'm not really surprised that we didn't pick a clear path to follow among ourselves, and we certainly weren't pulled in a particular direction. There wasn't a great deal of leadership in the seminar either. I felt like we were all sort of free associating most of the time and Bazell didn't do much to push us in a particular direction. Rather, we spent most of the time finding, presenting on, an discussing articles \"related to cancer\" that we found. I feel like I gave a half-assed performance in this class but given that the class was sorta terrible relative to it's potential I feel like my not-really-caring was more justified than the professor would care to admit. It's not like I didn't care at all, but the class was so terribly uninspiring that after a few weeks I didn't really care anymore. He didn't actually follow up on the readings in class the first few weeks, then he spent 2 weeks quizzing us, and then just stopped assigning readings and all we did was present on articles we chose and listening to uninfomed babble about my classmates' opinions on cancer-related news articles isn't really something I looked forward to doing for 2 hours a week. I've never understood why an institution as amazing as Yale has lower teaching standards than my public high school. I know that may sound mean, but honestly, can they really expect someone like Bazell to walk out of 30+ years in news and into the classroom and then immediately begin teaching like an Ivy League student would expect? Not that Yale professors have a tendency to be skilled at teaching in general. In the last class Bazell said, at one point: \"I'm going to do something I should have been doing all semester, teach you something about the science of cancer.\" I think this course should have been half lecture and half seminar and Bazell needs to rethink it in that light and go in harder on a few details and skimp on the current events a bit. I think even the non-science majors were disappointed by the lack of science in the course. The longer books on the syllabus were assigned as optional (emperor of all maladies and the Weinberg Cancer Biology textbook) but I got both and I think it would be better to approach the course with making both actually assigned and actually teaching from both of them. Bazell was being nice by not assigning too much reading, but in a seminar like this I think it's 100% necessary to have an impossible to complete amount of reading each week. We are Yale students after all. In short, this course was like having really, really, bad sex with a really, really, hot person. The prospect was exciting at the beginning, but it was utterly disappointing relative to where my expectations were set. I got very little out of it, but there is great room for improvement with some work.",
    "If you're interested in cancer in any way, take this course. Prof. Bazell is the BOMB and he brought in some amazing speakers. If you're a science major than it'll be almost zero work but you still learn a lot from the speakers. Can't beat this class."
