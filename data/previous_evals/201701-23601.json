   "comments": [
    "I suppose an insight I developed is that I am not well-suited to this type of course.",
    "I loved getting to use the resources at the Cushing Center and Beinecke in this course. I felt more comfortable utilizing them for my final paper, and look forward to keep exploring their collections in the future. Thematically - the chance to explore important themes like exotica, imperialism, and the thoughts that go into collecting practices were all so relevant and intriguing.",
    "I learned about the rise of museums in the early modern period. We learned how to analyze primary sources and construct an original argument.",
    "Developed invaluable insight into European histories of collecting (involving medieval traditions, empire, colonialism, slavery, the development of natural history and anatomical disciplines, etc). This class, through exposure to the Beinecke's and the Cushing Center's beautiful and rare texts and Paola's informative readings, is a great space to reevaluate some of the ways we imagine relationships with objects look like with exploration into the ways early modern Europeans looked at, related to and circulated objects and their meanings.",
    "I learned how to critically evaluate early modern collecting",
    "I learned about the history of collecting and its intersection with historical events and trends.",
    "I learned about how people in early modern Europe acquired, preserved, organized, and interpreted natural and man-made objects. I learned about the emergence of a scientific culture that valued firsthand experience, rather than secondary knowledge acquired through books. I also learned about how the boundary between nature and art was challenged and re-imagined in the early modern world. Through this course, I learned how to develop interesting, original historical arguments supported by primary sources. I also learned how to produce critical responses to other scholars' writing.",
    "My understanding of the collecting practices of art and nature in the early modern period!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "For those students who are particularly interested in or experienced with museums or the sorts of objects typically housed in them, I'm sure this class was particularly beneficial to their thought processes. There is a LOT of reading, but that is typical of HSHM courses. I personally did not like it, but I'm not sure quite how the course could be improved -- I think I was just not a good match for it.",
    "The syllabus for this course was exceptional. Every reading was selected with care and incredibly engaging. Getting the opportunity to engage with primary resources was also a wonderful thing. The midterm was fun to write and a nice break from the usual academic research paper. The class discussion felt, a few times, not all that productive. However, this was not a major issue.",
    "Strengths - making great use of Yale's resources! The midterm creative paper was also a great, enjoyable experience.",
    "- readings can be really dry and boring at times. - assignments are too vague. I honestly thought the midterm assignment was confusing. - the topic of the class itself is pretty fascinating. Good seminar topic. - so great to see materials at the libraries",
    "It was an amazing course! The syllabus was wonderful. Professor Bertucci was even better. I wish we could have gone to the archives more!",
    "This was an incredible class with an awesome syllabus, plenty of time spent in the Cushing Center and Beinecke, engaging assignments that you will look forward to completing, and an excellent professor.",
    "I loved this class! The readings were really wonderful and the syllabus was so well curated. I thought class discussion was always engaging and Professor Bertucci did a wonderful job of getting us to use primary source materials. That said, I wish we had more information about precisely what primary sources we would be working with on class field trips to the Beinecke and the Cushing Center. I always felt like discussion on those days was a little less focused because it took people a while to make connections between the readings and what we were looking at in class. Having more guidance ahead of time \/ being told some questions to think about or key themes to consider would have made those field trips more effective.",
    "This main strengths of this course is that it makes really good use of Yale's rare book resources and is structured really well from week to week. One weakness is that the readings, while containing good information, can sometimes be confusing, long-winded, repetitive, or dry. It could probably be improved somewhat by condensing the number of readings or assigning shorter portions of longer readings.",
    "The readings for this course are excellent. They provide a diverse introduction to how scientific knowledge in early modern Europe was organized and how it circulated. This course also makes fantastic use of special collections at Yale. I loved viewing material at the Medical Historical Library and at the Beinecke Library and drawing on course readings to interpret what I saw. This course could be improved by situating the intellectual history of collecting within the broader social and political history of early modern Europe. For some students who already have a strong background in early modern European history, this may not be necessary. However, since a course in early modern European history isn't a prerequisite for this class, it may be helpful to have additional recommended readings that provide broader context for students who do not already have it.",
    "Really engaging and I loved the museum and archive visits. Spot on.",
    "The material is the obvious strength, the delivery is the weakness."

   "comments": [
    "No. I feel like only a very small minority of Yale students would be capable of the emotional investment required to enjoy a course like this. It was very difficult for me to sustain interest.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course. Take it if you have an interest in objects, collections, knowledge and how these things relate. You will learn so much about so many topics that feel relevant. This has been my favorite class at Yale, and I strongly recommend it to all students with interest in both the humanities and the sciences (...so everyone?).",
    "Most Definitely! Every week, the themes and readings presented were challenging and intriguing. I enjoyed working on my midterm and final papers, and looked forward to the chance to engage with my peers and the readings every class.",
    "If you like museums, I recommend it.",
    "Take this course if you can get in! The material and professor are wonderful.",
    "Absolutely! This was an incredible class with an awesome syllabus, plenty of time spent in the Cushing Center and Beinecke, engaging assignments that you will look forward to completing, and an excellent professor. Fun! Weird! Do you want to learn about unicorn horns? Take this class!!!!",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is really interested in the topic of collecting and\/or museums. Keep in mind that, though there is a lot of interesting information to learn in the class and it's a good way to get hands-on experience with some rare books and artifacts, it is also a discussion-based seminar. If you think you would enjoy reading and talking about why exhibits are arranged in a certain fashion or what fundamental beliefs guide collectors or what the political implications of a specific machine or object are, then this might be the class for you. Otherwise, you might find it to be a little too abstract or philosophical.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. It's a wonderful opportunity to learn about the philosophy and practice of science and art in the early modern world. The course readings and discussions are engaging and diverse. The writing assignments are valuable for learning how to develop compelling, original historical arguments that are well supported by primary sources.",
    "Yes!"
