    "this is small but it would have been really wonderful of the readings on classes V2 had been organized in the order we needed them instead of alphabetically. perhaps putting a number in front of the case title, either by order of need or class week would have been great but it was sometimes challenging to find the reading.",

    "All guest speakers were wonderful to have in class. I enjoy what they had to say and that they all appeared to want to be there as well. Speaking with Jason and then Jeffrey Herrmann about the case we read was really great.",

    "There was enough room in the structure of the class that I'm sure everyone that took it came out with a different benefit. I also think it very much depends in when in your life and when in your time at Yale you take the class. Having such a wide range of minds in the room was very eye opening as well."

    "There were various versions of the final assignment for the course that stated conflicting information. This led to some confusion about what the focus of the project was - to discuss just the employee manual or the organizational culture or both. While I was able to apply what we learned in the course to the project, some more clarity would be helpful. I think it would also be helpful to apply the Kolbe A self-tests to other class discussions during the course.",
    "While interesting, I felt like the final project could have used a clearer direction. I enjoyed everyone's presentations and the different perspectives everyone took on the project but while working on it I wasn't really sure what I was supposed to learn or what the overall objective was.",
    "I don't know if I would've had time to read them, but I would've liked the option to read the Personnel Manuals from all of the companies we did final projects on, so you could've suggested questions to be asked when the different people did their interviews. Then the presentations for me would have been a little more personable and less just listening to random information."
