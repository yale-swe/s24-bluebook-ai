   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend English 120. I think those who enjoy writing would appreciate the freedom provided by the class to write about whatever subject they wish. I think the structure of the class allows for the work load to be extremely manageable.",
    "Yeah, take it! It's just a fun class. It demands a significant chunk of time, but I never minded it, because the work was always so fun. The class itself feels like a good conversation among good friends, which is what I'd want out of my day anyway. 10\/10 would recommend to a friend.",
    "English 120 is an extremely worthwhile course that will improve your writing and increase your appreciation for the modern essay genre. I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are someone who enjoys reading non-fiction and discussing it. The class follows the interest of the students which is something not all classes do, and this can be very exciting and interesting. It is an almost entirely student driven class, and it is really great to learn just as much from your peers as you do from your professor.",
    "ENGL 120 is a very enjoyable course with about an average workload. We wrote a draft or a final paper every week, which spaces the semester out nicely. Crucially, though, the readings took about 1.5 hours per week, far less than courses where students are expected to plow through whole books every week. The in-class discussions were very enjoyable too -- Oppenheimer is a great conversationalist, and all of my classmates were great to work with. I would certainly recommend this class to anyone looking to take an entertaining introductory writing class.",
    "It is a great way to work on your writing. The class is a lot of fun. The readings are great and the assignments really make you reflect on yourself and your experiences. I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "ENGL 120 is a transformative course. Not only are the readings varied and interesting, the in-class discussions are always insightful and often revelatory. The small, cohesive group of students makes the class fantasticeveryone is engaged and has something important to say, whether it's a comment that completely refocuses the discussion or a constructive critique of a fellow student's essay. Professor Oppenheimer is an amazing seminar leaderhe ably guides the discussions, focusing them when necessary but also letting them develop their own momentum. I learned a lot about myself just from writing the essaysabout my political views, my relationships, my goals. This class was the highlight of my term. Take it."
