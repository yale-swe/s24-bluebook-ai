    "I learned a lot of basic Russian grammar that I had not known before, which was very helpful. I started to improve my formal Russian writing, though I am still working on that -- it was very helpful to learn formal phrases and ways of writing. I practiced reading Russian literature as well, and discussing it in class.",

   "comments": [
    "The students in this course had a wide variety of Russian skills and knowledge before joining the class. As someone who had not practiced Russian as much as my peers, it was definitely hard for me to catch up and stay on top of my work, because things like reading and writing took a lot longer for me. Looking back, I feel like I was in the wrong course because my skills were not up to par with some of my other classmates, who were almost fluent. I'm not sure what the plans for the Russian heritage\/bilingual program are, but I think it would be great if next time, people could be split up into more levels. There were some students in the class who were basically fluent, and could have been in another heritage class. Then, there were some students, like myself, who needed to go a bit slower in order to really learn the language. Splitting up these two groups could really help everyone. I'm not sure if this is possible with the size of the Russian heritage program, but it is something to consider anyway.",
    "The course is outstanding for students with a firm grasp of the Russian language who want to improve their performance and understanding. It offers a great mix of fundamental exercises and classical readings.",
    "This was a great course. We developed a variety of language skills and it was really helpful to have conversations. I think more readings on contemporary culture, events and literature in Russia would have been interesting."

    "A wonderful course for native\/bilingual Russian speakers of all levels (although it would be very helpful to take the first semester before this). Prof. Titus manages to adjust the work to perfectly fit every individual student and their abilities.",
    "I would recommend this class to a bilingual student who is almost fluent in Russian. I wouldn't recommend this class to someone who comes from a Russian-speaking family but hasn't had a lot of practice with the language themselves.",
    "Absolutely! This course is well paced and thoroughly enjoyable.",
    "This is a great course if you want to keep up and improve your Russian with a very light workload."
