If you're not a BME major, you can still appreciate this course and the technologies that are covered!",
    "I would recommend it if you are really interested or possible interested in imaging. It wont really teach you how to do much but it will give you an idea of what imaging in BME means.",
    "It's interesting, but I'm not sure I would recommend it. It's the kind of class that takes complicated material, presentsit very quickly, and then just doesn't expect you to understand it very well. It's not hard to do well in this class, but I still find myself wishing I could better understand the underlying physics and chemistry behind the imaging techniques we learned about. Perhaps if the class focused a bit more on the basic principles underlying the imaging techniques (especially MRI, pulse sequences, etc.) I think it could be a great class."
