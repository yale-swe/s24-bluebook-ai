   "comments": [
    "This course taught me to go about the process of creating effective writing that efficiently and effectively conveys an argument of substance. Through this process I have learned the importance of clear articulation, discussion to stimulate thought and writing, rigorous revision to improve the quality of writing, and peer review, comments and criticism as they provide perspectives that are hard to consider otherwise.",
    "I learned better organized writing skills, gained experience communicating with my classmates in a classroom setting and a peer-review setting, and I learned about the historical impacts and implications of basketball as a social and cultural structure.",
    "Arguments, assembling papers and arguments, analyzing films.",
    "I learned how to write better, especially a lot of the nuances of formal writing.",
    "This course allowed me to develop my skills of analytical writing, rhetorical argument, and essay structuring, all through the lens of a topic I am interested in and passionate about.",
    "How to think critically in writing an essay. Establishing the stakes of an argument. How to enjoy your writing and the writing process.",
    "I learned how to write better about non-fictional texts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of the class's biggest strengths was its engaging topic and ideas. This piqued me to be a more engaged and attentive learner and contributor throughout the class. My only suggestion for improvement is faster criticism and grades for papers so we can identify what we need to improve upon.",
    "Strengths Very interesting and enlightening discussions, surprising for me given the content. I love basketball but I didn't realize how academic and intellectual we could make it, and I really enjoyed that. It pushed my understanding and appreciation for the game and everything it means for me. Weaknesses Sometimes the discussions would get difficult if people didn't have anything to say. That didn't happen too much but Professor Brower did a good job of handling those situations and keeping the conversation going.",
    "I thought the emphasis on collective discussion in the classroom was the most effective and enjoyable component of the class. All the students generally had plenty of thoughts to contribute in response to our readings, but the discussions also sometimes felt short. So I believe the course could be improved if we had readings that were slightly longer, or more different readings.",
    "Awesome, devoted teacher in an environment open to facilitating discussion and provoking thought. Professor is extremely flexible and attentive with students and puts learning first. Great, contemporary, and relevant readings.",
    "The course had generally very good readings, and the professor did a great job of fostering class participation and engagement. However, at times, there were some dry spots in discussion, and it was used kind of just to fill the remainder of class time.",
    "Strength: The structure of the class, which focuses on in-class discussions and exchanges of ideas, which then translates seamlessly to the papers."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student based on Professor Brower alone. Despite my distaste for English, I took up this course per a recommendation from a peer and am very glad I did. The material is not only engaging in itself, but Professor Brower works to push us to consider the material in a new light- forcing us to consider the larger consequences of the ideas at play.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in learning to formulate and express personal thoughts about sports and just culture in general.",
    "Absolutely. If you love basketball, this will be your favorite course, bar none. First reading\/essay is a tad tedious but nonetheless interesting and sets a solid base for the rest of the course. Jordan is an amazing professor and will teach you got think about the game like you never have before.",
    "Yes I would. It's a class where you can be fully into the subject matter but still learn important writing skills.",
    "To any student who has even the slightest interest in basketball, I would highly recommend taking this course, you will not regret it.",
    "Yes, it is a freat intro to English course for those interested in writing about basketball.",
    "I think both the professor and coursework were excellent."
