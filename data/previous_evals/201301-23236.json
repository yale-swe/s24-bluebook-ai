    "If you take this course, definitely take it with the lab--then you really get to see the things you learn in class in real life (real dead life, I guess). This class felt like it was trying to cover way too many topics in one semester, but they may change it and re-focus it next year since this year was the first year it was being offered. Overall, I thought it was a great class. I learned a lot about where structures in the body come from, not just knowing what their names are.",
    "This class was offered for the first time this year, so there may be changes! I found it to be very laid-back, sometimes a bit dry, and not much work. The exams were relatively short and easy for anyone who has taken previous classes in general biology. I really liked the comparative approach that focused more on homology and evolutionary changes than memorizing tons of molecular details. The professors were really nice, and the TAs were awesome! I'd recommend this for underclassmen... if you've already taken higher level bio classes (especially through MCDB) you may not get as much out of it.",
    "Comparative Anatomy is my favorite science class thus far. The subject matter itself is fascinating, and the professors and TAs make the experience even better. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested, and I would suggest taking the lab component with it.",
    "If they are interested in the subject then yes definitely.",
    "Great lecturers, no classwork and fascinating material - I never thought I'd be able to learn so much about anatomy in one semester! I just wish there wasn't so much of it. Absolutely take with the lab - the lab is definitely what makes this course.",
    "An awesome class, with cool teachers and fair tests.",
    "I would recommend the class because the material is interesting and the Professors and TA's are excited about getting the information across and helping the students.",
    "TAKE IT! IT\"S THE BEST!",
    "Yes! Take this class!! The material is absolutely fascinating and Gunter and Kurt are really good lecturers. The class itself isn't very much work-- two midterms and a cumulative final, and although it covers a lot of material, the tests are really fair. You definitely won't regret taking this class.",
    "No, unless you need it for your major. Lots of memorization in this course and the material (although extremely interesting), was not presented in an engaging manner. The course is entirely test based (25% for two midterms and 50% for the final), so that will either make you or break you. Lectures were not organized well, and complementary assigned readings would have been really helpful, since lectures were really confusing (basically, if you missed one lecture, you missed a TON of info.",
    "I would recommend this class! It's difficult, there's a lot of material, but it's fascinating and I really enjoyed going to class."
