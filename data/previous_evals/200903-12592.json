    "Yes take it!!! Also if it works with the time of the class, try getting together with the other people in the class for lunch in a dining hall before class starts. It's nice when you're all baring your souls to each other for the semester.",
    "you gotta take this if you get in. a totally unique opportunity. louise gluck is fantastic. that said, not quite for the faint of heart. you're pouring the deepest emotions you have out into these poems, and then they're getting ripped apart. if you get too emotionally invested, it's gonna be a hard time. also, the class is weirdly emotionally tense, but i guess it comes with the territory. shit, if people weren't super sensitive, they probably wouldn't be very good poets.I think i most recommend this course if you've never written poetry at all (i hadn't). i totally struggled at the beginning, felt like i was out of my league, and spent a really long time on each poem. and i learned a ton. if you're down for a challenge, take it take it take it, you won't regret it.oh, i kinda wish i'd taken it credit D, cuz you don't really know how she's gonna grade (she says you get an A if at some point during the semester you have written a\"real poem,\" whatever that means).at the beginning of the class, I wished we were talking more about poetry itself; what it is, what we're doing with it, how to do it, different ways to use enjambment, etc. we never did that stuff. instead, we just went over poems each week. still, though, by the end, i felt like i really had gained an ear for it.prof. gluck is wonderful. she speaks with astonishing, astonishing precision, which i suppose is expected, and strikes a nice balance between being a hard-ass and really encouraging good work. above all, she really respects the students in the class; she's reading the work like it's real poetry, and evaluating it as such. what a wonderful opportunity.",
    "Take this if you get in. Just take it. It will make your writing so much better, and you will look forward to class every week.",
    "Good work shop for poetry, in that it encourages you to write each week. Class discussion and the forcible bending of your voice are both damaging.",
    "This class will definitely improve your writing.",
    "You read and comment on each other's work. Take it.",
    "From this class you will get intense, critical analysis of a poem of yours, either from Louise or from the class as a whole. It isn't for the thin-skinned, and it isn't for those who are unable to revise their own work--but it's an INTENSELY rewarding experience if you take the class seriously. Louise is willing to comment on a single piece you find promise in over the course of several weeks (on top of the normally assigned weekly piece) and I suggest you take advantage of this. This class gives you as much as you put into it.",
    "Absolutlely recommentd. This workshop was a wonderful opportunity to discuss poetry in an intimate environment. If your group is anything like mine was, this is a chance to meet weekly with a bunch of brilliant, critical minds who can approach discussions from a variety of angles \u0097 sometimes discussions became very academic, sometimes they were very grammar-focused, sometimes they just got plain silly (it's good when at least a handful of people in the room are down-to-earth\/have a good sense of humor). Professor Gl\u00fcck's feedback is shockingly precise \u0097 sometimes she will amaze you with her ability to pinpoint EXACTLY what is wrong with a given word\/line\/stanza. (The other students can also amaze you in this way.) The class can also be intimidating \u0097 it's hard to feel confident when you are surrounded by a group of talented individuals and you find yourself writing and having to discuss very personal things. After the first few weeks it gets increasingly comfortable. Last note: as with all creative writing classes, you'll get out of this class what you put in. You have to be very self-motivated, though there will be weeks when you just aren't inspired.",
    "TAKE IT! It will be exhausting but fulfilling. You will learn a lot.",
    "If you are seriously interested in writing poetry, this class will be a wonderful experience. It can be a little rattling, however it is really worth it."
