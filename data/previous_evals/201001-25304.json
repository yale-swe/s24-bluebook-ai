   "comments": [
    "Great survey of the history of Latin American film. it's a time commitment, though; there's usually 2 screenings a week because of visiting filmmakers. But keep in mind that the homework is fun - you're watching great movies and writing about them. Improves Spanish in a fun atmosphere.",
    "Spanish 223 is a great class. You do have to do a fair amount of writing, but it's in short increments and the teacher is willing to make changes depending on what makes the class more doable for the students. What's a better way to do homework than to sit down and watch a movie with other students and eat cookies that your teacher brought? I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone that wants to keep the rust of their spanish in a fun way.",
    "This is a great class through which you will learn a lot about Latin American culture, both historical and contemporary. The professor is passionate about the material and willing to do whatever she must to make this class work for the student. I recommend this class for people who are passionate about film, regardless of their confidence in their Spanish. For those who are less confident, there ARE subtitles available for some of the films.",
    "You will end up doing more work than you bargained for by taking this class. but it's worth it if you like watching movies and want to practice your spanish because having a demanding workload is necessary to motivate you to put in effort.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It's super interesting and fun. The movies are great, and the expeience I had in this class was fantastic!!"
