    "Take it if you are interested in combinatorics and probability theory. Not too much work and a solid treatment.",
    "You will learn a lot and see some very cool probabilistic proof techniques that are very different from other kinds of math, which is awesome. However, do not expect to understand everything that is going on in class all the time especially as it gets late in the semester. Over all I learned a lot and am glad I took it. I did wish in the second half of the class that I was slightly more comfortable with linear algebra but I still understood a lot with my rusty and limited knowledge.",
    "Yes",
    "The course begins with the simple idea of Erdos which is then applied to many different situations. The emphasis of the course then shifts to random graphs and matrices."

    "Probabilistic method is one of the coolest math techniques I have ever seen. I am really glad this class exposed me to it and I hope it is not the last time I encounter it. Alon and Spencer is a really interesting text.",
    "Great contribution for my future research",
    "The course material is very well aligned with my present research. Professor Vu's talks cover a broad spectrum of the field and concludes with the most contemporary open problems and results."
