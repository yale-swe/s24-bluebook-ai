    "Definitely recommend it. The intensity of it makes you learn the language far faster than people who take L3 and L4 separately.",
    "Take it. The course may sound like a long time, but it's a great way to hang out with a couple other people every morning and just talk in spanish. Much better than the separate L3 and L4 classes, as there is only one section of intensive and only about 7 or 8 people take it.",
    "Excellent. You will learn so much Spanish - much more than in the standard classes - and the small class size and speed allows you to learn while respecting your intelligence and ultimately having a lot of fun.",
    "I would highly recommend it. You're spanish will actually become loads better."
