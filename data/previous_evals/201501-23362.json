    "It would be wonderful if we could meet more frequently in order to build a community among the PhD students. The programs are small, but a community atmosphere is lacking.",
    "I'm not sure I remember what this course was--I think a few ethics events and another presentation or two. It's sad, because the PhD program seriously lacks cohesion and this course could be a good opportunity to create that. I know it's a work in progress, but we would really appreciate if developing a PhD group course was prioritized. We would love a journal club or chances to get together with people from other departments and talk with each other or faculty about careers, grad students life, and our fields.",
    "A nice way to bring students together and hear interesting speakers",
    "Great opportunity to share work and experience with peers. Certainly salient. More regular meeting times perhaps can enhance experience.",
    "Interesting panel discussion."
