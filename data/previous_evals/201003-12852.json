    "MEMS is a great class if you're interested in how they work. You learn not only the scientific concepts, but also the fabrication processes required to make them and how this impacts their design. It makes for a great elective, isn't too much work, and Professor Ramirez is great. It's no gut class, but it's also not Fluid Mechanics.",
    "About the same difficulty as most other mechanical engineering classes with psets and exams not too demanding."
