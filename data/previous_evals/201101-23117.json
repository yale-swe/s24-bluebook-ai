    "Most definitely! Take this class if you're at all interested in multi-media art or want to just experiment with sculpture.",
    "Definitely! Not only you get to know with 3D expression but you also learn some very useful skills in digital media (photoshop, final cut pro), etc.",
    "Two big projects and a couple of assignments throughout the year that encourage exploration of the shops and digital media. Supportive and friendly class vibe. Super fun! Take it",
    "Work with a bunch of digital media, especially photography and video. Two larger projects that incorporate other materials like metal or wood. It was a really fun class, but part of that was the size and the people. If Sandra Burns is teaching, you'll have a good time. She's wonderful to talk to and tries to get to know everyone in the class.",
    "Art 120 02 is a great course if you've ever been curious or interested in working on sculpture or multidimensional art with materials such as wood or metal. It's definitely abeginner-level course, but would probably be better suited to students who have had a little experience because much of the class is simply time spent in the wood or metal shop working on projects so you have the freedom to experiment and make whatever you want, regardless of experience. The class is also \"digital,\" meaning you do get to use all the available resources to shoot videos and take photographs, which is a good portion of the assignments throughout the semester. The class is definitely a more relaxed studio class, but be prepared to put in time for your critiqued projects, because a good portion of the class is art majors and the work they did constantly impressed me. Overall, the instructor, class size, freedom, and range in topics explored in the class were the greatest strengths of the course. I definitely would recommend to anyone interested in sculpture and digital photography\/film."
