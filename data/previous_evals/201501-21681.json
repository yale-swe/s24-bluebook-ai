   "comments": [
    "The lectures are great. The lab is a whole lot to handle. It's a little bit crazy at times and a whole lot of work.",
    "If you're up for a challenge, this is it! You learn so much from the lectures and the exams were specific\/challenging. Working in a group project was pretty difficult (in ensuring people pull equal weights), especially on this type of very technical and difficult project. Make sure that people in your group have experience with different techniques, such as staining and imaging. That would make your lives much easier. Make sure to be very on top of the timing, as the total time you have to work on this project is not very much. There will also be a lot of coordinating times to work on the project outside of the class and lab time, especially during the less couple of weeks. Make sure you are willing to commit to this and that everyone in your team has the same expectations. If you're interested in tissue engineering (or any related field), this course will challenge you to design a project and hopefully really understand the techniques. In that sense, I refined a lot of my techniques.",
    "The course does a great job covering the field of tissue engineering from its conception to it current state. I would recommend the class whole heartedly with one caveat, that the lab segment is onerous and can be frustrating. Taking the course with two others and a senior thesis, I found the workload manageable, but with three or more high intensity classes would not be a good combination for this class.",
    "BENG 464 is hard, frustrating, and honestly a much-needed experiences for BME's interested in the tissue engineering field. I would definitely recommend the class to other students. Professor Niklason's lectures manage to be incredibly extensive, summarizing the basic concepts of tissue engineering, interesting business models, and landmark research. As a leader in her field, she really knows what she is talking about. The lab portion is difficult and you get little guidance with the initial proposal. However, the need to be organized in your team, and the frustration and pitfuls are part of a lab experience that every BME needs. You also get an extensive introduction to cell culture. That being said, be prepared to devote a lot of time, so only take the class if you are interested in the material. Also, tests can be hard to predict."
