   "comments": [
    "Largely a good course, with some qualifications. For a lot of the course you feel like you're meta-studying the issue. You spend the first half of the course looking at theories of typologies of welfare regimes, and instead of really talking about specific policies you debate about the debate surrounding those policies. Later, the course gets a little more empirical, but you still talk a lot more about the political forces going into sculpting policies and not much about the ways policies happened in different specific countries. You leave with a very good overview of welfare policy, but you don't feel like you know that much about any country in particular (except for the two you study on the final paper).There's not very much reading, and the only assignments are a mid-term paper and a final paper, which both took a good bunch of time, but overall it's really not much.Professor Seekings is verycool, smart, friendly - fun to be in class with him.",
    "Unless you have a particular interest in welfare policy, I would not recommend this class. Professor Seekings is a great teacher, but the subject matter is uninspiring at best.",
    "It was an interesting look at welfare in developing countries (mostly Latin America and East Asia). I kind of took this course on a whim, because shopping period was overwhelming, thinking that maybe I was interested in welfare. This class, though, showed me that I'm not interested in welfare and wouldn't like to pursue it further. But I don't regret having taken this course. I learned a lot that might help me later on, even if only to understand something in the newspaper more thoughtfully and with more insight. It was also just fascinated so look at how historical legacies (cultural, social, political legacies) are shaping the development of welfare policies in countries of the \"South.\" I enjoyed the readings and discussion.",
    "I signed up for this class because I wanted to deeply understand one area of public policy. Classes that offer such a thing are rare at Yale, and it turns out this wasn't one of them either. The class focuses much more on the methodology of comp pol welfare research and understanding the politics that led to particular policies being chosen. The economic or ideological arguments for choosing policies and study of their effects on society is largely left out.",
    "The class starts very theoretical and gets much more nuanced and specific as you go on. Don't give up on it just because it seems intimidating (only two papers, both huge and detailed), Prof. Seekings is there to help. There's a good deal of reading every week, and you'll want to keep up with all of it--discussion will be infinitely stronger. Grading is absolutely fair.",
    "If you are interested in welfare policy and in economic challenges and poverty in developing countries, definitely take this class.",
    "I would only recommend this class to other students if they were interested in the material. This is not a class one should take if they simply want to explore welfare policy. The material can be dry. This is not a easy and fun class to take. It is a class to take if the student wants to have a base foundation of welfare policy in other countries."
