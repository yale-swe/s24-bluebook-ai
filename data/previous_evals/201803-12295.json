    "improved algebra skills and knowledge concerning the application of calculus.",
    "I learned all of the topics of Calculus II and learned how to problem solve difficult problems.",
    "Calculus BC skills, with some topics covered more in-depth such as the concept of Riemann sums and also new topics like calculating volume by cylindrical shells.",
    "Gained a good foundation for calculus and calculus-adjacent mathematics.",
    "Calculus BC skills - series convergence\/divergence, integration, maclaurin\/taylor polynomials, etc. The material was generally learned more effectively through watching online videos than through going to lecture.",
    "I honed my BC Calculus skills and learned more of the theory behind Calculus.",
    "Basic calc",
    "I learned all of the valuable skills for integral calculus, including very applicable knowledge about areas, volumes, and infinite series.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class could be improved by employing teachers who know how to teach the confusing calculus material in a clear way, not by using proofs that aren't conducive to understanding (or even relevant to the course material). Moreover, I often found that the sections were not uniformly taught. When conferring with students from other sections of Math 115, we found multiple discrepancies in methods of solving problems and general material covered in class. There was often much confusion concerning what would and would not be covered on the exams. When I referred to the syllabus, I found that we had not learned material that was supposed to be on the first midterm, and we stayed behind schedule until the end of the course. Math 115 would greatly benefit from uniformity in both professors and the syllabus to prevent even more confusion in an already incredibly confusing course.",
    "strengths: many resources such as peer tutoring and office hours. Weaknesses: pace is a bit too fast at times; inhibits full comprehension of concepts.",
    "This course was good at holding the students accountable by having weekly problem sets and making sure that the problem sets challenged the students. A weakness is that the lecture meetings weren't incredibly engaging so they didn't do much to enhance my learning.",
    "Not many students were aware in the first half of the course that there were short video lectures that were part of the course (flipped classroom), so that should be made obvious on the syllabus. There just wasn't much guidance\/suggestions on how we should learn the material before coming to class except through doing the explores - but I wasn't even sure how to approach the explores - was I supposed to read the textbook first and do this? Or use my Calculus BC knowledge? Or just guess and try again because there are 6 attempts per Explore? Either way, the Findings from each explore were very helpful in explaining the concepts I was expected to know.",
    "Appreciated the breadth of what was covered, no real outstanding weaknesses.",
    "The pre-class explorations are very poor at illustrating concepts and are generally just a guessing game and feel like busywork. Its nice that the exams are more focused on conceptual understanding rather than heavy computations. Sometimes, however, it felt as if missing one part of one problem because one thing didnt click cost an entire letter grade on an exam, and this was often disheartening. Furthermore, the weighting of points on somr exam problems seemed inconsistent - with some being worth more than it seemed like they should be, and others less. Furthermore, the course itself isnt exactly structured well - while it isnt flipped classroom anymore, it clearly still isnt conducive to effective learning. The majority of students that dont struggle in the class have taken BC in high school - if you havent had previous exposure to this material, youre going to have a tough time.",
    "Fei can be more thorough and explain better.",
    "grading is so harsh",
    "Strength: Good theoretical teaching, effort by professors: Weakness: Professor went off tangents every class about stuff that was not going to be on the test",
    "Everybodys class experience completely depends on their TA, which is kind of unfair if you get a bad TA (make sure to shop for a good TA). Also its kind of confusing how the people grading your hw, teaching you, and making the test are not the same people. This class is honestly a lot of work that onpy ends up making about 15% of your grade which is annoying. This class could also benefit from a curve.",
    "The flipped classroom setting was a struggle at first but I learned quickly how to maximize learning. However I thought the exams were an accurate and fair representation of what we learbed in the class.",
    "Solid workload, great explorations. The course should have more review sessions maybe.",
    "This course advanced at a nice pace and I never felt unprepared for any of the exams or problem sets. If I had to offer a weakness, I would say that class engagement is usually low. Since this is a math class, however, I do not think that high engagement is as necessary as understanding of the material and practice."

   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they knew what they were getting into. Having the discipline to teach yourself difficult material is crucial to attaining a good grade in this course, since the professors are of little help and the peer tutors, while much more helpful, lack the time and resources to reteach the course to you. My advice is to not let this course, despite its many fundamental and organizational flaws, deter you from pursuing math in the future.",
    "Yes; I believe the content taught is relevant across multiple disciplines and is hence necessary for most students to learn.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is effective at teaching the basics of Calculus II and the workload isn't overwhelming.",
    "It would really, really help you if you've already taken Calculus BC and want a manageable math class. Taking Calc BC doesn't mean this class will be an easy A though - you still have to have a detailed understanding of each math concept if you want perfect scores on that psets (they take off points for every minor thing). However, don't take this course if Calculus BC was a breeze for you - do Math 116 or 120 instead for a true challenge.",
    "Yes, I find the course to contain important information for a college education.",
    "The only reason you should take this course is if you have to to fulfill a requirement. Otherwise, there are easier and likely far more enjoyable and useful QRs you can take.",
    "I would if the student had not taken BC. If they had taken BC before, they should go into 120.",
    "Not really, unless you had to take a math (if you do then i think it is the better out of the 112,115, 116,120 options)",
    "I would recommend to another student because I personally enjoyed the material we covered during the course but they should know that it is a but more work than other courses.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who has some math background but is not entirely sure whether he or she is good.",
    "This is a nice introductory class to college-level calculus. If you are nervous about taking 120 this may be a good option."
