    "I came into this class knowing all Latin grammar but not being able to apply it super well to texts, and I came out of the class being able to read Latin poetry basically on spot! I also gained the ability to understand the Latin by reading and not translating to English and understand the text through the original grammatical constructs. I also gained an understanding of how poetic elements like meter contribute to the text.",
    "Translation and grammar skills.",
    "reading latin meter; reading intuitively",
    "Knowledge of Latin verse Increased Latin vocabulary Knowledge of more archaic or poetic syntactical constructions",
    "I developed the ability to read and better understand Latin poetry, especially the meter component of Vergil as well as other Latin poets. In addition, I also developed an ability to think about the themes and topics written of by Vergil and seen in ancient Roman society."

   "comments": [
    "This class was incredibly engaging and progressive in how we studied classical texts--it was by no means your typical Classics classes. Alternate readings and interpretations of the text were highly encouraged, as well as satire and subversion. The assignments were all interesting and well beyond standard academic essays.",
    "all strengths, only strengths.",
    "Strengths: Lots of Latin reading that increases reading proficiency Small class size allows for a lot of discussion Kyle is a great teacher Weaknesses: Small discussion-based class sometimes gets off topic or slowed down with student questions.",
    "The biggest strength of the class was that our professor pushed for an intuitive understanding of the meter and the meaning of the Latin poetry that we read. This made it frustrating at first, but as the course progressed it definitely made me more flexible in how I approached reading these epic poems, or lines of them. To this end, the poem we read, book 6 of the Aeneid, was a really interesting read that allowed us to practice our skills while at the same time providing an interesting story. However, there were times where it would have been nice to have more definite and concrete translation for sentences, even if they didn't capture the full meaning of what Vergil might have been saying. Another really big strength of the class was Kyle's seemingly inexhaustible knowledge of ancient Roman society and the etymology of words."

    "Take this class!! It was fantastic. Kyle is a great teacher and brings so much to your understanding of the Aeneid with lessons on related side topics, such as history and culture. We visited the Beinecke and the Art Gallery to look at ancient books and artifacts related to the text. Kyle himself is fun and incredibly knowledgable, and interested so much more in your learning and ideas than giving exams and grading assignments.",
    "i would. excellent way to improve latin skills",
    "Absolutely. We read a great text (Book 6 of the Aeneid), improved Latin reading proficiency, and spent time discussing both syntactical details and literary comprehension.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have to take Latin to finish your language requirement. It's an interesting class, and the translations are time consuming as always, but it is pretty manageable. Also, it only meets three days a week rather than five, which is pretty sweet. Furthermore, Kyle is an interesting professor, and the Latin poetry we read is really fascinating. Assignments are not that bad, and Kyle definitely had an infectious enthusiasm for etymology and other facets of translation that were interesting to learn about."
