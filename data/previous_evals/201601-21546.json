    "This course was a fantastic introduction into Japanese art, accessible for newcomers to the art history discipline and art history majors alike!. It was my first course in the department in East Asian art, and one of my most enjoyable classes all year! The lectures were engaging, thoughtful and well-prepared; the readings were fantastic and did not feel like a chore at all; Professor Yiengpruksawan was available to talk about lectures, papers, or anything else. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend! :)",
    "One of my favorite classes at Yale. A lot of my friends who saw me reading or studying the class material thought all the screens or temples looked the same. But Mimi is an expert in this field, and I couldn't disagree with my friends more after taking her class. I learned so much about Japanese art, architecture, culture, and how it all fits into Japan's own history as well as history at a global scale. Mimi is an amazing, engaging lecturer and also one of the kindest, most invested professors I've ever had at Yale.",
    "Great class! I learned a lot, and most of the lectures have really beautiful and\/or interesting pieces that you won't see in any other class. You'll learn a lot about the history of Japan as well, although the class seems a little crazier than it ends up being at first because it's technically a continuation of an ancient Japanese art class. Grading ends up being easy, but be ready to put in the work to memorize what you need to - it's a lot, even for an art history class.",
    "great introduction to the art and architecture of Japan; course load is very manageable with short analysis, course essay, midterm, and final; overall great art history course",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who's interested in Art History of Japan. It's very easy to understand, yet with a great amount of knowledge."
