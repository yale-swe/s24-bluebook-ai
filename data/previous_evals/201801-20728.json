    "My vocabulary expanded by a lot. We learned about new grammar patterns, more useful phrases, and did readings on Korean culture.",
    "I developed a deeper knowledge of the Korean language, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening to the language.",
    "I was able to really hone in on the basic skills I received in L1 and gain more grammatical understanding of the language .",
    "I learned a lot of grammar and vocabulary. I was able to practice speaking, reading, and writing Korean. I also learned about Korean culture through songs, videos, and readings.",
    "Proficiency in korean language level , especially im writing",
    "I felt that both my reading and speaking skills improved immensely through this course. Specifically with regards to speaking and dictation I felt this course was incredibly helpful.",
    "Korea Language and more grammar",
    "This semester we learned many more complex grammar structures and vocabulary that drastically expanded our ability to communicate. We learned a lot of songs and facts about Korean culture as well so now we are better able to listen and voice our thoughts in Korean.",
    "New grammar rules and vocabulary, a little more about Korean culture, better speaking and writing fluency"

   "comments": [
    "I really liked the course. In the beginning it seemed like a lot of work but it definitely got better.",
    "The strengths are that Professor Choi is very flexible and the class is very friendly and made to be fun. The weakness is that the class and its handouts are sometimes a bit disorganized.",
    "Professor Choi has a lot of experience teaching and it showed as she approached language learning from different angles so each of us could try absorbing it in our own way .",
    "The class was small so everyone was able to practice and participate. Choi Seungsangnim was very nice and she definitely cared about all of her students. I feel more confident about my Korean speaking abilities.",
    "More vocabulary smaller class for better speaking practice",
    "The daily quizzes were difficult but definitely helpful. However, jumping from slow dictation to song lyrics and Korean commercials was a little overwhelming and stressful.",
    "There was a big discrepancy between the students who excelled in korean or knew the language prior to the course versus the students who were struggling. Could be improved by having two different courses or more help with the students who were struggling early on.",
    "I found the pace of learning in KREN120 to be a lot slower than KREN110. Although the lessons moved quickly, I felt like the first half of the semester was literally just review of 110. A huge part of the vocabulary that was supposed to be new was also from 110. I think the two halves of the course need to have better continuity between the two, as there is so much overlap when we could have spent that time learning new grammar. Furthermore, we didn't really incorporate the book as much, and I felt like I wasted $60 buying it. Choi SSN is sweet and very funny at times, but in practicing the dialogue and listening exercises, I felt like she mostly recited things back to us, and this felt draggy at times. There was also one time we watched a video of a tiger trying to hunt down a bear, but it was animated in this hyperrealistic way with weird sound effects. The vocab we learned in conjunction with the video was super niche, and we never revisited it throughout the class. I did really enjoy the traditional songs we listened to and sang along with, as it was a departure from the usual kpop I was used to.",
    "The course was extremely organized in a way that made it easy for us to keep track of the skills we were currently learning! The class was also a good balance of speaking, reading, and writing and I felt that going to the language tables and having weekly sessions with the TFs were really helpful in improving my skills.",
    "Professor Choi explains Korean very well. Her background in linguistics will really help you understand why these rules are happening. Plus, Professor Choi gives you back excellent feedback! However, sometimes the class can be a bit dull, especially if your classmates don't make the class exciting. The class really depends on who you take it with."

    "Yes, if you want to learn Korean take this class.",
    "Yes! This class really helped me learn a lot more Korean so I definitely suggest that Korean learners take this class.",
    "Yes! Korean at Yale is so fun and honestly worth the challenge.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I love to learn about Korea and Korean culture. Choi Seunsangnim is extremely helpful and cares about her students.",
    "Yes because professor has a very helpful background in linguistics so concepts like etymology are useful in learninf and retaining the lamguage and grasping cultural concepts as well",
    "Yes. It was a rigorous but also fun and enjoyable class.",
    "Yes, but mostly because 120 is required for the Light Fellowship and to advance further in Korean. The course isn't uniquely interesting, but if you have an interest in Korean language and culture, you can probably get something out of it.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course since you learn quite a bit of Korean and it is not too much work!",
    "YES! It's not that difficult of a class and will help you learn Korean!"
