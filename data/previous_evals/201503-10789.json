    "Yes, I will recommend.",

    "APHY 675 is a very useful course to expand and deepen your optics knowledge. The focus on applications is particularly useful, and as a result I would recommend this course to a friend.",
    "This is a very good course. But it would be nice if the course can spent a little more time on some of the basics for non-physics background student."

This 'baseline' may not be directly helpful, but important nevertheless as its the fundamentals that are the most daunting to learn when its coupled to the advanced theory presented in research papers.",
    "It offers comprehensive analysis on some concepts in optics, which rectifies my previous wrong ideas. It provides me with some useful references for my research.",
    "My research involves optic diagnostics and this course is useful to learn the fundamentals."
