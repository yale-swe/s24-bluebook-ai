   "comments": [
    "This is a very tough course no matter what your background; it requires a strong background in basic statistics, comfort with calculus, and programming skills. The weekly homework can take from 5 to 20 hours, even if you work in groups, and the exams are very difficult. The course is especially useful if you are already working on independent research projects, otherwise you will be exposed to a bunch of models without really understanding their applications. Finally, Green is always available to help, and really cares that students learn (a rare thing in graduate school) so all in all it is recommended.",
    "A worthwhile recap of some topics from 503 and a helpful introduction to MLE and binary response models, plus a quick guided tour through a handful of other methodologies. Definitely recommended.",
    "I would highly recommend the course, very nicely merges theory and practice.Theoretical concepts explained in a very intuitive way. (The max.likelihood coin flipping exercise in excel is brilliant!)",
    "Take 504 unless you throw up at the sight of numbers or plan to take the Economics Department statistics sequence.",
    "Good introduction to non-OLS methods. Would recommend it yet would also recommend another class on those topics to get a non-biased view.",
    "The course is an absolute necessity for any student in the social sciences who is interested in applied statistics. Strongly recommended for all students, but those with a solid backing in statistical theory will get even more out of the course."

   "comments": [
    "My classmates and I are fortunate to have had Don lead us through these first topics in econometrics. I've talked to folks from polisci programs in other places and many of them expressed a lot of frustration with the training they've received. Don prepares us well.",
    "Significantly deepen my knowledge, very nicely connects theory with practical examples and exercises (HW+Exams great examples).",
    "I don't think anyone can understand political science without being well grounded in statistics. I may or may not end up doing an experimental dissertation, but in any case it will rely heavily on understanding causal inference and how to design and evaluate statistical models.",
    "I learned to appreciate experiments, yet at the same realize that experiments are not a panacea at all.",
    "This course has been invaluable to my research, and has directly assisted me with an article I am readying for publication. It has broadened my understanding of topics that I thought that I previously understood, as well as introducing me to new methods of estimation."
