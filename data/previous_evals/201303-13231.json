   "comments": [
    "I discussed this class with most of my cohort, and other students were interested to hear the lessons learned from this course. I would summarize the class as learning how to do effective research, and that lessons learned here, while focused on historical and archival work, apply to most work in the social sciences.I would recommend this class to any student in political science, and in fact would argue that this class should be a requirement, or at least as widely taken as more formal methods. Given that all empirical data at some point comes from critical reading of sources, even large-n research, this course is a necessary building block for conducting independent research or criticizing empirical work by other authors.",
    "I do think it's useful if you're interested in archival research. Not necessary by any means, but useful.",
    "Yes. I would certainly recommend the class to someone who wants to begin an archival research project.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for everyone who is interested in qualitative methods in general, and in history in particular."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped teach me how to quickly and critically review works, how to conduct independent research on historical sources, and how to design research which avoids pitfalls which cause problems for inference.As was said above, I have already used works and ideas from this class in citations and discussions for other classes. While archival research is time consuming, it has also given me ideas for how I might approach other research problems.",
    "This course offers an in-depth engagement with the basics of qualitative methodology, as well as an excellent introduction to historical and archival methods."
