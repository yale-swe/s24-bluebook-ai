    "Yes, take this class. Be prepared with a short film idea and ready to change it for the better.",
    "Great if you want to make a short film! DO IT! But only if you're willing to devote a ton of your own time and energy. You get out of it what you put into it much more than other classes.",
    "I would recommend it if making a short film is something you want to do. It is really helpful towards letting you achieve that goal. The classroom environment is great. And everyone is really helpful towards helping you create a good screenplay and a good film for the future.",
    "If you are passionate about filmmaking and are seriously considering entering the industry after graduation, definitely take this class. There is a lot of work all leading toward one final product. If you are looking to experiment and play around with film, this is probably not be the class for you."
