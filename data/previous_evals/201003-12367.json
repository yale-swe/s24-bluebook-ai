    "Physics 200 was a decent physics class. Nothing special, and basically what I expected out of an intro physics course.",
    "PHYS 200 is a manageable but somewhat bland class, up until it covers special relativity. Professor Tipton is very funny and adds a light-hearted element to the class, but even he cannot spare his students the day-long problem sets about special relativity. I would not take the class unless you are considering the subject as a major.",
    "If you have to (or want to?) take physics, Physics 200 is a good bet. Tipton's hilarious (and, more importantly, interesting to listen to), problem sets are easy, the curve is generous (I hope), the class moves fast but not too fast. Knowing how to compute an single-variable integral is important -- any other math and\/or high school physics is not (though of course it would make your life WAY easier if you've had AP Physics, and if you know differential equations, you will find the wave equation lecture hilarious). The class starts very easy and picks up fast -- faster than I thought, actually, as the difficulty of the first midterm took me by surprise (oops).Also, that thing about Math 230 and Physics 260 being coreqs is a complete lie. Physics 260 is for people who like computing things like curl, and Math 230 is for people who like proving things about manifolds and eigenvectors. The math you learn in 230 will be utterly useless in 260, and success in one class by no means guarantees success in the other.",
    "essentially a review of AP physics C with some relativity, forced and damped oscillation, and fluids thrown in. Goes through the material quickly, which could be difficult if you've never seen it before. I'd recommend it for anyone who has taken AP phys. C and maybe isn't math-oriented enough for phys. 260.",
    "A solid course covering a broad range of physics. I recommend that course, but get ready to spend some time on the homework assignments.",
    "Take Physics 200 if you're interested in physics, and have some background in it. Don't take it if you need to get a physics requirement out of the way, but dislike the subject- that's what 170's for. 200 covers a lot of material, but doesn't really delve into any subject very deeply, but, as an intro course, that's to be expected. It's not hugely interesting physics, but by no means is it boring. Tipton spends a lot of time on the theory behind the equations, and the derivations of the equations, but not much on applications of the equations. That's something to be wary of, especially if you're not good at physics. I've heard 180 isn't much better in that respect, though.The homework assignments range from easy to very frustrating (the longest one took me 10 hours). The tests are never very hard, though.",
    "Yeah, I guess so. Not entirely inspiring... I never know why intro science classes can't be inspiring. Some unwritten law I suppose.",
    "Take it if you need to or want a refresher on AP Physics but don't expect it to be the most interesting class you've ever taken.",
    "It is a good course, moves at a good pace that is gets through the work with out going to quickly. I would recomend it to another student if they have an interest in physics.",
    "Hmm...I personally didn't like the course that much. If you have taken physics in high school, it shouldn't be too hard, just try to keep up somewhat with the material. If you want to understand more of the rigor behind physics I think 260 would be better.",
    "I would recommend this course to those who have a good background in physics. For those who have little knowledge of the subject, stay away. Paul Tipton provides very thorough colored notes which is a plus because the class covers a large amount of material in a very short time.",
    "Paul Tipton is friendlier and accessible. His lectures, however, often seem elliptical to the crux of the matters at hand, focusing on long derivations that yield equations with which the students may already be familiar. Tipton's teaching--and the class's education--would benefit from a better balance of derivation and application.The tests vary drastically, but none of the subject matter is ridiculously difficult to comprehend. The problem sets are doable, and count for a significant portion of your grade, too.",
    "Tipton is the man. Take it.",
    "Take it if you love physics and have a pretty strong background in both physics and math. The exams only have four questions, so there's not much room for error.",
    "After taking this class, I realized I don't like physics. If you like physics, take 206. If you feel your physics level is not good enough, make it good enough on your own, then take 206. Do not waste your time wiht this class: you can pass the tests just by reading the book, except for the special relativity section, which the book didn't cover.",
    "Physics is tough but it pays off in the end if you do well enough for your standards. Take it if you need to, I hear 180 isn't taught too well.",
    "This is a great course to take after Physics AP in high school. Professor Tipton is funny and works very hard to keep the class \"happy.\"",
    "I wouldn't take physics 200 if you haven't seen any of the physics concepts yet or if your math isn't up to the requirements. With a non-calculus physics background, though, I felt completely comfortable in the class and was able to do well. The problem sets were generally pretty straightforward and the tests were really fair.",
    "If you took AP physics C, take this class. It willy solidify what you learned then and introduce you to a lot of important other topics in physics (relativity, sound, fluids, etc.) The workload is not bad at all, it's only twice a week, and it's well taught.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has taken AP Physics in high school but wants a more in-depth knowledge of mechanics. This class also goes over special relativity, a subject not covered by the AP.",
    "The lectures were very interesting but the problem sets were very hard. Overall I enjoyed the class, and recommend it if you know you like physics. However, if you don't understand something in class, it was likely that you would never understand, because the textbook and the TA's weren't very helpful.",
    "Only if you need it for your major or love physics. You have to figure out a lot on your own.",
    "Take it if you have to, if not there are much better science courses out there like Astronomy 220 or Astronomy 210.",
    "I would",
    "Most of Physics 200 (up until Special relativity) was a review after coming from AP Physics C. Professor Tipton always teaches from slides, so if you don't like that teaching style then I wouldn't recommend the course with him. The course load includes a weekly problem set, which isn't usually too bad.",
    "I would strongly recommend Physics 200 to a fellow student. It is a very interesting course that goes a bit beyond the scope of what may have been covered in a high school AP Physics C course. It includes not only mechanics but also an introduction to relativity, four-vectors, and some mathematical methods for physics and science in general. It was a very enjoyable class.",
    "If you are looking to take a physics course, I would definitely recommend this course even if you have not taken all the math required. Professor Tipton does a great job of not only teaching the physics, but the math required to do the problem sets.",
    "Pretty standard first semester physics. Compared to phys 180, I believe that this class tends to have more homework and exam problems that are in variable form. There's not too much calculus involved actually; perhaps that'll change in the second semester of this class.I think Prof Tipton was responsive to class feedback and was a pretty clear instructor. Humorous sometimes.",
    "Physics 200 is a manageable course but most likely neither the easiest nor the most enjoyable course you can take at Yale. If you're genuinely interested in physics then it is definitely possible to enjoy it, but otherwise it will probably just become a chore. The math you need to do problems isn't that bad but some of the math used in derivations can get complicated.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, whether or not you're planning to major in physics. It's not as scary as some people make it sound, and the professor makes it really fun and interesting. The workload is very fair.",
    "I wouldn't recommend Physics 200 to another student. If you're looking to take a physics course at all, take either 180 or 260. 200 is more work than it needs to be.",
    "I you have enough math background take 260, it's much more interesting. You are not going to learn basically anything new in his class.",
    "In retrospect, I kind of wished I had shopped 180 or 260. Prof. Tipton is nice and cares a lot, but he can be very confusing. If you enjoy physics and had a good background in high school, you'll do relatively well. Otherwise, look at the other two courses. With a subject like physics, the professor can really make or break the course - and Prof. Tipton, unfortunately, won't make you fall in love with damped oscillators any time soon.",
    "Physics 200 is an introductory physics class that largely covers Newtonian physics and a little bit of special relativity. I wouldn't recommend it to another student unless they want to major in science because otherwise, it is sort of waste of time.",
    "Physics 200 was a good introductory physics class if you have had some background in high school. I would definitely recommend it if you are thinking of studying physics or have it as a requirement for another major.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has a solid background in high school physics (AP Physics B or Honors Physics would be enough) because it covers the same materials in a little more depth and with some more challenging problems and topics (like rotational motion, statics, and special relativity). For people with AP Physics C, 260 would probably be a better fit.",
    "A great physics class meant for someone who is interested in a deeper understanding past high school physics. Not necessarily just for majors. Professor Tipton makes the class enjoyable and interesting.",
    "Physics 200 is a solid introductory physics course. Though I hear that Physics 260 is better-taught, that course also requires a significant time commitment. If you have a good physics background, but don't feel that Physics 260 is worth the time, then Physics 200 is an excellent alternative. Professor Tipton is a relatively relaxed professor who lectures well and writes very reasonable tests. If you've taken Physics C, as I had, then you should have little trouble with this course.",
    "I have taken enough math\/math-intensive courses with terrible teachers to know that when you get a solid professor like Prof. Tipton, you thank God. He's funny and pretty good at explaining things. His biggest weakness is spending too much time doing derivations that require math far beyond what the prerequisites require that no one understands or needs to. But at least he does example problems too, which is more than I can say for some professors. Anyway, the course itself is basically Physics C Mechanics plus Special Relativity, Hydrodynamics, and Oscillatory Motion, so if you've already done Physics C, this course shouldn't be anything to worry about.",
    "Pretty solid class. Tipton is a great guy, if an uneven lecturer. Relativity ate me alive, but everything before and after I had seen in A.P. Physics C.",
    "I would recommend this for a student who is looking for a good introduction to physics with modern physics mixed in. I am a bit unusual in that I came into the course without any physics and without multivariable calculus (only single-variable). I had no difficulty with the concepts, and I thought Professor Tipton often made the course quite interesting. It was not too difficult for me, but if you come in with my level of prep or just a little more, you do need a strong mathematical mind to survive.",
    "This is a good introduction to mechanics and special relativity. However, when the lectures get difficult to understand, use the open yale course lectures.",
    "No. Take 180 or 260 instead.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course is you like physics. Professor Tipton is a great teacher, and you will learn a lot from this class. Take it if you have taken Physics B or C, or if you really like physics. This is a great class.",
    "Physics 200 is a good physics class for students who took AP physics C: mechanics in high school and did well in it. The class moves too quickly for a student with less preparation and it would be very hard to keep up. Overall, the class was pretty interesting and challenging and professor Tipton was nice. The class covers kinetics, rotational motion, relativity, and waves\/oscillations.",
    "It's a challenging course that depends on how much effort one puts into it.",
    "Decent class. Teaches you the material fine but not in a particularly interesting way and the lectures are mediocre. If you can do 260, do that.",
    "It's a pretty good class. It covers everything in AP Physics C: Mechanics and adds a few other topics--special relativity was definitely the most interesting! It was also the most difficult, but it was absolutely worth all the mind-boggling work! Professor Tipton is really nice and a pretty funny guy. He lectures off of slides, which made lecture harder to learn from than if he had used the chalkboard. But the upside of his slides is that he posts them online, and they are really very thorough--like a mini textbook--and they contain everything you need to know for the class.",
    "If having the professor read off his notes off the projector screen for the entire semester is not your thing, avoid this class. I had trouble adapting with his style of teaching and this affected my learning experience. I only survived by watching Shankar\u0092s videos which were excellent. Also, I\u0092m not too sure about the curve but for my semester about 1\/3 of the class scored 90% and above. Problem sets were not too difficult\/time consuming so workload is pretty alright. If your physics prep is good enough, take Phy 260. I loved Baltay\u0092s teaching style but found myself having to drop down because my physics foundation wasn\u0092t strong enough. That being said, Tipton\u0092s a really nice guy who is pretty helpful during office hours. However, I do have to mention his explanations can sometimes be quite convoluted.",
    "Physics 200 is recommended if you have previous physics knowledge. While most of the lectures cover the background of deriving formulas, most of the material you are tested on is how to apply and use the formulas, which requires some practice to understand.",
    "Physics 200 is an excellent continuation of a strong high school physics background and\/or a deep passion for physics. I met only the latter and struggled, but enjoyed the class nonetheless; if given the chance, I would take it again, and take advantage of tutoring earlier on. I would recommend Physics 200 with Professor Tipton, and also recommend that anyone with an interest who is worried about difficulty level should get extra help early on and stick to it, as the class material is very interesting and, when learned, very satisfying."
