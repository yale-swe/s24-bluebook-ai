    "Hands down the most difficult philosophy class that I have ever taken at Yale. I struggled with the complexity and quantity of the readings assigned each week, since I did not have a lot of the context and background needed to understand the readings.That said, I am very glad that I took the course and will probably re-read Parfit many times in the future. The class was really well-taught by some of my favorite philosophy professors. Profs Darwall and Kagan are incredibly knowledgeable, and were super helpful in discussing final paper topics.",
    "Definitely take this course if you're at all interested in Ethics, Normative Ethics, or Metaethics. If you aren't then don't.I thought the course was great.",
    "Fantastic course.",
    "Take this course! An excellent and thorough engagement with Parfit's On What Matters, and a great way to engage with some of Yale's best philosophy profs!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "It is unlikely that this course will be taught again. However, the subject matter and the teachers are all amazing and worth seeking out. I.e., ifyou see another course on Parfit, take it! He is a deep thinker whose profundity of insight is matched only by his clarity. While occasionally a little whacky and bizarre, On What Matters was a fantastic tour de force. Kagan and Darwall are both, individually, fantastic teachers. The former is very high energy, engaging and excitable, always ready to push further in some investigation with a student. The latter is incredibly patient, and while often fails to cover everything he wanted to, teaches very thoroughly. The two as a team were wonderful complements, both in their philosophical stances and pedagogical approaches.",
    "Recent Work In Ethical Theory: Derek Parfit lives up to its name. The text focused on is contemporary, though accessible, and the level of philosophical discussion is advanced. I would recommend this class if you have a background in Philosophy and particularly in Ethics. Be prepared for fast-paced discussion. It is a lot of reading, but Parfit's text is very manageable as far as Philosophy goes. It is the ideas and arguments that are complex."
