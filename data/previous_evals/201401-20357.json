   "comments": [
    "You read books that you'll sort of base your discussion on, but in reality just talk about how we should best live our lives. It's sort of pseudo-intellectual, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. Take it, of course.",
    "Definitely take it! Courses with accomplished, real-world-experienced professors are exactly what make the Global Affairs major great.",
    "Take it. You will start to question yale and your life choices and it's not particularly hard. Only 2 paper.",
    "Not sure how hard to get into this class, but if you get in it is a must take. If you're a senior as I was, this class will challenge you in so many ways, especially if your entire Yale career, like mine, was focused more on obscure fields than tackling the larger life questions.",
    "One of the most enriching classes I have taken in four years at Yale. A wonderful set of readings, class discussions were very engaging, and Professor Brooks offers a unique combination of breadth of perspective and depth of insight. Highly recommend.",
    "Famous, distinguished professor. Some of the smartest students at Yale. A reading list that is really important to finish. Not a very academic course but a very good one. Take it if you can.",
    "TAKE IT!!!",
    "Humility is an awesome class to take regardless of what you are studying. It's particularly interesting for people who want to do more thinking about religion, philosophy, theology, and ethics.",
    "My most commonly recommended class the opportunity have discussions about what matter to us and in life and how we interact with our world is invaluable. Thank you so much for the opportunity to be part of the discussion!"
