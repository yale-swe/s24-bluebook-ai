   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the course. Lecture wasn't necessary at all, but the sections were really interesting, and it wasn't necessary to read the whole book each week to keep up. I enjoyed the papers, and my TF was incredibly helpful. I feel like my writing improved a lot, and got some exposure to something interesting texts.",
    "You learn a lot about a bunch of literature you haven't read before. Overall, it was quite enjoyable.",
    "Good gut class to take as a fifth class. Little work.",
    "yes - great, straightforward class",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS! A great class for those looking for writing requirements.",
    "Overall Race and Gender was a good fifth class as a pre-med student who needed to fulfill a HU credit. The workload was reasonable and section keeps you in tough with the readings.",
    "Great lectures with some really valuable and provoking discussion; lots of reading but great and interesting materials. Writing assignments are fairly easy, but if you are really interested in the class than you can make it as much of a challenge for yourself as you would like it to be. It really all depends on how much you put into it. Section discussions will most likely not be fruitful because a lot of students taking this class generally don't care about it.",
    "Deconstruct American literature to get at the reality of it.",
    "This class was about how race is perceived and all of the books had to do with this. The books were long but most were interesting. It wasn't necessary to read or buy the books unless you had to write a paper. There weren't that many written assignments",
    "It is an extremely easy writing credit, but felt like a waste of a course.",
    "The definition of a \"gut\" class. I did not do any of the readings for this class but still managed to get an A grade with minimal effort. Not a super interesting class, so don't take unless you are looking for an easy A.",
    "Take this course!! Not too much work and great readings. If you do the readings, you can actually learn a lot and take a lot away from the class. If you don't do all of them, you can still manage to get a good grade. Lectures did not feel extremely mandatory because they were manly just summaries\/analyses of the books. The lectures definitely help you to write better essays though.",
    "Such a great class, interesting texts, and good workload.",
    "Very good course for anyone who is thinking about studying something from a different field of study from, maybe, your intended major.",
    "This course offers interesting readings and good lectures. It's pretty light in workload and not the most well organized, but I recommend it to those interested in the subject matter or looking for a good cr\/d.",
    "This class is a great class to take if you aren't majoring in anything related to this. Not a heavy course load but allows you to expand your horizon and learn about what other people are struggling with around the world. Also pretty nice Writing Credit to get out of the way",
    "Would recommend as a baseline class to introduce the subjects of Race and Gender in literature to a student who has previously had little to no exposure to such subjects.",
    "GUT",
    "Great course! Take it if you can get a spot.",
    "It is a fine course. The books are interesting to read, but the course only creates space for one particular type of viewpoint, both in lecture and in section. The entire course structure serves to affirm the lecture's stance, rather than create an opportunity for true critical engagement and dialogue about the legacies of the texts.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The readings are good and the class isn't especially hard.",
    "yes, yes, yes. But sadly Professor Rasmussen is leaving this year (which is HORRIBLE).",
    "An easy, yet still worthwhile course, where you can finish the semester being proud of the work you've accomplished, yet not agonizing over the number of hours you put in.",
    "A class where you get to read great literature and also explore other forms of literary art.",
    "Take it if they offer it.",
    "AFAM 140 is pretty similar to a high school literature class. You will write a few papers using close-reading skills and while you read many books, the work is manageable. I would recommend this course if you need a writing credit with a manageable course load or if you are particularly interested in the literature of various races.",
    "This was a great class and very important and relevant subject to discuss in and outside the classroom. The lectures were a little dry from time to time. The sections were great. Taking as a Non-WR was a nice choice too for the class. It is too bad that Professor Rasmussen will not be teaching this course in the future.",
    "It is a class focused on how to approach analysis of racial and gender themes in different texts.",
    "Great syllabus, compassionate lecturer, sad that this is the last time the class will be taught",
    "Take it if you have an interest in the topic.",
    "This class is an important way to introduce people to the basics of race and gender in American literature. Everyone should take it, and certainly not leave Yale without taking a class like this one",
    "An excellent syllabus accompanied by excellent lectures and fun and reasonable assignments. This is an amazing class because it introduces you to so many important topics thoughtfully, and in an environment that allows people of all backgrounds to engage in. The only gripe that I have with the course is the amount of slacking that the instructors let slide. It's a shame that so many people didn't go to lecture, and that so many people did not show up to section prepared. There were a lot of people taking this course just for the easy grade, and as someone wanting to genuinely engage with the material, sometimes I felt like a salmon trying to swim upstream a current of apathy.",
    "Great class for a low-stress writing credit with creative assignments",
    "Won't be offered again by the same professor, if offered at all.",
    "ERM 210 is a solid introduction to foundational pieces of literature that explore issues\/experiences related to race, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality. Although the class was disorganized this year due to a massive spike in interest in the course, the readings and scope of the discussions sections were very solid. Birgit is a phenomenal teacher and cares deeply about her students and the course material. Despite the size of her class, she was super responsive to students and was so excited to meet and discuss outside of class. She obviously is very enthusiastic about and invested in the course, the readings, and literature in general, and her excitement is infectious. At the same time, I don't think she was prepared to teach a 300 person lecture (and her class suffered for it). That being said, Yale is losing an incredible professor--and a very important class--next year.",
    "MUST TAKE CLASS. not only makes you a better writer and someone who can analyze text really well but introduces you to tough subjects of race and gender in currernt american lit that are appropriate that every student has. I wish this was a required course for freshman i found it that fruitful. It also is not very hard, but you take what you can out of the course.",
    "She's no longer teaching at Yale. Which is a shame. Really great syllabus. Though, many people treated the class like a joke. I got something out of it. Learned a bit and got some feedback on writing. Not a very rigorous course - quite easy.",
    "Absolutely take this course.",
    "Yes if you're looking for a gut.",
    "An introductory level English class that has a focus on Race & Gender issues.",
    "I personally loved the course, but I think you take out what you put in. Some students probably hated it, but I personally thought it was thoughtful and interesting. I recommend it, if you are willing to put in work to learn more.",
    "Great 5th class, really easy. Also take if you want the Wr credit. Essentially you get what you put into the class--like you do well even if you read the books or not, but they're all worth reading.",
    "This class is an easy intro class for ERM, AFAM, etc majors. You have the chance to read important POC novels and to explore the some serious topics. The workload is light, which makes it easier to explore the novels.",
    "good",
    "Solid writing credit.",
    "Take it. Gut.",
    "This class has great texts and is a fun class.",
    "AFAM 140 was an enjoyable course that exposes you to the perspective of many minorities. In particular, the intersectional experience is very valuable to learn from, and Race and Gender does a nice job of exploring it. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Broad intro in race relations in literature",
    "I would fully recommend this course. Great instruction and great texts.",
    "Good class for a fifth or sixth class. Not challenging and not necessary to do all of the readings. Helped with learning new cultural perspectives with a wide variety of literature.",
    "This is a good class and I would take it if you need a HU or WR credit. It is fairly easy as there isn't much work. We had one close analysis assignment, a midterm that was just multiple close analyses, an assignment that involved writing a 50-word thesis statement, and a final paper. There were also two extra credit opportunities; you could revise your thesis statement and post it online and also write a Declaration of Independence. Lecture is actually interesting even though most people don't go, but if you have time I would attend as you'll probably learn some interesting things about literature that you have never thought of before.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "Decent course",
    "Certainly, but with the caveat that the teaching fellow makes a huge difference. Friends who did not like the course, expressed dissatisfaction with their teaching fellows in addition to the uselessness of lectures.",
    "Yes most definitely! But unfortunately it will not be offered again.",
    "There is a lot of reading, but you don't have to do it. You can get away with not going to lecture and just attending section. Overall very low work load given that I never did anything and still did fine.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student! The material covered in class is so important and so relevant to everyday life and the class as a whole is amazing.",
    "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Take it if you want an easy WR requirement. Don't expect much more, and I would only recommend ENGL 293 to another student if you do not care about learning anything valuable regarding race and gender but if you need a quick grade booster. It was probably the best class (extremely minimal effort = good grade), but the worst in regards of the terrible curriculum and professor. Don't bother with the lectures.",
    "Race and Gender is a great class, good writing credit, and interesting way to broaden your perspective while studying American Literature. I would recommend it because it provides many unique perspectives, but be warned that not every student is respectful and tensions can be high over insignificant events at times.",
    "Would not recommend until there is a more coherent aim to the course and lectures start actually being helpful. There is so much potential for this course and the subject.",
    "Eh it was alright. It was a bit eye opening in turns of the timing of the class",
    "Take the class, if only for the exposure you get to the important works of American literature that you didn't read in high school. The course syllabus is amazing. Definitely an introductory English analysis class, thoughbe ready for basic lessons on how to close read, again and again.",
    "Fairly easy class, but is also tremendously meaningful and important. Definitely take this class if you are looking for a class that won't absolutely kill you with work, but also isn't totally meaningless. The conversations you have because of the reading list are important.",
    "Take this class! Light work load, super easy to succeed while enjoying the material.",
    "Very chill writing credit. Readings and lecture are optional. Just come to section with things to say and you'll be fine. The readings are actually pretty cool if you have time to do them. Take it if you are a STEM major looking for a easy yet non-boring WR credit.",
    "if you want an overview of the topics, take the course",
    "This class was a gut. The reading list was pretty interesting, but the lectures were not super engaging (and only 25% of the class actually came to lecture). You definitely get as much out of this class as you put into it and so the range of experiences is going to be pretty wide.",
    "It's a good course and the reading list is excellent.",
    "Lecture was fine in this course. Not exceptional, but there was clearly a huge need for the class material on campus. Section was really good. Alexia was amazing. Such a good writer and teacher, and her insight was nuanced and useful. Good assignments overall.",
    "This class was a very well-known gut, and so 700+ kids tried to take it this semester. About 300 actually managed to secure a section and get a spot in the class. I hear that fewer than 50 kids showed up to lecture, because it was completely unnecessary. The assignments were really easy and graded very easily, and we even got two simple extra credit opportunities. Anyway, Birgit didnt get tenure and is leaving Yale, so this class will probably never be offered again.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, no matter which major they are a part of, in order to gain a deeper understanding of some major literary works pertaining to the very interesting (and prominent) topics of race and gender and issues regarding these topics in the past and present.",
    "Race and Gender in American Lit is a great course with a great reading list. Professor Rasmussen is an engaging lecturer.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student interested in reading the books on the syllabus. You should be committed to the material if you want to take it.",
    "Great class, must take, very interesting",
    "This course has interesting topics and a low work load.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Easy WR credit. Don't end up learning a lot about race and gender because the course is so focused on the literature. Books are great, if you have time to read them. Nice break for STEM majors. Good source of feedback on writing and papers. Workload depends on how much you want to read.",
    "Definitely. Only with Professor Rasmussen though.",
    "It is a class to critically evaluate and interpret readings of American history. I already have introduced it to other students.",
    "It was a good class. Lecture seemed kind of optional. It wasn't really needed to write the papers.",
    "A reasonably easy course, which is interesting to most people, and relevant to day to day life. The workload wasn't too high. A good course for somebody who isn't an English major.",
    "AFAM 140 is a gut class with a light workload.",
    "Interesting class with great reading list.",
    "Take it if you want a broader perspective on literature!",
    "Overall good class with not too much work.",
    "A course that no longer exists (at least with Birgit), so if you're reading this, either the course is back or you're taking a stroll down memory lane. It's hard to pull off an English course in a lecture setting, and even with a section, this did not work well. Lectures were useless and sections were disjointed conversations between people who knew just enough about the book to make sense. Just not a good course in a lecture setting. Birgit would work wonderfully in a seminar setting with highly interested students who were engaged with the material, like she clearly was. Unfortunately, too many people enrolled in the course for her to manage, and it went downhill. Low workload, though, which is why 90% of people who were in the class took it. I did not take the course for a writing course, and I had to write a 2 page close reading of a passage, 4 page paper (two close readings), a 50 word sentence, and a 5-7 page final paper.",
    "This is a good class that focus a lot on close analysis. For the writing sections, there are 2 8-10 papers during the course of the class as well as 2 small assignments, which isn't a very heavy workload but still takes up a fair bit of time. The lectures are engaging, and its a good class to take for a WR credit.",
    "Definitely would recommend for everyone of any major!",
    "Yes I would, great class, learned a lot.",
    "Great class and a fun way to get an english credit since the assignments are different and fun.",
    "I would summarize this course as an introduction into literary analysis through the lenses of race and gender. Unfortunately, it will not be offered anymore as Professor R is leaving, but if she wasn't, I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to every single student I knew. It's entirely too easy to go through your entire Yale education only reading and learning about a Eurocentric worldview, and classes like these add other perspectives and allow people to branch out and learn about the real world - which is a diverse place. Please add more classes like Professor Rasmussen's.",
    "Although the material - the ideas and the texts themselves - were certainly really interesting and worth studying, I don't think the class presented them well at all. I understand Professor Rasmussen's desire to make the class accessible by avoiding the typical \"reading from notes\" lecture, but I think that lectures lost coherency as a result. Also, I appreciate that Professor Rasmussen wanted not to go too deep and intimidate less well prepared students, but her readings of the texts weren't particularly insightful as a result - we spent a lot of time talking about context and background rather than gaining insight into authors' works.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow students since it has a relatively low workload and is a course that you can learn a lot from."
