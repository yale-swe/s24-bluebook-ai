    "Take it. I was skeptical in the beginning, and writing the essays was sometimes painful, but in the end I'm so glad I took it with Ehrgood. He's a very charming, funny and engaging professor, and he cares deeply about each one of us. Ehrgood's syllabus is different from those of other professors. We only had 5 essays instead of 6, and the revisions were \"optional\" for the last two or three. That eased the workload (I was grateful because I already had a busy schedule). Though I wish I could have spent more time on the last few essays, I learned a lot from Ehrgood's thoughtful and detailed comments. This course made me think more not only about how I write, but also about life in general.",
    "English 120 is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale -- and this is coming from a person who dreaded having to take a WR requirement. Professor Ehrgood was absolutely amazing. I was so impressed with his ability to actually teach writing, and by how much I could learn in a little over an hour. Take this course with Professor Ehrgood if you can!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. I got a much better, different perspective on writing than I was used to before, in a much more rigorous way. In this class I learned that writing is very tough when done right. You write five fairly creative, artistic essays, that will be critiqued both for their style as well as their logic. The days of BSing essays will be put well behind you.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, this is an excellent class to take, whether you're an English major, just interested in English, or you're getting rid of a writing credit. (I'm the third, although a touch of the second.) It's kind of like taking the step beyond college essays, and I found it to be a really big step. I think I put in a considerable amount of effort into the class, but you get out of it what you put in, and I feel like I got a lot out of it.",
    "This class lives up to its reputation, as does Ehrgood. If you get in, take it.",
    "Yes, do it.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 120 with Professor Ehrgood. Before taking this class, I had really high expectations, as I had heard that he is the best instructor. After completing the course, I must say I confirm this. I felt that I learned a lot about writing prose in English, in genres that I had never written before. There was a lot of work to be done, but with Professor Ehrgood's class I discovered literary and writing skills I have had but wasn't aware of; I developed new skills which the professor was happy to see and point out to me: and I further polished skills I have had for years. I feel like I have undergone a process of transformation through this class. Having taken it in junior year, I was glad to see that classes can still \"surprise and delight\" me in many ways - just like your writing, as Ehrgood will teach you in his section!",
    "Over the semester, you will read and discuss a wide variety of essays by renowned writers, and having studied \"the best,\" you will write 5 types of essays, by first submitting a draft and then a revision. One of your pieces will be workshopped in class. I highly recommend ENGL 120: the essays are amazing to read, and you will learn so, so much. Given the chance, take it with Professor Ehrgood, because he will just brighten your life.",
    "A great class for improving your writing skills.",
    "I would recommend English 120. Make sure you get in a good section though! Ehrgood's is one of the best. This course will definitely help your writing skills in an area that not many students have worked with: creative nonfiction. You should feel comfortable in your writing skills when you sign up though."
