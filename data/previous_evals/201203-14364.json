    "I loved this class! Professor Cleary is here as a guest lecturer, but if he ever comes back, take his course! He is amazing and knows so much and is also just a wonderful teacher. It is a lot of reading that you need to keep up on in order to get anything out of the class, but it is still a mangeable amount of reading and well worth it.",
    "DEFINITELY take this course to fulfill the Junior Seminar requirement if: (1) you like Irish literature (2) you like American literature (3) you've always wanted to read Ulysses in a course or (4) you enjoy different forms of literature (essays, plays, novels).",
    "Very interesting, work heavy English seminar. You should be a quick reader.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!I literally cannot praise Professor Cleary highly enough. Taking a class with him was an absolute pleasure.He has been teaching Ulysses for 15 years, and his experience shows. That said, he brought a similar level of expertise to everything we read, from Tocqueville and Matthew Arnold to Yeats, Eugene O'Neill and Fitzgerald. This reading list was actually the best ever and Cleary was dedicated to ensuring that we understood these difficult modernist authors.Similarly, the class discussions were both engaging, enjoyable and educational. People actually interacted with each other, rather than just talking to hear themselves. It was a pleasure to bounce ideas around within that class room.While initially I was unsure about the connection between Irish and Irish American Modernist writers, they all were clearly engaged in similar types of discussions; I definitely would not have noticed the similarities - which really are there! - between Ulysses and The Great Gatsby if it weren't for this course.Every part of this class was just amazing; I guarantee you will regret it if you don't take it.",
    "If you're interested in modernism or in the development of national literatures, and you're willing to do quite a bit of reading, this class will be a very rewarding experience for you. It has an excellent syllabus--mostly Yeats poems and Ulysses, with plays by Beckett and O'Neill. And Cleary is very smart and very thoughtful, gives very thorough comments on your work, is very generous with his time, knows the Irish stuff better than anyone in the department, especially since Pericles Lewis is gone. Again, though, lots of reading--all of Ulysses in five classes!--and Cleary tends to spend half of every class lecturing (he's always really interesting, but still that might not be something you enjoy), and he isn't the greatest at getting discussion going.",
    "The syllabus in this course is fantastic (though it can be difficult to cover Ulysses in four or five weeks during the middle of the semester), and Professor Clearly is a patient and kind professor willing to provide his students any help they may require.",
    "This is a great course which I would highly recommend. Professor cleary genuinely understands, listens to and appreciates his students. He is also an extremely clear speaker - his short lectures in section are extremely lucid, organized and illuminating. You will never doubt or fail to understand him and always feel that you are in good hands. so if you have any interest in the subject matter absolutely take the course. One more note - when I was shopping this course I noticed that some students of previous years complained on ocs that prof clearys seminars were too lecture heavy. If that was ever a problem with professor clearly's classes then it has definitelybeen fixed - there is plenty of opportunity for discussion and a good balance between student discussion and short lectures by the professor. Overall, I would highly recommend the course."
