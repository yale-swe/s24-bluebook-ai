    "This is a MUST-TAKE COURSE. Yeazell is fabulous and the reading list is amazing. The seminar participants were incredibly intelligent and we had some of the most stimulating discussions of my Yale career. A lot of reading though!",
    "This was absolutely my favorite course this semester! Wonderful books, wonderful discussion, and a professor who moderated and enhanced discussion with prowess. The course addresses the ways that minds are portrayed in the novel through various (amazing) authors. You read Austen, Eliot, James, Woolf as well as some pretty interesting secondary sources. If those novelists sound fun to you, take the class! The papers (two 10-12 pagers) were very challenging but rewarding and required you to use secondary sources. The course was a lot of reading, but the books were great which made it manageable. Also Professor Yeazell is AWESOME. Definitely take the class if you get in!",
    "This class has a very, very narrow focus, so if you are not specifically interested in these types of novels or the representation of consciousness on paper, don't take it. If these are things that interest you, however, you MUST take it. You will love the readings and the discussions, and the papers will be wonderful opportunities to talk about what interests you.",
    "Amazing seminar! A short writing assignment, two 10-12 page papers, and a fair amount of reading but all of the works are fantastic, and Professor Yeazell leads great discussions. I highly recommend it.",
    "Take it IF you're interested in the reading list. A ton of work and it's not graded easily, but really rewarding.",
    "A really excellent course. A lot of reading but if you do it the discussion is fascinating. Prof Yeazell is a god. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This course is great, though be aware that examining some of the great works of literature through the lens of consciousness is much, much more difficult than it might sound. If you're up for a challenge and you have the time to devote to the works, though, take this course! Professor Yeazell is amazing and it is an honor to learn from her.",
    "This is a great course with a fabulous reading list and an incredible professor. You will learn to read novels through a different lens--by thinking about how minds work and interact in the text you are reading. You will also be introduced to some literary criticism that will be helpful to you in both discussing and writing about these texts. I loved this class because it introduced me to a whole new way of reading novels that I know I will bring with me to all thebooks I read in the future. Professor Yeazell is terrific. She conducts seminar with a good balance of her direction and students commentary. She is extremely approachable and offers insightful comments on papers. There is a lot of reading in this course but it really pays to do all of it and it is all a lot of fun!",
    "Professor Yeazell is challenging but incredibly knowledgeable. She is a tough grader and certainly holds her students to a higher standard. The reading for the class is heavily--another important concept to keep in mind when choosing classes. Nevertheless, students can learn a lot from the class.",
    "This is one of the best English classes. There are few English classes at Yale that really take up a field of critical literature and introduce you to that along with the primary texts. Yeazell's class does this brilliantly. You will learn a new way of thinking about literature through the lens of careful attention to the minds of narrators and characters. This is invaluable. The syllabus is well-constructed to give you a view of the important books in the field as well as the major schools of criticism about them. Be aware that there is a LOT of reading, though Professor Yeazell would select key passages before class to narrow discussion (and to give you something to focus on if you can't QUITE finish all the reading). She really doesn't impose herself too much on discussion, but guides it very well. There were a lot of applicants for the class, and she selected a great, smart group ofstudents."
