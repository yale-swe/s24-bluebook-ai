    "Not the best class. In fact, very, very bad. I'm sure that Prof. Pfefferle is a nice person, but she's low on energy, low on organization, low on clarity, and has lectured from the same shoddy lecture packets since who knows when. Disappointing, but you'll take it and you'll be fine. Problem sets, at least, are relatively enjoyable, and DJ (the TF) is a gem, so hopefully he's still around.",
    "The class is really only for those in the major who should be interested in learning the material presented. I believe there is a lot that could make the class better, but I do feel as though I learned a lot from the class.",
    "This class is by far the worst class I've taken at Yale, owing entirely to Professor Pfefferle's disorganized and incoherent teaching style. The material itself has the potential to be interesting and useful, given that kinetics is at the core of Chemical Engineering, but class itself is excruciatingly boring and useless. Fortunately, the textbook has all the qualities that are lacking in Professor Pfefferle's teaching: namely, organization, conciseness, and accessibility. Other pluses: the exams are reasonable (basically rehashed versions of the practice exams) and the problem sets are interesting and thought-provoking.",
    "You obviously have to take this if you are a ChemEng major, but I hope for your sake they change the curriculum\/professor.",
    "Bad. So bad. Very bad. Awful. Horrible. If I were an English major I would have more adjectives, but I'm not. I can, however, teach you about catalysts and about temperature dependence and how not to trust sources on the web. I learned most of this despite the teachings of Professor Pfefferle. The xeroxes of the xeroxes from the previous year were my favorite part. If you're looking at this class, chances are you have to take it. You can count on the \"quizzes\" being reasonable at least. Good luck, at least the material is interesting enough that you can probably motivate yourself to learn it on your own.",
    "This course is awful, definitely the worst one I\u2019ve had at Yale. Not worth changing your major because it\u2019s not too challenging and you\u2019ll get through it. Tips: Use the book. It\u2019s really good, and example problems are helpful for homeworks. Use your TA. Memorize the answers to practice exams!!! Many test questions are verbatim from the practice exams. And they\u2019re repeated verbatim on later exams. Lol. Write out definitions for relevant terms and email them to her to ask her if you wrote the specific wording that she\u2019s looking for, because you\u2019re only right if you happen to include the two-word phrase that she wants. More info: This course was terrible. Worst course at Yale. And it\u2019s infamous \u2013 it\u2019s been terrible for more than three years. Please change something! It\u2019s required, and students change their majors out of ChemE because of courses like this one! There\u2019s a running joke across classes that Prof. Pfefferle re-copies the packets each year from the copies and they become increasing hard to read. Here are the problems with the course (professor specific ones included here and in the professor section \u2013 I\u2019m hoping that someone will notice this is it\u2019s in both sections): 1) There is no grade distribution given \u2013 how much is homework worth? How much are exams worth? Grading is totally opaque, which is very abnormal in Yale courses and most students and professors agree that it\u2019s bad. 2) Students have no idea when exams will be until about a week before (or even how many there will be!), and there\u2019s no way to know when homework will be given. Basic college syllabus, please? 3) Homeworks often have nothing to do with what we were taught in class. It\u2019s find if there were no example problems given in class, but it is completely unreasonable to ask students to write computer programs if we haven\u2019t learned the programming (which we haven\u2019t even if we\u2019ve taken the engineering computer science course). It would be nice if we went through at least one example problem, but at the minimum we should talk about the theory behind solving specific problems before they are assigned as homework. 4) The packets are ridiculous. They have some good information, but they don\u2019t need to be 10 works per page in huge font, handwritten, and often containing conflicting information from the book. Pfefferle can use them as her own notes, but pointing to a tiny thing on the packet when she\u2019s up at the front of the room is silly. Please stop using the packets. Maybe post them online, but taking notes, the conventional way of learning, and using the book is a much better way to learn. 5) The lecture style doesn\u2019t feel like a class. Pfefferle would be a good guest lecturer for a specific industry thing, perhaps, but the course material is not taught in an organized way (it would be so much easier if the material in the book were taught, or simply if the material covered were presented in a more organized way). Actually, very little is explained. She often puts things on the board without the very important derivations. We never derived how to find the design equations for different reactor types! This is so fundamental to kinetics and reactors and chemical engineering\u2026we did it with Prof. Kim in Water Quality Control. Can he teach this course? 6) Exams\u2026they basically mimicked practice exams, but they sought very specific answers that were not necessarily more correct than other answers, and that were often descriptive or only tangential to the material, and also repetitive. So, we all just memorized the answers that she wanted for the practice exams without really understanding them or learning anything else in the course and spit out the answers on the tests. And we still sometimes got them wrong because she was looking for very specific things that she may have never mentioned before, and because we never got to learn the material the way we would like."
