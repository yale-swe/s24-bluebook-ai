   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course strongly, without reservation. Students in this class range from hardcore Astrophysics majors to other science majors or people with a basic knowledge of physicswho are simply interested in learning about the hottest topics in astrophysics. The course presented cutting-edge research on exoplanets (SO EPIC), black holes, and cosmology. Several guest speakers were brought in to present specialized presentations about their particular research, which was pretty cool. The homework doesn't take too long and the three midterms were pretty manageable. Nothing in the course requires any sort of tricky math, although the density of qualitative arguments increases towards the end of the semester. Prof. Nagai is wonderful, completely engaged, energetic, and helpful. In short, take it!",
    "It's definitely worth taking. The material was really interesting because its so new, especially for the last 2\/3 of the class. I would make sure you feel confident in calc and physics, I only had high school ap classes for background and it was a bit hard to keep up sometimes.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in astrophysics. It is a great class for those looking to step up from the intro astro courses",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. It was not that interesting and it was not well structured.",
    "Physics 343 was a great, low-stress course. We covered a lot of interesting material at a fairly fast pace. The course is very easy. There were only about 7 or 8 problem sets and 3 short exams for the entire course, and the problem sets only took a couple hours each. The exams were also pretty much straightforward applications of concepts covered thoroughly in class, and you should have no problem acing them if you pay attention. Overall, Physics 343 is a great course, especially if you are a physics major and you need an easy elective. Don't go into the course expecting a whole lot of rigor and you won't be disappointed.",
    "A fun, easy survey course on current research in exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology. Don't take it if you're looking for an in depth, quantitative treatment of the material, but it can be a fun, easy fifth class as a physics major.",
    "Yes, the materials at the beginning are very easy, but things get harder later on. Sometimes the concepts don't quite connect to each other in smooth transitions. The instructor is very helpful and nice, and so is the TA.",
    "Take it!It's low stress and meant to be something to be enjoyed. Especially if you're also taking some of those more intense physics classes it's good to see stuff that isn't presented quite as intimidating. And everyone in that class takes it because they want to, which is much different from some of the larger lectures.",
    "Take it! These are some of the most interesting topics in physics. Not too much work- three in class exams and several problem sets with no final. A great, non-stressful class where you'll actually end up learning a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course. However this is pretty demanding as far as math is concerned. the material is interesting and fun.",
    "This class is awesome!! If you've taken physics 200 or 260, astro 343 will be no problem workwise. I spent ~3 hours a week on problem sets, but I learned a ton. Professor Nagai is always enthusiastic, clear, and fun - he's great at getting the big picture across without getting lost in the mathematical details. The course is divided into three sections: exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology, with increasing levels of difficulty. One word of warning to astro majors: try to take this class sophomore year, by junior year you will have already seen a lot of the material.",
    "Take this class, even if you're a non-major. The material is interesting, and Prof. Nagai is pretty good. One thing to watch out for is the psets can be completely unrelated to the lecture, but Prof. Nagai was flexible about moving deadlines when the class got lost.",
    "I enjoyed this course and found the material very interesting. However, I would've liked to see the material contextualized a bit better (I felt that sometimes topics and equations were just presented without truly explaining their significance or relationship). The later tests were quite difficult.",
    "I would recommend it, but with the warning that the second two sections of the course are a lot harder than the first, and that the exams are tricky to prepare for. It isn't too much work, a problem set and maybe some articles to read per week, three exams, and a presentation. The presentation is fun because you get to really research a topic, and Professor Nagai definitely will guide you through the process. Also Professor Nagai is a great lecturer. I don't know if Camille will be the TA for this class again, but she was one of the best things about the course.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The material that we study is up and coming in the field of astrophysics. While we were in the class, new discoveries were being made every day! It was really exciting to feel like I was studying something so current and important to the field. At the same time, the problem sets were very, very difficult in this class which was made worse by the fact that we had no primary text to fall back on, only lectures. If you are proactive and meet with the TA during office hours and work in a group, they are doable, but this class gets much harder as the semester progresses. The first test was very easy and then it just got harder and harder for the next two sections. I loved this course, but it ended up being much more difficult than I previously thought.",
    "Even if you are not an astro major I still recommend this course",
    "If you're not a science major with a strong mathematics background, the latter two sections (black holes + cosmology) might be a challenge. What did make the class worth it was not having a final exam."
