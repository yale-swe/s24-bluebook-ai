    "This class explores fascinating music, mindblowing architecture, and connects the two in a web of ways that even demonstrates the myriad social implications of the art. Professor Veal is a truly unique thinker and challenged me in ways I never imagined. A must take even if you have no experience in music or architecture. The class is entirely discussion based and doesn't have very much work.",
    "In this seminar, we explored the discourse of digital architecture in our to discuss jazz at a time when traditional musical terminology was not applicable. Most of our discussion was from an artistic standpoint, but we also discussed social implications, which really grounded the material and made it far more valuable. I would recommend it, especially if one is familiar with jazz, but even if they are not.",
    "Jazz and Architecture is a class that explores the histories of both disciplines as well as painting, dance, and sonic spatially and uses these tools to explore and explain the extremely complex improvisational jazz of the 1960s and beyond. Concepts in digital architecture proved to be most useful. This class is not simply an exercise in navel gazing. It is a strong root (as does the music) in sociopolitical implications. I recommend this course to anyone who will listen."
