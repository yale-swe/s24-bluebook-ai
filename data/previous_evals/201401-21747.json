    "Excellent class, organized, learned A LOT about digital photography. Loved the emphasis on artists and looking at art as opposed to just technical work on Photoshop, etc. The balance was great. Ka-Man is stellar and the course had a large workload but only towards the end felt like a burden; the shoots were fun and educational. First art class at Yale and best class I've taken in four years.",
    "I highly recommend taking this class! If you are willing to put in time for this class, this is guaranteed to be a fun, meaningful, and fruitful class.",
    "Definitely take this class. Be aware that it is a lot of work and you will be asked to do a lot with this class. However, it is definitely worth it!",
    "Definitely worth taking, but bear in mind that it's a lot of work if you really want to learn from the class",
    "Digital Photography is not for the faint-hearted, and definitely not for those who are not able to put in the time and effort that this class demands. You learn a lot about photography in this class, from the history of photography, to formal elements of photography, and also a lot of technical skills along the way. It is a class that definitely rewards you for the amount of time you invest into it. The more work you make, the more there will be to talk about in class or during critiques. One of the pleasant surprises that I got from Digital Photography was how the class began to develop a sense of community. From the amount of time we spent together making photographs and in critique, the class developed this good-natured camaraderie that allowed us to be more open with each other and learn from one another. While Ka-Man and Evan did an amazing job teaching the class, I felt that I learnt just as much from other students in the class.",
    "This is a great class to learn photography, if you are ready to work semi-hard. To get an A, you will need to put an enormous amount of work into the class. I recommend starting out Cr\/D\/F and then switching over after the midterm.",
    "This class is a very in-depth approach to the technical, historical, and artistic aspects of digital photography. Do not take this class if you're looking for an easy course-- there is a lot of work involved! Take it if you're interested in putting in a large amount of time and effort to learn a useful skill and produce some beautiful art. I recommend taking the class Cr\/D, which will take some of the pressure off and encourage you to take more risks. The class is structured in a way that slowly builds a variety of digital photography skills, from exposing photos properly, to editing in photoshop and properly printing in different sizes. You receive feedback on your work both from the professor, and from your fellow classmates during in-class editing, and several longer art critiques throughout the semester. It is a lot of fun and the atmosphere is very creative and collaborative; even for those of us with little art background and no digital photography knowledge. This is a class that will definitely stick with you and serve you later in life!",
    "It is a lot of work, but ultimately it is rewarding."
