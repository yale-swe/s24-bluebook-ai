   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weakness: Unnecessary pressure to \"be perfect\". Lab reports were cumbersome for no real reason. Take a hint from Physics Lab Dr. G. That is how a lab course should be run.",
    "The course does teach you laboratory techniques very well. However, the strictness with regards to formatting lab reports and datasheets detracts from the process of learning to write successful lab reports.",
    "The labs are extremely long, and the lab reports take a good amount of time. Some of the TAs are clearly better than others, which can really make or break the course. Some TAs grade the quizzes and lab reports much stricter and are less accommodating during the actual lab, definitely detracting from the experience. The prelab lectures help prepare for the experiment at hand, so it is important to listen to everything Dr. G talks about. Everyone tends to work with the same lab partners even upon request to switch.",
    "The beginning part of the lab where Dr. G explains how to do it and the quizzes are very helpful. Sometimes the report pages are graded a little bit too harshly though in terms of organization, wrong heading, etc.",
    "The last half of the course is very, very repetitive. Exposure to techniques beyond simple volumetric analysis would be an improvement.",
    "Strengths: challenging material Weaknesses: not all TAs all well trained, unequal grading, disorganized rubrics, delayed feedback, workload greater than actual chemistry course, length and duration of the lab, outdated experimental procedures",
    "This is a great lab course- Dr. Ganapathi explains the chemistry behind experiments in a pre-lab lecture, and then we carry out the experiment following the instructions in the lab manual and under the guidance of the TAs. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
    "As previously stated, this course provided introductory knowledge and laboratory techniques crucial to all scientists who will encounter harder lab classes in the future. That being said, the experiments themselves were at times quite tedious, and therefore not always very interesting. In order to improve this, I suggest creating a few more experiments that are slightly more challenging in order to help students expand their laboratory knowledge.",
    "The structure of this class was very straightforward and very routine, a plus in my book when considering scheduling and weekly routines. Lab reports were always due one week after the experiment had been completed, there were pre-lab quizzes every week, etc. We could plan on the same thing every week which was nice - there were no surprises.",
    "I would say the weakness is that it is sometimes very unclear of what needs to be turned in on the data sheets, as well as what is considered neat. I would also say another weakness is how the time given in lab is short for some labs. The strengths in the class are that the material learned is valuable, as well as how to be very meticulous with data.",
    "This course is very detailed oriented, and this can feel very stressful. Lab often felt long and exhausting, but also accomplishing.",
    "The strengths are that you know what to expect each week, the weaknesses is the amount of work that has to be completed, especially when the class if only half a credit.",
    "The strengths of this class were that students were exposed to a laboratory environment. The weaknesses are numerous, but I think the most critical is the bland and repetitive curriculum.",
    "I actually enjoyed the rigor of the course considering this was my most challenging class (Chemistry and the Lab with it). I think having more help with the first and second lab reports would be helpful but other than that was structured well.",
    "The grading on the data sheets was stupid and picky. This class made me hate chemistry.",
    "The labs were not that difficult and the grading on the lab reports was pretty lax. Lab reports were lengthy but not impossibly difficult. The class had pretty strict guidelines for procedures and results.",
    "TA level should be more consistent, professor should be more accessible and responsive.",
    "A strength of this course is that the TAs are always present and ready to help so that we understand what we are doing in lab. I think that the length of some experiments, combined with the sometimes tedious measurements being made sometimes led to it being difficult to focus or understand the concepts behind the experiment, especially as it got closer to 5pm.",
    "The stregnth is that you learn many important skills. The weakness is that four hours is very long and it can be quite boring.",
    "The strengths of this course are the TAs that help support you and give advice. The major weakness of this course was the lack of information and definitive structure to the course, especially during the first few weeks of lab. What students needed to do for the data sheets was not clearly explained until after a few weeks into the course.",
    "It is very difficult to get help outside of the lab before each lab report is due, so if you don't understand a concept it is hard to write a comprehensive lab report.",
    "Strengths: Allowing students to get hands-on experience with experimental techniques. Weaknesses: Too much emphasis on things like neatness during data collection. Time pressure was very high during some labs. Improvements: Labs that are designed to be done a bit faster so there is less time pressure. Grading that is more focused on an understanding of chemistry rather than factors like neatness.",
    "Some aspects of the course seemed unnecessarily focused or weighted unevenly--for example, while special attention to significant figures was important, it seemed weighted too highly on quizzes and lab assignments. Otherwise, the course was very helpful in encouraging meticulous lab practice and following protocol.",
    "This course was strong because the Teaching Fellows were great and very helpful. The class could be unnecessarily frustrating though as it sometimes felt the TA's were grading unequally. The length of the lab reports were intimidating but manageable.",
    "Your success in the class largely depended on the TA you had and how strict they were. Some guided their students through each lab report, and some did not do anything.I think this is a big problem that creates a lot of unfairness between students.",
    "Generally the course was quite structured and I knew what to expect every lab day. However, the experience does depend on the TA that leads the lab section. Some TA's are more involved and take time to explain each part in detail while others hover and answer any questions the students may ask. I think this inconsistency is probably one of the weaknesses that could be improved. Perhaps this could be remedied with a survey at the beginning of the course that assigns TA's to students would prefer a specific type of teaching style.",
    "This course covers important basic laboratory skills and provides a good foundation for later labwork. That being said, it is not that engaging, especially considering how long the lab is. The labs we do are somewhat interesting but not fascinating, and it sometimes feels like the labwork we do is arbitrary and not that relevant. While this may not be true, perhaps choosing labs that tie more closely to real labwork or explaining how such work is relevant could help students feel more engaged.",
    "This course overall is just bad. It is focused on all of the wrong things.",
    "Get rid of the quizzes! I never really learn from them and they make class much more stressful than necessary! Other than that I think the class is awesome.",
    "The course could be more hands-on with teaching basic lab skills. Many students carry out the motions but were never really shown proper techniques. I knew them only from doing research in private labs.",
    "The course is good at fostering connections among the students and engage interest in scientific experimentation. Course was weak in teaching new material and in giving fair grading. Performance depends a lot on the lecture and the TA one is randomly assigned to. Should strive to have more fair, equal grading among all students.",
    "I liked how we had a lot of independence in the course. I didn't like the pre-lab quizzes because I didn't know how to study for them.",
    "While occasionally inconvenient to attend, this course was great for exposure to new lab techniques and methods of scientific inquiry. The lab course often assumed a baseline level of knowledge that was unrealistic given that it is attached to an INTRODUCTORY chemistry course, and the pre-lab lectures were not always sufficient explanation to correctly answer the quiz questions. In the future, perhaps Dr. G could reorder some of the experiments, because we were asked to experimetn with and were tested on difficult concepts such as light waves and Rydberg's equation in the lab course before even having a cursory overview of the topics in the Chemistry lecture course. As a student with a very limited STEM background, I found this to be a challenge.",
    "The good thing about this course is that there are teaching fellows in the labs to help you when you encounter an issue. The negative thing is that a lot of your knowledge about the experiment you are to perform depends on the knowledge and preparedness of the teaching fellow you are assigned.",
    "Great TAs. Good logistical structure.",
    "I really appreciated the structure of the course with the pre-lab lecture and then going into lab. I also liked that the pre lab packets had all the pertinent information to understanding the experiment and I found that working through the lab reports solidified my understandings of the experiments. The only weakness of the course I thought was how students got points counted off for forgetting to write their TA's name or neatness but that is just a matter of grading and not so much how the course was as a whole.",
    "Strengths: Improved my lab skills. Weaknesses: Lab reports were a drag sometimes.",
    "Strengths developed good lab procedure in terms of safety (goggles, coats, long sleeves, etc) Weaknesses lasted 4 hours and was not that engaging for those 4 hours.",
    "Providing more information to help students study for the quizzes",
    "The class labs were interesting and useful. However, a few were unnecessarily long and tedious.",
    "The pre-lab lectures by Dr. G were helpful in understanding the labs. Overall, I was able to learn basic lab skills such as pipetting and titrations. However, feedback often lagged behind lab report submissions, so I would often lose points for the same inattention to detail for the next two lab reports or so.",
    "Strengths: The course was very rigorous and placed a lot of value on careful technique, detail-oriented observations, neatness in keeping notebooks, and familiarity with lab safety and experimental procedures. Weaknesses: We learned a lot of skills, but for some of them (such as titration), I didn't feel like I had enough time to practice in order for the technique to become fluid. I would have liked to have additional opportunities to be in the lab, perhaps the equivalent of \"review sessions,\" in order to get more practice for these skills.",
    "A strength is the content since it's very useful, but a weakness is the amount of time you have to put into the labs since the syllabus even said we shouldn't be spending as much time on the course since it's only half a credit.",
    "This course was generally useful for learning lab skills, but it really limited the skills to basic pipetting and titrations. Additionally, the lab reports were overly tedious and points were docked for insignificant reasons.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in preparing students for various laboratory courses by teaching them the basic skills needed to do work in a laboratory. The grading is based on mostly factors like neatness in handwriting, following instructions, repeating what is demonstrating, and listening to Dr. G or the TAs. The course could be improved by standardizing the expectations of the various TAs, as I had wildly different experiences working with three different TAs.",
    "Strengths of this course include very helpful TA's and Dr. Ganapathi was also very helpful. On the other hand, I think that the pre-lab lectures were not necessarily helpful. I think that they could be more clear and concise.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is that it creates a sense of comfort within the lab by the end. A weakness is that many people say that the lab reports and lab itself take too much time out of their schedules.",
    "The strengths are that the lab manual and files on canvas provide a great deal of resources to understand the material and techniques needed in lab. The weaknesses are that the lab reports are sometimes tedious and take many hours.",
    "The strength of this course is that it fairly complements the chem lecture. The lab itself should be clearer and easier to understand. The weakness of this course is the grading. Some lab TA's are easy to grade and hand out extra credit, and some TA's are too harsh and grade very hard. So If there is a way to equalize and or standardize the grading of the TA's, it would ensure that future students are treated fairly.",
    "This course was rather tedious. There was a LOT of homework and things to complete on lab reports that were not discussed during the lab. However, the pre-lab lectures were helpful for key concepts, and then carrying out experiments that pertained to the content helped to reinforce learning. I just wish that the lab reports were not so long\/challenging and were more in line with what procedures we did in class. It would have been helpful if the TA could have just explained things a tad more.",
    "The greatest area for improvement in the course was the great disparity in the degree to which TAs were helping students. Some graded in a nicer way, or sent emails to their groups with information to help them write stronger lab reports, while others were completely hands off.",
    "Strengths: work in lab was mostly useful, definitely helped me to grasp concepts in chemistry and supplemented my learning in the class Weaknesses: lab reports were unnecessarily long and tedious, lots of busywork.",
    "The procedure was very well explained in the intro part of the class. The lab reports were sometimes unnecessarily time consuming and difficult. It would help if some of the graphing procedures were explained at the start.",
    "The strengths of this course were the good overview of general lab skills and the straight forward nature of the lab reports. Some of the weaknesses include that sometimes components for lab data sheets were unclear (ex. only a single line through mistakes, tables required, etc.) and resulted in loss of points.",
    "The final exam is not a reliable measure of the skills developed during the semester and can seriously affect your grade, either positively or negatively.",
    "Strengths: The course, generally, is a good introduction to laboratory sciences at Yale. It teaches the skill that will undoubtedly be useful in my future scientific studies. Weaknesses: Generally, the course-work is very stressful and time-restrictive, and the contact time as well as the length of the lab reports certainly warrant a full credit course.",
    "Absolutely terrible in all ways.",
    "The course was very good at teaching us how to use equipment like burets and pipets.",
    "While I did improve in my lab techniques, this class was very hard. The labs took a long time, the reports were unnecessarily difficult, and instructions were unclear. The reports had vague questions, my TA had trouble explaining the labs, and the prelab lectures were often drawn out and unhelpful. The standards on data sheets, quizzes, and reports were unclear, and everyone always felt confused.",
    "The course was strong in that since we physically did everything it was difficult not to learn. It was weak in that some of the lab reports felt like busy work.",
    "A strength of the course is that each lab focuses on different areas and skills that are important to learn for future lab work. The manual also is very detailed and explained the procedures very clearly. A possible weakness of the course is that the labs and reports towards the beginning of the course were much more rigorous than those towards the end of the course and it made for a somewhat disproportionate workload.",
    "The nature of the class was relatively punitive, and the environment of the lab was stressful, which is not good for laboratories. A slightly less intense environment would be much appreciated.",
    "The course grade was weighted on weekly quizzes rather than lab reports and data sheets which doesn't seem to be the best way to evaluate performance in a chemistry lab.",
    "A strength of the course was the organization. The course packet had all course material laid out in a neat, logical way. However, many of the procedures\/ labs techniques felt repetitive and I think we could have covered more basic lab techniques over the course.",
    "My weaknesses were the quizzes and strengths the lab reports.",
    "Doesn't really teach you anything",
    "This class is far more work than a half credit seems to be worth, and it's mostly just very tedious work. I'm reasonably confident that the lab reports could be shortened a little bit to make the workload more reasonable, and also that some of the labs themselves could be shortened. In one, nearly half an hour was spent watching a reaction with many different colors, which is cool to look at, but doesn't actually further your understanding of any aspect of chemistry and ultimately just filled that week's 4 hour timeslot instead of contributing meaningfully to learning.",
    "efficient, clear expectations, well run. TAs are not as uniformly experienced as one would expect.",
    "The lecture-followed-by-quiz system is not the best because you can't really study for it in advance. Overall, the course is strong.",
    "I would have liked more experiments involving careful pipeting before the final experiment.",
    "TAs were helpful. Dr G was condescending and rude.",
    "A strength of this course was that it guided you through the whole process of lab. Everything you need to succeed is in the packet Dr. G gave us, it was only a matter of how much you studied it. However, a weakness was when plans would change and deviate from what was written on the worksheet, that was confusing.",
    "The final is not well designed",
    "I really like that we are given all the labs ahead of time in order to prepare for them. The only weakness of this course is that the labs are sometimes boring or tedious",
    "We worked on our own for most of this course and for those who where unfamiliar with a lab setting it was difficult to catch up and learn.",
    "The course teaches how to carry out basic lab techniques but grading policies are extremely structure and focus on minor details. Writing out procedures during the lab distracts from the actual labs.",
    "Although the course did a good job with getting the material across, some of the criteria was somewhat vague, such as the level of detail necessary for lab sheets that were to be turned in at the end of each lab.",
    "The course was a bit dry.",
    "A strength I saw was how complementary 134L was with CHEM 161. Having lecture be animated through the application of lab was a nice way of ingraining knowledge. A weakness would have to be the stringent grading system. Sometimes the details were prioritized over apprehension of the subject matter. It is obvious that some students knew their stuff (through quizzes and knowledge of the lab), but something little such as a spelling error or \"lack of neatness\" would result in point deductions from their lab notebooks, which isn't really indicative of their skills as a student.",
    "I felt that the experiments reinforced lab and lecture concepts well. I did not like that the course relied heavily on minor details and numerical accuracy; if our lab equipment does not work properly, leading to erroneous data, and the TA cannot fix it, we should not be docked points on our lab reports or required to come in for another 4-hour experiment run. I found it unreasonable that an introductory lab course would deduct 25% on a final for a 2% experimental error. While the lab guides were helpful in writing reports, there were often small details that the professor wanted to be included that were not listed, and points were deducted. Introductory students can be held accountable for significant figures and neatness, but we cannot know exactly what professors are looking for in a report if it is not listed. I know that most students who are in this lab are required to take it as a prerequisite for future study, but the course would be improved if students genuinely enjoyed doing the lab work and learned from mistakes instead of stressing over minor details and minimal experimental error that lead to big deductions in grades. I also do not think that it is necessary to have a four-hour lab when the experiments and lectures could be modified to fit into three.",
    "The quizzes were arbitrary and irrelevant to Chem 163.",
    "The quizzes at the beginning of class are overly stressful and I do not think very necessary",
    "I think that my ta was the strength of the course while the tediousness of the course was an obvious weakness.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it gives a basic introduction to the lab and outlines the experiment very well in the lab lecture before the lab. The labs are very easy to follow, making it easy to understand the purpose of each step. Some weaknesses are that I feel like you don't grow much as a student because everything is outlined for you, and you don't have to figure anything out on your own. But this does help with getting introduced to basic lab procedures.",
    "We get a lot of feedback in lab but not so much on our reports.",
    "Weaknesses were \"cleanliness\" and organization with data sheets. The professor grading the sheets was very particular about how clear and clean the data was recorded. Perhaps provide students with some examples of successful data sheets.",
    "Strength is that it makes very well aquatinted with chem lab skills. Weakness is that it is very tedious and requires a lot of attention to detail.",
    "The grading of the TAs varied greatly. Some TAs were extremely lenient with the grading while others, notably my TA was much harsher. I would recommend standardizing the TA grading in some way.",
    "I think the labs are very comprehensive and easy to understand. The labs are well designed and each lab teaches us a different crucial lab technique. However, as a Chem 163 student, the labs had little overlap with what we were learning. 134L is a perfect parallel to Chem 161, but not with Chem 163. I think that a separate lab course for 163 should be considered.",
    "It's just really long - lab could definitely be shortened. Also the weekly quizzes were a little annoying. I think that lab and lecture could have more overlap as well.",
    "The workload of the course does not correspond to the half credit you're given for taking it. The weekly lab reports require a lot of time and the amount of time you put into them does not always correspond to the grade you'll receive.",
    "Strengths: Easy to understand and follow directions Weaknesses: too specific when it came to grading",
    "Strengths include: Pre-lab lectures, which helped me make sense of the procedure and allowed me to understand the chemistry that would take place; division of class into smaller sections; weekly quizzes for consistent feedback Weaknesses include: some of the lab reports involved tedious work that contributed little to learning (room for improvement here), but overall were an effective teaching tool. Additionally, lab report feedback was only received once at the beginning of the course.",
    "Strengths: students had to be engaged to properly perform experiments and receive credit. Weaknesses: not a lot of the experiments left any lasting impact on my knowledge of chemistry, since all I did was follow the manual.",
    "I think some of the strengths are the fact that it's so hands-on and the fact that the class is very expansive. Some of the weaknesses are the varying strengths of the TA's (not all TAs know what's going on), and the fact that it's very long. 4 hours seems like a long time.",
    "good course, truly depends on how engaged your TA is, they were fabulous.",
    "This course does well introducing chemistry concepts and showing them in a lab setting. They very independent nature of this course however does not do well to support students who have little experience in the lab in the first place. More guidance on each assignment from the TAs would be helpful.",
    "The strengths are that it is easy to follow and understand. The weaknesses are that it is not that interesting.",
    "The pre lab lectures were not always that helpful. It could be orchestrated to work better in tandem with gen chem so that they covered the same topics at the same time",
    "The class goes into depth on many topics but sometimes the work seems a little bit tedious.",
    "This course did not really teach me much about chemistry. A lot of the time I got points taken off for something as small as a crossed out answer on the data sheets. Writing the procedure in class is tedious and students gain nothing from rewriting the whole procedure. The quizzes taken before lab were very difficult to student for and tested mostly just students' previous knowledge of chemistry.",
    "The pre-lab lectures were always helpful. I wish that it was more clearly explained what was required on each lab report.",
    "I loved the class, each lab, the pre-lab lectures, etc. I just wished that the grading could have been fairer. I often felt like my TA graded harder than the other TAs, and that nothing was being done to normalize the grading.",
    "The lab reports I felt were unnecesarilly long and took up a lot of time and some of the quizzes were very hard also. However I did learn a lot.",
    "The course allowed me to develop familiarity with chemistry lab equipment and procedure quickly. However, for students who had little lab experience in high school the course could have done a better job at easing this transition and giving more individualized help.",
    "I think the course does a good job of introducing students to the labs and techniques. Some of this was repetitive for me and I think for some other students as well because we had done this kind of lab work in high school. I also think there could have been more of a focus on designing and carrying out experiments rather than just on methodology.",
    "The strengths center around its connections to the general chemistry course; both the lab and the class reinforced the information learned in one another. Also, the lab provided practical skills. The weaknesses include the lab reports, which were lengthy and harshly graded despite hours of effort, and the time put into them was not worth the small amount of knowledge gained. Lab reports can definitely increase understanding, but the format of these was time-consuming yet not very thought-provoking.",
    "The pre lab lectures are very informative",
    "The strength is in the professor and equipment. The people helping you in lab are wonderful and the facilities are beautiful. The weakness is in the clarity of the material; sometimes it didn't line up well with the course material in general chemistry, leaving some confused.",
    "The labs are thorough in teaching skills but can get very repetitive and frustrating at times. It's not a class that anyone who takes it is specifically interested in.",
    "Strengths: Well structured, prepared me very well for the final. Weaknesses: The difference between TAs seemed vast. Some were more willing to provide help than others.",
    "The course is very hands-on, which is good. I thought the course was solid.",
    "While in part useful for the cultivation of basic laboratory skills, this course was otherwise rather redundant and repetitive.",
    "I thought the labs were engaging and actually doing the experiments was fun. However, I thought the prelab lectures were not always interesting or helpful, and the lab reports were hard to write and not much help was given.",
    "The strengths of this course are the prelab lectures that are very helpful for the subsequent experiments and for emphasizing important ket concepts that we see in our general chemistry course.",
    "A weakness is that there are students in this course that had prior lab experience due to research, internships, etc. while other students (like myself) did not have any experience. This meant that most students had an advantage in the course and would leave several hours earlier from lab. Another weakness was that students would only get to practice their lab skills once a week. There are videos available online showing how to get rid of an air bubble in a buret for example, but seeing it is not the same as doing it in the lab. Unexperienced students would mostly learn while in the lab through a process of trial and error. So not being able to practice outside of the lab was a weakness. Perhaps having optional \"practice\" sessions would help remedy this and would help level the playing field for the students who have had no prior experience in labs. Another weakness is that Dr. G is unnecessarily picky about the datasheets. He wants them extremely neat as in he will take off points if students cross something out with two lines instead of one because it is messy. Also, he expects tables for all experiments but he does not always tell you so. This meant that students unnecessarily lost points each week because of \"messy\" or \"incomplete\" datasheets. Another weakness is that the course is only half a credit but I spent as much time on the lab reports as a problem set for my STEM classes. It was a huge time commitment. A strong positive is that students can use up all of the time in the lab so that they use as much time as they need (as long as they do not stay past five o'clock). I was always one of the last people in the lab because I was so new to lab procedures. But the excess amount of time allowed me to properly learn all of the lab skills that we needed to know and to be meticulous in my datasheets and lab procedure. Another positive is that by the end of it, you will learn basic lab skills.",
    "Just a regular lab course, no real strengths or weaknesses",
    "The quizzes and lab reports are graded harshly and a small error could drop you multiple letter grades.",
    "It could be helpful to move the lab about wavelengths and corresponding colors to when the chem 161 class is also covering the material, because the lab currently happens before students have covered the concepts in a regular chemistry class.",
    "Weaknesses: Dr. G is very strict on the data sheets. I followed the format of his model data sheet, but I almost never got a 20\/20.",
    "Some of the grading procedures seem unnecessary (datasheets in particular seem a bit tough) but overall this is an enjoyable course with some great learning outcomes.",
    "The laboratory experiments were generally very interesting, but they were often quite long, and it was sometimes impossible to complete the lab and submit the data sheets by the end of the lab period. Also, I found it very frustrating how many procedural and syntax\/logistical guidelines in the TYCO course packet were incorrect, or altered. The TYCO course packet really needs to be updated. Also, I found that I spent more time doing work for this class than any other class I was taking, due to the immense lengths of the lab reports.",
    "The strengths of this course are that your TA is very helpful during each lab and regarding the lab reports. Some weaknesses are that Dr. G can be a very harsh grader. He does explain the pre-lab lecture in an easy to understand way. Another weakness is that you can either have a really great TA or a terrible one and this determines how well you will do in the class.",
    "A strength of the course is that it matched well with what we were learning in Chem 161. A weakness is that is is from 1-5pm, that 5 hours of mostly standing and, as and athlete, I had to miss practice to take this course.",
    "Strength is that it familiarized us to certain concepts and with the lab equipment and techniques. A weakness is that it is very time and energy consuming and very tedious.",
    "I felt that the course load exceeded what should be expected out of the students for a half credit course. Most of the labs took too long to complete.",
    "We could've received more quiz preparation. I also thought the grading for the final lab practical was VERY unreasonable.",
    "The course is a lot of work for only being .5 credits. Your success can also be effected by the TA you are assigned.",
    "Final exam should be less strict-- not much room for partial cre",
    "I think a strength of this course is in its ability to expose students to a variety of different concepts in general chemistry. I think this course could be improved by tying more directly to chemistry 163. Compared to my friends in chemistry 161, I often felt at a disadvantage, as they had learned material and formulas in class that directly helped them on lab quizzes, experiments, and lab reports. A more direct correlation between chemistry 163 and chemistry 134L would be helpful for future students.",
    "There were many labs, especially the labs with many calculations that we had to hand in with the data sheets, where I feel like I was not given nearly enough time to complete the assignment well. Other than that, the class was fine.",
    "A weakness is that there is little student innovaton, but a strength is that it was effective in teaching lab skills.",
    "The course went over almost everything that one needed to know about a basic chemistry experiment, from proper procedures to note taking. However, a vast majority of the students had worked in labs previously, so many of the exercises were tedious and not needed.",
    "I felt that while grading was useful, it was sometimes a little late. For example, the report is due on thursday night and responses become unmuted wednesday night, or even thursday morning. This often meant that the same imstake would be counted against you multiple times before you finding out you made that mistake."

    "If you must, you must. If you mustn't you mustn't.",
    "If you need the credit, take it. It's doable, but it's not necessarily enjoyable, and it has many annoying features (strictness towards formatting lab reports that it is ultimately necessary for learning the course material)",
    "Don't take this course unless you have to for a prereq.",
    "Yes it teaches you a lot and the labs are engaging (except for the first few). I would tell them to not save the lab reports for the day before however.",
    "I would not recommend this course. However, if you need to take it for your major requirements, then you have little choice. Just be prepared for a slow, boring, and uninspiring introduction to chemistry experimentation.",
    "Although it is unfortunately a required course for many majors, I feel that it needs serious improvement, and I would not recommend taking it unless absolutely necessary.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a career in scientific research.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone planning on taking lab courses in their future, as this course provides all basic knowledge necessary for future science experiments. However, I would not recommend this course as something to take just because, since the simple experiments were not always particularly engaging. That being said, my TA (Zach Carter) did a fantastic job in engaging his students and explaining the science behind each experiment, and he made the course very enjoyable.",
    "Though this class is challenging, I would definitely recommend it to another student taking Chem 161 or 163 because I believe it complemented what we learned in lecture very nicely.",
    "I would recommend the course because it is helpful, however you roll the dice with your TA, and if you don't get a good one the class could be very difficult.",
    "This course can be a lot of work, especially in the beginning when you're trying to learn how data sheets should be written or how lab reports should be done, but after that, it gets a lot easier and lab experiments get a lot more interesting and fun. Definitely recommend this class, if only to get a taste of general lab skills.",
    "I would recommend this course as necessary requisite for other labs, but the class on its own is difficult.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as long as their TA grades fairly.",
    "If you need it for your major or for pre-med, take it because you need it and try to enjoy and learn from it and gather basic laboratory techniques and procedures, but if you don't need it, don't take it. It can be a grueling 4 hours and the TAs and the professor are picky on grading sometimes, which can be very annoying.",
    "This course should solely be taken by students that want to pursue interests in medicine or chemistry.",
    "I would recommend",
    "Do not take this class unless you're sure you absolutely have to. If you're in Chem 163, take 136L .",
    "If they are considering taking other STEM Courses, yes.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "This is a standard lab course that most STEM majors\/premeds can't avoid. An A is possible but will require extensive attention to detail while preforming procedures and countless hours making sure your lab reports are extra perfect.",
    "Prereq: yes; otherwise, no.",
    "Although this course is useful in that it teaches one good lab skills, I would only recommend the course to somebody who needs it for their major or as a pre-req. It's a good course, but not one that I would recommend for those not interested in pursuing chemistry or certain sciences further.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in science and planning on taking more advanced labs.",
    "If you have to take this course, then you will be fine, but it can be annoying and a lot of tedious work at times. The course is not as horrific as others may make it seem. If you try to enjoy it while you are doing, it will be a lot less painful. For most, this class is a requirement for future majors or for pre-med requirements. The biggest difference that determines whether or not you will enjoy the class is if you have an amazing TA like I was lucky to have. Dr. G can be very intimidating so come prepared for lab. Otherwise, you will survive.",
    "Yes, however, only if they were a stem student or looking into a major that requires the class.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. In my opinion, I did not learn a lot, it was a lot of work, and it should count more than one credit. I also did not like how we had to take a quiz on material that was just presented to us during lecture.",
    "Only if it is required. Otherwise, no. Unnecessary stress and work.",
    "If you are a STEM major, you will most likely have to take this course because it is a requirement. That aside, I think the course is good for establishing basic skills that will be necessary in the future, so I would recommend this course. Dr.Ganapathi can be somewhat intimidating, but that doesn't detract from the quality of the course.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a student who doesn't need to take it. Lab is a significant amount of time, and the coursework does not teach anything very interesting. That being said, students who need to take this course will learn basic, useful laboratory skills, which is important for future work.",
    "No. But you have to take it so what can you do.",
    "Yes! Lab is actually fun if you can focus for 4 hours.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it for learning lab skills. It's usually a requirement and it's a fairly easy course. It takes some work but its very feasible to do well.",
    "Required course for many STEM majors - recommend",
    "Do not take lab unless you have to. The grading is really unfair and Dr. G is unnecessarily meticulous when it comes to data sheets.",
    "I would recommend this class because it helped me become comfortable working in a lab.",
    "This course is definitely a lot of work for only half of a credit, but it is also a good way to develop necessary lab techniques that will aide many of the students in the future. I would recommend that students take a lab course of some sort, whether it is this course or not is up to them.",
    "Yes, I think this is a good course to take too get comfortable with performing individual experiments and drawing conclusions from the data you obtain.",
    "Yes.",
    "You have to take this course for a lot of majors and pre med requirements, so just take it! It seems like it'll be hard, but after lab 5 it gets much more manageable. Don't stress and just stick through it!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that has to take general chemistry lab for their major or for premedical studies. But also if someone is just interested in chemical experiments and wants to gain introductory lab skills or understanding, this lab course was rather helpful in developing such skills and understanding. It definitely requires a lot of commitment and hard work, but it is a very rewarding course.",
    "Only if someone needs them for a requirement; not just for fun.",
    "I would recommend taking this course because you might need it for your major. Could get quite tedious. Not incredibly painful but not a lot of fun, and not intellectually engaging at all.",
    "This course is good for any students looking for an introduction to common basic lab procedures and the analytical process of writing lab reports from one's own experimental results.",
    "I would recommend this class if it is a requirement for your major or premed track.",
    "Overall, this course was a good introduction to techniques and skills needed to work in a lab. However, grading and feedback for lab reports often lagged behind, so I would not be able to realize my errors until two or three weeks after, resulting in losing the points for an error I was unaware and unable to fix until too late.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in applied chemistry, and want a solid fundamental training in lab technique. This class is not difficult, but teaches you to pursue meticulous technique and pay careful attention to experiments and calculations.",
    "I've heard that this lab is the most tedious out of all labs, so only if you want to finish your lab requirement early.",
    "I wouldn't unless the course was necessary. I just found it slightly boring. I wish the experiments challenged our understanding of chemistry more.",
    "Yes, Dr. G is very helpful with applying concepts of chemistry learned in class to a lab setting.",
    "There are only a couple cool demonstrations. Only take this if you are genuinely interested in chemistry, pre-med, or laboratory research, and if you are willing to actually enjoy the decent amount of work that it takes to do well.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it was very helpful in addition to the general chemistry lectures. This class gave me a more clear understanding of certain topics in chemistry, and I think it could do the same for other students.",
    "It's a challenging course that has its fun moments; however, it does take a lot of time. I would recommend only to pre-medical students.",
    "Most students who take this course need to take it as a prerequisite or a requirement for their anticipated major, so they do not have a choice whether to take it or not. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who didn't need to take it.",
    "No, I would NOT recommend this class to another student at all. This is the worst class I've ever had the misfortune of taking. WORST CLASS EVER!!!!",
    "If you are pre-med, you've got to tough it out and take it. If you are not pre-med, I would not recommend this course. It is a lot of work with little reward.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student if they have a clear interest in learning the basics of chemistry experimentation. Due to its 4 hour length and robust workload for only a half a credit, the course is a more intense commitment than one might think.",
    "No, only if they absolutely need to take it for their major. Not a pleasant experience.",
    "Yes but the lab reports take hours.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student pursing a degree in the sciences or the premed track.",
    "Not unless it is absolutely necessary.",
    "Unless it is absolutely required (most Biology\/Chem majors), I would not recommend this course. It is much more effort than should be required of a 0.5 credit course, with an intensive period of lab and a lengthy and often confusing lab report due each week in which little to no guidance is given to help complete it.",
    "Never in a million years.",
    "Yes. It is a great way to build upon your foundational knowledge of laboratory procedures and equipment.",
    "This course is a necessity for MCBD, chem, and premed, so you'll have to take it either way. It is not terrible, but do not take it if you don't have to.",
    "Yes, it was overall very interesting and informative despite the large section of time it ate up.",
    "I would recommend this course as an introduction to lab work because it did not assume too much prior knowledge or experience and it allows the student to figure out how to use the equipment in a supervised environment.",
    "Don't take unless you have to, although if you're here you probably do. It's kind of miserable, but it's possible to suck it up and just get through it.",
    "The workload is very little, maybe 2 hours a week, so if you are considering pre-med or a stem major, this is a necessary course to take and not too bad.",
    "Seeing as CHEM 134L is a prerequisite for many majors and academic programs, you will probably have to take it if you want to go into the sciences, but I wouldn't recommend it. The prelab lectures and quizzes make the lab seem more stressful than it has to be, creating for a daunting lab and a nerve-wracking three hours.",
    "Yes because it is a very good learning experience.",
    "Do not take if you don't need it",
    "Obviously you have to take it in order to do the premed requirements, but it's mind-numbing in many ways. You just have to accept that you're going to be there for four hours and not think too hard about what else you would be doing and it's genuinely fairly enjoyable some weeks.",
    "yes, it is a solid course for stem majors or people who are premed.",
    "Definitely not. Only take this if you really have to, ie are premed. It's a lot of tedious work with very little reward in terms of satisfaction or overall learning.",
    "It's a necessary evil for premed!",
    "I waited until sophomore year to take this course and that was definitely right for me. Having a schedule where I had only mwf corses was helpful to me because having class before lab is a drag.",
    "No",
    "If you have to take lab then yea.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to know how to perform experiments. There was a pretty large workload, so only take it if you have to.",
    "Yes, most people take this because it's required for their major but I really enjoyed lab. I enjoyed it more than lecture",
    "Yes.",
    "Take it if you are required to by your major.",
    "Unless that student is very interested in experiencing work in a lab, I don't believe CHEM 134L is necessarily a class I would recommend due to the amount of time and work alongside with the specialized material.",
    "If you have to take the course.",
    "If necessary to your major, yes.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a casual student shopping for science classes; only take Gen Chem lab if it is a required prerequisite. The course focuses too much on experimental accuracy and nit-picky details for students to enjoy the experience of learning lab skills.",
    "Only take if necessary. Drains your day.",
    "Only if it was needed for a requirement",
    "Unless required by their major I wouldn't recommend:",
    "I would recommend this course if it is required for a major, otherwise I don't think this course offers much to personal growth of the student. This course has a really high workload for only and half credit class. I did more work for this class than I did for some of my full credit class on top of spending more time in lab than I did in other classes. In order for this class to be worth taking if it is not required for the major, a full credit should be offered for the class.",
    "Take it if you need lab experience or need the credit. It's a lot of work for a half-credit class. The experiments were exciting but all of the data sheets and lab reports were pretty mindless.",
    "Yes. It was a great course to gain some experience working with tools in a chemistry lab. Would highly recommend if interested in pursuing a career that is science related.",
    "Yes, its useful if you work in a lab in the future.",
    "Take this course if you wish to work in a lab in the future. Dr. G and the TAs are very helpful and are meticulous in ensuring that every student understands how to properly execute the experiments and techniques required to complete each experiment. You gain valuable experience that would prove useful for any science major.",
    "Unless you're premed or need it for your major DO NOT take chem lab",
    "I would consider not taking the course if it's not required for your major. It's a lot of work but you won't always get a lot out of it. However, it is nice to have lab experience so consider that also.",
    "Only if required for a major",
    "Most students take this course to fulfill a requirement (myself among them), but I was pleasantly surprised to find a class that was enjoyable and useful on the whole.",
    "I would not recommend this as a course to take for fun, but I would recommend it as an introductory lab course.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student because I often found it a frustratingly high amount of work and time for 1\/2 a credit. I often was also frustrated with the lack of clear feedback from my TA.",
    "I would probably recommend this course to another student, but even if I didn't, it's probably a necessity for all chemistry majors and pre-meds! The course is fine, nothing bad, nothing special.",
    "Take the course if you plan on taking future courses in chemistry.",
    "Great introductory course on lab procedures and some cool experiments.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend it. It's honestly not bad at all, if you need it for a requirement you could take it without having to worry about it that much, but it's also not good either. It's just a lab. It's a pretty cool experience taking a lab, but in terms of telling another person to take it, I wouldn't have much else to say to them.",
    "Yeah, a useful intro class",
    "Yes. It was a good way to get used to using lab equipment in an entry level course.",
    "No, I think students only take this course as a requirement.",
    "It is a lot of work for half a credit.",
    "Yes! It's hard, but it's worth it, and you'll need the class anyway if you're pre-med.",
    "Yes, because it gives you a basic idea of how lab classes work.",
    "It is a helpful introduction to lab techniques. However, if there was another setting in which to learn those techniques, I might recommend trying that over this course.",
    "Yes, it was helpful when taken together with the Chemistry courses and was an introduction into science labs at Yale for STEM majors.",
    "It's difficult to say. The practical skills learned are incredibly helpful, but the workload was often very burdensome. I spent more time on lab reports and preparing for labs than I did on work for classes that were worth a whole credit. This is only half a credit but it is much more challenging than most credit courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they have an interest in chemistry or need it for a requirement.",
    "Yes only if they need the course for requirements.",
    "Yes. the skills learned in this lab are very important for further labs and many STEM majors.",
    "I'd say that if you must take it then so long as you prepare and listen during the prelab lecture you will be fine. It is a good course if you put in your own effort. Dr. G doesn't take much crap and he can be very strict at times but at the end of the day he is fair.",
    "No",
    "Yes. This course is a great introduction to valuable and common lab techniques.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it is required for a major or track that the student is pursuing.",
    "I probably would not recommend this course to another student. For a half credit, the amount of work was considerable, and I do not feel like I got much out of the course at all.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone that needs to fulfill their chemistry lab requirement or anyone interested in learning more about the applications of chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if they are required to by their major, because they are pre-med, because it is a pre-requisite, or because they will be taking more advanced chem lab courses in the future. The lab reports themselves are a huge time commitment if you want full points for them, they are practically problem sets from how much time spent on them. The pre-labs are very stressful because Dr. G expects you to memorize what he says right on the spot since he quizzes you just after pre-lab. Overall, it is a huge stressor and it takes up a lot of time from a busy schedule. It was not something that I would look forward to each week; in other words, it is not a fun course. But it is a necessary one for those who have to take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because I think the skills learned are extremely valuable in order to be able to study science in a laboratory setting.",
    "Only take it if you are required to.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this lab for those who are pre-med. It also establishes a foundation for lab skills.",
    "No regrets taking this course.",
    "It is relatively useful but it takes a lot of your time.",
    "Yes, because it is helpful and cool to learn how to perform experiments in a college laboratory environment.",
    "I would recommend this course to others because it gives you a good foundation in laboratory skills. Dr. G is also fairly understanding and will you allow you to make up labs later in the week.",
    "I'm on the fence about if I would recommend it or not. I really liked working with my hands in the lab setting, but smites the data sheets and the lab reports were monotonous and unnecessary complex.",
    "I would.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless they were required to take it. It's just a lot of work and very tedious.",
    "Yes, it's a requirement and some of the labs are enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend if your major requires lab credits but if you don't need to take it then its not really worth the large workload.",
    "Unless you and interested in the pre-med track or have not had any lab experience before, then yes. However, I don't believe I would recommend it to others and I will likely not take the second semester of the lab.",
    "I would recommend this course, as it was very helpful in gaining basic laboratory skills.",
    "I think this is a perfect course to gain basic lab skills and an understanding of how to use the various lab apparatus and lab techniques. It's definitely the workload (and more class time than) a full-credit course though, so be aware of that. The lab reports take especially long at first, but they get shorter as you get more used to it and need to create fewer graphs. Be aware that the lab reports are the only out-of-class work. They're not hard but they are very tedious. Don't leave them until the last minute. I pulled way too many all-nighters or almost all-nighters the night before lab.",
    "For a student who had never had any laboratory experience, this class would be a great start. I would even recommend it to those who had previous lab experience, as it is a good way to become acquainted with the labs at Sterling.",
    "Most of the people who take this class have to. It is a lot of work, and a lot of busy work. There is no intellectual challenge taking 15 minutes typing out a wild formula on Microsoft Word. However, the lab experiments were great and highly informative. It is a lot of time to work your schedule around. I recommend it to a nonmajor if you have an extreme amount of free time to spend on the class."
