   "comments": [
    "This is a course on linear regression for people who are good at math. If you need (due to economics major, probably) or want to learn about that, and are good at math, you should take this course, otherwise, do not.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "I would recommand it to those who want to be Econ-Math majors.",
    "This course got better with time because the instructor adjusted the workload to suit our preparation. Take it with Vytlacil if you can.",
    "Yes! I don't know about what other econometrics classes are like, but I think it's a good mix of theory and practical examples.",
    "If you've decided to take 136, take it with Vytlacil. He's a really good teacher. He's good at explaining stuff, he's lively and animated in class (even if his humor is not your cup of tea, you can appreciate the effort), and he's very available and approachable during office hours. If you're trying to choose between 136 and 132, seriously consider this class. It's really not as hard as people make it out to be. Some of the problem sets can be heavy on math especially those near the beginning, but the exams are generally not. The class alsogets easier as you go along.",
    "Take it with Vytlacil. He's very good. If it isn't with him, I'm not sure you should take it.",
    "Extremely hard and demanding class. A class designed for students with excellent understanding and interest for both math and econ (aka math and econ majors). At the same time, this class is great and taught by an amazing professor (Vytlacil).",
    "Take this class only if you are mathematically inclined and have fulfilled the prereqs. If you have, you'll get a lot out of it, but if you haven't, you probably won't find it rewarding.",
    "Take it if you want to be able to read serious econ papers and understand the theory and the application. Definitely better than ECON 132 if you want to continue studying econ.",
    "If you take this course, I would highly recommend taking Econ 135 first or else you'll be a little lost in the beginning... even taking econ 135 first you might be a little lost. While it starts out pretty intense, the course gets better as you go, and Professor Vytlacil is good."
