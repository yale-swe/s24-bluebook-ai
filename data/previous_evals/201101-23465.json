   "comments": [
    "Slow start as we had to surmount hurdles such as the HIC approval before we could begin. Later, more hours were required. At first it was difficult to understand what our tasks were. These gradually became clearer.",
    "Strength = real world, practical experienceWeakness = A lot of classroom time that is not very relevant to skills we need for the project (e.g. classroom discussions on leadership, communication, etc.)",
    "The course is practical and insightful. It allows you to have hands-on experience in program planning.",
    "Great course!",
    "It was alright. In the end I wonder if it was more work than it was worth.",
    "The course's intentions are good though each group's experience will be different. My group was unsure of our projects goals and outcomes from the beginning which led to a rocky first couple months. The classtime was sometimes helpful and othertimes not.",
    "This course is FAR too time-intensive and is completely overweighted as compared to all other classes. This class was not a favorite this semester.",
    "Unique opportunity to practice core public health skills, learn about realities of community work with the support of an academic class and academic community. Course materials helpful and assignments useful for planning the schedule for the semester and division of labor. One suggestion is having each group have it's own workshop with the TAs and instructor in order to discuss project plan and workload in more detail.",
    "Overall, this course was good. It provided me with the opportunity to learn new skills, and work within the community. However, class time seemed unnecessary. Some of the lectures were useful, while others were not very helpful and that time could've been better spent on the projects."
