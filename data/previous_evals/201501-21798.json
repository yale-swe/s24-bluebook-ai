    "DS Historical and Political thought is a political theory course that tracks the evolution of philosophy of history and government from Machiavelli to the end of World War II. I would recommend, but not as a history course.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "Second semester is way more political theory than first semester, so take what you will out of that. Personally, I found second semester H&P fairly interesting though, again, slightly repetitive on the political theory side. Professor Leaman is a pretty good professor who really places an emphasis on what the students want to discuss.",
    "It was the most rewarding freshman experience in political scholarship and writing I could have asked for."
