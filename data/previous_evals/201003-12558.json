   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to those interested in going into education or some related field. As a psychology major interested in working with children, this class provided me with a deeper understanding of the importance of schools on the future well-being of children. If you do not have time to commit to a placement outside of class, however, I would not recommend it. You have to hike pretty far up science hill for both class and observation.",
    "I recommend it!",
    "One of Yale's \"must-take\" classes if you can get in it and are interested in education.",
    "This class is wonderful. You learn so much not just about early childhood generally, but specifically will learn so much about your own childhood. Such a great experience.",
    "I would recommend this class. You will come out really understanding early childhood education. You will also have a lot of fun doing it.",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in learning more about teaching in an early childhood classroom, Calvin Hill is one of the most amazing places to observe and work with teachers who are really at the top of their game.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is at all interested in developmental psychology and\/or education. The readings are interesting and varied, the discussions give you the chance to talk about child development, curriculum for early childhood education, and the education crisis in general, and the practicum allows you to tie together everything you've learned in a nuanced and fun way. It is a unbelievable opportunity to be able to observe kids and then discuss your observations in detail with Professor Horwitz, who knows each child at Calvin Hill intimately, who made sure that the practicum is not only worthwhile but the highlight of my week. The journals are manageable and the paper is open; take this class!"
