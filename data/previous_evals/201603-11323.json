   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about the most recent findings in epigenetics. The course really expands upon the ideas that other courses only briefly touch on. My scientific analytical skills also improved a lot from the weekly literature discussions and presentations.",
    "Detailed foundational knowledge of epigenetics concepts and how they apply in the context of human development and disease",
    "Epigenetic mechanisms, critique papers, see the connections and dialogue between papers",
    "Taking Epigenetics this semester taught me more than nearly any other class. As an upper level biology class, you put to work all of the things that you've learned in previous classes to understand the field of epigenetics - the mechanisms that control expression of genes. You learn about model organisms, various ways our genes can be silenced\/ expressed, and so much more.",
    "I learned core concepts about epigenetics and how to apply my knowledge to both reading scientific literature and thinking about solutions to epigenetic problems.",
    "Epigenetics was a more advanced MCDB course that taught me how to read peer-reviewed literature and think critically about experimental design. The course also introduced me to many important experimental techniques in biology.",
    "I got a great overview of the state of epigenetics research today. The course was structured as a lecture class and a paper discussion class per week which I thought was a great way to not only see the concepts we were learning applied in current research but also to develop my skills in reading primary literature.",
    "I learned about different epigenetic mechanisms, the way they interact with the genetics that I have previously learned about. Then I learned how to connect epigenetics to various human diseases.",
    "This course was research paper intensive, which was something new for me. It was very challenging at first, but after doing my paper presentation, I felt a lot more comfortable reading them. I learned how to breakdown and analyze complicated research. That was a huge skill that I think is useful in all science fields.",
    "Learning about experiments that are used in the current field of epigenetics and cancer biology. Learning to read scientific papers effectively and efficiently, understanding figures and diagrams and how they mean in the context they are placed in."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are the dedicated and passionate professors, the steady pace, the 3 quiz structuring of the material, the weekly journal clubs, basically everything! The professors really brought the material to life and created an atmosphere of curiosity and enthusiasm. I really can't think of any ways the course could be improved.",
    "The course was taught by a fantastic team of professors-- Nadya, Yannick, Josien-- who never fail to engage and care for the class; it was a great joy to be taught by them! The topics were very fascinating and gave both a good overview of epigenetics topics and in more depth into some specific topics in the field. I particularly loved how we covered multiple papers that often have a story between them, and included some papers with clear issues so we can train our critique skills. I really liked the 3-quizzes structure of exams, since they kept us on top of things without being too stressful. The timing\/length could've been better-- maybe making them longer would help? But not too long-- the current length had good coverage of topics and room for a couple challenge questions already, I felt.",
    "What really makes this course is the three professors that teach it. Each of them are incredibly caring, encouraging, and passionate about their respective fields of Epigenetics. Their support and guidance makes the class much more enjoyable! A significant portion of the class is spent reading papers and discussing them in class. I personally had never had to read scientific papers, but learned how to do it in an intelligent manner and to evaluate what was and wasn't appropriate experimentation.",
    "The class was fantastic. I thought the scientific literature selected was great and the lectures were compelling. I think discussion leaders figured out towards the end of the semester that it would be good to break students into groups to present the figures and I think this would have been useful if we had done this for every paper. Also in the second part of the class, I think too many papers or too long of papers were assigned at a time for proper class discussion but this was resolved in the third part when we were assigned shorter papers that I thought allowed better discussion.",
    "The professors tried to cover too much information during each lecture, which made a little difficult to fully comprehend the material.",
    "Strengths: breadth of topics, manageable workload, understanding professors Weaknesses: some of the lectures felt a bit rushed; needed more guidance on how the papers should be presented",
    "This course really made sure we learned the material. Concepts were introduced and reinforced through the lectures and the paper discussions. The quizzes were at the end of each unit, which was a good interval of time to make sure that we stayed up to speed on the material. It was clear that the instructors put a lot of thought into the design of the course.",
    "I really have no idea how the grading is set up, whether there will be a curve or not. Also, the professors assigned a lot of research papers per week which was difficult to keep up with.",
    "3 quizzes, one after each block. The quizzes are short so they focus on the main concepts and most important information, hence you will retain more because you really have to understand each lecture very well."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! The material is NOT EASY. You should definitely have a strong foundation in basic cell biology, genetics, and developmental biology before taking this course. That being said, you learn and gain so much from this course. So far, this is the best MCDB class I've taken!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student",
    "Awesome professors-- Nadya\/Josien\/Yannick are great at teaching the class. They are really nice and the class had a great atmosphere, and they also made sure we put in the work to learn the topics that we should know. The topics cover a good depth and breadth of epigenetics, while also being very manageable. The class also uses interesting examples. One big component is literature reading, critiquing and discussion, which was a superb part of the course. We covered multiple papers that often had a story connecting them to see how the field advanced and dialogued. We also had some papers that had problems in them, and it was very helpful in training how to critique papers and spot problems. An excellent course, and I'm so glad we finally have an epigenetics class-- it's a really important booming topic that ought to be taught specifically on.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes, it is a relaxed upper level MCDB course where you learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend Epigenetics to another student. The discussion atmosphere made the learning very engaging and epigenetics is such a cool topic.",
    "Yes. Workload for this year's iteration of the course consisted of 3 quizzes (one at the end of each module), a very short video project, and a final paper on a topic of current epigenetic research. For me, this was an incredibly manageable workload. The quizzes were reasonable as long as you review the slides. There was a different professor for each section, but all of them were great--incredibly understanding and willing to meet outside of class to review points of confusion. I'd consider this a great upper-level MCDB course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested in genetics and looking not only at the content of our genes, but the way they are actually used in cells' functions. The professors are very accessible, the class was a good size this year (~12 people), and the material was very interesting.",
    "I would highly reccommend this course to other students. The material is fascinating and is essential for all biology majors in my opinion. It changes the way you understand the genome. The workload is also so so so much better than all other options for this course level. The professors are wonderful and really care about the material and the students. It is also a seminar which is a rare gem in MCDB. This was one of my favorite classes I have ever taken.",
    "Great MCDB special elective. Knowledge and skill-based, but not as much information packed as the core classes. Kind of weaves the core classes together into the next part of biology. Learning about it was enjoyable, also because the scientific papers given out once a week served as an extension of that week's lecture so it allowed you to place it into context and learn about it practically."
