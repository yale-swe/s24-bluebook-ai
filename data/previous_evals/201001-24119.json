    "TAKE THIS IF YOU GET INTO IT.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in the Incas. It's a lot of reading, but the professor is excellent. He really knows everything about the field, and he provides insights and anecdotes that other professors couldn't just because of how prominent he is in this type of research. If you're not really dedicated to understanding the Incas, though, the course probably isn't for you. I know some people got bored with the readings after a while, which makes class not as fun. Overall the course was excellent, though!",
    "Take this class only if you are very interested in the Incas or want to go to Peru (assuming they're still offering the trip). Otherwise don't bother.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in Archaeology or ancient MesoAmerican\/Pre-Colonial cultures.",
    "This is a great class and an great freshman seminar experience. Not only do you walk away with a new understanding of the Incas, but you walk away with a new understanding of anthropology in general. I really came to appreciate the relaxed, intellectual atmosphere of the class",
    "Yes, especially if you have an interest in Anthropology\/the Inca already",
    "Although the subject seemed interesting based on the title of the course, I made a fatal error in continuing with this class through shopping period. Professor Burger is a really sweet man, but he\u00b4s not a great teacher. The class was constantly in disarray because the syllabus did not reflect our actual work load. We never covered what we were supposed to in a day, and if we did it would be completely unbalance (45 minutes on one article, 4 on another). Professor Burger also did a very poor job in setting his expectations for the class, so I rarely felt confident in my preparation for assignments. It was always a crap shot if he liked it. Also the class was strongly biased towards the influence of Professor Burger\u00b4s mentor, and I felt very cheated from learning about all of the opinions in the study of the Inca. I would not take this course again.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, but I didn't really understand what I was getting myself into since I'd never taken a class like it before. If you're new to the field of anthropology\/archaeology, I'd start out with this class Credit\/D. Once you get a feel for the class and gauge how you'll fare, then you can either switch out of Cr\/D or keep it, but since it was a new field for me, I would've found it helpful to elect the Cr\/D option."
