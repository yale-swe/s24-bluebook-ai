    "THIS CLASS WAS SO SPECTACULAR!! Just listening to Prof. Blight's magnificent lectures practically transported you to this tumultuous period of American history. What I really cherished about this class was how it was so much more than a mere historical overview of the period. It really captured all the overarching questions of what the Civil War means for American national identity and historical memory -- how the ways in which we interpret the Civil War really do matter for its legacy as America's redemptive tragedy. This course was so special and TA Sam Schaffer made all the more so. Try and get him too as much as you can!",
    "Take it!",
    "Definitely recommended!",
    "Its a good course, though harder than your typical history class.Lots of reading, but worth it.",
    "GREAT, GREAT, GREAT. Take the class, it's GREAT.Lectures& professor, readings\/subject matter - interesting, and important to know.I definitely recommend Civil War to all students.(There is a fair amount of reading, but it is usually very good - I read Civil War a lot because I want to, not just because there is a lot of it. Also, since there isn't much work other than reading - just two essays and a final over the whole semester - it's ok to not finish all the reading each week)",
    "If you are already slightly knowledgeable about the Civil War, I would not recommend this class. It will not further your knowledge in any way and will be a waste of your time.",
    "This is a great class, and it deserves the reputation that it has. Blight is a fascinating lecturer, and I always found it really easy to pay attention. He will keep you captivated the whole class period. The reading is really fantastic, and the workload is really manageable. Thereare 2 five-page papers and a final, which is pretty good for a history class. Definitely take Civil War. I'm so glad I took it before graduating.",
    "Great overview of America's greatest crisis. The lectures are fantastic, but there is a lot of reading.",
    "You have to take this class. Best class I have taken at Yale. Seriously, YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT!!!!!",
    "Large lecture (SSS 114) about America from 1850-1877. Lectures were interesting, though sometimes Professor Blight's historical anecdotes and dramatic readings were uninteresting (maybe this was just me). A LOT of reading assigned for the course but most people don't do all of it (and this doesn't seem to be a problem).This course focused on social, political, and economic parts of this period of American history and not as much on the war itself. This course is not a day-by-day recap of the war but instead an overview of how the war affected all Americans, from politicians to at-home citizens.",
    "This course is a social and political history of the Civil War and Reconstruction. You learn how the role of individuals--politicians, abolitionists, slaves, freedmen, Confederates, yeomen farmers, Southern women--and ideas about proslavery, antislavery, moral perfectionism, warranteeism, executive power, the interpretation of the Constitution, racial equality, religious tolerance, and women's rights are all inextricably linked to the major events of the war. For instance, Blight challenges the myth that Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation strictly out of the goodness of his heart. You delve deeper into the issues of the war and since Blight is one of the premier Civil War historians of the day, many of the class readings are very recent and cover the newest discoveries in Civil War social and political history. I highly recommend this course for anyone mildly interested in how this country came to be what it is today. Many historians argue that the Civil War and Reconstruction Era was the Second American Revolution. Take this course and you will be able to see and understand it for yourself.",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking this class if you're really not that into history. I know it's recommended to everyone, and people from all across the board take it, but after a while the glamor of Blight's lectures wears off and all you have left is your love (or hatred) of history.It's not that hard to get a good grade, especially as all his lectures are online. If you're looking for a total gut, though, this ain't it.",
    "Good survey of important time period.",
    "Just take it.",
    "This is a fantastic course. Blight is a terrific lecturer and always makes class fun. If you get a good TF, it is even better. There are a lot of readings, but they can be skimmed without a problem. The writing assignments are kind of a pain, but they're short and definitely doable.",
    "Its about the Civil War.. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Awesome class. The lectures are great just because David Blight gives them. Writing assignments were fair and I took some writing tips away from them. The subject is fascinating and the TAs are pretty stellar.",
    "Solid course. Go into it with the mindset that you will learn things you didn't know, and your perspective on the civil war will be challenged. The papers are very short and very broad, so it's hard to do them well. Lectures are engaging even if class attendance is discouraged by the fact that the lectures are online. You will probably like your section.",
    "I would recommend Civil War; however, I would caution them that the focus of the course is on slavery before, during, and after the war.",
    "Would definitely recommend to any student interested in American history - one of the great lecture courses at Yale.",
    "Awesome class. Take it before you graduate. Also a perfect Credit D class, but you can definitely get the A if you want it (not hard to do well). A little too much reading, but you definitely don't have to do it all.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. Professor Blight is phenomenal and the class is incredibly interesting. There is a significant amount of reading each week, however, so taking it Credit\/D\/Fail is a good option.",
    "Important course. Well taught. Great TAs. Packed syllabus, but you don't have to do all of it to do well in the course. If you go to class, then you will definitely learn a lot. Professor Blight's humor and enthusiastic teaching style cannot be praised high enough.",
    "I think this class on the Civil War and Reconstruction Era is a great overview of the time period and the war. All of the major themes and topics were covered amazingly well. I would just caution that there is a lot of reading, but it's worth it. It's all very interesting. I would definitely recommend the class to someone that wants to know more about the Civil War. As a potential history major, it helped me narrow my focus a little and determine what topics I want to pursue further.",
    "YES-best class at yale.",
    "Blight is a bit long-winded and slows down later in the course, but this is one of THOSE history lectures at Yale. You're missing out if you don't take it.",
    "Yes- Good course.",
    "YES. Take it. It can be challenging, but so worth it and so much fun\/informative. I found myself thinking about the class\/readings after and outside of class often and their relevance to today.",
    "Take it. One of the best.",
    "Yes. You have to take this",
    "I would recommend it. The workload is not bad and you really get a good grasp of the Civil War's causes and continued impact.",
    "I would recommend it but with the understanding that the course will focus entirely on slavery and pay lip service to the other schools of thought.",
    "Yes!!",
    "Good section especially if you're doing most to quite a lot of the reading. I didn't like Blight's lecture style, because he usually didn't get through everything on the outline and because it was so hard to pick out the important bits from all the poetry he was quoting. Definitely take notes in a notebook and not a laptop or else you will get quickly distracted and find yourself missing the entire lecture...again and again. I would recommend it, but you'll get the most out of it if you do the most reading you can and stick with it throughout the semester. Papers are easy to ace, and the exam...we'll see. I didn't prepare a lot, I made an ID study guide and read over it, but I felt okay about it, probably got a B or B+ at worst.",
    "Civil War is the best experience I have had in a class at Yale. Professor Blight is one of our strongest professors, a truly fantastic and effective lecturer. His deep passion for the Civil War era came through in every lecture. He did such a great job at not just presenting the facts for us, but also asking questions, leaving us hanging in silence at the right points. I don't think I've had a more meaningful time in a lecture class, when the professor stresses self-reflection. I was able to truly understand for the first time the significance of the Civil War in ways I never could have in high school. I was also fortunate and had an excellent TF in Katherine Mooney. Katherine was there when Professor Blight wasn't, leading a good section and providing great feedback on my work that helped me take creative approaches and produce papers I was proud of. Overall, the course has a lot of reading, but the readings were great! It is set up really nicely in three parts: the causes of the war, the fighting, and Reconstruction. And Blight brings in other media, films, novels, primary documents, etc. that truly complete the experience. You have to take this class! It is one of the best offered here and has been a definitive factor in why I am a history major.",
    "I would definitely recommend to students interested in social history. To those more interested in military strategy or institutional changes, not as much.",
    "Whether or not you love or like the Civil War, I definitely recommend taking it for the importance that the Civil War has in the shaping of our nation and in understanding the course of American history. If you don't take it for those reasons, take it because David Blight is a fantastic, amazing lecturer and professor who reminded why I chose Yale. However corny that sounds. I would definitely recommend it to another student. The work load is manageable and the reading is interesting. Definitely take this course. It's one of those must do while at Yale.",
    "Yes. This class was awesome.",
    "The lectures are amazing and Blight appeals heavily to the emotional aspects of looking at the war. You will not learn to many new things about the civil war but you will get a slightly different perspective of the war. There are a ton of books that you are supposed to read but you can get away without reading many of them for the final. It would help your section grade to read the books though.",
    "It's a good course but if you aren't a history major you might not enjoy it as much.",
    "I thought it was going to be easy - it is not. There is a lot of reading, but you surely don't need to do all of it.I was only able to realize how rich and extremely interesting the course and Professor Blight are after the final, when I entered a discussion about the Civil War and realized how much I had learned - not only factually, but also in terms of scholarly analysis.If you are into history, I would suggest taking it. If not, stay away.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Whatever your major. If you are an American, or are interested in any way shape or form in America, this is not to be missed. Blight is also an interesting, funny, and knowledgeable lecturer.",
    "Of course you should take it.",
    "Yes! Take it! There is sometimes a ton of reading, but it is great (and some is obviously skippable). A must-take if you are interested in American history, race relations, etc. Blight is really fantastic.",
    "take it, blight is the type of teacher you come to yale for",
    "Based on this class' extraordinarily positive reviews, I went into Civil War with high expectations. However, Blight's lectures were somewhat disorganized and often focused on anecdotes that did not convey a broad overview of the conflict. The readings are both helpful and enjoyable, and the class isn't that much work: just two essays and a final. So, I would still recommend this class if you have an interest in the topic, but I disagree that this class is the must-take many Yalies make it out to be.",
    "Sure. Good, but not as great as I expected. Lectures can be a little slow. Didn't really feel like i learned anything substantial until cramming for the final. But definitely an interesting topic.",
    "This is a great class on the Civil War and Reconstruction. Note that this course assumes students are already somewhat familiar with the period; I would expect this would be a difficult course if one did not have any background with the material. Blight adds a completely different dimension to the material - he really makes this a humanities class, showing the human side of this period and emphasizing how we can construct history to better understand our own lives.The reading is a lot but you don't really need to do most of it (you should though). There are just two essays and a final, although the essays are very broad and take a lot of thought to write.",
    "You may have learned about the Civil War twelve times already, but you will be learning about antebellum America, the War, and Reconstruction in such depth that you will be shocked by how much it connects to American politics today. A ton of reading. So if you can handle anywhere from 200-400 pages a week, then this is a great class. If you can't handle that, it's still a good class, but you won't get as much out of it. BTW, because the course is on Open Yale, you don't really have to come to lecture if you don't want to, but that would make Professor Blight so sad.",
    "TAKE IT. Take it, and do the reading for it. There's a ton of it but it's worth it. Also, David Blight is amazing.Take it take it take it.",
    "Take it. But do make sure you have some time to read.",
    "Professor Blight is wonderful. His lectures are impassioned and resonant. Poetic. I never missed lecture because it was so great to listen to him. ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS COURSE. My favorite lecture at Yale. Work load is totally manageable and the material is fascinating. Don't miss out on this class. You will not regret it.",
    "A good intro history course that isn't too much work and gives you fresh viewpoints on a familiar topic (at least for American students). Definitely recommend!",
    "I loved this class. David Blight does a great job putting together his team of TAs - my section leader was passionate about the material, and it showed.Workwise, yes, it's a lot of reading (I gave up on McPherson pretty early on) and the papers are really challenging (you try condensing the causes of the war in just 4 pages, it's damn near impossible). BUT the lectures are incredibly rich and you will learn A LOT. I walked in having never studied any American history whatsoever, but now I walk away from this feeling decently knowledgeable about the Civil War and Reconstruction.Words cannot tell how much I will miss listening to David Blight's stories. He's a fantastic lecturer, so entertaining to listen to, and is a really sweet man on top of it.",
    "The class will give you a social history understanding of the Civil War. It lacks strong analysis of the war and its causes and effects. Instead, it focuses on the experiences of specific individuals.",
    "Yes I'd recommend it. One of those Yale classes you need to cross off your checklist.",
    "Good course, but maybe not as good as you've heard. Think hard about taking it- and know that your grade has no relation to how much work you do or how much of the reading you do. It is completely based on your ability to write history papers, which was frustrating as a freshman.",
    "really good lectures, lots of reading, work load is what you make of it",
    "David Blight is an excellent professor. His lectures are funny because of Blight's dry sense of humor, and he is one of the most renowned experts on the Civil War era. Reading is heavy and long, but you don't need to do all of it--your TA will tell you which readings to focus on. Just two papers and a final, but don't underestimate the workload. A must-take class sometime in your time at Yale.",
    "Most definitely. Best class I've taken at Yale thus far.",
    "Great lectures! If you're looking for a relatively easy and straight-forward class and have even a remote interest in the Civil War, definitely take this class. Blight is a legend, and the topic is fascinating.",
    "take it, it is interesting and a great course. one of those you should take before graduation.",
    "This is a great history class taught by a great professor. Blight is a dynamic lecturer and while his lectures are more entertaining than informational at times, you learn a great deal about the important themes of this time period with him.Take this course to learn about a defining moment in American history, and one whose results dramatically influenced the evolution of the country.",
    "Absolutely, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "This is one of those classes you just have to take before you graduate, even if you aren't a history major. Professor Blight is great, and you can't go wrong with the TAs. The reading is interesting, and if you put in the work, you'll get a lot of out the class. Also: GO TO LECTURE. GO TO LECTURE. There is no point in taking this class if you don't take advantage of its incredible lectures. If you sleep through, catch up on Open Yale Courses.",
    "I would. For people who want an easy 5th class, this is it. Don't get me wrong-- the paper topics are open-ended, and need to be top notch in order to earn the best grades. But the absence of a midterm and fact that a lot of the reading is supplemental and not tested makes it easier to do well. For people who want a class that goes deeper than US AP in discussing the Civil War, I would only recommend this class lukewarmly. I had a good US AP class, and didn't feel that I learned that much more about the period.",
    "Yes, this class is very engaging and blight is an excellent lecturer. Lots of reading, but the assignments are not difficult, just 2 papers (60%) and a final (30%). This is a must take before you graduate. I though Blight was a better lecturer than Gaddis!",
    "This is a great class taught by a great professor about the most exciting, tragic, and transformative era in American history. What more could you possibly want? The only downside is that there's a fair bit of reading, but it's all good material and worth the time it takes to get through it.",
    "I would highly recommend Civil War toeveryone at Yale; David Blight is an amazing lecturer and a great historian. You may be surprised at how much about the Civil War you didn't learn in AP US; the material is enlightening and very relevant to America today. Read the books. There is a lot of material, but it is so worthwhile. That said, you don't have to - you can survive without doing the reading (only 2 papers and the final). But doing the reading makes the class much better.",
    "Great intro course. Does a good job of covering black and female perspectives. Could have used more military history, but that's probably just me. Blight is an amazing lecturer, the reading is really interesting, the topic is essential, and the workload isn't that bad. Take it!",
    "Take the course and you won't regret it. This class is entertaining and insightful. It is worth all the work.",
    "Fascinating class- The Civil War is a topic with much to offer and taking the class with Professor Blight is a real opportunity.",
    "yes if u like american history or are interested in finding out a lot about it.",
    "Summarize it: A comprehensive and multl-angled look at three time periods:1 The antebellum: what causes led to the Civil War2. The war period: The purpose and meaning of the war.3. Reconstruction: The events. repercussions, successes and failures of this time period.I would absolutely recommend it. It is one of the several must-take courses at Yale.",
    "The lectures weren't as enthralling as some evaluations make it out to be, but this is an important period in American history to learn about. Do take it. 2 papers, 1 final.",
    "Take this course before you graduate from Yale.",
    "The course is somewhat overrated, in my opinion.",
    "Of course I would recommend the Civil War to another student. It's one of those seminal classes that you need to take before you graduate from Yale. This of course does not mean that you will be in any way worse off for not taking the class, except the additional knowledge that the class will give you is invaluable: it will teach you, first of all, the real reason of the civil war (slavery and not states rights); it will teach you about the difference between healing and justice, and just make you think about a lot of other things that people are still talking about today.",
    "Absolutely take this class. An amazing period of history, a fabulous professor, a beautiful lecture. Everyone should really know this stuff.",
    "Civil War is a fantastic class. The lectures are great, as are the readings. If you want to graduate from Yale with a deep understanding of American history, this course is a must.",
    "Yes, it's a good course.",
    "TAKE IT! BLIGHT IS AMAZING! The class is fun and you don't have to do all the reading, thought that's pretty cool, too. AND, who wouldn't want to learn about the CIVIL WAR? It's a great class, and the TFs are nice, too.",
    "It is one of the BEST COURSES AT YALE! David Blight is the BEST lecturer at Yale. He has the best voice of anyone I've ever heard ever. This is a must-take Yale experience.",
    "This is a great course that lives up to all the hype. Easily one of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would recommend it. It's one of the must take courses at Yale. Really useful, not too much work. Blight is so informed on the subject and very interested in what he teaches.",
    "I would strongly recommend the class.",
    "Lectures are great, material is even better. Blight very infrequently uses slides, so the only difficulty is if you have trouble following a narrative for taking notes. Take the papers seriously, and you'll love it.",
    "Absolutely. Take it. Don't look back.",
    "Great class. Take it if you can.",
    "A great class. Professor Blight is a great,interesting lecturer. Make sure you keep up with your reading.",
    "I would recommend Civil War has been my favorite course at Yale mostly because of Prof. Blight and his lectures.",
    "YES take it. super lectures. not that much work.",
    "Great class to take to gain a deeper understanding of the causes and results of the Civil War. Gives us a greater understanding of American History in general.",
    "good, but professor blight can kind of ramble a little and the lectures aren't always that cohesive. i expected to like it more than i actually ended up liking it, but its the only way to learn about an important era in American history. so do it. stimulating.",
    "Yes take this course. Blight is one of the best lecturers I have had at Yale. The course is a lot of work though. There is more reading than is possible to do, two papers, and a final.",
    "Civil War is a class with few surprises, especially if you've taken a history course at Yale before. You'll learn that the war's causes and consequences are a matter of historical debate, not simply a set of clear-cut facts. If that seems like an obvious point, and you can name three battles or other important events of the Civil War era, you don't need to take this class. David Blight is an engaging lecturer, but the lectures themselves consist mostly of him reading from his primary source collection in his--admittedly awesome--set of voices, and as such get jumbled and fail to provide a sense of forward motion through history. The TAs also seem to be really hit or miss, since there are so many.",
    "HIST 119 is a great class. The lectures are fantastic. There is a lot of reading, but otherwise, just two papers and a final. David Blight is amazing - this is definitely a must take class while at Yale for a reason.",
    "Take it. It was a good course. Prof. Blight is a very good lecturer. To do well, however, you need to do most of the assigned readings, because Prof. Blight does not go over many facts in his lectures. The last test is pretty difficult. Overall, it was an insightful class on one of the U.S.'s most important periods.",
    "You are missing out if you don't take this class. It is fascinating and exciting to sit through. Blight it one of the best professors at Yale and the course material is something you probably don't realize how little you know about. This is one of the best classes at Yale, don't miss it.",
    "I highly recommed Professor Blight's \"Civil War and Reconstruction Era\" course. It certainly lives up to its reputation as a Yale classic. Professor Blight commands the lecture hall, and although he is a bit melodramatic at times, does a great job of threading in new content to complement our readings outside of class. Those readings are terrific, and achieve the near impossible task of providing the student with a comprehensive taste of what is an incredibly broad historiography. Course requirements are simple: 2 papers, a section grade, and a final exam. Fight your way through convulted paper prompts and shallow discussions to get the most out of what is a truly amazing course -- you will never think about the Civil War in the same way again.",
    "Excellent course - take it.",
    "definitely. i am a science major, and while it didn't turn me into a history major, i still loved the class. just be prepared for tons of reading. (no one can do all of it, so don't worry)",
    "It's a must-take. Plus they give you all the possibilities for what will be asked on the final so all you really have to do is memorize. If you like America, this is a solid, fun class.",
    "Great course. Extremely important history to know. Tons of reading, but you don't need to do all of it to do well. The readings are usually interesting. Write two short papers and review your lecture notes and the major themes for the final. Blight's essay prompts, on the papers and essays on the final, are difficult. Blight is one of the best lecturers.",
    "There is a lot of reading, but it is definitely a course worth taking while at Yale especially if you have even a mild interest in the Civil War.",
    "If you think you're gonna learn sweet shit about Civil War battles, you're not. Turn around and do vikings. Naw, this was a good class. You get as much out of it as you put in. Blight is awesome, I just wish I went to class more often.",
    "A classic Yale course with a classic Yale professor, Professor Blight's lectures are a true delight to attend. If you would like to confirm that attitude for yourself, check out some of his lectures on Open Courses. Truly a knowledgeable, prolific, and entertaining lecturer, even if you have never been particularly interested in American history. Unfortunately, the course has an impossible workload. The amount of reading for the course makes DS reading seem trivial. However, know that few people do all of the reading. Plus, a lot of it just reinforces the lecture material and you can easily guess which book(s) or article(s) will be discussed specifically in section (50 minutes only). There are 2 5-pagers and an essay exam at the end. Worthwhile, especially if you like the subject.My TA, Taylor Spence, was far too chatty, graded rigorously, and was overall unimpressive. However, TAs change every year so one cannot worry about that.",
    "A great lecture course on a fascinating subject.BEWARE: it's very easy to not do the reading or go to lecture and get away with it. but you will be wasting the course. Try to stay on top of the work. You can finish the class without learning much, or you can be totally inspired by the material. The choice is yours.",
    "It's a great course because of its excellent lectures, which give you a good understanding of the Civil War era. David Blight is an excellent lecturer, really is passionate about the subject, and knows how to infuse lectures with both facts and feeling.The reading is a bit too heavy and sometimes too detailed for the course, but if you have the time, it's worth doing. The TA's all seem to be great.",
    "Awesome. I fully recommend it!",
    "Take it. It's a Yale experience.",
    "I would recommend this class. There is a lot of reading, though.",
    "Civil War is a survey course of the antebellum, bellum, and postbellum period of America. It attempts to raise and answer the questions why did the civil war happen, how did it change America, and if and how the North won. It is such a worthwhile class- if you think you know about the Civil War, take it anyway- it teaches the period through so many lenses- social history, military history, and economic history, though mostly, and happily, social history. The course bring the time period alive and you will love every minute of it. Take this course!!",
    "Classic Yale history lecture. Worth taking if you're interested.",
    "Yes! it's one of those great courses at Yale. a must take.",
    "This is a great, interesting class with a lot of reading. Make sure you have the time to do it, but it's all very interesting and worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Straightforward history class, lots of interesting reading (which can definitely be skimmed), manageable assignments and great TAs.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone whether they are interested in history or not.",
    "An interesting, well-paced overview of the Civil War and Reconstruction.",
    "You should definitely take this class- gives you many new perspectives on a formative war of our country",
    "Great lectures (blight is a wonderful storyteller), and not too difficult. Be prepared to get a very pointed view of the civil war, with a strong focus on emancipation. The course does a good job of covering the whole spectrum of the war (except the military really). Nice varied reading too, though not too many primary sources.",
    "Take Civil War if you love this subject already, if you know a lot about it already, or if you have a chance to be in a section with Katherine Mooney.",
    "Civil War and Reconstruction is an excellent history class for those took American history in high school and are interested in learning more. Professor Blight is engaging and entertaining lecturer and is an expert in the public memory of the Civil War. I enjoyed every lecture and while there is a lot of reading, the books are a well chosen mix of secondary and primary sources. I would highly recommend the class, as it has made me seriously consider becoming a history major.",
    "Definitely worth taking if you have an interest in history. Blight is a professor that is worth meeting.",
    "This is a course that has great lectures, but is also heavily based on reading. It is possible to do well on only a small fraction of the assigned readings, but the lectures will not be nearly as meaningful.",
    "I would definitely recommend Civil War -- Professor Blight is engaging, and very interesting to listen to. His lectures are overrated, but they're still very good. They weren't amazing, like some students rave, but they weren't boring by any means. Be forewarned that there is a lot of reading -- 12 books in total, plus documentaries to watch. It's pretty much impossible to keep up with all of it, especially if you took 5.5 credits like I did, but make sure you keep on track with the main readings that your TA focuses on. I would recommend to maybe take it Credit\/D\/Fail if you're taking it as a fifth class -- I didn't take it Credit\/D, but it was still manageable (although I did skip tons of reading). It's great for anyone who likes U.S. History, especially for those who already took it in high school. I feel like I took a lot away from this class, and it really enhanced my understanding of the time period. It especially taught me a lot more about the causes of the Civil War, and about Reconstruction, which wasn't really focused on in AP US.",
    "This class was great and I would definitely recommend it. The lectures are great and the sections really help pull all of the material together. It might be one of the largest courses offered on campus but I was still able to get an intimate feel and really learned a lot.",
    "DO IT",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested. The readings are interesting and so is class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone, no matter their major or year. The subject matter is so important in understanding our country. It's a course that really going to stick with me beyond Yale.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, although I would say that overall it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. A good lecture, but I wouldn't see it as a \"must-take.\"",
    "Overall, a good course to get deeper knowledge and some different perspectives on the Civil War. I didn't feel like I got a ton of hard facts from the lectures--Blight focused more on stories and feelings of the era...which, if you're into it, is great. Specifics, facts, and figures came from the readings.",
    "A good class for any history major, or anyone interested in American history. I would recommend the course. Some TAs are better than others, but thats how it always is.",
    "Take it",
    "Definitely recommend. An incredibly entertaining and thought-provoking course that will show you the sheer magnitude and scope of the revolutionary changes of the Civil War-Reconstruction period, blow away some popular myths, and teach you more about the true significance of the Civil War in American historyand in America's consciousness than you ever dreamed of learning in high school.",
    "don't do it by yourself. take a friend. drink often. whenever you feel the urge to complain, take it to the top first. the tas are protective of each other.like a mafia but without the violence or fun outfits.",
    "take it",
    "Definitely take the class. It is amazing.",
    "You can't understand American history without this class. Every American citizen should know what this class teaches. Depending on what you (think you) know already, it may well reshape your view of the world, in particular with regards to race. And David Blight is amazing."
