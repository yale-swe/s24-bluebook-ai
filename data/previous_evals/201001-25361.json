    "Deb is hilarious and supportive - it's worth working with her at some point while you're at yale. Careful though...once you're on her good side, she'll start asking you for favors. But she's so fun to hang out with that you'll probably want to take her up on her requests.It's hard to describe this class, it'll be different every year. Didn't learn a ton about the performance of that time, but learned a lot about my own relationship with performance. It was definitely freeing, I'm happy to have taken it.",
    "This class explores the performance art movement that developed downtown in the 80s and 90s, and culminates in a production. It is a wonderful class that I highly recommend. The material is engaging and Deb is phenomenal\u0097one of the best professors anywhere and if you have the opportunity to take any of her courses do it. She has inspired me in so many ways and influenced my life far beyond the classroom. This class is fun, interesting, and overall wonderful. The first portion of the class will combine readings, presentations, and visits from esteemed guests, leading into a collaborative production that was such a great experience. We staged Critical Mass, one of Deb's brilliant plays. This was an awesome class. Take it!",
    "Highly recommended. The culminating production of Critical Mass is what made the class for me, but even just the genre's material was fascinating. Take it for the literature, take it for Deb.",
    "THST 381 starts off studying the performance art of the 80s and 90s and then quickly moved into rehearsals, which continued to focus on techniques and style based from the period of study. It's a great class for those interested in theater, who are interested in trying something beyond the traditional dramatic scope."
