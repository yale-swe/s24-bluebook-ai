    "Yes.",
    "Yes! Great teachers (sometimes) - talk to people taking lessons about getting a good one. AND easy grade.",
    "If you can take voice lessons for credit, do it!! It's an amazing way to learn about your voice and get credit for it!",
    "Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely take voice lessons for credit if you're remotely interested. If you have a teacher half as good as David Leigh, you'll make dramatic improvements to your voice faster than you thought possible, and you'll come off the semester feeling far more confident in your vocal ability. It's only an hour a week (unless you arrange for extra rehearsals with your teacher, which you should), and the only \"work\" required is casually rehearsal on your own every now and then, and if you're making progress, you'll be happy to take a few (and I mean only a few) minutes every day to practice. And what's more, it's a full, relatively easy credit with immediate results. I'd highly recommend this to anyone!",
    "If you can sing, definitely take this class. It is fun, and you will learn a lot about your voice. Even if you think you know everything, you probably don't and you will find yourself a better singer if you put the time and effort into it."
