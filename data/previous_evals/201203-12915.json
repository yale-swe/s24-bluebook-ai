    "Russ 130 is a good review of basic Russian but also pushes into more complex topics. I'd definitely recommend it, especially if Irina is teaching it again.",
    "Russian 130 is a great L3 class, especially for students who place into it as freshmen. The class moves at an excellent pace and I would say that I learned more Russian in this one semester than I did in two years of high school. The homework is also very doable and does not add too much stress to your daily life.",
    "It's a class for intermediate Russian students looking to improve upon the basics. If a student wants to improve in Russian, I absolutely recommend the class.",
    "I really love the Russian program here at Yale. I enjoy going to class, which for me is a very odd sentiment. Take a Russian language class while at Yale - you won't regret it.",
    "I would recommend Russian 130 1 to another student, but it is a lot of daily work."
