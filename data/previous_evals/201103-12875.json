    "A wonderful wonderful survey of very important subjects. TAKE IT!! Chauncey is the best, lectures are fun, the reading is interesting, and it is just great. I can't say enough good things",
    "I would 100% recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn more about a subject they probably don't know much. It has an unexpectedly rich history with an incredible professor that will make you so much more aware of present issues and give you a whole new outlook on the subject. Compared to other history classes, it is a very new area of research so it makes it all the more exciting to not just memorize what happened, but truly analyze the books and feel like you are discovering something new as well.",
    "This is a great course to take if you are a human being who cares about the society you live in; I strongly recommend this course for all students, gay or straight, male or female. It provides a historical context for the gay rights issues of the 21st century that all Yalies are probably faced with daily, whether they support them or not. Knowing where the current civil rights activists come from will help to put their battle into better perspective.What I took away from the readings and lectures from this class were more significant to my life during my first semester at Yale than anything I learned in the rest of my classes. I have a feeling that it will remain the most significant course I take during my time at Yale.",
    "This class is absolutely incredible. There is a lot of reading, but it is all quite gripping. Lectures are also quite good and enlightening.",
    "All students at Yale should take this class. It's a fantastic experience...don't miss it!",
    "This is probably one of the best classes I've ever taken. Everything about it is amazing. Take it!",
    "Take this class. Just take it. Take it with friends so that studying for it is more fun but definitely take it. You won't regret it and you will leave feeling as though you know so much that you never even could have dreamed of. Chauncey is a great and engaging lecturer and the subject matter is fascinating. The workload is manageable and interesting (2 papers, midterm and final). My section leader was also great which really enriched my course experience. But definitely take it.",
    "Absolutely. This is an amazing class. If you think you even might be the tiniest bit interested - check it out. Chauncey is wonderful, there is a very reasonable amount of work and the lectures are fascinating. It will really take you by surprise.",
    "Take this class. This will be THE defining social issue of our time, and Chauncey presents it compellingly and with a great deal of depth. It will change your opinions and deepen your thought about gay issues. It's a great class even if you're not into gay issues, as it grounds itself well in more general American history.",
    "Absolutely; to all students, of every creed, race, and orientation. Particularly if you're of an \"Other\" persuasion.",
    "This class is a survey course in Gay and Lesbian History in the United States and is structured like lots of other history classes at Yale: weekly readings (not too long), two papers (your choice of three), a midterm, and a final. That being said: TAKE IT! Need the distribution credits? Take it. Need another class to round out your schedule? Take it. Don't think you're interested in LGBT history? Take it (even if you're straight). Seriously, you won't regret it.",
    "Well, on one level, the course is exactly what you'd expect from a class called \"U.S. Lesbian and Gay History,\" but at the same time, it's so much more: you come to understand how queer history intersects with the mainstream in ways you might not expect. I would certainly recommend this class to others.",
    "This is a standard History\/American Studies course. Chauncey is a great guy and some of the lectures are very interesting but I felt overall the course was very monolithic and didn't really provide a nuanced overview of the various perspectives and experiences of gay and lesbian history. The movies are excellent and the readings are very good. I would recommend it to a freshmen or sophomore looking to get their feet wet in this kind of cultural history but warn an upperclassmen that they might find it to be a little boring at times.",
    "U.S. lesbian and gay history provides an overview of the history of gays and lesbians, mostly in the 20th century. The class is informative but a survey, and contains a lot of broad information. I would recommend gay history to another student, as it's a great class that's always surprising and interesting.",
    "It wasn't my favorite class, but I'd recommend it.",
    "It is a nice course, with very nice reading materials, you'd better do all the reading.",
    "GREAT.",
    "Take this class. It will change the way u think about things.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to every Yale student. You will learn so much and have a great time doing it!",
    "Absolutely. This is up there with Civil War and Art History as the best lectures I've taken at Yale, and the subject is fascinating. An awesome awesome class. And, it's really not very hard...2 papers a midterm and a final but all are very fair and straightforward.",
    "This class is a must take. The material is so fascinating, the professor cares so much about thecourse and his students, and I feel as though I've learned so much about something that is really important to my identity. Few classes come with a personal journey; this one does. Start the essays early and try to hand in drafts if possible--that way you can do as well as possible. The exams aren't that bad, but you need to focus on what could be an ID and on understanding some parts of the course very, very well. Also, shop around for a good TA. I had a great one, and it really made all the difference.",
    "The class was a look at an aspect of history that is often overlooked. It will change your outlook on United States history.I would absolutely recommend the class - it was fascinating and well-taught. it's definitely not just a class for people who identify as LGBTQ, and you should definitely take it before you graduate.",
    "US gay history. It's really good in some ways- the lectures are really engaging, most of the readings are really interesting. The thesis of the class is basically that there have been queer people in the past forming communities and being awesome. I think it's the perfect class for a gay freshman or sophomore who was closeted or bullied in high school or generally felt alone. However, if you want amore complicated or analytical take on the history, it might disappoint you. I loved the class, but it's more like Uncle Chauncey telling you about all the gay people who came before you in a story rather than a history class. Also- pay attention to the different ways he treats gay men and the way he treats gay women. He obviously likes men more than women, and it comes through in lecture if you pay attention to it, but I can't really fault him for that. Take this class though! Everyone should! Just go into it without huge expectations.",
    "Everyone should take this class.",
    "This is a fun, engaging way to look at the last 100+ years of history. It's information that isn't widely taught and a unique subset of history that does a great job to map unto the wider information you've been taught. There is a lot of reading, but you really don't have to do all of it and the papers aren't super difficult, but can be rewarding. THIS IS A MUST TAKE YALE CLASS.",
    "TAKE IT. It may be of more personal interest to LGBTQ individuals, but equally valuable is the additional perspective it gives you about American History, an alternate timeline grounded in a social and civil rights process that is often ignored. George Chauncey is just the most precious lecturer. The TF's are excellent.Just so you know, the reading is just too much. Just too much. And the TFs grade on the harsh side (at least mine did), so don't expect to BS your way through papers. They expected intensive and thoughtful synthesis and analysis of which I, given my other obligations, was incapable. I should have CR\/D\/Failed this class. But I have no other regrets.",
    "It's a fun, low-stress lecture that a lot of people take. Weekly reading is about 100-150 pages and you choose two out of three papers. Theres a midterm and a final that are both typical history tests: IDs, essay, and on the final, quote IDs. All of it is manageable, would probably be good for someone who's not used to humanities courses or someone taking her first history class at Yale.",
    "It is an awesome course. The subject matter is very interesting and well taught and the workload is completely manageable.",
    "I think every single queer\/LGBT individual at Yale must take this course. It is really a class that you can relate to, teaches you more about how to think about your own life, and a place where you meet other queer individuals who you can bond intellectually with. I definitely recommend this to ALL students - straight and gay alike - because it is super interesting, engaging and something we all have to think about as we move into the 21st century.",
    "I would recommend it, just because it is probably one of the few chances you get to learn LGBT if you are not a WGSS major. It is also really important to look at the materials in terms of time periods. For me, I did not keep track of the timeline and it wasn't until the end of the term that I pulled everything back together. Also, readings. A lot of readings.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. You won't have any regrets, I promise. Chauncey is an amazing lecturer - super engaging, and he truly cares about his students! There's a decent amount of reading, but it's all really interesting. Easily the best class I've taken at Yale!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Chauncey's great and the lectures are really entertaining and informing.",
    "An amazing, fun, worthwhile class that you would be foolish not to take before graduation. It opens up a whole world to you that you may not have known even existed.",
    "Obviously an amazing, impactful course to take no matter who you are. There is quite a bit of reading involved, so I took it Credit\/D, but I think I would have gotten even more out of it if I did the reading. But, if you are thinking about adding it on to your course load and aren't sure you have time for all the readings, don't hesitate, because the lectures are 100% worth it.",
    "Gay + Lesbian History with Chauncey is a phenomenal course. A must-take for history\/american studies majors in my opinion. Chaunceyis one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale - he is passionate and thoughtful and incredibly insightful. This course is a bit reading heavy, but you don't need to do it all to do well. The paper assignments are very straightforward as is the midterm and final; if you put in the work, you'll do well.This course is mostly white gay history with some lesbian history thrown in, so if you're looking to learn a lot about black or latino gays and lesbians, this course may not be for you. This is a function of current scholarship (which is very sparse in the multicultural homosexual arena) plus Chauncey's slight bias towards the history he knows, that of white gay males. This didn't bother me, but it might bother others.Overall this is a great lecture course. I highly recommend it.The movies are well chosen and the lectures cover a wide range of topics to give you a complete social and cultural history of gays and lesbians in America.",
    "This is the best class I've ever taken at Yale. Chauncey isabsolutely amazing. His lectures will make you change the way you look at gender, sexuality and social construction. This class goes far beyond the history of gays and lesbians in the United States. Absolutely brilliant. It will change your life. TAKE IT.",
    "I'm sure every other review says \"best class at Yale.\" That may be true for some, but I don't think it's necessarily correct. It was a fantastic class, to be sure, and Chauncey is a hugely respected giant in the field who is also a great lecturer, which is not common enough here. The workload was manageable, too.However, though it's a good intro history survey course, it is SO biased. To be expected. There's a lot of social theory mixed into the history (that should be in a social science class instead), and no point of view on the other side of the debate is ever validated. Even, for example, sexual promiscuity is seen as liberating, natural, and good.I found, interestingly, that the things I learned, for example about how to approach primary sources, were much more applicable to my other history classes, which is not a bad thing at all.I'm more interested in feminism because of this class. I'll probably take another WGSS course. But I'll probably stick to more history-based history classes!Finally, Chauncey is so nice and wonderful. He goes to lunch with students and everything. However, you get this weird feeling that though he's genuinely interested in your wellbeing, he's really interested in what you have to say and what you write because of what it means for his research. I felt like a guinea pig at some points. I also felt forced to apply what he said in class to what my family said (for the last paper, which you HAVE to do!), which I don't think is the way you should approach history.",
    "Definitely a class worth taking. Learn so much new material that you probably will not get a chance to be acquainted with otherwise.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to other students. Even though the reading gets to be a little much, the history taught in this course is one that every Yalie needs to learn at some point in their lives. It offers a completely different view of wide window of time than most high schools would allow.",
    "You listen to a lecture for 50 minutes while taking notes that you WILL BE TESTED ON. The lectures are good.You read several portions of books that are usually boring or stupid (I'm looking at you, Zami<<big black strong womyn who don't need no man>>).You watch three movies which are actually great and I'm very fond of them. Harvey Milk left the whole auditorium bawling.Discussion section can be good depending on what kind of lesbian womyn you get stuck with. If it's the anti-monogamy radical who is currently on the last year of writing her dissertation, then good luck lol.Also, as someone who actually did the readings, I'll mention that this course had a heavier course workload than my other classes. :\/",
    "Take it. Chauncey is brilliant and his lectures are often incredibly moving, plus so much of this material will actually be entirely new to you, as the subject is one that's been so thoroughly erased from the historical record. You'll be so glad you did, I promise.",
    "Great class, highly reccomended. Gives you a really great understanding of American cultural history as it relates to sex, family, and love.",
    "An AWESOME history class. Something that makes Yale really special is classes like these...Chauncey is an amazing (and hilarious!) professor. Not too much work, interesting to go to lecture, and writing essays and studying for testsis fun and not at all tedious.",
    "Regardless of how you identify, this class is worth taking. You don't really learn this stuff anywhere else.",
    "A must take in your years at Yale! You won't regret it. Fairly easy work load, extremely interesting topic, and phenomenal teacher. George Chauncey is phenomenal. If you can't take it, audit it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course -- it's one of those courses that you have to talk at Yale, no matter what.",
    "You should take this course before you graduate. Yale is called the Gay Ivy for a reason, and Chauncey (who went to Yale) analyzes both the country and Yale through history. The lectures are awesome and even in you take it Credit\/D and don't do most of the reading, you'll still get a lot out of it.",
    "This class is a great survey class on LGBT history. Take it if you want to understand more about this esoteric field of studies. Most importantly, this field shows\/introduces one to the importance of good historical arguments. Professor Chauncey makes exhaustive use of primary sources [songs,films, movies, interviews, diaries, journals,newspapers) to make compelling arguments on historical changes in LGBT history. Even if you are not impressed by the fascinating content, or the great style of lecture, you must be impressed by the depth of his research and the cogency of his arguments. Highly recommended.Class load is manageable (2 essays of 5-6 pages each, 1 mid terms, 1 finals.) The only qualm I have is the readings which can be a little heavy. In fact, the finals contains a section that requires students to identity quotes from specific readings. This can get a little daunting especially for those students who are not good with specific\/rote memorization. Otherwise, as long as you keep up with lectures, sections and participate actively, this is a manageable class.",
    "This is a class that will never let you down. Chauncey is amazing, the material (whether or not it interest you) will be made relevant, and you cannot regret taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is genuinely interested in learning about lesbian and gay history. I guarantee that what you learn will surprise you! Just keep in mind that this is a very reading-heavy course!",
    "Lecture is fascinating, You do need to attend class because Professor Chauncey does not post his lectures online.",
    "this is a MUST-TAKE at yale. prof. chauncey is an incredible lecturer and a leader in this area of study... the information is also pertinent to society today. 2 short papers, a midterm, and a final - reading is fascinating. the papers are REALLY fun to do. completely changes the way you think about gender\/sexuality in any other course.",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History is a jam-packed, fantastically comprehensive account of gay life in America, touching on the experiences of every sex, gender, race, social class and ethnic group over a 400-year timeline. I would absolutely recommend the course to all students - it covers an enormous part of American history completely omitted from the standard high school U.S. History textbook, and thoroughly explains the historical basis for the actions of a group of people more relevant than ever in 2011.",
    "This course deserves its reputation as one of Yale's best lecture courses. I would recommend this class to everyone.",
    "I know people say this often, but this is probably the only time I'll say this and mean it: this class should be required for everyone at Yale. Chauncey is so clearly at the forefront of his academic field, and every lecture is chock-full of incredibly nuanced and thorough history. He is devoted to giving his students a holistic picture of every time and event he presents, as is evidenced by the readings and films he uses to supplement his lectures. The course is also richly imbued with Yale history--one of the benefits of a course taught by a lifelong Yale scholar. He is funny, engaging, and kind--and there will be moments in lecture when his passionate and earnest handling of the subject matter moves you (probably to tears). Plus, who doesn't love a class this begins and ends each lecture with a surround-sound anthem for the day? Professor Chauncey had a soundtrack for his lectures, and I always felt awake and happy in the morning, with his carefully-selected danceable tracks stuck in my head on my way out of class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student in a heartbeat. It's one of those must-take courses at Yale.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. I have no criticisms. The workload was just right, the lectures were amazing, the readings were very good for the most part. I learned a lot and found it entertaining at the same time. George Chauncey is awesome!! Take this course before you graduate.",
    "It's a great deal of fun, and an accessible way into some of the most interesting historical developments of the 19th and 20th centuries in America. There is a fair amount of theoretical content as well as historical content, which I enjoyed but may not be for everyone.",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History gives students insight into an historical thread largely ignored by culture at large. As a gay man, I found it crucial for understanding my place in American history, but for straight people as well, it's important insight into sexual politics.",
    "This course is a great introduction to US lesbian and gay history. Lectures are fast-paced and interesting, especially with the wonderful Professor Chauncey. The reading load is somewhat heavy (but is discussed in section every week), and there are two papers in addition to a midterm and a final. I absolutely loved this class, and would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter. Be aware that you need to go to lecture to really enjoy this course to the fullest!",
    "It' an interesting class, Chauncey is a good lecturer and class is enjoyable though readings are sometimes boring \/ excessive. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a fun extra class but definitely not a must take.",
    "Just take it. I really cannot speak highly enough of it. This will end up being one of your favorite classes at Yale guaranteed.",
    "YES TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT BEFORE YOU GRADUATE. Does not matter whether you are LGBT or how liberal (or not) you think you are. This will completely change your perspective of American history as you know it. It is not just a class of gay men--that is false. Take it no matter what!!",
    "I would definitely take it if you're interested in the material. There is a lot of reading, and you're expected to know it for the exams, but Chauncey is an incredible, engaging lecturer!",
    "This is a class that has a pretty light workload, and is relatively easy even if you're not a history major. The topic is interesting, and I learned a lot that I did not know before taking it.",
    "This is a fun and fascinating class. It covers US gay history very thoroughly and really provides a broader history of sexuality in this country while doing so. Chauncey is a clear and effective lecturer and unequivocally a leader in his field; he brings a lot to lecture and presents it very well. He's also a warm and engaging presence and is willing to meet one-on-one. There's a lot of reading but never a truly unmanageable amount, and it's pretty easy to pick out the most important things to read when necessary. Papers and final aren't bad at all, and the oral history paper is a really amazing assignment. Definitely don't be discouraged to take it if you're straight; it might even be better suited to straight people.",
    "You may actually be obligated to take this class. This is the kind of history that needs to be taught in high school curricula but that you almost certainly don't know. Take this class because you care about history, take it because Chauncey is a great lecturer, take it because you're an activist, take it because you want to be an activist, take it because you don't understand what the gays are complaining about, take it because you don't know why on earth anyone would oppose gay marriage, take it because you're queer and you want Chauncey to be your role model, take it because you're straight and you want Chauncey to be your role model, take it to understand yourself and the people you love and why you are the way you are better. Seriously, just take it.",
    "Take this class. If you take one class, make it this one. It doesn\u0092t matter if you\u0092re a seasoned WGSS major or a straight boy who\u0092s not really comfortable with all of this\u0097take this class. Nowhere else at Yale is there such a fantastic opportunity to understand the history of the US, the lives of gay people, a hidden history of Yale, or the modern gay rights movement. You will leave class roaring with laughter at jokes about Harry, Ron, and Hermione having illicit threesomes, openly weeping about everything that was lost in the AIDS epidemic, but most of all having engaging conversations about topics that had never occurred to you. Professor Chauncey will revolutionize the way that you see the world. You will connect with your peers in ways that you never thought you could in a lecture. You will never regret it. Take this class.",
    "Not nearly as great as it's cracked up to be. The volume of reading is enormous, and for all practical purposes, you're responsible for all of it when it comes to the IDs on the exams. This is a great class to take Credit\/D; if you do, you'll learn a lot without having to put up with the shenanigans in the class. Chuancey is a great lecturer but has a slightly pretentious style of lecturing, and the quality of your TA is really hit or miss.",
    "Stop. Right now. If you're on OCI, find the little + button. Click it. You are taking this course.I would recommend this course to anybody who is interested in learning about some of the issues that define our time, and even if you aren't interested you will be. It's not too much work, but is utterly fascinating and fun. Take it, dammit.",
    "Interesting course. The lectures are great and section is fun. I would definitely suggest it",
    "One of the top 5 classes offered at Yale and you don't even have to apply or fight upperclassmen to get into it. George is the best and he'll really try to get to know you if you just email him and ask him to come to lunch with 4-5 other students. His lectures are amazing, you don't actually need to do ALL of the reading (read all the articles but skim the books if you don't have the time, except for Gay new york). This is definitely the best class I've taken so far at Yale. MUST TAKE!!!",
    "Learn about gay and lesbian history in America since the colonial period, but heavily focused on 20th century urban history. Chauncey does a good job of tracking the different experiences of minority groups and lesbians from white gay men. Take the course! You won't regret it. A short autobiographical essay atthebeggining,two shortessays, a midterm and final. Very doable.",
    "A really important class. Take it.",
    "It has the reputation as being one of the classes students must take before they graduate, and it is deserved.",
    "It is a must-take course if you have a slight interest in LGBT studies, and you absolutely should take it even more if you are queer, because you will find a great community here.",
    "U.S. Gay&Lesbian history is a course that seeks to present the American history from a traditionally under-appreciated perspective. Not only does the class do a phenomenal job of captivating students' attention, but it ensures that they learn of movements and events that have been otherwise removed from popular memory. The workload of the class is not anything vastly different from other humanities courses, and the readings are more than manageable if one keeps up with them on a weekly basis. I highly, highly recommend this course to anyone seeking a change of pace in their course load or for those looking to gain a historical perspective on the emergence of homosexuality.",
    "This class was my favorite class all semester. It was a joy to be in it. It challenged me in ways that I had not previously been challenged, but made the experience enjoyable and fascinating. This class has changed my perspective on gay culture and the gay community. Seeing where it had come from to where it is now has changed the way I see the dynamic between the gay community and society as a whole and also gives me hope for societal acceptance of homosexuality.I hope that EVERYONE has an opportunity to take this class. It is applicable to everyone and you will walk out enlightened afterwards.",
    "Please, please, do yourselves a favor and TAKE THIS CLASS. It is hands down the best class I've taken at Yale. You will learn (and retain) so much, not only about gay history, but about American history.Professor Chauncey is a fantastic lecturer who cares a lot about his students. He organizes lunches with some of his students and makes an effort to get to know them. He's also one of the most renowned historians on this subject and actually testified as an expert witness in the Prop. 8 trials in California. Yale is so lucky to have him. Take this class.The papers are actually fun to write - when else will you have the opportunity to interview your grandparents about the gay people they knew growing up? The readings are fascinating and the work is super doable. Everyone in this country should be required to study gay history. There are plenty of straight people in the course, too, so don't let that be a barrier to taking it!",
    "Excellent overview of gay history in America. The lectures were always interesting, and Prof. Chauncey was always engaging. The readings were heavy at times, but always enlightening. If you are gay at Yale, you'd be remiss not to take it during your undergraduate career.",
    "A great course, but not thelife-changer that people seem to think it is. Maybe if you've never taken a WGSS course before and are wowed by the idea that sexuality is a spectrum this class will be transformative. Still, an excellent class, even if just for the discussion groups with a mix of gay and straight students - fantastic and interesting way to learn more about both gay history and Yale's student body. I would recommend this class to other students, but don't expect it to blow your mind. Except for the fact that Chauncey has pretty much changed American history (Google Lawrence v. Texas), which just about makes it worth taking the class just for that.",
    "SHOP IT.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, and already have to many people. I usually talk about how amazing the professor is and how enlightening the course material is.",
    "Great lecture to take! Professor Chauncey and the TFs are wonderful and really dedicated. The material is interesting most of the time, and the course will give you a new way of thinking about the world, especially if its your first WGSS class.",
    "This class is great! Gay history is really interesting and the things you learn in this class will change the way you understand American history and gay peoples' places in it. Chauncey is a wonderful professor and, more than I've seen in a lecture class professor, genuinely cares about his students. Be motivated on your own to do the reading, though. It's good, but doesn't get brought up in class much.",
    "Take it. You might be a biomedical engeneering or economics major, but you'll still love this class.",
    "Definitely take this class if the subject interests you! Probably one of the most interesting classes at Yale.",
    "A fantastic course - take it before you graduate. Consistently interesting, and Chauncey is an incredible lecturer.",
    "I took this course credit\/d and really enjoyed it. The lectures are the bulk of the class material, and readings supplement it nicely but aren't always crucial. Chauncey is just fantastic and makes the material come alive. He's also really committed to getting to know his students, even in such a large lecture.",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay history is a great class--take it! Professor Chauncey is a wonderful lecturer: funny and engaging while communicating complicated ideas in a very comprehensible and fluid manner. Even though it's a survey course, it never feels rushed, and you'll come out with knowledge that is both wide and deep.",
    "It was a really interesting course. The lectures were cool. I definitely learned about things I had never heard of before. I'd recommend this course.",
    "Take it. Even if you're not gay. It's the best, and it's easy. If it gets a research paper component, it'll be even better. But if you are gay, take it. Careful with the last paper though, it can be awks.",
    "I would recommend this to ANY student. For the more Science-inclined students, perhaps credit-d this course. You learn a lot, and it all is fascinating.",
    "As everyone else will tell you, this couse is essential Yale. It's the kind of class you don't really get anywhere else. Chauncey is the rock star of gay history and he's beenan expert witness in the past decade's biggest gay rights cases. He knows his stuff. If you're gay, take it. If you're straight, take it. If you're a freshman, take it. If you're a senior, take it. There's an amazing project toward the end of the semester. You interview your parents and grandparents about their experiences with, attitudes toward, and understandings of gay people (and don't worry if you don't feel safe talking to them about this; the TFs and your classmates are sensitive to this and will help connect you with other people to interview). I learned so much from this. I cannot espouse the virtues of this class enough.",
    "An extremely worthwhile (if massive) lecture, carried not only by the intelligence and charisma of Professor Chauncey, but also the devotion and sharpness of the class TAs. Despite opinions I have heard to the contrary, I thought the course very effectively covered women's issues and the identities of queer racial minorities, especially given limits of previous scholarship.Of the \"much-hyped big lectures,\" I think this is one of the best. Be prepared for a pretty significant reading load (around 125-150 pages a week), which varies substantially in quality throughout the semester. Nevertheless, highly recommended. Sections are great because people in the class genuinely want to be there, and so are enthusiastic about the material."
