    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course",
    "This is a really well designed course to get an overview of many of the issues facing African nations and doing so by looking at particular case studies of various countries and their particular approach to the issues. Baldwin does a great job at making all of the reading relevant, interesting, and manageable. Overall, the workload is fair and grading is tough, but the grade scale makes things very fair. She is good at giving constructive feedback. Also, Baldwin really makes a great effort to make it an interactive lecture so that it isn't just sitting around the entire time. The in class activities make you follow whats going on but also really help you understand the issues.",
    "Awesome class! Totally manageable workload, Professor Baldwin is awesome and the material covered is captivating!!! Take it! :-)",
    "Its a good course in terms of structure and content, pre requisite for this course is that students must be very much interested in the Africa subject matter.",
    "Interesting study of the problems which effect development in general and specifically in Africa. Some interesting readings. Would recommend to somebody interested in poli sci or African studies even neither are your major.",
    "I would not recommend this course to those seeking a dynamic class experience. It will teach some important basics of African political science, and for that it could be useful.",
    "I would recommend this course because it's a well-structured introduction to African politics."
