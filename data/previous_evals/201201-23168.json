   "comments": [
    "Take it! Credit-D is the way to go though.",
    "Absolutely. The work is interesting, lecture is actually entertaining, and the tests are manageable. I loved this class!",
    "definitely a good class if you're not looking for a lot of work on a daily basis, but the exams are difficult.",
    "Awesome class! No need to do readings, just read the wikipedia page. For midterm\/final, make sure to memorize all the small details of every slide, because they matter",
    "Great class. Good variety of information and awesome professor. Fair grading--midterm, final, final paper, quizzes (best 3 of 5 count).",
    "ABSOLUTELY",
    "Yes!! Come take it even if you don't care about psych at all. This class changes your way of looking at the world.",
    "Santos is a big deal and she knows it. She kills this class and makes it very interesting. Certainly not an easy A (the final\/midterm are a bit challenging) but a great Credit\/D.",
    "Interesting class, REALLY tricky tests which was annoying, otherwise it was fine. You don't really have to do the readings. Problem sets + quizzes were pretty easy. Do go to class though.",
    "Do not take this course if you've already taken any courses about evolution. There is a lot of overlap with Intro Bio Anthro.",
    "I found it to be fairly easy (esp. since I'm taking it CR\/D), but super useful and relevant. Definitely recommend.",
    "Honestly, not that great. Each lecture only covers a few main points, many of which don't seem relevant to the larger picture of the course. It's definitely fun--you learn a lot about evolution and the animal kingdom, but it's not a psych course and not a human nature course. It also is not about sex, but about the consequences of sexual reproduction.Kind of a \"high school\" course in its structure. If you really want to do it then take it credit\/d\/fail and just go along for the ride. Lecture is entertaining and taking it credit\/d is pretty easy (just study for the exams, don't do the readings).",
    "Sure, take it, it's easy.",
    "Take this class. Pretty easy if you study, tons of fun, and I looked forward to the lectures every week.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The workload is very manageable. Readings aren't too bad. 5 quizzes during the semester, but you know the questions in advance. Exams not too bad. And this class is just FUN!",
    "Yes, but if you're taking it for a grade acknowledge that it will be a time consuming class. It's not the type of class you take with DS, for example.Otherwise, take it Credit\/D\/Fail and you'll love it for sure.",
    "Easy gut with interesting material and you don't have to go to class (you just have to read the notes she prepares before class). Take for easy 4th\/5th credit.",
    "This class is fantastic. Take it! I thought I had no interest in non-human primates but this class is so much about humans and even the animal parts are incredible. If you have a good background in evolution you'll find the beginning of the course a little boring and basic but the end makes it totally worth it.",
    "Great class! Absolutely recommend it. Super interesting, not too much work, and an overall good time. It's especially good as a fifth class.",
    "Really great class, amazing professor, really interesting topics covered. This has been my favorite class at Yale so far.",
    "really fun class but can be deceptively hard.",
    "Sexy Psych is basically about how our evolutionary history affects our current human mating system and sexual culture and is taught almost entirely through pop culture references.There's a lot of readings (which you can of course, not read) and a one-question quiz almost every week (which is taken directly from our weekly optional PSet), and not only do all of the powerpoints of the lectures go online, but Professor Santos also gives us notes on each lecture before class even starts (which also double as an awesome study guide).It is an incredible course, with an incredible professor, and you should DEFINITELY TAKE IT. This class is one of the most popular on campus, and it deserves all of the hype and attention that it gets. Santos is the greatest lecturer I've had at Yale so far, and from the 5-minute standing ovation she got after her last lecturer, I think mostly everyone else will say the same.",
    "PSYC 171 is an overview of how sex and evolution relate to each other, and ultimately, how they create human nature. I would highly recommend this course with Professor Santos, as the lectures were entertaining and the material was interesting. The reading isn't essential to doing well as the professor covers all of the material in lecture well enough to understand the concepts. The research project near the end of the semester was also a great alternative to a typical research paper.",
    "Definitely!!",
    "Take this class!",
    "I would recommend this class, especially to a non-psych major. Santos is great, but there's a lot of overlap with other psych classes (into, cogsci, moralities, philosophy&science of human nature).",
    "great class if you don't know about evolution. it'll change the way you look at the world. evolution is a beautiful thing, it's fun to understand. class is fun.",
    "good class.",
    "Absolutely, take it. Little work, lots of fun. The curve isn't the easiest in the world, but you can do just fine if you just put in a little bit of effort. Also, the reading is minimally tested.",
    "3 Laurie Santos3This class has it all: amazing lecturer, fascinating material, and a class-structure that prevents it from ever being really stressful.Take it!The lectures are so well taught that the quizzes and tests don't require a lot of studying, and the bit of studying you do have to do is on interesting stuff, so it's not bad.There are 5 quizzes, but only your 3 best are counted. A midterm and a cumulative final (1\/3 material on pre-midterm stuff). Also, you can do perfectly well without reading the 3 assigned books (just make sure you get their main themes).And once again,3 Laurie Santos3",
    "Lots of this class seemed to be oriented around Ecology more than Psychology. Certainly interested but not exactly what I would think of as a class on human nature.",
    "Take the class! It's super interesting and not labor intensive at all.",
    "GREAT class. Really fun. Relevant material, lectures are interesting for the most part and the class applies to your life. Grading is fair, and there is enough stuff to balance out the midterm and final. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",
    "Amazing class, if you are at all interested in the subject matter definitely take it. Laurie Santos is awesome, and its not much work.",
    "TAKE IT. WITH LAURIE.if you have any interest in human sexuality on an evolutionary sense this is the class for you. I took it credit D and it was the perfect level of work and interestingness.",
    "A really good course. A definite must take. It puts things into perspective for you. It should be a good follow-up to Intro to Psych.",
    "This course was fantastic. It provided a comprehensive overview of everything from evolutionary theory to mating systems to cultural development. Everyday provided some new interesting topic, and there was never a dull moment. I feel as though I learned a lot, and I definitely recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "YES! During my time here, I've taken a bunch of the \"classic\" Yale lectures (Blight, Nemerov, Chauncey), and I honestly think this one was the best. And I'm a history person. Professor Santos is so awesome and her lectures are incredible. Plus, the material is really cool and pertinent. It's also not too hard. TAKE IT ABSOLUTELY.",
    "YES. It is fun, interesting, and I found myself relaying a lot of what I learned in class to my friends during mealtimes.",
    "I definitely recommend this course! Take it!! Very manageable and super interesting!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It is not taught every year, so if you have the chance to take it now, you really should. It is a truly amazing experience with a WONDERFUL professor who really loves what she is doing. Laurie Santos will inspire you. Don't miss out on this one.",
    "Yes! See everything above.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class! It was so good, and not too heavy of a workload either. You have 5 1-question quizzes (the question comes from a problem set you get a week ahead of time), 2 of which are dropped; a midterm and a final, and a 5-7 page project\/paper which was really fun to do! Laurie Santos is also a fantastic lecturer! My favorite class at Yale so far.",
    "Great course that EVERYONE should take while they're here! It's interesting and a lot of fun while being pretty laid back. Prof Santos is the cutest most engaging lecturer, and I can honestly say that I never wanted to miss a class! The quizzes are pretty easy and the midterm and final are fairly straightforward. DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "TAKE IT. it's a fun change of pace and professor santos is a really amazing lecturer.",
    "YES!!! So interesting, exciting, and Laurie Santos is a GODDESS!!! Not as easy as it sounds, exams are not a joke so make sure you go to lecture and study.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. There's a reason professor Santos got a standing ovation on the last day of class. She's amazing. Basically, sexy psych is everything you want in a class: you learn a lot (and so much of it is applicable to daily life), it isn't too much work (really), and the professor is SO COOL. I looked forward to the lectures every week.",
    "Definitely take this class!",
    "I would recommend it to any psych majors looking to expand their knowledge in the science part of the major",
    "An excellent class! Take it! You will learn so much and have a good deal of fun along the way.",
    "This is a great 5th class. It is interesting and engaging and you learn really cool things. I will say, don't take it too lightly, it will be more work than you think, and you may want to take it Credit\/D unless you are dedicated to doing the reading and studying well for the exams. Professor Santos is amazing though!",
    "I would definitely recommend Psych 171 to another student. However I think it is important to know (as Professor Santos announced in one of the first lectures) that the class is not all about sex, which is what a lot of people falsely think. There is merely a section about sex and the rest is based around evolution. Nevertheless, I very much enjoyed the course.",
    "THIS CLASS IS AWESOME! The only thing that would make it better is if it were a Sc credit. There's so much science in it, it's strange but from some of my conversations it seems the \"real\" science departments got jealous...Regardless, this class is extremely interesting. You learn starting from basic evolution stuff, so people with a lot of bio background may find it boring at first BUT it really gives you a great basis when we get to the Human Nature part. Really, so interesting, if you have the chance take it, especially with Laurie Santos GREATEST PERSON EVER and Rumpus 50 Most holla!Here's the breakdown of the grades:-5 quizzes, you drop your two lowest scores AND you know the question because it's always one from the optional problem sets-a midterm-a final-a research paper, which you can gather data for in one day and write another..TA DA! best. class. ever.",
    "Take it if you want an interesting class about the human mating system from a more psych\/biological perspective.",
    "PSYC 171 is a great time, doesn't require a lot of work, and Professor Santos is super fun. I would recommend the class as a Credit\/D ONLY, because you really won't come away with much. It's a fabulous fifth class and it's a fabulous way to get a credit, but not necessarily a class that will change your life.",
    "This class attempts to cover too much psychology in one semester to teach you anything. The powerpoints are shiny, but you will leave the class wondering what exactly you learned (the answer is very little). You get very little out of this class, and to make matters worse, the questions on the test are a mix of random facts, obscure passages from reading, and \"gotcha\" questions that really don't test what you learned (which makes sense, because you didn't learn enough for a test). If you're interested in evolution, take a real science class; if you're interested in psychology, take another psych class; and if you're interested in sex, have some.",
    "This is a GREAT class. Take it.",
    "I believe this is the last semester that the class was offered but if you have any chance definitely TAKE IT!! This class was so much FUN and applicable. It's actually changed how I think about evolution and human nature, especially love and warfare. Also Professor Santos is hands down one of the best professors I've had at Yale. Her enthusiasm is catching and she has a great sense of humor.",
    "There is very little real science in this class - a lot of theories, but they are all sort of fuzzy without any solid data.",
    "It depends. If you've ever taken anything remotely related to this (or are reasonably well-read), it probably isn't worth your time. Molecular Anthro is a more substantive account of the evolution part, gives you a science credit, and is comparably easy. On the other hand, if you need a credit, have a Cr\/D, and want something that is perfectly enjoyable to attend but hardly un-missable, it's a pretty great pick.",
    "Absolutely take it. It's more a focus on evolution but there is some sex, don't worry. It's not hard and readings aren't really necessary. Laurie Santos is amazing and great. Take it.",
    "Psych 171 (\"sexy psych\") is a great introductory course. It's a class that talks about human nature and what human nature's roots are. The course itself is not hard: 5 quizzes, a midterm, final, and a short final project where you \"run\" your own experiment about human mating\/attraction. She posts the lectures up the next day or so, but you should definitely go to lecture! Professor Santos is incredibly energetic about the material and is a great scholar. Definitely take.",
    "Take it as an extra course. The content is just fun and interesting. However, exams are not too easy so its not a gut.",
    "This is a great, engaging, highly enjoyable course. The lectures are entertaining and funny enough that you will actually want to go (plus you'll definitely know someone in the class). It's not a gut, but certainly not too hard a class. Watch out for the midterm and final...they're tricky (study up on the power points...actually...but not the readings; they're not too necessary). I think this is only offered every couple of years, so grab it when you can!",
    "Boring boring boring class.",
    "If for no other reason, take this class simply to have a class with Prof. Santos. The content is engaging and does not carry an overwhelming amount of work. It is fascinating to see how human nature can be deconstructed and explored through biology and psychology. This is definitely a class that you will remember.",
    "PSYC 171 is an evolutionary psychology class taught by one of the best professors at Yale. If you aren't that good at science, you might struggle with this class, as most of the class has its roots in evolution. However, Prof. Santos makes everything pretty easy to understand and her lectures are among the best at Yale. Definitely take this class if you ever have the opportunity.",
    "YES. This has been my favorite class at Yale so far, and I doubt anything will dethrone it. Very fair course load, and very interesting material.",
    "Sexy Psych is an incredible course, and truly one-of-a-kind! It seamlessly integrated psychology, evolutionary biology, and even a bit of anthropology! Laurie Santos is one of the most amazing professors at Yale. She is an incredible lecturer, and despite the huge nature of the class is willing to interact with students one-on-one to help them understand anything and everything, directly from the course or only slightly related. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!",
    "It's fun! You watch the beauty of slugs mating and lions eating their young. And learn a lot about human nature and some science and psychology in the process.",
    "Really interesting class and very well taught.",
    "A great class to take regardless of whether or not you are thinking of going into psychology in the future.",
    "Yes, Laurie Santos is young and cool for a professor. Yes, this class is about sex. That said, it was way too easy and boring, all I got out of it was a couple fun facts, nothing too substantive. Guttiest gut of all time, if you're into that.",
    "Yes! It's great - fun and engaging lectures, not too much work though the tests were relatively tough",
    "Absolutely take this class. It is extremely interesting, yet still has a reasonable workload. Professor Santos is one of the best lecturers I've encountered at Yale. Just a warning: It's not all about sex, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't take it!",
    "Yes! I definitely think people should take this course if they need a fifth one, or if they want a class that is really interesting. The material is very applicable to real life--I find myself always referring back to what I learned in class when talking to people.",
    "If you're looking for a fun class, this is a great one, especially if you haven't taken intro to psych. If you have taken intro to psych, there's some overlap, but this is still a worthwhile class, and Laurie Santos is a really engaging lecturer.",
    "Did not live up to the hype. It's boring and repetitive and even though Lorie Santos is amazing, the material really was too theoretical for me to enjoy. Plus, the tests were brutal and didn't test on whether or not you understood the information. The test was more concerned with your ability to interpret ambiguous questions. SKIP IT.",
    "A bit too much on animals. Did not live up to the hype. Wish it hadn't been an hour and fifteen minutes. That said fairly easy course. Laurie Santos is an entertaining lecturer. The quizzes are easy. The paper is a terrible assignment, but doesn't take too long to complete.",
    "No. But it's not being offered again next year anyways sooo....",
    "Sex, Evolution, and Human Nature goes down pretty easy. However, for anyone with any psych background, it can get a bit dull and even sleep-inducing. Towards the end of the course, I started regretting not taking something more challenging and specific. However, after I completed the course, I started actually thinking about what we learned as it applied to my real life. And, lo and behold, what I learned about human nature really helped me understand some real-life stuff! So I suppose I recommend the class either if you don't know a thing about the subject matter, or if you're willing to actually think about what you learn in a larger context.",
    "The best. Take it. You learn a lot about evolution and psychology and Laurie is one of the most incredible professors\/people at Yale.",
    "The material presented in the class is interesting and Professor Santos is a fantastic lecturer. However the graded assignments (especially tests) are not a good indicator of what one has learned. Take this class, but not if you're really concerned about the grade you will get.",
    "Really intersting lecture course which took a look at human nature through an evolutionary lense.",
    "Yes! It is a really fun interesting class.",
    "Great Class! Take it again when it comes back in three years! It's not a lot of work, but it is also not easy!",
    "Professor Santos is a brilliant scientist and a fabulous lecturer, her talks are funny, engaging, and worth-while.The material is interesting, but definitely more science than psychology - we did not start studying humans until the very end.Take this class if it's offered again, if for nothing but the opportunity to experience a Laurie Santos lecture.",
    "Great lectures and interesting material. Laurie Santos is fun.",
    "Yes. But more so for credit\/d. The lectures are really great but the work itself is sort of boring and pedantic, and so is hard to commit to doing.",
    "Take it if you want, it's a super easy class and works great as a fifth credit. You learn some interesting stuff (more so if you're not already a psych major).",
    "Don't expect to be blown away by the depth of the material, but expect to find it really neat.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far. Laurie Santos is awesome. Take it.",
    "Take this course ONLY credit-D fail. The lectures were great and the material was interesting, but the tests were ridiculous -- really nitpicky over dumb details and incredibly subjective (e.g. two answers that were both partly right and partly wrong but one answer was 'less wrong').",
    "YES YES LAURIE SANTOS IS THE BEST.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! Absolutely. So incredibly interesting and you'll actually WANT to go to class.",
    "If you're not interested in the topic, don't take this class. Even if you are interested in the topic, you still should NOT take this class, because you will have learned almosteverything already if you care at all about evolution and human nature. (For a better introduction to the topic, I would recommend Intro to Biological Anthropology.) The material is taught at a very low level. This sounds like it might be nice (especially if you're trying to find an easy course), but you'll just be bored in class and annoyed at the poorly-written tests. This is the first course in four years I've given a rating of 'poor.' Unless the course changes a lot, please don't waste your time.",
    "Prof. Santos is a good lecturer and the material was interesting, though most of what I learned seemed pretty intuitive. Overall, the class was fun, but don't feel it's a must-take.",
    "Yes. I enjoyed lecture every day and the small quizzes on problem sets we had really helped me to understand the material.",
    "Yes",
    "A beautiful course. TAKE IT.",
    "Great course that explains why we act and behave the way we do. Stay on top of the assignments.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS, YOU WILL LOVE IT!",
    "Sure. Laurie Santos is legendary for a reason. That being said, be warned that the course material itself isn't well understood yet (once you get to the \"Human Nature\" part) and also necessitates a discussion at the end of why we should even get up in the morning. Also, take it Credit\/D and don't look back (I switched it back and wished I hadn't).",
    "This class has its ups and downs. Definitely some awesome lectures but some drop dead dull ones as well. Don't fall for the overwhelming hype or the advertising around the course. While I did learn a good amount, it's not the \"must-take\" course that it seems to be known as.",
    "If you are lucky enough to have this course offered while you are at Yale, TAKE IT!! It is absolutely fascinating, and Laurie Santos will easily engage you for the entire lecture.",
    "Of course! The class was phenomenal, the material you learn in the course is very interesting and rather applicable to life. It's also a good course to take if you're interested in Evolutionary Psychology, or even Psychology in general.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, but I wouldn't say it quite lived up to all the hype. It was interesting and I enjoyed the lectures, and if you're interested in learning about evolutionary biology\/psychology, it's probably worth taking.",
    "Take it! Professor Santos is amazing and the material is very cool. You will remember what you learn in this class for very long! Plus, lecture is super fun.",
    "Yes take it, but keep it mind it's not going to be a gut class. you actually have to study for your tests and write up a good research paper.",
    "PSYC 171 is a great course if you want to learn about evolution. A lot of your general misconceptions about the topic will be cleared. All of Professor Santos' lectures are a lot of fun. You'll watch videos in class and read interesting books. The exams are not super difficult if you attend all lectures. The final research project was fun.",
    "Take this class the most unexpectedly amazing class I have taken",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. (Skim the readings, take notes in lecture, and you'll be just fine. The paper is SO MUCH FUN.)",
    "Yes! It's fun, different from other classes you'll take if you're not a psych major and professor Santos is THE BEST.",
    "It's harder than you think it will be",
    "I'd recommend this class if you want a not-so-difficult fourth or fifth class that will still be really interesting and teach you a lot.",
    "If you have the chance to take Sexy Psych, DO IT! Laurie Santos is a fantastic lecturer, and the information is fascinating. Pretty low-maintenence work-wise, it is well worth tacking on as a fifth class; though I made the mistake of skipping a lot of the readings that I really would have benefitted from doing. Sexy Psych has made me think about \"big questions\" in a different way, and I am so grateful for having had the chance to be in this class. Absolutely take it if you can!",
    "AWESOME",
    "Good 5th class",
    "Sexy psych is worth the hype -- great material, fun lectures, little work. Prof. Santos is hilarious, the material is easy to relate back to one's own life, and it's easy to do well without very much effort. Definitely take it, no matter your major!",
    "The first part of the class is interesting from an evolutionary stand point...I don't much love talking about animals and it was that up until the mid-term. But everything AFTER the mid-term was super interesting (and also incorporated the first half of the class really well). A lot about why humans are the way we are.",
    "Take it if you find the first session at all interesting.",
    "I would recommend it-covers a lot of interesting topics and makes you think.",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Summary: SPECTACULAR! A fascinating class on how evolutionary biology informs an understanding of human nature. Don't expect to learn about sex. Do expect to learn about basic evolutionary concepts, how these concepts are at play in various mating strategies, what the human mating strategy looks like, and how this strategy is at play in human nature. (And do expect to fall in love with Laurie!) Lectures are funny, stimulating, informative, and always too short. God bless you if you do the readings. We'll see how I do on the final I suppose (knock on wood!), but as long as you pay attention in class, do the problem sets, and study the lecture slides, you should be OK without them. Either way, you're missing out if you don't do them, since the material is so relevant and interesting.Recommendation: When (and it better be a when!) Professor Santos offers this course again, you absolutely must take it. There's no excuse not to--it's an ideal 5th class. And the material is not only fascinating but incredibly relevant. Lectures are a pleasure, and you're guaranteed to have awesome discussions about the material with your friends outside class. I felt genuinely sad on the last day of class.",
    "The idea in theory sounds a lot more interesting than the class turned out to be, but Professor Santos is such an amazing teacher you have to take from her at some point. The midterm and final I feel were unfairly hard as the notes and lectures didn't seem to prepare me for their difficulty. It was so detail oriented it was hard to figure out the important key points.",
    "I'd recommend this course as a fun, low-workload course to fill out your schedule or branch out from your major. Laurie Santos is the greatest and the material is interesting.",
    "DO IT. You will learn a lot about evolution and even more about your very own human nature, including your sexiness.",
    "Yes, interesting",
    "The tests are difficult so don't expect an easy A. Great class though.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this class- apparently it's only offered every 3 years or something but if you get the chance, do it! There's a bit of overlap with other psych classes, but that's often the case. It's a more scientific way of looking at things which is cool, and Professor Santos is a boss.",
    "This course will give you a lot of food for thought related to sex and nature. Definitely take it.",
    "PSYC 171 is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It makes salient an aspect of human nature that is so prevalent and dominant in our lives. It's great stuff to know and understand.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The best lecture I've taken at Yale hands down. I learned a LOT and it's an entertaining, fun lecture.",
    "Yes! If it is offered again, do take it! Especially if you have little knowledge of evolution\/natural selection. It is a little repetitive if you have taken Intro Psych or if you have taken a course on evolution, but Laurie Santos is a really fun and awesome professor. I definitely learned a lot, even though I have taken Intro Psych AND a course on evolution.",
    "Fun course. Great professor -- professor Santos is a wonderful professor and human being. I would say to anybody considering taking this course -- look at the syllabus closely and ask whether or not you like evolution and ecology. The course ended up being far more about those two topics than I was expecting, and as a result, I did not enjoy the class as much as I was anticipating. But that's no reflection of the quality of the course (one of the best), just the content itself.",
    "Psych 171 is an interesting course for anyone interested in any of the social studies or behavioral sciences. I would recommend this to anyone at Yale looking for an interesting course to take that doesn't require an immense amount of time.",
    "Take it! It'll change the way you think about human behavior!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking the course if you are interested in evolution, primate behavior, the behavior of hunter gatherers, and identifying what does and does not make human behavior unique. Be aware, however, that it is less of a course about analyzing or explaining modern human behavior than I anticipated. I did enjoy the course.",
    "Sexy Psyche was awesome! The lectures were always interesting to go to, and Prof Santos is great! The class workload definitely wasn't much, and the research paper at the end is pretty easy to do.",
    "Yes, definitely. Tricky questions on the midterm and finals, but the class was always interesting and I would always look forward to it.",
    "Sex, Evolution, and Human Nature was probably one of the most interesting courses I've taken in my time at Yale so far. There isn't that much of a workload, but oddly enough, after walking out of the last class, I felt like I learned much more than I did insome of my other, more intense, classes. The material is genuinely interesting, the readings are fun and fascinating, and each lecture held me captivated from beginning to end. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested in learning about how Evolutionary Biology and Human Psychology are connected to one another.",
    "Yes and no. Yes because the workload isn't that bad and Laurie Santos is a great lecturer. But no because the lectures do tend to get boring. Make sure ahead of time that you are really interested in the material or you will be hating yourself by week 8.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student. Such an awesome class.",
    "Not a great class. Te first half is all biology. It seemed more interesting than it actually is and the tests are annoying.",
    "Yes! Take it if you're interested in the material.",
    "This is one of the best courses you could take at Yale. Laurie Santos is absolutely incredible and the subject material is fascinating. I would recommend this course to everyone who has the opportunity to take it.",
    "Take it!!!!",
    "Great class. Not much work, so you have 5 quizzes and they give you all the questions beforehand so a guaranteed grade booster. I really enjoyed the final paper in which you do your OWN research, and the midterm and final were alright...Anyways, Professor Santos is such an amazing professor. You have to take this class for her! The topics are fascinating, and I learned so much about evolutionary theories!",
    "Yes, take it, it's fun and the research paper is really fun to do!",
    "Very interesting course. Very fair exams. Laurie Santos is a joy.",
    "It's an alright course, but definitely not what you might expect from the title. I thought the course would come full-circle and it didn't really. But overall it's not too much work and often interesting so I would recommend it.",
    "Overview of evolutionary psychology and human mating systems...interesting stuff, especially towards the second half of the course. Take it!",
    "You definitely want to take this course! Professor Santos is amazing and the material is so interesting. This course is perfect if you're interested in evolutionary psychology, or if you just want to learn more about people. I would recommend this course to any student.",
    "This is an interesting class. The material is pretty straight forward and the readings are completely unnecessary. I didn't buy a single book for this class. Most of the science is at a high school biology level or lower and the evolutionary theory is covered in class and can be learned just through lecture or wikipedia.Overall this is a relaxing, enjoyable class. You just need to cram a bunch of information into your head before the midterms and you will be fine.",
    "The lectures are extremely fun and the material is easy but the tests are harder than the material makes them seem before hand. Don't be lulled into thinking you don't have to pay attention because its a gut.",
    "This class really interesting and reveals a lot about human nature. I really recommend this class for anyone that's just curious about human nature.",
    "This is a fun class that focuses on how evolution and reproduction has shaped many animal species, concluding with our own. It is a science-y class, but if you're a science major everything will feel pretty basic. That said, it's an enjoyable class and not too hard at all. I would recommend taking it.",
    "Graded much more harshly than you'd think. Interesting but I'd recommend intro psych instead",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Although the class was huge, it was one of the best I have taken at Yale, thus far. Listening to Laurie Santos is inspiring and the topics covered in this course register as applicable to understanding everyday human nature and the motivations and functions of our own species.",
    "Great class, definitely take it if Laurie Santos is teaching!",
    "NOT A GUT. Not a ton of day to day work, and the material is very easy, but the tests are unjustifiably hard. It's like Professor Santos tries to make the material harder by phrasing the questions as trick questions. Also the final research project takes forever.",
    "This is a good class to take. You don't have to do the readings, and lecture is interesting.",
    "Professor Santos gives one-off lectures, sometimes for other classes. I learned about this course at one of those, and was slightly disappointed at the unstructuredness of this course, compared to that lecture. Still worthwhile, but didn't really change the way I looked at the human mind as much as CGSC 110.",
    "Definitely worth taking. Lots of fun and really interesting. You have to take a class with Laurie at some point!",
    "A big lecture, with a superstar prof, on the evolutionary basis of mating strategies, and human behavior. A great class.",
    "Not particularly unless you really really are interested",
    "No. Not really worth your time. The exam questions are weirdly worded (as all psyc classes are) and the TFs do not even know how to answer questions that you have about the material.Maybe Credit D the course. Otherwise, not vey useful.",
    "It is the study of human sexual behaviors in the context of evolution. I would absolutely recommend this course because it was interesting, fun, and overall very enjoyable.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student wishing to gain a better understanding of human behavior from an evolutionary and biological perspective. A majority, if not all, of the information presented throughout this course is applicable to everyday life.",
    "PSYCH 171 is a really fun introductory psychology course. I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student! It's not too much work (except for the final project) and makes for a great fifth class. The instructor is great and the work is pretty straight-forward. However, it's definitely not a gut course and you should definitely stay on top of the work. The class is so enjoyable that you won't have a hard time doing so!",
    "It's a fun class that teaches you a lot of interesting things about evolution and both animal and human mating strategies. It is a decent amount of work though, which is mostly rewarding and sometimes annoying.",
    "This was an interesting class, lectures are clear, and professor Santos does a good job of explaining all of the different concepts.",
    "40% evolutionary biology, 30% animal psychology, 30% contemporary psychology, blended to form evolutionary psychology. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Sexy Psych is a great introduction to evolutionary psychology. Outlines of lectures are provided before lectures which are very helpful. The mid-term and final exams were very tricky, while the research paper was not that bad. I would definitely recommend this course, just for Professor Santos alone. She's an amazing lecturer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's extremely interesting and a great psych class for non-psych or science majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Santos is great and the course material is so interesting - it will change the way you think about everything, from events in the news to conversations at the dinner table.",
    "Great course - everyone who can take this course should.",
    "I brief yet fulfilling overview of evolutionary psychology. I would highly recommend this class because it is so fascinating and well taught.",
    "Take it, don't question it, just take the class, you won't regret it.",
    "This is a great overview of evolution and how evolutionary constraints shape human nature. If you've taken Introduction to Biological Anthropology, much of the material overlaps, so keep that in mind. Prof. Santos is a very engaging lecturer and cares a lot about the subject and her students.",
    "If you haven't taken an introductory psychology course before, or if you've only taken one, this is a great class for you. Fun and interesting, with a reasonable work load and a lively and enthusiastic professor. On the other hand, if you're like me and have a more extensive psychology background, be warned that you're going to get a heck of a lot of review of topics that are VERY well-covered by the Yale psych department. (e.g. the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Ultimatum Game, the Mischel marshmallow test, etc.). I did learn some new and interesting stuff, but on the whole, if I could do this semester over, I think I would have opted for a different class.",
    "Did not live up to the hype. Lectures were more about being entertaining than substantive and in the end were neither.",
    "Laurie Santos is a loving, amazing professor. You will learn a lot from this class, even if you sleep through large chunks (like I did), and you will enjoy learning it.",
    "Interesting class, not too difficult. Recommended.",
    "Excellent. Not difficult but very interesting, well-taught and engaging. Take it if you want a nice introductory psych course that is applicable to life and interesting. Not all about sex, but it is important and interesting.",
    "If you take this class, please take it credit\/d. The tests are so oddly specific that studying for them doesn't really help at all, and they are graded so that you inevitably lose points on small technicalities. The tests don't measure what you have learned, they measure how well you can read the grader's mind. The one reason to take this class is because Laurie Santos is a fantastic lecturer and the material isn't actually difficult to learn.",
    "Take this course! I took it CR\/D which let me enjoy the lectures without having to worry about all the readings, but I got a B in the course without trying. So getting an A would be totally doable. The material presented is extremely interesting, and Laurie Santos is one of the best lecturers I have had at Yale. Every class is extremely interesting, and her power points are the bomb! You will love every class.",
    "Take it. It's not very difficult. The only thing is there is a lot of information, but its really not tough",
    "I'd say take it if you're interested in learning how humans are both similar to and different from other organisms.",
    "I would highly recommend taking the course, if mainly just for the experience. The information was certainly interesting, but most of it was highly familiar from high school biology and from nature documentaries and books. That said, the lectures were truly phenomenal and the class experience was overall extremely enjoyable.",
    "Yes! It is a great class that introduces you to the fields of anthropology and evolution and general psychology.",
    "Fun class with kind of optional attendance. Testing and grading are both very fair.",
    "This was an awesome relaxed and interesting class. Definitely recommended!",
    "This is a wonderful class about reproductive strategies in both animals and humans. Professor Santos makes it an even more enjoyable class. I highly recommend it.",
    "This class is amazing. Professor Santos is a GREAT lecturer. definitely worth the hype.",
    "Very good, interesting class about how evolution can be used to describe pretty much everything about human nature. Lots of material, but it's all very interesting",
    "Great class, interesting material. If you're an EEB major or have taken classes in a similar field, you might find a lot of overlap. Large class, not too much work (except for the final project).",
    "Great course! Take it with Laurie Santos if you can!!",
    "Sexy Psych was a great class. I really enjoyed it and was always uncomfortable with missing lectures because they were a joy to be present for. I would highly recommend this class to ANYBODY, because it's interesting and relevant to any student, regardless of his\/her major; learning about human nature encourages us to think about our actions with a different perspective, and that opportunity is a great one, especially when the class is taught by such an amazing, knowledgeable, charismatic professor. Take it, if you have the chance. You don't need to take it Credit\/D either, if you're willing to put the work into it. I think a common misconception about this class is that it's a gut - that it's super easy - but I found that I really did have to study to perform well on the tests, especially since I haven't had too many psych classes in the past (if you have, then it may be a different story). I.e. pay attention, study, and you'll be fine. It's an enjoyable class.",
    "A very fun 5th course. This was my \"fun\" class this semester, and it did not disappoint. Laurie Santos is a fabulous, fun, engaging lecturer. The topic is light, not difficult and fun. The readings might as well be optional. The quizzes were taken word-for-word from the optional psets. Overall, an easy, fun course."
