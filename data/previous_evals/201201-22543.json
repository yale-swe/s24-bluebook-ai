    "Fantastic class. Blight is the real deal: brilliant, accessible, funny. A great syllabus, excellent class discussions. The workload is huge but worthwhile.",
    "There is no reason not to take this class, even if you've already taken Professor Blight's lecture. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Best class I have ever taken at Yale. Blight is a wonderful professor and really makes his students interested in the subject. If you can get into the seminar, definitely definitely definitely take it. You won't regret it.It doesn't hurt that Prof Blight has a sense of humor, too!",
    "Yes. Solid seminar.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in problems of historical memory. If not, you might be frustrated by the lack of historical specificity in discussion.",
    "This is a fantastic class that looks seriously at how Americans have remembered the Civil War. After a couple weeks of theoretical work on what historical memory is and how it works\u0097filled with really interesting readings\u0097we move onto several topics in the memory of the Civil War. Each week had compelling readings, and though I couldn't finish ever single one, almost all of them are works that I have or am hoping to finish in my free time. Take this class.",
    "History 138J is a fascinating and wide-ranging seminar on the memory of the Civil War in American culture, public memory, and literature. Professor Blight is a great seminar leader and the expert on the topic. The well chosen-readings start with pieces on the meaning of history and memory, then cover soldiers' memories and the beginnings of the Lost Cause, progress to the Civil War Centennial and the Civil Rights Movement, and finish with Confederates in the Attic and modern politics and art. Discussions are excellent and with so many unique primary sources at Yale or other sites nearby, writing the term can be very fun.",
    "If you get in, take it. Take it, take it, take it. Blight is amazing. The workload is heavy but it's worth it. READ ALL OF \"ALL OF THE KING'S MEN.\" It's worth it. Just an exceptional class. Historical memory is something every history major should have to take a class in.",
    "Yes! Don't take this class if you don't know anything about the Civil War, but it's a great follow-up to Professor Blight's lecture, particularly if you're interested in historical memory.",
    "You are probably interested in this course if you took Blight's Civil War lecture, for good reason; I definitely went into the class with a huge intellectual crush on Blight. He is still a brilliant man in a seminar, though admittedly prone to ramble in his lecture-like way.The reading list is excellent, and my classmates were all interesting people who mostly cared about the class. It was fascinating to take time to look at historical memory both in abstract and with reference to this important era in American history, which essentially allows you write your final paper on any era of American history since. I very much enjoyed writing the final paper.",
    "This course is a look at the Civil War, in the unique framework of American memory. It gives a great look at what makes the Civil War different from other historical events in memory, but also shows how it is similar. It challenges you to think about memory in a new and different way.",
    "TAKE. Blight is amazing, the topic is both historical and relevant, the readings interesting, the discussion can't be missed. Top 5 professors at Yale if not top period."
