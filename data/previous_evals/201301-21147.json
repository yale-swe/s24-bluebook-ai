   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the course. I would suggest that anyone who wishes to know about Eastern Europe in a global context or who wants to have great preparation for PhD work should take the class.",
    "It's a class where you must manage your time and be prepared to do a lot of reading (and critical reading at that). But it's really rewarding to get through each book and to listen to the other class members' contributions. I found the work to be very time-consuming each week, but again I have to say that it's truly worthwhile.",
    "The course gave a good overview of modern Eastern European history. We read cultural, social, and political histories of late 19th and 20th century Eastern Europe. The discussions with the other students and the professor were interesting, and the workload was manageable. The professor is very knowledgeable and engages well with students. Yes, I would recommend the course."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very important to me. It helped me think of my own specialty in a more global context and to think about ways to incorporate this view into a potential dissertation.",
    "I don't have a dissertation, but the class succeeded in providing me with a deeper understanding of the Eastern European region, which is the region on which my degree is concentrated.",
    "This course was good preparation for an orals field in modern Eastern European History, which the instructor indicated was the goal of the class at the beginning of the semester."
