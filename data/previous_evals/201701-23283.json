   "comments": [
    "I learned how to think critically about my predispositions and how I had been taught previously",
    "I think I learned a lot about the intersectionality of Muslims in this course. I didn't really try to understand the religion beyond what I've already learned in high school, so this class was perfect for bringing in a more expansive knowledge and understanding.",
    "This course pushed me to think in ways I have never had to before. Every class I would walk out and be so deep in though that I would walk into people and doors and walls and such. This class, was extremely enjoyable and I think it made me into a more sensitive and thoughtful human.",
    "I really learned a lot of writing skills and how to think critically about Hingis that are correct in theory but wrong in practice.",
    "This class helped me a great deal with approaching an issue or topic from a multitude of different viewpoints and perspectives. It went far Beyond the preconceived notions that I had about the course and brought so many angles that I had never considered.",
    "My understanding of Islam's influence on America's political structure and culture changed completely. I had never considered how Muslims shaped the very idea of citizenship in America, or even how they influenced the emergence and development of hip hop. I also became much more proficient at taking in written material and processing it down into a narrative or series of thoughts.",
    "I have never learned as much in a course as I did in this one. This class truly changed the way I think. It changed my understanding of America, Islam, and my own identity. The way I conceptualize the world has forever been changed. I think much more deeply about the nature of religion and humanity. I developed a passion for the humanities. My basic assumptions about the world have been completely destabilized. I would very much recommend this course.",
    "I learned more both about the history of the Muslim American identity and also what I want from classes and my professors. This class can teach first years how important it is to view your teachers as potential mentors.",
    "I developed my writing skills for research type paper and book response opinion-based papers as well. I also developed my speaking skills by being able to participate in a class-wide discussion.",
    "I learned many interesting things about Islam's history in America. I got a chance to try and expand on my writing skills.",
    "Islam, America, anthropology"

   "comments": [
    "This course is very unstructured, which has both its benefits and its drawbacks. The benefits are that there is less pressure for the discussion to take any one course, allowing for the interests of the student group to really define the topic of conversation. For this reason, I felt like I really learned more about things that really engaged me than in an environment where the discussion is very structured. The drawbacks of this method are\/were that it was hard to know exactly what reading we were supposed to do for the following class, and sometimes it felt as though assignments were unclear.",
    "I thought the readings were awesome but didn't really like Thomas Jefferson's Quar'an",
    "The films we watched took up a lot of time and if we didn't have those, I feel like I would've had more time to dedicate to the readings.",
    "This course is very strong. There are no weaknesses, I'm so glad I took this course it changed the way I look at the world, at the socioeconomic stereotypes, and at politics in America.",
    "The course has a lot of interesting reading but the class itself is often off topic or scattered.",
    "First of all, I truly enjoyed almost everything that we read and watched in this course. The one book that I didn't particularly like was Thomas Jefferson's Qur'an. I thought that the point of the book was rather interesting but that we could have dealt with the material in the course of one lecture as opposed to having to trudge through the entire book, which I found to be excessively dense. One of the other strengths of the course was its casual and relaxed nature. Zareena talked to us like regular thinking and feeling human beings, and I sincerely appreciated that. Something that I think could be altered is the way in which we process each book that we read. At times, it felt as though I was putting a lot of time and effort into reading a text only to go into class to discuss a small portion of the book. This would happen when we got side tracked and ended up talking about something other than what we had originally intended to discuss. Again, this flexibility is generally something I enjoyed, but when we put time into reading something, I appreciated seeing that effort reflected in the attention given to the discussion of that material. Another example of this is when we watched the Night Of. I LOVED this series and it was highly valuable to me. However, I found it frustrating that we didn't talk about it until long after we had finished it. Something else that I think could be improved upon is the structure of the two major paper assignments. In theory, I like the idea of the second building from the first. However, when it came time to sit down and write a second paper, I would have rather had a completely fresh start. I kind of ended up writing a completely new paper, but that was due to an unfortunate choice of focus in my first paper. In any case, I think that the papers can build on one another in terms of style and form, but they don't necessarily need to be related by content.",
    "This class has incredible readings, an awesome teacher, and is truly thought-provoking. Its only weakness is that it is somewhat disorganized. I think it more than makes up for this in its incredible content.",
    "The readings and discussions are fantastic. Zareena is amazing teacher but also can be slightly frustrating when trying to get in contact with her and when she changes assignments at the last minute. With that said she will almost always make up for it by blowing your mind in class.",
    "This course goes over many things, and it focuses more on somethings like Islam and Blackness than it does on other things like Terrorism. It would be better if it focused more evenly on both things.",
    "contents were very interesting, but engagement of the professor was not high"

    "YES THIS COURSE IS AWESOME ZAREENA IS AWESOME",
    "Most definitely!",
    "I have already recommended this course and this professor to other students. This course is amazing because it creates conversation about sensitive subjects in a ways that is engaging and forces you to open your eyes to the problems with the world while also opening your mind to how you can help, what you need to change and how you actions affect other people.",
    "Absolutely. The professor is awesome and the class is one where you learn something new everyday.",
    "I would because it provides a fresh and intelligent take on many issues facing our country and the world right now.",
    "The content of this class is crucial to understanding the role that Islam has played (and continues to play) in shaping the US. If you are interested in how this might be, then you may want to consider taking this class. However, I would also warn anyone that is interested about a couple things. First of all, I found that I was learning the most, and feeling the best about my engagement in the course when I was able to give the material the time it deserved in order to be read with all of my attention (and adequate time). Although this may seem trivial, it's not. Yale students are busy. And often, things like readings get the short end of the stick when it comes to prioritizing late at night. In light of this, I would keep in mind that it takes a lot of time to read thoroughly and that this will have a distinct bearing on your experience in this class. The other thing that one should consider before deciding to take this class is the kind of teaching style that they prefer. Zareena is a wonderful, intelligent person. But her teaching style may not be for everyone. See if you like the feel of the class in the first bit of the semester. If you find that it's not a good fit for you, then I would trust that. Otherwise, stay in the course and you will be rewarded with a really thought provoking semester.",
    "Please take this course! It totally changed the way I think. It was one of very few courses that will completely alter your perspective. I think this is a critical course with content that everyone should seek to understand.",
    "No, I would not recommend the course. There are plenty of other ER&M \/ AMST courses that are better organized, more engaging, have stronger reading lists, and better run class discussions. I left the class each day feeling frustrated with Prof. Grewal and intellectually dissatisfied.",
    "Yes, but with caution. This class will change the way you think about the world and Zareena is truly inspirational, but it can be very frustrating.",
    "This course is AMAZING. Zareena changed my life; I don't say that to be dramatic, but she goes above and beyond as a professor and I feel immensely blessed to have been able to take her class. She is also one of the smartest and most passionate people I have ever met and it was a privilege to learn from her and alongside her as she often opened the dialogue and gave students opportunities to teach her, but also to teach each other. It was so nice and inspiring to be taught by a female professor who invests in her students and also keeps the class interesting by continually updating her sources. One of the things that makes her so great is the fact that she automatically relates to her students; I never felt intimidated or fearful when asking questions about the course content. Additionally, she made the course not only about Islam, but also about issues in the world that still exist. After having taken Zareena's class, I feel excited to be at Yale for another 3 years because this gives me the opportunity to take even more of her classes.",
    "Yes, this class is really interesting and Zareena is an awesome professor.",
    "Think you have heard enough of Islam and know everything about Muslim in the US? This class teaches you that you still have a lot more to learn."
