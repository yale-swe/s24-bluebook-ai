    "A good introduction to different models dealing with financial flows. Interesting to get a solid background of financial flows on a macro level. 3 psets, 1 final paper, 1 midterm. Really doable if you put in the effort and they don't really need that much of crazy work or anything. Very doable.",
    "Yes the final paper can be challenging but overall the work load is not bad.",
    "Solid class. Do not take it if you want to be an investment banker and are looking for a class that can put you on the path towards your little dreams. This class is more of a theoretical\/academic class, that looks at models of international finance and trade developed in academia, and applies those models to real world data, but doesn't really teach you about discounted cash flows or whatever else bankers need to know. Take this class because you are interested in economics and what macroeconomic researchers are working on. It's a fantastic class with a great teacher, and not too much work. The final paper was a bit stressful, but I thought it was overall a very great learning experience. Bottom line: bankers, stay away and take hedge funds or something. Those truly interested in economics, this is your class.",
    "International Finance is a good class for understanding a lot of the macro-level terms that are in the news and the crises that surround them. Professor Arkolakis does a great job of breaking these down and helping you understand how countries get into these problems and what their options are for getting out of them. He blends real world events and theory quite nicely. If you have any interest in these concepts, I would recommend the class for a senior seminar, as it's not an incredibly work-heavy and you get a decent amount of learning out of it. Just be prepared for a 9 am at Luce, which isn't the nicest of things.",
    "Yes. Take it if youre interested in macro.",
    "Basic introduction to important concepts in open economy macro.",
    "Yes, this class prepares the student well for understanding international financial dynamics."
