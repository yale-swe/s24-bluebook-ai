   "question_text": "How would you summarize AFAM 505 01\/AMST 643 01 for a fellow student? Would you recommend AFAM 505 01\/AMST 643 01 to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "It's a very intense class in which a lot is expected of you.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to a fellow student, with certain caveats. The reading list and the opportunity to work with Professor Lofton would be the main selling points; the amount of work and the potential frustrations of working with Professor Lofton would be my only caveats.",
    "This history class is the opportunity to focus on how the ideas of \"religion\" and \"modernity\" have changed, and can change, depending on one's vantage point within history. The course is demanding in that it asks you to evaluate lots of thinkers critically, but it enables you eventually to do your own creative work.I would recommend the course to a student only if she were really interested in the topics above. It is a very specific class, and if one is not particularly dedicated to creative thought in the subject matter, then the course might be overly taxing for one.",
    "I would highly recommend the class, although I think to some extent the topic either will draw a student on its own by some elective affinity or it will be fairly inert as a subject. I feel like \"modernity\" is a concept which either strikes one as extremely interesting and crucial to both self-understanding and an understanding of one's field, or one somewhat takes it for granted. Both, obviously, could use the engagement with modernity that this course provides.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to students in the future, particularly those dealing with intellectual or social history.",
    "Religious Studies 707 01 examines classic texts--works, for example, by Marx, James, and Nietzsche--in conjunction with recent monographic studies to question the relationships between the terms \"religion\" and \"modernity.\" Any student interested in having the opportunity to take a seminar with the brilliant Professor Lofton or interested in pursuing her own research involving either one of these terms should do whatever she can to get into this competitive course.",
    "I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this class to anyone interested in American Religious History.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone trying to come to grips with how Europeans and the Americans who read them rethought their worlds in the wake of the successive upheavals of the 19th century, or anyone looking for an excuse to read some Marx, Freud, James, Du Bois, etc.",
    "History 749 gives a vital introduction to classic and current thinking on the problem of religion in contemporary civilization."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The contributions of this course were mostly philosophical. I'm frankly not sure how explicitly engaged my dissertation will be with the category of modernity, but it will certainly subtend my research and my analysis.",
    "Even though I am not an Americanist, the method \/ approach to historicizing discourses regarding religion and modernity can be readily applied to my field of study.A number of these readings have helped me contextualize how other religions (and religious social movements) have been approached in academia, and the sources of certain dominant biases and focus areas.Additionally, a number of the currents we have discussed have manifested themselves in a global context, and similar tensions between religion and modernity took place in the 19th - 20th century colonized world.",
    "This course provided me with an expansive knowledge of the term \"modernity\" that will certainly prove productive as I develop my own research projects. The seminar also prepared me for oral examinations and other scholastic environments that demand an articulated synthesis of a large range of readings and theoretical frameworks. Further, this course built friendships with other students who I look forward to working with throughout my academic career."
