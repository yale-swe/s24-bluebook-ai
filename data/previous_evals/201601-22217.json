    "It was an archaeology course about East Asia.",
    "I highly reccomend Prof. Underhill's course. The course will challenge your perspective on East Asian archaeology as both field and discipline. You will learn much, and gain deep knowledge of the issues raised and yet to be raised in the field, as well as understand why this is the case. It is essential for anyone interested in East Asian archaeology, but it is also a great and insightful supplement for those doing archaeology in general."

    "It got me informed about East Asian history and culture.",
    "This course refreshed my critical analysis of East Asian studies historiography, and highlighted the connections between modern nationalist concerns and secondary research on material cultural history. It will be useful for a literature review of premodern materials in East Asia during my dissertation writing, and will help me to frame the types of questions I wish to ask, as well as the obstacles to those assertions as it relates to paradigms in the field."
