   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about cells. I feel really good about being able to read more scientific literature and understand generally what is going on. It's crazy to me that I am starting to reach the limits of what is known.",
    "So much information about cellular biology.",
    "I learned more about cell biology than I ever thought I could possibly learn in a semester.",
    "how to memorize information in the most efficient way possible",
    "This was an important foundation course to learn the basics of how the cell works. The knowledge will be useful to me in my research and perhaps my future in med school. I especially liked learning about the cytoskeleton and the cell cycle, topics that hadn't been covered in my previous bio classes.",
    "So much about the cell. So much. But really interesting.",
    "I learned so much about cell biology. Cell bio covers such a wide variety of topics that you really learn a lot about so many different processes. At times it was a little overwhelming to memorize and understand everything (especially before the final exam), but I definitely feel like I have a greater understanding of how biological processes occur.",
    "It taught me a great deal about synthesizing a lot of knowledge into a single understanding. It brought together much of what I've learned in my previous courses.",
    "I developed some knowledge of the nuts and bolts inside the cell. Mostly I gained a healthy appreciation for complexity, specifically through the methods of regulation and negative feedback in the cell. Learning about cellular machinery also helps to better envision what disease truly consists of. It's important to note that the course places a heavy emphasis on the machinery aspect and teaches parts of the cell in a very granular way. I learned just enough specific protein names, etc. to remember the important ones without being overwhelmed.",
    "After taking this class I essentially know everything about cellular biology! It is definitely an intensive, difficult class but at the end you realize how much you're walking away with.",
    "I learned a lot about how the cell biology and how all this stuff connects to cancer.",
    "I learned so much in depth about cell biology! Given the dense material, I learned how to organize lots of information and pick out important concepts and patterns. The weekly quizzes were also a test of diligence and perseverance.",
    "I learned a lot about mechanisms in the cell that I would never otherwise have learned about. I think it is very easy in biology (and especially biological research) to specialize and focus on only one topic. It was a good survey course to broaden my horizons.",
    "A strong grasp of a large variety of cellular events, at a non-trivial level.",
    "I learned so much in this course. There was so much information.",
    "good overview of cell bio. definitely heavy on the memorization side, but you'll learn a lot of neat things. Tom really tries to make it more so that you're thinking about concepts and their applicability to today and not just memorizing things, which is nice.",
    "I have never studied so hard for one course. I learned how to budget enough to time for such a course and get material into my head. Obviously I learned all about cell biology, but really I learned what it might be like to learn information as one might have to do for medical school.",
    "I really learned how to use a textbook to my advantage to study for exams",
    "Knowledge of cell bio and skill at memorizing a ton",
    "By taking Cell Bio, I gained detailed knowledge about many cellular components and processes, from protein synthesis to the cell cycle. More importantly, I developed an ability to comprehend general principles and apply broader frameworks to specific mechanisms. It is impossible to retain all the minutia discussed, but the essential processes will stay with me.",
    "I learned much detailed information about the workings of the cell. Each week focused on a different topic and we really delved into the mechanistic details of various processes.",
    "How to consolidate a depth and breadth of information into practical experimental based questions",
    "All of cell biology",
    "Overview of cell biology and what goes on in the cell e.g. Mitosis and the proteins that regulate it, gene transcription and translation etc",
    "In this class, you will learn so much information about cell biology. You will also have to learn how to memorize the great mass of material that you cover in class.",
    "I learned to integrate what I have read and learned about cell biology.",
    "Learned about the cell and a little about experimental techniques in cell biology.",
    "All about the major mechanisitic pathways of molecules which occur over the course of a cell's life cycle",
    "I learned a lot about cell biology! Also, I learned the best way to study, and I developed good study habits, which Professor Pollard helped and encouraged in class.",
    "This class was chock full of information, and in a good way. It made you appreciate how much was actually going on, without being too overwhelming about the information."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was a great, deep and broad overview of cells. I think it will really prepare me well for my MCDB coursework. I really liked my section's style and feel bad that the other sections were not as discussion based. However, it was probably the most work in one class I've ever done. There is so much content and because assessment was through weekly quizzes that could be on anything, but only actually tested a small thing, you had to study everything in detail to actually be prepared.",
    "A ton of material - it's hard to absorb everything that this course has to offer. The course is well structured and the material is interesting.",
    "The strength of this course is that is is fairly well-organized, and expectations are laid out fairly clearly. The weakness of this course is that it covers an inhuman amount of material over the course of one semester.",
    "strengths: you learn SO much weaknesses: it's at 9 in the morning and the classroom is always too dark",
    "The material is generally very interesting, but it was not always taught in a very engaging way.",
    "The course is well structured and the material is comprehensive and organized. Both of the professors are extremely well qualified and dedicated to the course. The only thing is that I feel the lectures started to drag later in the course. I wish that there had been a higher level of student engagement during the lectures. One suggestion I have would be to do what Biochem II does: in the middle of the class, have the students work on an application-based group problem together and discuss it briefly.",
    "It's comprehensive which can feel overwhelming. A natural two-edged sword.",
    "This class simply has so much information that it is nearly impossible to learn it all. Luckily the grading on quizzes was very generous!",
    "I really enjoyed the organization of this course. Professor Pollard's lectures were always really helpful, and I learned a lot from going to class. The textbook that Professor Pollard assigned (that he also wrote) was also very helpful to read, and the lectures matched the textbook well, so I was glad to have this extra reference if I didn't understand something in class. The quizzes every week were difficult sometimes, especially since I was taking Bio 103, which also had weekly quizzes, but in the end they helped make studying for the final exam a lot easier, since we'd already had to review the material once. I was also really thankful for the peer tutor review sessions every Monday night before the quizzes because they were always really helpful and a great way for me to review before the quiz.",
    "Weakness: an overbesring amount of material. Efficacy of organization is variable. Strength: very knowledgeable professors and TAs make the material much more manageable.",
    "Strength: forces you to be up to date with the content. Weakness: it's a 9 AM lecture, which makes it harder to pay attention.",
    "Strengths: the textbook and lectures go well together; the professor is very smart and very, very prepared. The structure of the class--with quizzes and a final exam only--is terrific, and made me feel like I really did have time to sit down and read all of the chapters in the textbooks each week. I was also very happy with the vast amount of material covered. Weaknesses: I did not come away from the course feeling like I had integrated concepts. I did not feel that a larger effort was made, either at the beginning of the class or at the end, to sketch out what larger concepts we would be learning and why we would be learning in the order that had been chosen. As such, the order felt arbitrary and I never achieved a bigger picture. The packets are loosely meant to be \"units\" but these units are called things like \"extracellular matrix\" without giving a sense of why we are now turning to the extracellular matrix.",
    "I think the course is very well-executed. I really, really liked the weekly peer-led review sessions before each quiz and think most of the class benefited from this. I also thought section was loosely structured enough yet structured enough to benefit from.",
    "I really liked this class because I found the material to be interesting. Although there are weekly quizzes, I think they are integral in making sure that you stay on top of the material. You are also given some flexibility by being able to drop 3 quizzes. I think the biggest weakness about the class is that no one knew how the class was going to be graded in the end or what the quiz averages were. Also, it can be hard to hear what Professor Pollard is saying at times.",
    "Strengths: deep, yet comprehensive; weekly quizzes helped with keeping up with material, wonderful professor, engaging material, peer tutors\/review sessions were great, TAs were helpful Weaknesses: sometimes lecture went too much into details at times which made it difficult to absorb information",
    "I sometimes thought that the course was quite pick-and-choose. Like it was very difficult for me to see why we would focus on protein transport into the mitochondria so much, but then skip over other important topics. Perhaps I wish there was some sort of pattern to the course, something to connect each of the modules we studied. Even explicitly stating a grand narrative would have been helpful. For example: starting with DNA (and thus nuclear import\/export, etc.) and moving to proteins (transcription, translation) and other movement in the cell (membranes, action potentials, and actin\/myosin, etc.) and so on.",
    "The weekly quizzes were instrumental to keeping everyone up to speed and not fall behind, so it kept us engaged. The materials are clearly very well-organized and carefully revised over time, so they were great to absorb. Sections were also in a good format. The asynchronous disconnect of the slides and handouts made it difficult to organize notes and materials. It was easier to take lecture notes on the slides, but it was more effective to study the handouts; studying ended up with a bit of \"where is this on the lecture\/handout???\"",
    "Strengths - A lot of high level content, but the design of the course (weekly quizzes especially) helps to keep you on track - Notes are very comprehensive - Really nice and accomplished professor - A lot of help resources available Weaknesses - Quality of sections vary e.g. the way they're led - Wish the final covered the syllabus more fully, quite a few topics not included",
    "strength - very organized! really appreciate that it was so organized, bc most of the time, i find that my stem lectures are a shitshow. everything was laid out nice and neat, but what really did it was that the lectures themselves were organized. really appreciated having the handouts in addition to the slides, so that you get info presented to you in multiple ways, and also if you don't understand smthg in lecture, the handout explains it for you really clearly, so it's not vital to understand everything the first time it's presented to you weakness - Tom can be really difficult to hear sometimes. would appreciate having a better microphone",
    "The quiz structure was very helpful. It made sure that I kept up with the material and overall felt less stressful than classes with midterms.",
    "The course is well organized and predictable. The packets are essential and much appreciated for knowing what to focus on. However, reading the textbook was necessary to actually gain understanding.",
    "I thought this course was excellently taught. The lectures really helped explain the difficult topics and the book was pretty good as well. I really appreciated all the resources that were given to us because it made it feel like the instructors really cared that we did well. I appreciated the printed lecture guides, the optional sections, and the fact that we got the answer to the quizzes right away. On that note, the quizzes were an absolute life saver and I think a great way to learn a huge amount of information like this class poses. If there would have just been a midterm in between, I think it would have been a lot more overwhelming and difficult, but the quizzes helped break down studying. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "The quizzes could be a little bit longer and maybe some more guidance of what to focus on when studying",
    "Pretty solid class overall, though very memorization heavy. Exam was a bit hit or miss in terms of being representative of all of the material.",
    "This course is strong in that it is taught well and tested in manageable chunks--a quiz every week forces students to review the material often. One weakness is that it can be hard to know the level of detail expected, but one's intuition for this improves throughout the course.",
    "This class was interesting but the lectures were sometimes a bit dry. The packets were extremely helpful and did a great job of summarizing the useful information. The textbook was fascinating but there was simply too much reading to complete all of it every week.",
    "Strengths--Covering an entire textbook of material is not a feat many classes achieve; Professor Pollard kept the class engaged and really wanted us to ask questions and get involved Weaknesses--There should have been a gradebook function of some sort or a better tracking measure for the students of their progress",
    "Comprehensive, like all other biology",
    "The weekly quizzes are helpful in breaking up the material. You only have to study 2 lectures for each quiz. But the exam, which is 40% of your grade, is cumulative, and you have to study a ton of material.",
    "I learned so much in this course, but at times this was an overload of information. I feel like the quizzes were more based on what was covered in discussion section or the textbook, and I wish the quizzes drew back on what was covered in lecture too.",
    "Weakness: not enough focus in experimental techniques or design, heavy on rote memorization",
    "Grading needs to be more ubiquitous among the TAs. There is no benefit of doubt when grading quizzes which may have have the right intent about the questions asked, but wording may have been somewhat vague due to time crunches. In the same line of thougt, quizzes should NOT start at 8:55am. It's early, everyone hates getting up to walk up science hill, starting an aspect of class before 9:00am is somewhat cruel. Also the quizzes are slightly easier than the review questions, which just adds to student stress in trying to figure out what they may be evaluated on. Honestly, the course structure is fairly annoying in that it jumps around a lot and only ties together at the very end. Feeling as though you only understand the material the week before the final is not ideal. Also, the professors need to collaborate more. Prof. Pollard may be an amazing scientist in his field, but he is far less exciting to be lectured by. Prof. King was very entertaining and kept us engaged in the frew lectures she taught. Also this class always falls prey to the pains of expecting students to understand advanced cell bio lab techniques to figure out how to discover a new molecule or patheay. To be honest, most students are not involved with labs until their junior or senior year, so these types of test questions will always be painful to study for and answer. The course material should de-emphasize these types of questions n quizzes and the final. I will say that this class was one of the most informative I have taken as a junior MVDB major but I wish it worked more to see from the student perspective how they learn cell biology best.",
    "A very good overview. I hated the weekly quizzes, but also they were very necessary in making sure that I stayed on top of the material. I probably would have been overwhelmed during the final if we didn't have those quizzes. I still was a little overwhelmed during reading period in trying to review all the material. I think the biggest weakness was its ambitious range of materials, but otherwise I thought the class was taught well.",
    "I think the greatest strength was in the weekly quizzes - they allowed for a routine evaluation of the knowledge you were supposed to be learning, but the ability to drop three quizzes allowed for a much welcomed amount of flexibility. The sections were also very helpful - having a set list of questions to review was definitely a positive."

    "I would recommend this course to students who want to study biology.",
    "Take cell bio if you can! Don't listen to the people who say it's too much information. As long as you put in the time you can do fine in the course. You will also come out with an appreciation for cellular biology, and this class will no doubt be helpful for future biology classes (if you're an MCDB\/MB&B major).",
    "Yes, take it! You have been warned: it is a LOT of material, and it is really, really easy to fall behind. You do not want to fall behind. Do whatever you have to do to keep up with the readings and lectures. That said, I enjoyed the material we learned! It was really rewarding to take principles learned in introductory biology and expand on them even further to learn things like how we see or smell, or how cells behave. If you like biology, you'll love the course material, even as it robs you of soul and sleep.",
    "DON'T BE AFRAID OF WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING. cell bio is NOT that much work, AS LONG AS you can find a good study group of 5 to 6 people. split up exam review questions as soon as possible, review after thursday lecture, pay attention in section, and you're good to go.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who needs it for their major. Otherwise, only take it if you are \/really\/ interested in cell bio. The material is interesting, but it's also fast-paced and very dense. However, the grading is fair, which offsets difficulty of the material.",
    "Would I recommend this course to another student? Probably not. Hear me out. I have taken many MCDB courses, from intro course to cores, electives and graduate courses; i have tutored some of those courses (which kind of defeats the anonymity of this review, but oh well) and I have a general idea of the competences you should have after you finish a college biology course. What that being said, this course is not hard and this course isn't challenging, per se. This course, is just, for lack of a better word, annoying. The critical thinking expected of students in this course is probably at a high-school level, which isn't particularly great. Some people view this course as hard because the amount of material covered, which is fair. You go through a couple dozen 50-page chapters and there's a lot of material involved. Pollard and King will give you an A to Z presentation of cell biology. Notice I said presentation and not understanding. You might think you understand stuff, but you really don't since you're mostly tested on basic recall of information. You will learn that F-type ATPases produce ATP by using the proton gradient, and V-type ATPases create a proton gradient using ATP, but you won't know why that is important, nor will you understand what happens on a cellular level when you knock either of these out besides the fact that the cell dies. Most of the time, the quizzes ask you to compare and contrast the 2, 3 or 5 different classes of pumps\/kinases\/signaling pathways, and that's about it. You get two questions per quiz and you choose one, although the questions aren't always equally difficult. So you do this, week after week, studying something and then regurgitating that without a true sense of direction. The final then comes and punches you in the face with the amount of material you have to learn, you get a blood nose and you survive. And now you're left, one semester later, pondering if this was a good decision. You've learned about everything in the cell, but not really and after a few weeks if someone asked you to name and compare two kinases, you might, but you'll wonder what the point of that was. This course is a great reference course: a Wikipedia of cell biology that you have to memorize. It tells you the population of Croatia, or the length of the BRCA1 gene, but you could've looked those things up yourself. So, if you want to take this course. Take it. It's a fair, well taught course and if you put in the work you'll be fine. Is it interesting? Maybe, depends on your definition of interesting. Is it useful? Yeah, sure, not because you learn stuff but because you'll know what section of the textbook you should look in, 5 years from know, when you're looking up kinases. I do have to say though, that Prof. Pollard and King really try to make the most out of this and are in it for you to win. You'll get study guides, they're great at explaining and are really wonderful. But the course is flawed and unless they reduce the emphasis on memorization and make it more about problem solving, don't take this course. There are better courses where you can experience the same amount of self-hate during finals, while still learning applicable information.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to MCDB majors. It covers important foundational knowledge that may be helpful to your research and other pursuits.",
    "This is super time consuming if you want to do well. I probably would have been better off not taking it, or at least Cr\/D. The peer tutor sessions each Monday are very helpful for understanding the material. The course covers so much information that studying for the final is pretty overwhelming. The content is interesting, but the focus on quizzes and final exam really detracts.",
    "Fantastic course. Thorough, although maybe a little dry.",
    "YES! Much more structure and transparency as well as true learning of material than most MCDB courses",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in cell biology and willing to put in the time it takes to memorize tons of pathways and facts. If you work hard, you will get a lot out of it.",
    "You really have to take this course if you think you're interested in biology, whether on a professional or personal level. Yes, it's hard; yes, there's a lot of information; yes, it meets early; and yes, it more than justifies itself. I went into this course thinking I wanted to be a biology major, and I came out of it knowing that biology is what I wanted to do with my life. Seriously. Take it.",
    "I would recommend this class because I really feel like I learned a lot, and I got to learn about a wide range of different topics in biology which was interesting since most biology classes focus on only a select few topics. Professor Pollard is also an incredibly accomplished professor, writer, and researcher, so I feel really lucky to have had him too.",
    "Yes if you are a biology major take this class. Totally relevant and necessary material, completely up to date.",
    "I would but only if you don't take other 4+ challenging courses with it. It has weekly quizzes and if you have other heavy workload, it is quite hard to be able to prepare.",
    "If you like self-teaching and memorization and your brain works best adding lots of small pieces on top of each other rather than together, this is a good class.",
    "Prof. Pollard is truly passionate about his work though his lectures could be a bit dry. The class has a ton of information to memorize but I personally find the handouts to be very helpful. The final did not seem to be as memory based as the quizzes, which was such a relief.",
    "If you are looking to fulfill an MCDB requirement and want something that isn't easy but you will learn a lot from, then definitely take this class. You will learn so much that is applicable to chemical, physical and obviously biological aspects of science.",
    "Yes. If you are hesitant about the class then start it off credit D and then convert it to a letter grade later.",
    "This class is beautiful but also a ton of work. The weekly quizzes make it so you know what's happening when the final rolls around.",
    "Yes! But only if you really like cell biology and are willing to put in all the work to doing well.",
    "Cellular Biology is a very interesting class, although it is very work-intensive. The lectures are extremely dense, which make the weekly quizzes a bit difficult to study for. However, many of the quizzes were fair, as well as the final exam.",
    "An essential class for an MCDB major. No doubt about it, this class is not easy, and requires a good grasp of the underlying principles (so it's not just memorization). This class equips you with a powerful \"map\" understanding of various cellular events; anything you study in detail later will benefit, since you can immediately place it alongside the other molecules, pathways, and events in the cell. In short: extensive and challenging, but powerful and insightful.",
    "It's not as bad as people say. As opposed to some science classes, however, this class really just boils down to pure rote memorization. It's rather unfortunate because I found the class quite unsatisfying compared to other science classes at Yale. Take genetics, tbh, if you want a really rewarding class.",
    "I would recommend this course because it will reinforce biological concepts and it teaches knowledge that will help you in other courses.",
    "much better than most of the other stem lectures i've taken (which is a bit sad, bc really this is the standard of what a lecture course should be). you'll also learn a lot.",
    "This class takes more time than most other biology classes because of the weekly quizzes. At first the study sheets can seem overbearing up after the first few quizzes it becomes easier to figure out the concepts that are most important and likely to be on the quiz.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, but only to MCDB majors. There isn't really another reason to learn about cell biology in such detail if you do not care about it. The course is well-organized and while quizzes are difficult and encompass a lot of material, you can do well on them with sufficient studying. Do not underestimate the time you will have to invest to absorb this information and understand what goes on inside and around the cell.",
    "There is a LOT of material to be learned in this class. The lectures move pretty fast, and it can take a lot of time to keep up with the weekly quizzes. However, you end up learning a lot, which proves extremely beneficial for future biology classes you take at Yale. Despite the workload, this class is extremely rewarding, and I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about biology beyond the intro modules.",
    "Yeah i for sure recommend taking it although do not take it if you have other very demanding courses to take as well.",
    "I wouldn't unless you're MCDB\/MBB as it's not exactly fun, but you will learn a lot if you're interested.",
    "If you are capable and interested in lots of memorization, and want to gain a comprehensive understanding of cellular function, then take this course. It is a lot of work but it is definitely manageable, and Professor Pollard is fantastic. His motto is that we should \"learn to swim in the infinite sea of knowledge and ignorance\" that is cell biology, which I think is a worthy goal.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they are willing to put the work in and learn the material. The weekly quiz format will keep you ahead of the material.",
    "Great course! Covering an entire textbook (over 40 chapters) of information felt like an incredible feat. Weekly quizzes were a challenge at first, but it felt like the grading was so arbitrary at some points. Studying 10 hrs could result in a 6\/10, while 2 hours the night before a 10\/10.",
    "If you like biology and it excites you to memorise lots of shit then you'll like it. Notes and power points were helpful. Book was pointless as it is too much detail and little context or motivation",
    "I would recommend this course to another MCDB student because it provides a good basic foundation.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn a breathtaking amount of cell biology but also if you have a significant portion of your semester to devote to it.",
    "Do not take this course if at all possible. The workload is extreme, there's no other way to put it. Just a huge amount of memorization with very little conceptual development. If you have the time to take it and you want to take the MCAT maybe use the course as a study tool, otherwise do something else.",
    "A great course if you want to know more about the cell.",
    "If you want in depth knowledge about cell bio, this is the class for you.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, it was a great class!",
    "It's a solid MVDB requirement course. It has a lot of useful information for graduate school, the MCAT and medical school, as well as research associates who may want to be involved in a lab. It also opens up the way for a lot of great upper level courses. If it could be taken later in the morning, it would be an even better course.",
