    "This was a small class with a very diverse group of grad students and undergrads. You can go in knowing no French (but it would help to have some background, or background in another romance language) and come out knowing how to (almost) read a French newspaper. You get out what you put in. The textbook is great, that's how you learn. Class is a waste of time, but it's just once a week. Prof. Sanjabi is nice, but it would make more sense for someone whose first language is English to teach the class.",
    "Take it if you want to quickly be able to read French texts, newspapers. Don't take it if you want to learn how to speak French fluently, or practice listening skills.",
    "It is a good course for those to gain a fast introductory knowledge of French reading. This is not a regular language course in that you really are only learning to read. As a result there is a heavy emphasis on grammar, and the vocabulary acquisition is more up to you to do on your own throughout the semester. Prof. Sanjabi is great.",
    "Yes, if one has experience in the french language or would like to sharpen up their skills. Definitely a good overview of the language as a whole.",
    "A good and low-stress way to pick up basic reading skills for research or work.",
    "French 109 is a great course in which to learn to read French. It does not go over speaking and pronunciation, which is indicated in the syllabus, but given that you may not have enough time for the standard French class, this is a fair trade-off.",
    "If you need to take it, take it with Dr. Sanjabi. Also, it is definitely much easier to take this course then to try and learn French on your own. The course itself requires consistent hard work. It is a lot of fun, but it's very productive."
