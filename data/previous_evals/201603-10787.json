   "comments": [
    "This class helped me in my reading, thinking, and writing, but I'll focus on the writing: Anne does a magnificent job of both guiding the class through the syllabus and assignments and facilitating a class community that continues outside of the classroom. As a result, my writing felt high-stakes, and I achieved a new level of focus and depth that helped me both do a better job of reporting and research and explore the stamina of my creativity.",
    "By reading such a diverse array of writers' voices -- from both the readings and my classmates -- I learned what can be done by experimenting with style and structure. I also learned to refine my writing greatly on the level of the sentence, revising for clarity, humor, and effectiveness. I learned that I -- a writer who has gained the majority of her experience in newsrooms -- can do personal writing, too!",
    "I learned so many practical skills about writing and reporting-- like how to manage time, how to overcome the instinct to procrastinate, how to treat sources ethically, etc. I also thought this course had a unique focus on building a sense of community within the class itself and between Yellow Pages and critique partners, so I improved as an editor and discusser-of-writing, which I think improved my ability to revise my own work.",
    "This class transformed my writing.",
    "It is absolutely impossible to take 469 and not become a better writer. Each class focuses on a particular element of craft in the readings, allowing you to improve at the profile, sentence variation, rhetorical devices, etc. One-on-one conferences with Anne help you notice your strengths, weaknesses, and general tendencies in your work. You will get to contemplate the ethical questions of writing and reporting. If you are like me, your appreciation of writing on the level of the sentence will increase exponentially - things like word choice, strong endings, structural elegance. I had never reported before, and felt supported by my classmates, Anne, and my Yellow Pages partner (the classmate-pair everyone is put in for the final project); I feel much more confident, going forward, about reportorial writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are infinite. Anne has been teaching this class for many years, and her experience shows in her ability to easily and generously direct class time and fit in elements that interact with each otherreading discussions, workshops, writing advice, peer critiques, reports on authors, author visits. Both the class experience and our individual work feel like pieces of the same project, and that makes people feel responsible for themselves and the experience of others.",
    "Prof. Fadiman is highly engaged with each student, more so than any other professor I've had; the individual one-hour conferences were absolutely invaluable. Feedback from my peers was fantastic, too, and I greatly enjoyed the readings. The author visits were especially special. Don't really have any suggestions other than perhaps some (very minor) tweaking of the reading list here and there!",
    "This course's biggest strength is Anne's incredible engagement with it, which I think inspires all the students to really invest in it as well. Anne spends an hour talking to every student individually about every piece they write for this class. You get the chance to really talk with her, ask questions about writing, get advice about Life etc-- all the stuff I want to do with professors but don't because I am intimidated. Here it is mandatory yay! Aside from the conferences, Anne structures each class really carefully, so there's never a flat moment, brings in guests and gives the class opportunities to interact even with writers who don't come to campus, and hosted an after-hours pizza party to discuss grammar. (Everyone came and it was very fun.) The other big strength stems from the first and is that this class really felt like a warm, supportive community. Can't think of any weaknesses but I will admit I am slightly disappointed that I took this class and still am not John Jeremiah Sullivan.",
    "Anne is incredible. There is nothing bad about this course."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "My only caution would be to consider if you are willing to invest the amount of attention this all-consuming class requires. If you do not want to be a writer, or if you are not at least passionate about writing, you will likely find yourself overwhelmed. For prospective writers, however, I cannot think of a reason not to take it. I have had no other writing professor at Yale who gives as much individualized attention as Anne Fadiman.",
    "Without a doubt, yes.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Your writing will improve markedly over the course of the semester, and the opportunity to have so many eyes so closely focused on your writing alone is so, so rare.",
    "Take the class if you get in. Anne gives more feedback than any other writing professor at Yale (one hour, one-on-one, for each assignment), and that, combined with the feedback you receive from classmates, will improve your writing immeasurably. You'll fix flaws you had never before recognized in your work. Good discussions on readings that always felt like a treat. She brings a few special guests to class each semester (Gay Talese, John Jeremiah Sullivan) and meeting them is amazing. Potential downside: Anne encourages students to take the class Credit\/D\/F (the idea is that you take risks in your writing) which can be frustrating since I can almost guarantee you'll spend more time on this class than on any other. But it's not an inflexible request and you can probably work around it. Workload is slightly frontloaded three short papers due every other week in the beginning of the semester with a long time toward the end of the term to work on the final piece.",
    "Yes! Take it to spend quality time with a great professor and group of writers! My only hesitation would be that, despite the reputation(\/hype), it is not THAT different from some other nonfiction classes you could take, like English 454, so do know that. And if you want to go into journalism maybe think about whether you want to spend one of your Yale credits sort of practicing what you hope your job will be or instead, like, reading Shakespeare.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Anne cares more than any instructor I've ever encountered, and genuinely wants you to get over that hurdle that is standing between you and you as the best writer you can possibly be, whatever that hurdle may be.",
    "Wholeheartedly recommend",
    "It's all over the student evaluations: this class is absolutely incredible. If you get in, you would be a fool not to take it. You probably have already read those evals though (I remember one I read saying \"Anne will love you more than your own mother\") so I will just address some fears that I had, that you might have: -Do not be afraid if you have never reported before: one of the class mantras is the Singer quote \"I only write what only I can write\" - you will be able to do whatever it is you do, and if you haven't reported before, that just means you'll get to do you, but learn a whole lot along the way. -I know that I was at first extremely intimidated by this class: not only does Anne have quite a reputation (that, let's be honest, she helps cultivate with her intense devotion to and high, high expectations of her students), the students in the class tend to be (or at least were for me) both the big editors of all the publications, and ultra-cool. This is only a great thing! Between forum posts, in-depth critiques, distinct voices, and the fact that so many people are taking this class Cr\/D, 469 never feels competitive. You're sitting with 11 brilliant and wonderful peers: that can be scary, but ultimately, it's only a wonderful thing. -Don't be discouraged if you don't get in the first time you apply; there are a load of apps and it totally doesn't preclude you from getting in the next year - happened to me. Obviously, you're going to have to devote a lot of time to this course. Obviously, it's worth it."
