    "I ALMOST DROPPED THE 2ND SEMESTER OF DS. I DIDN'T. I CAN'T EXPRESS HOW GLAD I AM THAT I DIDN'T. It was so, so much better for me than first semester. First semester is tough. Because you're working hard and struggle-bus'ing it to develop the analytic, critical reading, and writing skills you need to actually engage with the material in the way your professors expect you to. By second semester, you're nearing the top of the hill. Don't give up! 2nd semester gives you the opportunity to actually engage those newly built tools with some of the richest works you could want to engage with. Tolstoy, Kant, Borges, anyone? Literature, which I never felt a particularly strong affinity for, surprised me by triggering some genuine insights within me that will continue to shape how I view my own life going forward.I highly recommend it!",
    "I would recommend DS Lit to another student.",
    "I recommend the course for anyone looking to get a broader understanding of the western cannon - it orients you very well.",
    "Yes. It's interesting to see the epic tradition evolve into the lyric and into modernism.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was amazing to read all of these classic works and see how they were influenced by and developed out of their own times and how they have in turn influenced subsequent thinking.",
    "Second semester DS is far better than first semester.",
    "It's really interesting to see what the professors pick for us to read as we move from last semester's obvious picks to a more subjective definition of classics less tested by time. This class is great. Professor Levin is so nice and totally accessible and always willing to help (run your drafts by her!) and you get to have dinner at the president's house.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Reading is more fun than the first semester, and leaves you with a great foundation that you can build on any time you pick up a book.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in pursuing any study in the humanities. The second semester of DS literature begins with Petrarch and Don Quixote and ends with Borges (or sometimes T.S. Eliot). The course covers a considerable number of pages, but what is valuable about this course is that through reading all those pages you really come to see for yourself how literature changed and evolved from the 17th to 20th century. There are many literature classes that can give you an in depth study of one author or one topic, but there are not many like DS Lit that can show you an overarching progression in a meaningful way. One of the other advantages of this course is that you get to be in a small seminar with a professor who will help you to improve your analytical writing. You will come to know all the works you read in DS, but you will come to know even more closely the works that you choose to write your papers on. I recommend this to anyone interested in the humanities not only for the overarching survey it gives, but for the depth that you can get along the way, and the quality of discussion and thinking you will get in this small seminar.",
    "DS is so great! You are given the chance to study a huge range of works in a small seminar setting with other students who are really smart and have similar interests and then listen to lectures given by people who have studied the works for years. Also, the DS community is so supportive and fun. I would definitely recommend DS!",
    "Professor Levin is great. She leads section with knowledge as well as cheer. Levin can make you excited to talk about Literature at 9 in the morning. She's great.",
    "Yes, its a good introduction to western writing."
