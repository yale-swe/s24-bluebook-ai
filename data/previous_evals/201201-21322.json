   "comments": [
    "Do it if you want a really easy and interesting introduction to China.",
    "Good class. Not too difficult, but provides one with a knowledge about Chinese culture over the thousands of years.",
    "It is a pretty good overview of Chinese history. It does not take much time at all.",
    "Helen Siu provides a broad and interesting look at Chinese Culture, Society, and History. Unfortunately, the course wasn't able to get into nitty gritty anthropology work and felt a lot like a history course at points. The focus was on anthropological interpretation rather than actual anthropological work, but a really good broad look if that's what you're looking for.",
    "Great Soc credit, if you have any interest at all in China.",
    "Sure! As an introductory class it accomplishes all the main topics for having a better understanding of what China is.",
    "I would recommend it if you have a strong interest in China.",
    "Awesome class to gain a deeper understanding of China. Start with imperial China but has heavy focus on 20th century China and present-day China. Yes it is an anthropology course, but incorporates themes of history and economics as well. Manageable workload, two essays and a final. It is a must take.",
    "Anthro 170 is a survey course on Chinese culture and society from a historical perspective. The class provides you a wealth of information from films, lectures and readings and gives you the opportunity (but more like a challenge) to craft your own understanding of China. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't already know a ton about Chinese history. I also recommend it to people who want a harmless introduction to the field of anthropology. The professor and TAs are great; all four of them were approachable when you needed them and overwhelmingly willing to help out.",
    "Yes.",
    "This was a class I took because it fit my free time in my schedule, and it ended up being one of the classes I enjoyed the most. I had little opportunity to learn about Chinese history and culture before now, and this was a great overview of all of that information. I would recommend this class to anyone else who doesn't have basic knowledge about Chinese history and culture, as it's interesting and not at all difficult.",
    "Take the class if you're interested in China but do not have a good understanding of its history and culture.",
    "This is a very good class, covers a wide array of issues and truly tries to examine multiple theories of how did Chinese society evolve from the imperial times to present. Very little work and I found the reading interesting.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend the class to someone looking for a better understanding of where Chinese people in our generation are coming from today!",
    "A good general survey course of all of China's history told from an anthropological perspective.",
    "Definitely, it is a great class with very interesting topics.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend it to another student.",
    "Yes. Take it. It's very interesting.",
    "Take this course if you want a great overview of the region and people. Not too work intensive, but enough so that you are forced to learn about the subject matter.",
    "Yes! Its one of those nice introductory courses even for those who kmow nothing about China. And for those who do, its still an interesting perspective",
    "great class, great survey of China. take it",
    "I would say that Anthropology 170 is a great course to take if you are interested in China and Chinese culture, but don't necessarily know a great deal about it. I would recommend this course to another student, but I think that it really has to be something you're interested in because it is definitely a sort of niche class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in Chinese culture. You learn about Chinese culture from so many different perspectives and how China came to be (and how the country is always changing).",
    "It's a broad overview of topics relating to Chinese culture, both historical and contemporary. There was a lot of reading assigned although you don't have to do all of it.",
    "This course gives a great overview of China and doesn't go too in depth. It has made me appreciate China a lot more. There are a lot of readings, but you don't have to do them in order to do well (though they are quite interesting). Grading on the responses and essays are very fair - just as long as you go to most of the lectures, you'll do fine.",
    "Take the course if you want a good background on China from a cultural perspective. Be warned, though, that there are once-a-week mandatory sections, and you'll often be asked to watch movies and write film responses on your own time (because Professor Siu falls behind in lectures), in addition to the assigned readings and papers. I enjoyed the class material a lot, but I did not enjoy the unexpected work.",
    "TAKE IT!!! Especially if you feel ignorant about China. Professor Siu made me change my mind completely about the importance of China as a rising nation for the world's largest public education promoter, developer and foreign investor. This subject is fascinating and very well taught.",
    "Take this course if you really want to understand Chinese culture and to get an overview of Chinese history. The material is interesting and Siu is passionate but not a particularly engaging lecturer."
