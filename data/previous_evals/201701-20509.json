    "It's like an 8th grade algebra course: you learn cookie cutter problems and how to solve theme",
    "Basic computations of returns and volatility of investment portfolios; understanding of derivatives such as futures and options, and using them to find arbitrage opportunities; aspects of behavioral finance (i.e. how psychology factors into financial outcomes); the history of finance, both in the U.S. and around the world.",
    "In lecture, I learned about the history of different financial institutions\/assets. In section, I learned how to price those assets.",
    "I gained a broad overview of finance in America.",
    "Got a good broad introduction to Finance, and learned how to quantitatively analyze common financial applications such as mortgages and bonds.",
    "I learned the basics of financial markets and some quantitative stuff to go with it.",
    "Got an overview of the math and concepts of financial markets, pretty general and all around. Lots of random facts and formulas...",
    "General overview of financial markets, some useful formulas and math",
    "A broad understanding of how financial markets work. I think the course is great in giving you an introduction to the capital markets, the regulatory framework of them, and the institutions through which they operate.",
    "A basic understanding of financial structures and institutions. Not too much computational stuff.",
    "I learned some basic topics and concepts in financial markets, such as weighted portfolios, CAPM, bond pricing, real estate, futures contracts, and options pricing, to name a few. I definitely developed more insight into what \"finance\" is, but I did not develop that much more knowledge or insight because the course wasn't well taught or organized.",
    "I learned a lot the general functioning of Financial Markets. Especially interesting an valuable for me was the input about narratives of Financial Markets!",
    "This course provided a solid introduction to finance and taught me how to solve common financial problems, such as those dealing with investment portfolios and mortgages.",
    "Learned about the inner workings of financial markets, and how to price simple financial instruments.",
    "You learn a great deal about options, mortgages, forwards\/futures, and general statistical math. You also learn about the markets in a very conceptual way.",
    "This class offers a great crash course on some aspects of financial literacy and finance broadly. It offers a nuanced impression of many aspects of finance, risk, investment vehicles, and other topics as well.",
    "Learned a lot about how finance works in the real world and about the history of finance.",
    "I learnt the basics about financial markets and how the economy in general functions in relation to finance.",

    "Econ 252 was a great overview of financial markets. I came in with virtually no knowledge of finance but felt that came out having a good grasp on what finance is. Professor Shiller's insights are invaluable. It was really interesting to learn how he looks at different aspects of financial markets.",
    "This course was a glimpse into the financial institutions that govern daily life. Shiller's approach to finance as not vocation, but rather an institution essential for a good society is a wonderful perspective that really changed the way that i think of finance.",
    "I gained a vast amount of knowledge regarding financial markets, institutions, regulations, and theory. I am now much more familiar with the terminology used to discuss finance, and the course has also allowed me to develop an idea of how the financial world works. Additionally, I learned about recent research and consensus among academic inquiry regarding finance. I also gained familiarity with financial calculations, including calculating bond prices, option prices, futures prices, and mortgage balances and payments. Finally, I gained an appreciation for how Professor Shiller views the world of finance and how the tools of finance can be used to accomplish important goals.",
    "Financial Markets provides good common sense intuitions about how various aspects of finance workfor instance, why is insurance important to society? What are forwards, futures, and options? How to investment banks work and what purpose do they serve? It teaches basic financial mathcalculating the price of bonds, futures, and options, constructing bank balance sheets and mortgage payment schedules, etc. The course teaches a basic financial vocabulary, particularly if students read the textbook.",
    "I gained knowledge of and insights into the modern financial system. I gained a new vocabulary of the different types of financial instruments and terms used to describe the performance of financial markets. I also gained skills of mathematical estimation of the value of various financial assets."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Be better organized!",
    "Have someone else (not in the business school) teach this class. Have TAs who are focused on engaging students and presenting material clearly instead of trying to cover up the fact that the professor does not teach well",
    "I think the exams really need to be restructured. Overall, the quantitative aspects of the final were fair, i.e. we had seen everything asked in one way or another on the problem sets. But the short answer questions tend to pick concepts from THE MOST OBSCURE portions of readings - readings that, let's be honest, most people don't do because they are busy digesting the lecture slides and learning the mathematical tools necessary for doing problem sets (which is the sole focus of section). It really just felt like the short answers were meant to stump people, and did not value the experience of going to lecture, and learning from Shiller.",
    "Weakness: I think there should be less reading, but then the exams test more of it. Right now there is so much reading and so few questions on it (i.e. the points are all dispersed) that virtually no one does them\/crams at the very last minute.",
    "Weakness: 8:45 lecture at SOM twice a week. It was the worst. Please at least consider changing the time or making it 9am or having it on Yale campus instead. My TA Michael didn't care about the students at all. I thank the lead TA, Majed, for all of his dedication and help in stepping up when my own TA didn't.",
    "Great professor and caring TA's The lectures could be better organized and information from lecture could be shared more clearly",
    "The exams and problem sets were largely quantitative, and lecture barely covered anything quantitative, making it fairly not worthwhile to attend. While Professor Shiller is an interesting teacher, the material we were tested on did not reflect the majority of what was covered in the course, and as such most lectures had very poor attendance for a class taught by a Nobel Laureate. I would recommend adding more quantitative practice to the course, either through posted practice sets or in lecture, or instead having the exams test more qualitative material since that is the focus of the lecture.",
    "TAS we're pretty good, lectures were on and off interesting, the tests barely related to lectures....",
    "strengths: good overview of information, sections generally useful weaknesses: no transparency in exams, evaluated random nitpicky details",
    "Strengths: TAs and Professor are always willing to help and explain things that may be even out the scope of the course. Weaknesses: The class can sometimes get very monotonous and this reduces the level of student engagement and participation.",
    "One of the strengths is that you come away from the course with a good broad view of financial markets. You aren't myopically stuck with the specific math, you just have a solid understanding of key concepts. One of the weaknesses is that the reading is a bit dry sometimes. Good material, just overexplained in the textbook.",
    "Strengths: famous, esteemed professor. Occasionally he's kind of funny. Weaknesses: course meeting time (8:45 am at SOM is brutal), badly taught (Shiller is all over the place), badly organized, curriculum jumps from topic to topic with little logic. There aren't many redeeming qualities of the course. Unreasonable in expecting students to do a crazy amount of reading. Just assign certain pages, not entire chapters. Shiller was also really inaccessible - communication was primarily with his personal assistant, Bonnie. He held no office hours (not that they would have helped - I imagine he rambles a lot in real life too). This course could be improved by restructuring the curriculum so that it has more logic to it. The easiest way to do this is just by following the textbook. It could also be improved with slides that are more telling - the slides are often incomprehensible. Prof. Shiller also needs to stay more focused. He rambles a lot and often falls behind. At least he had the foresight to add in an extra lecture slot because he knew he was going to fall behind.",
    "There were too many textbook-readings instead of papers. The mathematical part and the conceptual part from the lecture should be better related.",
    "The material covered during lecture diverged a lot with what was required for problem sets and exams. Bridging that gap would be extremely helpful.",
    "Strength is the math and psets, they force you to learn a lot. Weakness is the format of the tests. The tests are designed to test random points from the 600 page textbook that were never emphasized in class or in section, and the problems on the final were substantially more difficult than the problems on any pset.",
    "Strengths: the topics covered are all important and Professor Shiller sometimes gives his opinion on certain subjects which is interesting to hear. Weaknesses: the exams were way too difficult and did a poor job being reflective of the material we studied in class\/did on the homework.",
    "The class's strength comes in the form of its underlying material. When presented properly, it is interesting and engaging. However, the class's weakness is in the style of lecture. Much of the material presented does not feel germane to the topics of the exams and problem sets. Math and formulae are only provided in section, which students overly depend on.",
    "Great class, but the lectures had little to do with the tests. The lectures were just enjoyable and informative, but sections and psets were where the actual learning happened for testable material. Not quite sure whether that approach was intentional. Random questions on random textbook sections felt useless.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in the breadth of this course as it covers a lot and provides a very extensive overview of finance. I guess where it could be improved is in terms of structure. It gets a little difficult to understand the narrative of the course at times, perhaps due to the amount of material that needs to be covered. Moreover, some of the basic finance concepts are glossed through which makes it a little difficult to catch up on topics that are more advanced.",
    "Lectures could have more to do with the actual exam questions.",
    "This course was very well-organized with a fair workload, and all that I could criticize is how front-loaded it was. Both midterms (and 4 out of 5 problem sets) were all before spring break, which made the class quite difficult in the first half and then trivial in the second. Additionally, timing the class like this made paying attention in the second half hard, because the knowledge was not going to be tested in any way whatsoever until the final exam.",
    "ta majed was great, shiller tells stories",
    "Strengths: Interesting psets Weaknesses: Lectures were not engaging, unrealistic expectations for textbook readings",
    "The strength: the behavioral aspect of the lectures and Professor Shiller's insights. The weakness: Exams and problem sets were difficult to solve without TF's help or prior knowledge since the material was briefly introduced in sections only.",
    "One of the strengths of the course was its ability to cover such a wide range of topics and to allow students to really grasp the landscape of financial markets and the roles of various players. Another strength was Professor Shiller's very interesting insights, which provided an extremely interesting view of finance and the world in general. One way to improve the course might be to selectively trim the reading list to allow students to more thoroughly explore the most important readings while making others optional. Another suggestion would be to ensure that students have a sufficient statistics background, potentially by making it a prerequisite.",
    "Way too much unrelated material. Too much that we are expected to memorize.",
    "Strengths: Prof Shiller does a good job explaining concepts like what an investment bank does in simple, common sense terms. The class isnt too difficult, and if you read the textbook you can learn a lot. If youre interested in behavioral economics and history of finance, youll enjoy Prof Shillers approach to lecturing, which is full of tangents and stories. Three exams (two midterms and a final) works pretty well as a way to get students to study material more consistently throughout the term. Grading\/curves are pretty generous. Weaknesses: Since the class was at 8:45am at SOM, the lecture emptied pretty quickly after the beginning of the semester, and engagement seemed low. Shillers lectures are fun but move at a very leisurely pace that does not always feel productive. All economic math must be learned in section, as it is not explained beyond maybe a formula on a slide in lecture. The math is also not well connected to the theory\/concepts presented in class. Therefore, learning and understanding the context for the financial math (which comprises all the psets and a big part of exams) is very dependent on having a good TA. I had an amazing TA (Majed Dodin), but if I hadnt, the connection between the math and the concepts would have been very tenuous and I would have had to learn the math haphazardly on my own. Theres a huge amount of reading each week, particularly from the textbook by Fabozzi. Its a great textbook, but its very dense and uses an entire financial vocabulary that is new to most people, which makes the learning curve steep to be able to read the book. The vast majority of the class does not do the readings and therefore ends up scrambling on the concept-based short answer section on the exams.",
    "Strengths: covers a wide variety of financial markets terms and vocabulary as well as mathematical skills and concepts Weaknesses: key concepts are never fully explained and are therefore hard to understand, the textbook is confusing, there is too much reading to plausibly do, the exam questions are extremely nit-picky and never covered in class, the material and vocabulary is brand-new and thus needs more in-depth explanation, math concepts are not taught in class and only taught in section even though these are the bulk of the problem sets and exams"

   "comments": [
    "Shiller is great, even if his lectures drift apart from the course material. I would definitely take the class again.",
    "i would not recommend this course to anyone. It's simply a bad class. It is poorly taught, little material of substance is conveyed, and you could teach yourself the same information in a fraction of the time on your own.",
    "yes",
    "No, the class occurs too early in the morning and they don't count the people who dropped the class after the first midterm into the final curve even though there is a large drop rate because this class is hard. If you do take it, definitely start out credit-d.",
    "Only in certain circumstances. If you really, really want to learn about finance, sure, because there aren't a ton of options as an undergrad at Yale. However, I'd recommend taking it credit\/D. I haven't seen my grade yet, and I think everyone ends up doing fine; but I think for a lot of people, given the current format of the exams, you will not leave feeling confident about a large portion of the test, which is consists of very obscure short answers. Yes, lectures can be fascinating, as Shiller has a wide variety of interests that he manages to weave into the course (or jam in with no regard for the primary purpose of the day's lecture), but overall I didn't feel like it was worth receiving a grade for. It's a credit\/D.",
    "Yes, I can read the WSJ now and have some semblance of what is going on in the futures market or options market. Finance really is all around us, and this class provides a new perspective on how people make decisions because of that.",
    "I would recommend this class, only if you're willing to put in the work to learn finance. The material is interesting but the readings are long and boring. Exams are not very fair in the qualitative questions.",
    "I recommend taking this course for someone interested in learning more about finance from an interesting professor. The tests are difficult and are graded harshly, so its ideal for cr\/d. Professor Shiller could be disorganized at times, but you can learn a lot of cool, useful stuff.",
    "This is a good course for understanding the basics of financial markets, but Shiller is not a great lecturer and the lecture doesn't really reflect the exams. Drill the quantitative stuff, because that's what really determines performance in this course, and be ready to be frustrated at the specificity of some questions. Overall not too bad, but I probably would take Financial Theory (ECON 251) instead of this course if I could choose again.",
    "Would highly recommend to anyone interested or not interested in finance. I was prejudiced against finance before this course. I've been blown away! Read the entire textbook. Great lectures and material.",
    "I guess it's kind of interesting... kind of... eh.... meh. Tests are massive amounts of random fact regurgitation and random formula plugging in, also very meh.",
    "No, the curve was probably really generous but the class itself was frustrating. you basically teach yourself and lectures were just life lessons from shiller",
    "Professor Shiller is clearly incredibly intelligent. But, don't take it for the name, take it if you truly want to learn about the subject material.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course. It's an absolute treat to get to hear Robert Schiller speak two times a week. Honestly, the material can be kind of dry sometimes, but Professor Schiller is a brilliant, kind man (which is such a rare combination to find in academia honestly) and getting to hear his life stories and learn about his values was worth it to me. I'm about to be a senior, and at this point I've realized that there's not much concrete material that an Econ class will teach you that you won't forget\/can just learn online. Take classes for the professors.",
    "DO NOT TAKE. Shiller, while famous and esteemed, is a terrible teacher. You won't learn anything from him. All the learning is done at section. Trudging to SOM is miserable. If you want to learn finance, take a different course, or be willing to learn everything on your own from an extremely boring textbook.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommand it, because it changes the perspective on Financial markets!",
    "This course provides a solid introduction to the world of finance. It was a great opportunity to take a class with Professor Shiller, though one should be prepared to learn most of the material required for problem sets and exams outside of the classroom.",
    "Great course to take if you're at all thinking of doing anything related to finance, or if you just want to know how the financial world works, because you will definitely have to deal with these topics at some point in your life. This is definitely an accessible class that requires no prior knowledge. The textbook is very informative, and Shiller's lectures, although not the best for learning, are still fun to listen to. Would recommend.",
    "I would if you are interested in the material - be aware that the tests will be pretty frustrating to take given the obscurity of the topics covered.",
    "If you're interested in financial markets (stocks, bonds, markets, CAPM, options, futures, forwards, etc), and you're willing to read about them and teach yourself, take this class. But be warned that in class you'll learn more about the history of these things rather than their function, how to calculate them (read: all the relevant stuff). Shiller tends to go on tangents but if you'll put in the work on your own time then it's okay. Still, the tests ask questions about minute details from reading and lectures so it can be really hard.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is looking for a cursory description of many broad aspects of finance. The math is tricky and not always straightforward for non- Econ, but it is valuable.",
    "It's a good class (apart from the ungodly starting time), and Shiller's a good professor in the sense that you'll enjoy his lectures. That said, be very aware that tests draw almost entirely from material covered in problem sets and sections and occasionally the textbook. I honestly think you could go through the class never going to lecture or looking at slides and still come out with an A if you understood problem sets and sections. Still, there's a lot more to a class with Shiller than just the grade, and I think I got a lot out of going to lectures. Math used is trivial, basic algebra, if that.",
    "Yes. However, I wish the course would dedicate one class to covering basic concepts of finance when they are introduced- either in seminars or in lecture.",
    "Only if you are actually interested in finance.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to practically anyone except people that are very serious about finance (they can take a more technical class). Otherwise, this is a relatively easy class with little prior knowledge required, and you get to learn about a fascinating topic from a Nobel Prize winner. I would especially recommend taking this class if you hate finance or think it is evil; one of the main focuses of the class is explaining why finance is important and even how it can improve the world. In general, definitely take this class if you have the time and can handle a few algebraic formulas and some skimmable readings.",
    "no",
    "As someone who only took the class hoping to get some exposure to personal finance for when I have to be an independent adult (rather than taking the class to learn about finance as a career), it's hard to justify taking this course. Lots of pain for little gain. Credit\/D if you're not seriously interested in finance as a profession.",
    "I would recommend it but be ready to work. It is not an easy class but it is helpful if you want to learn about finance.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that wants to learn more about finance and its impact on the world as well as some of the basic formulas that govern financial markets. It is not too in depth in anything but it is a great survey and introduction to an important field of study. Going to section really helped me do the p-sets. Consult with your TA and it won't be much of a problem.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in gaining an understanding of the world of finance. This course provides students with an in-depth understanding of how the world works from a financial perspective, and it also serves to illustrate the benefits that society can gain from financial innovation. It helps to have limited business\/finance exposure coming into the course, but the teaching fellows and textbook were great resources to resolve questions or confusion.",
    "No take financial theory with John G instead - it's a clearer class and more interesting.",
    "I would recommend Financial Markets as a class that teaches basic financial literacy and outlines how the financial world works. That said, you should understand what youre signing up for. In order to learn anything, you must either go to lecture regularly or read the textbook (ideally both!). If you dont, you can probably still do alright in the class learning just the pset math but you wont actually become financially literate. Prof Shillers lectures are fun if youre a morning person and cool with a casual, slow-paced, story-style lecture with lots of tangents. Shiller is a really nice guy and does make an effort to reach out to students, although he is super busy. The five psets are all basic financial math, which then comprises a good part of the examsthis is never taught in lecture, only section. A tricky part of the class is connecting the math on the psets to the concepts learned in lecture. Its super important to have a good TAshop sections!!",
    "An extremely poorly designed course. Lectures are just a waste of time; slides are useless; PSETs do not really correspond to the exams; sections are simply awful and barely cover material in the PSETs. The only positive thing I found about this course are the readings -- they are very interesting and cover a lot of material. Wouldn't recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it teaches concepts that are important to understanding the modern financial system. However, I would warn that the class will require a lot of self-study."
