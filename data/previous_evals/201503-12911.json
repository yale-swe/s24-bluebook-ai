   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend research and a senior project to anyone who feels as though they have the time and energy to devote to it.",
    "This is the course where you learn to apply all the theory.",
    "The lab experience really depends on the lab and graduate student that you work with. If you have an interest in getting hands-on experience then this would be a great way to do that but expect to spend at least 10hrs a week in the lab.",
    "This class is an opportunity to do your own research or help with others research. I recommend this class to people because I think it is so important to get research experience as an undergraduate and I learned so much through this class. It really helped me understand how what I learned in class translated into research.",
    "Best senior thesis class ever, with Greg Samanez-Larkin, who is an amazing advisor.",
    "PSYC 498 is for students who want to perform independent research. It was a great way for me to continue working with the research lab that I've been researching in previously.",
    "A great way to fulfill the senior requirement for psych BS majors",
    "Fine",
    "Yep!",
    "I would recommend."
