   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the class. At first the workload seems like a lot, but stick with it because it is on a declining slope and by the end of the year it was very relaxing And enjoyable to go to!",
    "A class that you would totally enjoy. The readings are very interesting, writing tasks are at a \"just right\" pace, load and difficulty, and plenty of opportunities to share writings and presentations with the class. This class really helps writing skills even if you are a very good writer, as it would definitely consolidate your writing skills to a certain extent. The skills taught and the adivce given are very useful. And because the topic is a general yet unique one, as long as you don't mind a bit of philosophical conundrums, you would love the class no matter where your interests lie.",
    "A great introductory course for college and helps you writing.",
    "English 114 is a writing class that you should take if you want to be introduced to a college level English course. I enjoyed having a small class, where you learn to partake in an academic discussion. Also, the structure of the course allows you to write a first draft, receive feedback on it, and then revise it in a way where you learn how to improve elements of your paper. I personally thought this made me a better writer because I could see my own mistakes and have a conversation with both my professor and peers about them.",
    "English 114 was a good class. I cannot compare it to the other intro writing classes but I can tell you that you will not regret taking it. The workload involves three essays of varying length (usually about seven pages) and a final presentation which requires some work. There is also a good deal of reading involved in this class but it is usually interesting enough and a lot of class time is spent talking about the readings. The small class size is great because you really get to know everyone in the class and you get individual feedback on all of your essays. (Protip: if the instructor tells you to make a change in your paper, Do it!)",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. It was an engaging class.",
    "ENG 114 overall is a good class to take for either someone who plans to write a lot of papers while they are at Yale or for someone who felt that writing was one of their weaker skills in high school. In ENG 114 03 we read relatively short and interesting papers from a variety of fields that all related to the general topic of things. The workload was certainly manageable for even a very busy freshman, and the mandatory meetings with the instructors mean that students can concretely know how to get better grades. I would recommend the course as a good start to writing and reading in college because of its guidance by the instructor and reasonable schedule.",
    "I would recommend it. The seminar feel has it's perks. I really enjoyed class"
