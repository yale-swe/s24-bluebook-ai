   "comments": [
    "this was an interesting class about architecture and sustainability.",
    "Great class. I found it very interesting. Not a ton of work: about 4 small projects, no readings, and a final. She let's you take notes into the final, but honestly feel like you learn a ton just by going to class.",
    "Great class if you have an interest in how to challenge climate change through changing infrastructure.",
    "Sure, take it. I think you could learn quite a bit from Michelle, who is amazing, but I would really pay attention in lectures since theres no other material to look at if you miss or don't understand something.",
    "This is an incredible class! Michelle addington has so much expertise in the field, and is able to communicate it very effectively over the course of the semester.",
    "this is an amazing course. if you are at all interested in any of the three things in the title - take it! there are 4(or 5?) homework assignments and a final. she brings in guest speakers and arranges for field trips. basically low key obsessed with prof addington after this class so would highly recommend",
    "This is a class that's about much more than just building green buildings. It explores so many different examples of unnecessary energy use, and techniques or strategies that can help mitigate these energy wasters. As it is an Architecture class, it does cover new techniques and potential strategies that are being implemented into new developments, and this class analyzes how effective and practical these new strategies may be. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and never felt like the material was too far over my head. I would suggest this to anyone somewhat interested in architecture, the physical makeup of buildings, and sustainability.",
    "Overview of the environmental building sector. Not super in depth about anything. Not as interesting as I thought it would be.",
    "Mandatory sign-in.",
    "Environment, Energy, and Building was an engaging lecture-based course with two distinct strengths - one being that the material covered was inherently interdisciplinary and the course therefore attracted students from outside the architectural discipline - and secondly it provided opportunities to engage with the material in ways extending beyond the classroom setting, from field trips to symposiums, to the assignments which were based either on or own experience (i.e. the energy audit) or through actual sustainability competitions conducted in the past (i.e. AIA top ten).",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Probably my favorite class at Yale so far. Professor Addington is awesome. The material will change the way you think about the world. It's one of the few classes where I've come out feeling like I know so much more about something that I came in knowing nothing about. It's a little bit of everything - a sampling of sorts - but nothing is too brief or too in depth. There are only four outside homeworks and no additional readings. Everyone should take this class.",
    "A great class if you are interested in global warming and environmental issues as they relate to buildings. Very low workload, and the assignments that you do have are interesting. Professor Addington wants you to enjoy the class and do well!",
    "By far the favorite course I've taken this semester and perhaps even at Yale. The course is not about how to make green buildings, but rather about how we can change our building-based approach and find intersections between energy systems, the environment and buildings\/cities in order to reduce our impact on nature and climate as a whole. This is a fantastic approach that is difficult to find or read elsewhere, and the classes oftentimes feel like Professor Addington is sharing her years of insight and expertise on sustainable design and development. She is incredibly competent in her field and is a world recognized leader, and is very helpful and involved in our learning. There are four assignments which are all interesting and the courseload is not too much. Would definitely recommend this course to others, it provides you with great insights in a multidisciplinary field that is increasingly becoming much more important for our lives and the world.",
    "A great course that hits on multidisciplinary issues, for architecture and non-architecture majors alike. Very in-depth look on individual systems in buildings, but also generalizes. Homework assignments are infrequent but time-consuming.",
    "It is a course with very little outside work but when there is an assignment, you really have to put a lot of effort in to do well on it.",
    "I highly recommend this class for anyone interested in building design. The workload is totally manageable and the lectures are interesting.",
    "Definitely take this class! It's not too much work with a large amount of reward. Tak it take it take it if you have any interest in architecture, energy or the environment.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in sustainability and energy systems. The work load is really light, but the assignments are interesting if you are curious about sustainable design. The class is structured as a gut\/survey course, but Professor Addington does a fantastic job of training critical thinking skills if you put in some effort to practice them. At the very least this class will give you a lot of interesting information and case studies that will hopefully have you thinking twice about what standards like LEED and net zero mean."
