   "comments": [
    "Became a better essay writer and certainly a better close reader.",
    "I learned skills to connect literature and place works in a regional context. My close reading abilities improved.",
    "This class exposed me to literature and authors I would never have discovered on my own, and I am so glad for it. Besides well-known writers like Alice Walker or James Baldwin (who I had heard of but had never picked up to read) we also read the delightful Charles Chesnutt and Katori Hall.",
    "I made a big dent in my to-read list, and understood so much more about the books than I would have reading them alone.",
    "This course offered me a new perspective on how to approach literature and exposed me to a lot of ideas. I enjoyed the reading, and even more really appreciated that Dean Mahurin allowed the class to debate and engage with each other in a way that usually doesn't happen in seminars.",
    "I worked mostly on close reading. That is what the course focused most on skill wise.",
    "This class sharpened my analytical skills for literature, especially poetry. My thinking was pushed to a deeper level that I believe came through in my later writing.",
    "I learned how to engage with literature on a level that allows for meaningful conversation and engagement with big questions."

   "comments": [
    "The syllabus is incredible. I like the use of presentations, but they are not actually incorporated into class discussion or analysis, and they should be! I also think we should spend more time on certain books. I think it would be helpful to hear a little bit more about people and where they are coming from approaching the work and discussion we're meant to share.",
    "The strengths are that the reading list is amazing and the group we had was so, so good. I think the only real weakness was time spent on presentations. The presentations at the beginning of class often took a really long time, and sometimes we wouldn't actually dive into real text until there was only 45 minutes left in class. Would have liked to save much more time for text analysis.",
    "The class size should have been smaller to cultivate more fruitful discussion. I will we spent more time placing works within themes of the course.",
    "The syllabus is definitely a major strength, and Professor Mahurin's love for the texts and knowledge are apparent too. The class was too big, which made discussion kind of difficult.",
    "The strength of the course is its reading list. While discussions were normally engaging and productive, I think Professor Mahurin might have not always steered the discussion towards the passages and topics that the students were most interested in. If she asked students what they wanted to discuss, I think this could have been fixed.",
    "The course was a little too large, which made it difficult to participate in the discussion. However, I know that the class was that size so that more people could read the literature on the syllabus. Also, I would have preferred writing a third paper to taking an exam. Literature exam often feel like you get less out of them than working with a text more intimately.",
    "Best reading list of any English class I have taken at Yale.",
    "I think this course was awesome- it was one of my favorite classes I took this year and it challenged me a lot.",
    "The books we read were really incredible. For a literature class I think that is always the most important thing. I think a weakness of the class is that we would spend large amounts of time talking about white characters or only about the men of the books. I think more time could be given to discuss the black women of the novels, even when they aren't given starring roles. Also, I think it should be smaller next year to help facilitate discussion.",
    "I feel like we had robust discussions each class period. People didn't seem afraid to speak their minds, but there was also a level of intellectual respect between people in the class. I did feel that we could have done a better job discussing more parts of each book we read. There was a tendency to spend a lot of time on only a few moments when there were other moments worthy of discussion.",
    "I think the syllabus could be improved by replacing the texts that the class mostly agreed were not great with different texts. The class should be smaller. If we do presentations, there should be time built in for dialogue. Maybe 10 minute presentation, 5 minutes for questions instead of the full 15 minutes.",
    "The course is structured well to give students enough time to engage with each work of literature in-depth and engage with each other across the table in exciting ways. The conversations were always fruitful and I left with lasting take-aways from each one."

   "comments": [
    "Maybe. It was a very white space despite being focused on black literature, and only some black students will want to deal with that.",
    "Yes! A dope reading list, a great professor, and surely a wonderful group.",
    "I enjoyed the readings, but it was often difficult to have productive discussions because the class size was so large.",
    "Yes. This course gives students the chance to appreciate works that don't get covered in any other class at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student - English or AfAm, or any other major. The syllabus is stellar and will not only expose you to great works of literature, but will also change the way you think about race in the US. One of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale (although be warned, Prof. Mahurin is a very tough grader!)",
    "Yes! Great reading list, and really valuable books to talk about.",
    "definitely recommend",
    "I absolutely would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to a friend. If you are willing to do the reading and speak in class, then you will get a lot out of this class and its material. The final exam is a lot of writing though, as in three straight hours, and is my only qualm.",
    "Yes, the course would be worth it just for the syllabus. It's a bonus that Dean Mahurin is an engaging professor and the people in the class were engaged with the books.",
    "Professor Mahurin is a great professor who respects her students and cherishes their contribution to the classroom. You get to engage with important Black Southern literature in critical ways and read incredible books and poetry FOR CLASS when you may not have time to read for fun.",
    "Absolutely take this class! I recommend this class to anyone regardless of major, race, class year, etc. (But I would really love to see more English majors in this class, considering so few classes focused on black authors are offered by the department.) The reading list is amazing. Professor Maturin is so knowledgable and thoughtful and will push you to read the texts very closely. Do not get too distracted by the coolness of the \"Black South\" part of the title of this class: this is absolutely a LITERATURE class. Come prepared to discuss not just race, but also literature in a critical way."
