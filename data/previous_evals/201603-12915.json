   "comments": [
    "This was my first seminar so it was interesting to see how to balance a week of material without class every other day. There was a lot of reading, which was fruitful but if they were undone before class, it was hard to understand.",
    "Better understanding of applying philosophy of language to social justice issues, the quickly evolving study of philosophy of language, Flint Michigan's water crisis, technocratic discourse",
    "I learned a good bit about the canon of the philosophy of language, as well as a new way of thinking about methodologies in academic disciplines.",
    "I really learned a lot about philosophy of language, and the professor gave me very good comments that helped me improve my writing and thinking.",
    "This course encouraged us to make hitherto unexplored connections between racial\/social\/political issues and the philosophical study of language. We discussed the extent to which prevailing norms in the philosophy of language allow us to account for notable features of political discourse (though whether there is such a thing as non-political discourse is questionable). Other areas of philosophy -- most notably political philosophy and epistemology -- have addressed similar issues, so we also asked what bearing the findings in those areas have on philosophy of language. Due to the novelty of this approach, the course was as much about the methodology of philosophy of language as about substantive issues in the philosophy of language (the problem of the de se, the adequacy of Stalnaker's representation of context, etc.).",
    "I thought that this course helped me to think more critically. It was an interesting blend between philosophy of language and critical theory."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is a very interesting topic and I love when philosophy is grounded in real world politics, like this course grounded the philosophy of language with Flint, Michigan. It would have been nice to hear more about Flint in the later classes, especially when the reading was extremely theoretical.",
    "The first day of class in shopping period was vastly different from the rest of the semester. We rarely talked about many of the readings that were assigned, so I just stopped doing them. I thought it was going to be a semester based on conversations about the readings\/topics where we would all sit and engage in a discussion led by the professor, but it turned into the professor standing at the board talking for two hours with a few loaded interjections by the same students. There was little self-reflection on actual dynamics of \"language and power\" within the course. The course should definitely have a different name because we weren't studying intersection of language and power in a deep, self-reflective, or dynamic way.",
    "Strengths: exciting new ways to think about philosophy of language and apply it contemporary issue. One of the few philosophy classes that is directly related to issues in politics and the world today. Weaknesses: classes were a bit disorganized and repetitive. The class was more about Professor Stanley's thoughts and graduate students taking issue with parts of his argument. The class says you don't need a philosophy of language background, which is true for writing the assignments for the class, but you can sometimes feel a bit lost when the arguments get esoteric",
    "This course was not well organized. The focus changed completely on multiple occasions throughout the semester. The material was novel, but would have been easier to parse if it had been better presented. Of course, the material was so new that a good organization did not exist.",
    "Strengths: the content and reading were extremely interesting. Weaknesses: The course ended up being a bit of a lecture-format due to the many students in the room. Also, the course was a bit disorganized, and didn't cover as much of the \"language\" topics as I had hoped.",
    "I think this is a bad class to offer to undergraduates because there were so may graduate students, and students in the class who were less experienced were terrified to speak up. I think it would have been better if he offered two sections of the class, one for more experienced UGs and grad students, and another for less experienced UGs. However, it really is a unique and fast paced research course designed to introduce students to new research in the philosophy of language. Yet the entire syllabus is mislabeling, as we did not focus at all on any black writers or thinkers.",
    "The best philosophy courses are as much about methodology as about substantive issues in a given sub field; this course put the methodology of philosophy of language under the microscope in a way that I have not seen elsewhere. It ought to be commended for making us question whether philosophy of language, as practiced today, accurately reflects our actual use of language. Asking this question led to some nice insights about not-at-issue content, common ground, and speech acts. That said, I think we could have made even more strides if the syllabus were restructured. In particular, looking back, the course seemed to have two threads that I am not sure were tied together as effectively as they could have been: one about technocracy (as exemplified by our case study of Flint), the other about problems with the standard practice of philosophy of language. We spent the early weeks of the semester on the first with very little mention of the second; I wish that we had hit the ground running by talking about technocracy from a linguistic standpoint, and how\/whether technocratic discourse fits into the standard practice. This would have alleviated another problem I had, which was that when we did turn to language, we opted (at least at first) for talking at a very high level of abstraction rather than considering specific examples (of which Flint, I think, provided many). The last major weakness of the course is that people did not always seem like they were on the same page. Part of this was because of the varying levels of familiarity with philosophy of language; though perhaps the onus is on the student to fill any gaps in knowledge (overall, I was glad to have non philosophers in the room). But there were also weeks when it wasn't entirely clear what we were supposed to read (we departed from the syllabus early on), and so people showed up having done different readings (or done nothing at all); this was less a problem later in the semester when Professor Stanley sent emails each week telling us specifically what we should read.",
    "I thought that the course was good because it was fairly ambitious. I like that the professor tried to integrate critical theory into the course at a time when there was so much racial unrest on campus. However, I do feel like the course was fairly unfocused at times, so that made learning in class a little difficult."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I love Professor Stanley so I would recommend this course to another student, but only if they have had experience in philosophy. I could not imagine how other students kept up with the theoretics after a certain point of this course.",
    "I would recommend to someone who already knows a lot about philosophy and who likes to just listen for 2 hours. If you're looking for in-depth discussion that you can engage with, that doesn't happen. Although the course is framed as radical, it's not because it's still philosophy.",
    "If you are willing to accept a course that is a bit chaotic and you don't really know where it is all leading, hearing Stanley discuss what he is working on is really interesting. The tools of applying philosophical questions to pertinent issues (Breitbart, US Bail, Flint Michigan) was fun, interesting, and challenging to do. Highly recommend using office hours as well - Stanley is always willing to help explain ideas more clearly or answer questions you have.",
    "Generally, if you're interested in challenging age-old methodologies like the ones in philosophy of language\/analytic philosophy\/ethics. But, at least when I took the course, the seminar (\"semi-lecture\") was disorganized. I love Jason, but the course was probably not his best work. Still, it's worth checking out. The main problem in my year was that there were too many people in the course. Of course, there were good moments of discovery, due to the exquisitely selected syllabus reading. Yeah, check it out. See for yourself.",
    "Only take this class if you are interested in the philosophy of language, or else class discussions will feel dry to you. The syllabus may seem interesting and exciting, but ultimately those ideas and papers are not discussed adequately in the class to facilitate the learning of those ideas, but rather that the class itself is structured to help Stanley write his book. The class goes fast and there are a lot of new ideas, so do not take this as your first philosophy class.",
    "All philosophy majors should, at some point in their studies, confront (even if they don't ultimately embrace!) critiques of their chosen sub field from philosophers of race and feminist philosophers. This class filled a lacuna in by developing a (still very much nascent) critique of philosophy of language from this angle. Unfortunately, the class suffered from organizational snafus; too often it was the case that people showed up to class having prepared different material (or no material at all) due to lack of clear directions from the syllabus or professor. Even when there weren't such problems, discussion proceeded at such a high level of abstraction that I think was ultimately unproductive. I believe that with a pared down syllabus that focuses on a few key linguistic phenomena, supplemented by many examples of those phenomena, this class could be an unmitigated success. In its present form, however, there were many more misses than hits.",
    "I'd recommend it."
