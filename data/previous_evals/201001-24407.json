    "In comparison to BENG 351, I thought it was more straightforward and the exams better related to the material that had been taught in class. In all there were 8 psets, 1 midterm,and a final. The class wasn't so bad and wasn't as stressful as 351. Some lectures aren't as interesting as others, but overall you'll learn some useful things.",
    "If you are thinking about being a BME major, (especially imaging track), then I would recommend it. I think its too easy for a qualified EE major.",
    "I would only recommend this course if it is required for your major or you find circuits interesting. Most of the course is based no modeling physiological systems as circuits, which I was not expecting.",
    "It's the core course, so you have to take it if you're BME. If you're not BME, I strongly advise you not to take it. It's slow, boring, and barely applicable. It covers mathematical modeling of fluids, oxygen transport, and biosensing\/bioinstrumentation (circuit design). The circuit stuff is actually kind of fun, but the rest is really quite a slog. Good luck.",
    "recommended with hesitance (but you probably are taking it as a requirement)",
    "Take if your Bme",
    "You have to take it if you are BME.",
    "This course is far too introductory. It needs to offer more new material. It needs to expect more of students. There needs to be a greater focus on explaining in depth things that students don't know and less focus on going over things that everyone should have learned in prerequisite courses. It is quite easy to do well in."
