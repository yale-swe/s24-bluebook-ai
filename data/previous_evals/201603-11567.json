   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "This course pushed me to apply the knowledge I have learned in lecture courses in psychology in an unprecedented way. What I first perceived as frustrating in the lack of guidance or prompting for weekly position papers, I soon found to be the most rewarding. In breaking down dense psychology papers from many areas of the discipline and formulating my own ideas in how to engage with the topic or further study this topic, I was challenged to push my brain to relate theory to practical solutions and research. In this class, I gained a way of looking at the world that broke it down into the evolutionary underpinnings of every behavior and found this inquisitiveness pervading the actions I witnessed around me in my life.",
    "How to better understand and analyze a research paper, a huge degree of insight on babies, children, and evolution and human nature more broadly.",
    "By taking this course, I developed a deeper understanding of developmental psychology in the context of family relations. While I already knew the basics of most of the topics from classes like Intro Psych and Intro Cogsci, doing more readings and discussing in class helped me to gain an appreciation for the smaller nuances of the major theories in the different areas of child psychology that we explored.",
    "The skill of how to critique papers and create experimental designs in order to make current papers better.",
    "I gained a ton of insight about families in everyday life by having such intellectual conversations about things I've been surrounded by my whole life. I always left that class excited about the topic of discussion.",
    "I learned how to analyze scientific papers, and be able to point out strengths as well as weaknesses in a variety of psychological studies.",
    "I found this seminar extremely interesting and would highly recommend it to anyone that can get in. I have learned a lot about parenting and infant development."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the strengths are the weekly position papers which force everyone to engage fully and take the readings to the next level; however, I think that the seminar could definitely use a little bit more structure. I thought that there could have been more guidance from Professor Wynn in expectations but also in bringing in her own thoughts from her field-leading work. The Saturday night deadline was also brutal.",
    "The option of no final paper was very much appreciated and is unlike any other course that I have taken at Yale. The weakness of the course was the lack of grades for student participation; there were certain students who simply did not speak for the entire semester",
    "Students could be helped with more specific instructions for the reading responses, since they made up most of the course grade (i.e. the difference between a reading response that merited an 8, a 9 and a 10). The debates were engaging and dynamic, as were many of the class discussions (and Prof. Wynn's insights were always fascinating).",
    "This course is practically perfect in its structure, and I don't think I'd change anything about it. Perhaps it would be nice if reading responses weren't due on Saturday nights, a time when most people have some sort of other time commitments. Otherwise, workload was reasonable, class was interesting and fun, and without any exams or papers, there was never a point where I felt lost or overwhelmed.",
    "The class was too big and should have been maximum 12 students for everyone to really engage all the time. I really thought the class was going to focus on infants and infants cognition on behavior, since of course the title of the class was \"Topics in INFANT studies.\" We did not focus on infants and instead sporadically covered various topics that were not directly about infants, so that was very very disappointing. The professor should make it clear that this class will not just be about infants in the very beginning of the course. Or change the class and just make it about infants.",
    "Student lead discussions provide an opportunity for students to engage in the topics they find most interested. The course is structure in such a way that students know what to expect work-wise each week and can plan accordingly.",
    "I loved the one long seminar and one response a week set-up. I found that I was able to truly do the readings by the time Monday came around. I also loved that the responses were due on Saturday night, which forced me to get it out of the way during the week rather than Sunday night.",
    "Strength - structure of the class, feedback for the weekly reading responses, some disccussions were strong Weakness - sometimes the discussions weren't focused and neither yielded answers or more thought provoking questions - this varied - in these cases it would have been nice for Prof Wynn to prod us along in a direction that yielded greater insight"

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to either a psychology major interested in engaging deeply with many fundamental aspects of infants studies, or a senior who wants to learn more. I would not recommend the class to a student who didn't want to do all the readings or participate in class discussions, as the class might get tedious for them.",
    "If you are at all interested in developmental psychology, definitely take this class. It is relatively easy if you stay on top of the readings, and the seminar format makes it engaging and educational even if a particular class is not about a topic you like. The professor is great, the readings are interesting and relevant, and most likely your classmates will be brilliant and interesting people too. The only work in the class is 50-100 pretty skimmable pages of reading a week accompanied by a weekly 500-600 word reading response. There are no exams or papers (unless you take the option to write a longer paper instead of a few reading responses). If you are looking for an interesting and engaging psychology seminar, take this.",
    "Not if you want to learn about infants. This class will randomly and sporadically cover a range of topics in psychology. If you want a nice seminar with not too much work, yes you can take this.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student willing to engage in student lead discussions about interesting articles and excerpts on infant psychology.",
    "YES YES YES -- if you can get in, this is a great seminar for psych majors and non-psych majors alike.",
    "Yes! Karen Wynn is a phenomenal professor who facilitates discussions among students in order to teach. I found her style of teaching extremely helpful, and she puts just as much time into her class as she expects from her students. Her feedback is clear and she is very approachable. Would definitely recommend!",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, it is a great senior seminar that is a perfect balance of work and interesting material."
