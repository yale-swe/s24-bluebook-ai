    "This class is what the description says; the anthropology of immigration. If you don't like anthro, you might want to reconsider it. This was my first anthro class, and while I was able to keep up, some aspects of the discussion were a little over my head. However, the professor is great and you will definitely come out of the class having learned a lot.",
    "Take this course if you are at all interesting in immigration\/migration studies. Take it even if you don't think you're interested in immigration, because the course material will end up showing you that you should care about it. Immigration is an integral part of so many ongoing political and social issues in the States (and beyond), and I appreciated the course for its relevance. Professor Rogozen-Soltar made everything - even the most theoretical papers - accessible.",
    "A comparative view of arab and latino migration with theoretical background to boot.",
    "I would only reall recommend this course if you are an anthro major or one of the cross-listed majors. However, if you are interested at all in immigration this course would be good for you.",
    "If you really enjoy the many facets of immigration laws, cultural struggles, and barriers in communication, take this class. Otherwise the material might be too involved.",
    "I would recommend this class because I think immigration is a very important and poorly understood topic today, and one that Yale has a dearth of classes about. I also really enjoyed select readings and have been finding them very relevant and applicable in so many situations lately. They keep popping up in my head in relation to something I've read or conversed about. That's always a great feeling. That said, I think this seminar could have been organized a lot better. As it was, the readings for each week were pretty incoherent. Like, we might have read about a particular migrant group for one seminar, but the readings were often about completely disjunct themes. Or we might have read about a particular theme for one class period, but the immigration groups discussed were entirely different. It was just very hard to leave class with one solid takeaway message, which is very helpful for me, especially in a seminar-style class when you're just being exposed to so much information throughout the semester. Being able to leave each day with a key idea -- that you can actually REMEMBER after the class is done -- would have made me feel that I had a better understanding of immigration, which I genuinely desire. I understand that this class was a survey -- and I think that Yale definitely needs that -- but I think it could have been done more precisely. I wish the readings for each class period were more cohesive and coherent, whether about a particular immigrant group or a particular theme. I really liked the professor, though, and I found her very intelligent. I hope she gets a permanent position at Yale because she has so much to offer anthropology students.Also, I think the amount of work for this class was good. The four critical synthesis papers (two pages, double-spaced) took longer than you'd think (or maybe I'm just slow) because you couldn't just summarize, but rather had to forward some sort of argument\/thesis. The media paper was fine, as was the final paper. It was an interesting type of final paper, though, as it was termed a \"research paper\" but was very conceptual and theoretical, and forced the student to, again, push an argument and not just summarize the literature concerning the chosen topic.",
    "Really interesting course, especially if you are a child of immigrant parents or have some sort of experience with immigration\/citizenship\/refugees. Discussion topics were fascinating and Mikaela made it enjoyable for everyone. Workload is very manageable - readings are all interesting, and you have to do 4 short reading responses, 1 midterm paper (fun to write, roughly 5 pages), and 1 final paper (10 or so pages). One of the least stressful seminars I've taken, yet still one of the most enjoyable."
