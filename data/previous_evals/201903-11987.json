   "comments": [
    "I learned about new topics, such as the mass incarceration-tendencies taking place at the border, federal Indian law, and Critical Race Theory. I gained a lot from the guest speakers that frequented this course, and I appreciated the recognition of student diversity within the class.",
    "An understanding of critical race theory, overview of how race has impacted American law and society historically and in the present, and a vocabulary with which to discuss race relations. I developed insights that allowed me to engage more deeply with my other coursework as well.",
    "I learned the vocabulary to describe race in America, specifically intersectionality and colorblindness vs. race-conscious programs. I learned about different strategies for protecting minorities and the failures of the liberal framework of rights. I also learned a lot about mass incarceration, deportation, reproductive justice, and courts.",
    "I developed a super deep understanding of power structures as they relate to race, gender, and queerness, and am now able to critique our country's government and its legal foundations from an intelligent standpoint. It taught me about how racism and oppression are not individual viewpoints or behaviors, but larger systems of oppression. I also learned to read difficult texts and synthesize their arguments effectively, while also being able to critique their arguments.",
    "Through this course, I developed the ability to synthesize complex ideas together to formulate something new understandings of critical race theory, prison abolition, and alternative futures beyond the criminal justice system as it exists in the present.",
    "I learned about how race has been constructed by US jurisprudence. I learned about theories of criminal justice reform and abolition. I was exposed to ideas about potential tensions between framing advocacy around protecting rights versus building power.",
    "This class has been incredibly paradigm shifting and should be a requirement for all Yale students. Learning about Critical Race Theory, Abolitionism, and Indigenous law, among so many other fascinating and powerful topics has given me a lens to critically evaluate the social terrain upon which we are situated.",
    "I learned to understand and view society in a completely different light. I read and heard presentations from some of the most well known scholars in this field. I was exposed to new art forms, narratives, and concepts that will truly transform the way I interact with the world around me. I am a STEM major and I can truly say that I have never learned more in a class.",
    "Such an amazing course. Getting to learn about Critical Race Theory has given me the tools to understand some of today's greatest challenges",
    "I gained a very deep understanding of how race is embedded into our legal system and influences how minorities operate in our society. This class struck a perfect balance between focusing on theory and how these issues exist in broader social\/cultural contexts. My ability to synthesize different issues in such a way that addresses a larger theme or focus was improved greatly by the synthesis papers we wrote after each unit.",
    "Fantastic course! Was focused less heavily on law, and more heavily on race based politics and movements.",
    "Everything!!!!! This course really helped me finalize what I want to do with my life and helped me understand a more scholarly perspective on injustice in America. I cannot emphasize how open-minded you will be after taking this course, it is revolutionary.",
    "This course took everything I thought I new about Liberal frameworks and turned them upside down. It provides a great, deeper, look into the effect of race in law, contemporary social movements, and other ideas I took for granted before really examining them.",
    "This course gave me the vocabulary to explain things I had felt and experienced my whole life which made me feel super empowered.",
    "I would like to think that I am more aware of myself and others around me.",
    "So much - I don't even know where to begin. This course challenges one to rethink their inherent assumptions about the law and larger institutions in general, and does a great job of making relevant connections to our status as Yale students and current and relevant events. The course is grounded in critical race theory, so you learn a lot about that, and then we engage with a variety of other critical theories and ways of imaging more equitable social and material realties.",
    "Got some interesting info about critical race theory and mass-incarceration.",
    "how to apply critical race theory and bring these concepts to bear on every part of life",
    "This course taught me SO much! I learned more in this course than in all my other classes combined. Taking this class deeply altered and made more complex my understanding of racial history and current reality in the US. I was introduced to so many new ideas and had revelation after revelation. One of the overarching themes that fascinated me was the idea that our legal system can work exactly how its supposed to and because it has inherent inequities, still marginalize many groups. Overall, learned a lot more about the prison system, legal system, and myself.",
    "We learned about critical race theories and frequently applied concepts from CRT to different areas of law enforcement \/ reform, seen with prison reform and abolition movements as well as concepts of indigenous sovereignty, reproductive freedoms, etc. Each class lecture was incredibly interesting, and you walked out feeling like you've learned something new about the way race is socialized.",
    "You gain a lot of insight into the history of race in America and knowledge about how race plays into your daily life. You begin to think about events and interactions you have through a critical race perspective.",
    "I learned a lot about critical race theory and how it interacts with the law. I think this class was very eye opening in understanding how people today are organizing for racial justice",
    "This class was amazing! It talked about many relevant topics that need to be discussed even if they are sensitive. I learned about academic conversations and the vocabulary necessary to engage in them.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The material was highly engaging and deeply nuanced. I loved how HoSang structured his lectures (he always complimented our unit topics with artwork, prose and music that enhanced our understanding of course themes). I specifically loved learning about whiteness as property, prison abolition and intersectionality. Additionally, I love how HoSang gave examples of highly practical applications of the theories we discussed-- he brought in activists, poets, non-profit founders, lawyers, etc. to show how Critical Race Theory may translation into direct action. I think that class also transformed how I will navigate my future course work and Yale career more broadly. Critical Race Theory, as taught by HoSang, urged me to question the teachings of other classes and university rhetoric. I find myself applying the teachings of Race, Politics and the Law in conversations, other classes and just in how I take interpret news\/ politics, etc.",
    "This course did an excellent job in introducing the field of critical race theory, the reasoning which multiple founding authors designed the ideas of racial formation and the legal construction of race, and the material consequences of intersectional harms and hierarchies. We engaged with these readings with concise argumentative synthesis essays, that required a deep understanding of the readings and succinct application of their ideas in a short page length.",
    "I learned so much about institutionalized racism, equity, prison abolition, intersectionality, and so on. It was truly so much useful and insightful information that I cannot write all of it in this box. It's knowledge about racial inequities and the experiences that come with being a POC that I will carry with me for a very long time.",
    "I gained a foundation of understanding in Critical Race Theory. Professor HoSang does an incredibly good job of providing material in a way that is understandable to students with little background in thinking critically about race, but also making it clear that with limited lecture (and section) time we as a class can only really skim the surface of topics that impact people's lives in so many concrete ways that we rarely take a step back to think about. I learned how crucial it is to question the systems that raised us, and I hope I gained some skills in doing so.",
    "I learned about critical race theory, crimmigration, the prison system, alternative notions of freedom and sovereignty, intersectionality, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about how different critical racial theorists think, as well as a great new vocabulary and insights with which to talk about race.",
    "This course covers a wide array of topics, ranging from Critical Race Theory, to prison abolitionism and mass incarceration, to indigenous sovereignty, to queer liberation. It makes you rethink your perspective of society. You write synthesis papers to make sure you actually understand the material in class, as well as a course impact paper to display how you will use this information in the real world.",
    "Through this course, I gained an understanding of Critical Race Theory, as well as how to apply intersectionality in other fields. I also gained an understanding of how to critique liberalism, and more about my own personal beliefs. This course is absolutely necessary for every student at Yale.",
    "Where to I even begin. This course helped me think critically about the underlying racial bias that informs seemingly neutral political opinions. It encouraged me to interrogate my own racial education. It made me want to become involved in activism and learn more about prison abolition. On top of that, this course introduces you to legal writing- we read case law from actual law reviews, which was something Id never done before.",
    "I gained so much from this class. It's a fantastic introduction to critical race theory. It gives you great insights into why even the things we accept as good are bad (aka liberalism... aka liberal policies). It also introduces a class of mostly non-ER&M students to concepts that are initially radical to them, like prison abolition. The synthesis papers also helped me develop as a thinker because you're forced to be somewhat original in engaging with your sources. What I mean is that you have to critically think about how a variety of scholars and their ideas interact with each other. After taking this class, you will overall be a much better critical thinker.",
    "I learned how to put authors in collaboration with one another to synthesize a conclusion. I also learned that we are all complicit and that abolition of prisons isn't a far-fetched idea when you think about how prisons are used for a solution.",
    "Race, Politics, and Law is by far my favorite course I have taken at Yale. As a senior, I am so glad I took this course because it has changed my perspective on the world around me. This course allowed me to think critically about institutions American society is built around.",
    "Critical race theory, synthesis skills",
    "I learned a lot about the political topics at hand and was forced to learn how to write a synthesis paper. It was interesting to delve deeply into social justice issues and to hear from the variety of guest speakers that Prof. HoSang invited to class.",
    "Through this course you gain insight on critical race theory as a theoretical framework that challenges traditional legal liberalist discourse which pervades our society and discussions. We then examined how this theoretical basis could be applied across different realms of society, from mass incarceration to indigenous rights and queer community organizing. This framework and vocabulary is so important in this current climate where it seems that there is a renewed questioning of race and racial politics.",
    "This course offers an (unfortunately) unique in-depth exposure to critical race theory and many contemporary applications of this theory. The course offers expose to an academic discipline that is not found many other places (if any) in such an accessible way at Yale.",
    "My writing and comparative skills improved immensely in deconstructing difficult documents and readings",
    "I can't even begin to describe how this course has fundamentally changed my understanding of the world. I had never even heard of critical race theory before, but the first few weeks are really great in helping to understand its goals and its logic. I can so much better see through some of the veils of neutrality and innocence that are woven into the law to skew it towards those who already have privilege. Furthermore, it has allowed me to reimagine some solutions in ways I could not have really wrapped my head around before.",
    "Good insight into critical race theory; guest lectures were incredible; deep understanding of racial politics and power structures in the US that I had not encountered in law\/political science courses before",
    "This course totally reframed how I look at the world around me and how I view my place at Yale. The course is taught in such a unique and deliberate way that you will learn way more than you even realize until the course is over.",
    "I learned invaluable information about the world we live in today, and how to apply critical race theory to my daily life. I feel like my mind was opened extraordinarily to the realities of race in our world, its constructed nature, and the ways in which reform can often perpetuate racist systems. Overall, this class really made me question the world around me, and developed my ability to synthesize different writers and theorists.",
    "I learned the foundations of critical race theory and the ability to synthesize different readings thematically. I also learned how to understand relationships of subordination on a broader scale than individual instances.",
    "I learned a lot about this country's structures, race-aligned ideologies, and all of that's influence on the U.S. legal structure.",
    "Navigating through dense readings, reading with an open mind, gained a greater understanding of the intersections of race and law.",
    "I learned a great deal about the underpinnings of critical race thought and the entrenchment of racial and ethnic roadblocks embedded in our legal system.",
    "Critical thinking, appreciation for history",
    "I learned how to think in a new, more critical fashion which places race and power at the center of all systems. Truly changes the manner in which you see the world and tackle social issues. Truly taught me the some of the most important skills which I will take with me out into the real world, and it has been the only course at Yale which has done this for me.",
    "Deeper understanding of the way race and racism underpin our laws and social interactions and social structure at large; critical thinking skills to analyze the common liberal discourses about race\/colorblindness\/etc; exposure to prison abolition ideas, the reality of what's happening at the border, ideas of community power and care",
    "Understanding of history of race in America, current social\/political\/legal issues of race, Critical Race Theory",
    "I developed a lot about critical race theory and its application to the law today. I also learned a great deal aboutablition of prisons which is something I didn't know about prior to this class.",
    "Racial formation theories, ending mass incarceration in America, theories of sovereignty and freedom",
    "I learned about critical race theory and how to analyze perceived societal norms in a more complex way.",
    "Thanks to this course I explored a field of research I didn't even know about. The course offers a great introduction to Critical Race Theory and many of its subtopics: migration, queer studies, prison abolition, etc. It makes the student question their beliefs and encourages to become a critical thinker. It also allows the student to interact with various texts and produce new knowledge based on them.",
    "Deeper understand of the extralegal production of racial used violence in America and the ways in which we can imagine change outside of the traditional framework of civil activism",
    "This class is fantastic, it really opened my mind to a lot of new ways of thinking about government, political theory, and the basic ways we interact with each other. I think it also helps you practice writing concisely, because a lot of the assignments require you to cover a lot of ideas in a realtively short space.",
    "Everything I learned will be something I will think about and use for the rest of my life. We read about so many different and important topics that are not usually covered in classes!",
    "The readings for this course were phenomenal. I learnt how to synthesise different source materials and to devise my own conclusions from academic articles. I also learnt how to think through certain issues of social justice, and how to talk about them effectively.",
    "Critical race theory and how it applies to topics like immigration, prison abolition and Native American sovereignty. Related topics such as colorblindness, intersectionality, how racial identities are formed, and precarity.",
    "I learned a lot about synthesizing information for essays. For class topics, we covered the foundations of Critical Race Theory, prison abolition, sovereignty\/liberty, and learned a ton about struggles different races\/minority groups have gone through as well as constants throughout history.",
    "Current and past social issues with a perspective\/ focus on how ethnicity, and race influence or influenced the issues",
    "I learned a lot about how race plays into the political history of America, how certain communities, minority groups and those in poverty are exploited, and paths to envisioning a better future for those involved.",
    "I learned about critical race theory and how to apply theories such as white by law and intersectionalty to different topic such as Indian Law, property cases, and discrimination cases.",
    "This course teaches you the skills and insights to grapple with complex and difficult materials and concepts. You're given the opportunity synthesis readings, concepts learned in class, and guest lectures in the open ended yet specific synthesis papers.",
    "Very interesting course that broadened my ideas about race in America, incarceration, justice and sovereignty. This course will redefine your ideas",
    "I learned how to read law texts and cases critically, as well as how to contextualize them with the world around me. Overall, you learn so much about American history that is often left out of any typical textbook, as well as Yales involvement with this history.",
    "Obtained an understanding of critical race theory and the legal practices which construct race, among other concepts.",
    "I learned SO much in this class. It's a class I think everyone should take at least once.",
    "I learned how to understand the legal system beyond the liberal legal framework that is often regurgitated by liberal politicians. It was refreshing to see issues that I care about verbalized and explained.",
    "I learned so much about the intricacies of critical race theory, contemporary politics, and the role that we play in changing the world for the better.",
    "I developed more nuanced ways of thinking about the various ways in which race affects law and vice versa.",
    "I really felt like I gained a greater understanding of how race factors into almost all of our daily life, whether we realize it or not, and how to combat systemic racism in ways that don't just look good on paper but actually benefit all people.",
    "I learned how to synthesize critical race theory texts in a way that enhanced the richness of all arguments and furthered my understanding of the course themes",
    "This class was my favorite this semester. It taught me how to frame future activism in a way that leads to liberation for all, and recognize the failings of current movements or ways of thinking about change.",
    "THE BEST COURSE I'VE TAKEN AT YALE!!!! I learned so much about the failures of the law, visions of liberty and sovereignty, prison abolition, the crimmigration system, color blindness, and so much more. An amazing course that will have a lifelong impact on me. It has changed the way I view the world. Thank you, Prof. HoSang and Veronica!",
    "A language for which to understand and discuss race and how it has been constructed by the law.",
    "This is an amazing introductory class to critically thinking about the history and relationship between race, politics and the law in our country. From critical race theory to power structures and the meaning of liberalism and freedom, this class is an amazing lecture that forces everyone to think about their life from a new lens.",
    "I acquired a very necessary vocabulary that to talk about race from a wide range of readings and mediums. This vocabulary allowed me to write and talk about race with nuance and develop my own ideas about social issues and the various perspectives contained within them. I learned how to examine prominent social issues through a racial lens, combining insights from important critical race theorists, and I learned how to apply their ideas to answer questions about race and its role in our society.",
    "I learned how to hold a beneficial discussion around the subjects of race, politics, and law.",
    "I learned of new ways to be critical of the legal, political, and social frameworks that we often take for granted as steadfast and objective. I was encouraged to synthesize topics from throughout the course that improved my writing and comprehension skills.",
    "This course helped me develop a highly applicable academic insight into racial politics and ways to mitigate injustice",
    "The course taught me how to critically thinking about social constructions such as race in relation to how and why laws are created and implemented in the ways they have been. Towards the end of the semester, this class shifted gears from teaching the general ways of how other academics have thought about Critical Race Theory to how to imagine steps to make actual change in the world.",
    "I learned so much, this class was excellently taught and it helped me regain confidence in the ER&M Major and what work we could do as parts of greater systems",
    "I learned new ways of evaluating law and history. Gained an insight into the ways that race affect the system we live in.",
    "Through this course, I gained great insight into the manner and processes that facilitate group-identity formation as well as an approach to understanding race less as something that is defined by ethnicity, culture background, etc., but more as a concept that is socially constructed and reinforced by political, economic, and social structures. I also came to understand how these various identities can compound the mistreatment faced by members of the population.",
    "I developed very good skills in writing synthesis papers, something that will be very useful for future classes that I will need for my major. Additionally, this course helped me better my writing in a way that emphasized using seemingly unrelated topics by connecting them to grander themes. I also learned so much about American society and it relates to race in a different and more neo-liberal way, giving me the tools to effectively criticize much of what we see around us. I went into the class thinking I knew so much but walked out understanding that there is so much more to learn.",
    "How to be a better, more well spoken, more thoughtful human being.",
    "basically realizing that things you think are liberal and good are actually not liberal and good enough!!!!",
    "This course provides a helpful introduction to Critical Race Theory (CRT), crimigration, mass incarceration, indigenous legal studies, among other topics. It will fundamentally change the way you think of the law and functioning of society."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor HoSang is very insightful, and most of the readings were rewarding. However, I found this course very lofty and hyper-intellectual--it detracted from how important these issues actually are. The paper instructions were very difficult to understand, and grading seemed arbitrary. Professor HoSang often waited until just a couple of days before the due date to explain what he was looking for in an assignment, and it felt as though he was discouraging students from working anytime other than at the last minute. Furthermore, I felt as though the class was an echo chamber. Professor HoSang would use phrases such as \"We are arguing this point\" or \"That's not how we're looking at this.\" While I generally agreed with Professor HoSang's claims, the class attracts such a broad group of students, and I think it is unfair to us not to challenge our views. Those two course components--the abstractness and the one-sidedness--increasingly frustrated me throughout the semester.",
    "Amazing course, but the balance of which races\/communities we focused on could have been more inclusive. The emphasis on Black women was great, because what other class does that? But I felt like our discussions on indigenous and Asian communities were a bit rushed. Obviously time is limited, but I would have liked to go more in depth in those areas.",
    "All the readings in this course are incredible and some are even life-changing. Some of the readings are long, but Professor HoSang is understanding and made some of them shorter in the second half of the course. His lectures are super engaging and he does a really good job of explaining concepts and introducing new ideas. He also shows how interdisciplinary this course is and brings in legal studies, history, visual and performing arts, and even some philosophy.",
    "It was a privilege to have this course available to me. Lectures were incredibly well-explained and utilized a wide variety of engaging media to make ideas and concepts clear to students. Readings were super interesting, and units were designed effectively to facilitate student learning on these subjects through the lens of many different subjects and ideas. The synthesis papers were also interesting and fun to write, because I enjoyed getting to think about these subjects and found that I was challenged intellectually while also being offered the ability to express my viewpoints. My analytical and writing skills significantly improved through the course of writing those papers. From a political and analytical standpoint, I think this course has indescribable value. It is literally one of the most important classes that needs to be offered at this school. I think that this class would be able to provide a lot more clarity to American politics if, for example, everyone in the country were able to take a course like this. This course has national and international implications in ways that, for example, a Global Affairs class does not. The only weakness I would argue this course has is that Professor HoSang could assign some readings that aren't AS dense as the vast majority of readings assigned in this course. I wish we had a few more NYT articles sprinkled in. As a dyslexic student, I am very used to reading high-level texts in my Political Science classes, but still struggle with the academic-ness of the readings in this course. While those readings are incredibly important and valuable, there needs to be more entry points for people like me who struggle with really dense reading. More than anything, the BIGGEST weakness of this course was not the fault of instructors or curricula, but that of Yale as an institution for not adequately supporting ER&M the way it should. While classes like Constitutional Law have seemingly unlimited room for TFs and sections, this course was capped unnecessarily. Yale needs to understand that these classes are PIVOTAL to a student's education, and cannot be discounted in favor of Con Law or the Jackson Institute or something else. Hire more TFs. Tenure more professors. Put more funding and education into this work. Administrators and faculty reading this evaluation need to hear this message: Give ER&M more institutional support. I encourage the administrators who make decisions about where and how to fund courses\/departments ACTUALLY ATTEND some Race, Politics, and Law lessons and think critically about why they are disinterested in supporting this work. As a student who has taken a good number of Global Affairs courses, I encourage you to attend one RPL lecture and one Global Affairs lecture and compare the quality of education. You will notice that the material that RPL is the more effectively taught course for sure. Please reconsider where you place your institutional funding and resources. Listen to students and faculty of color. Students will not stop being frustrated about this any time soon.",
    "The course was incredible--Professor HoSang was so engaging and it was clear that he wanted the material he was teaching to be both accessible and thought-provoking. I really appreciated that Professor HoSang wanted the class to be open to student contributions, but in a class of this size, it sometimes made things challenging\/broke up the class a little bit as it was sometimes cumbersome.",
    "The subject matter is obviously really important, and I think every student should do some thinking about the construction of race in America. I also appreciated that the course focuses on the practice of critical race theory. For instance, one of the essay assignments was to think about how CRT practitioners would respond to current criminal justice reform proposals.",
    "Strengths: VERY well taught, sections are phenomenal, course material is fascinating and well-curated Weaknesses: Readings were way too long (I struggled to keep up and, later in the semester, found out that while I had been flailing to read everything, all the upper classmen in my section had apparently only skimmed). The readings should be shortened so we can delve in and engage deeper. Guest speakers on Skype and phone-calls were impossible to hear and I didn't get much out of them besides being star struck.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is most certainly Professor HoSang. His organization and dedication to this class are incredible. Also, my TF was incredible and I have heard similar reviews of the other TFs in the class. The class was split up into three units. The first two units were very cohesive and well organized. However, I felt as though the last unit was a bit jumbled. It didn't feel like the concepts flowed as easily and I felt like we skimmed over the topics in this section and we could have gone a lot more in depth with fewer topics.",
    "This course is amaze-balls",
    "Professor HoSang is the best lecturer I've had at Yale by far. Every class is incredibly engaging and he does a wonderful job of putting information together in such a way that the overall theme and message is understood very clearly. There is a lot of reading, but it's all very interesting and worth your time. Besides, the lectures are so clear and focused that you can get a lot out of this course just by doing as much of the reading as you need to understand what is going to be addressed in lecture.",
    "No weaknesses. Strengths -- lectures, TAs, papers, assignments in general",
    "There were three 3-5 page synthesis papers, one 500 word final, and one 2-4 page outside class event paper. The readings were quite long and the paper prompts were pretty tough to grasp, but honestly, there is a lot of support and TAs and HoSang all want to help. The strengths by far outweigh the weaknesses. HoSang is an awesome professor and makes class so enjoyable to go to. We have guest speakers that have done such incredible things and have revolutionized the field as well. It is so amazing.",
    "This course is honestly amazing. It has great readings, had a ton of guest lecturers to bolster other lectures, and had worthwhile assignments. The third unit got a little confusing but overall, the material was great and the lectures were very well created.",
    "The reading was a lot to keep up with and the papers asked us to do a lot with what I felt like was little support. However, I loved the material of the class and the lectures.",
    "I think this course is now a little too large for deep learning but might function well as a somewhat introductory course",
    "The course is very strong in that it creates tangible connections between the course material and current events in the real world - Professor HoSang and the TAs do a fantastic job of really raising the stakes for us and encouraging engagement outside the classroom. I think the course accomplishes such engagement in spite of its gigantic size - despite everyone's best efforts, it can sometimes be very easy to just kind of tune out during lecture. I also didn't really feel that I gained a lot by writing the synthesis papers - they felt less like opportunities to explore the ideas on a deeper level and more just like ways of proving that we did the readings by writing within specific and at times restrictive confines. I would've really enjoyed the opportunity to engage with the readings on a deeper level through a longer paper, though I do acknowledge that it would be hard for Professor HoSang and the graders to read 300+ long papers.",
    "I think this course was really strong in making you question your assumptions about how race functions in society. However, I do feel like many of the ideas we were exposed to in class were often not particularly novel, especially given the fact that this is the kind of stuff that comes in regular conversations at Yale all the time. I got a somewhat more in-depth knowledge of ideas like critical race theory and intersectionality but I'm not sure if I know significantly more now than I knew before just from second-hand exposure to these ideas. I also feel like the class became less focused once we moved past mass incarceration. I think the readings were really strong for this course though.",
    "NEEDS TO NOT SEPARATE THEORY FROM PRACTICE. the course arbitrarily divided seminal texts of critical race theory from the community efforts toward liberation",
    "Strengths: Too many to list. The lectures were always engaging and took the course readings (which were so thoughtfully chosen and paired) to a deeper level. Professor HoSang is a phenomenal lecturer and great person who gives his all to the class. The discussion section was one of the highlights of my week allowing a small and diverse group of students to engage on a more personal and interactive way with the material. Overall, great organization, topics, and professor.",
    "STRENGTHS: Lectures were amazing, HoSang is a very engaging speaker and it made each class very incredible. Also his office hours were incredibly helpful, just in clarifying the material and getting help with the essay assignments, he took the time to answer everyone's questions and look over drafts which was amazing and extremely helpful. I also loved the guest lectures component and the ability to learn from the people you're reading and ask questions! I thought the TFs were also incredible and it was great to hear them share about their work and how it intercedes with what we're learning. WEAKNESSES: Honestly, I can't think of much. The assignments are very short papers, and while they were a little confusing at first, going to office hours really helped with that.",
    "The grading format makes finals less stressful, and the discussion sections were a great addition to the class.",
    "The strengths are some of the readings and section. I really learned the most through the readings and the assignments. The lectures, while very engaging, could have easily been skipped. There were also a lot of irrelevant readings, and the third unit felt very loosely connected in comparison to the first two units.",
    "The course is very varied and attractive. It incorporates videos, music, poetry, films, and it engages the students with the material. Towards the end, it gets a little disorganized and it gets harder to focus on what the main objective is or how the material we are learning relates to it. Also, it has a lot of readings, too many! It could be simplified by decreasing the reading load and making it more relevant and accessible to the class.",
    "Strengths: great reading selections, HoSang's lecture style, guest lecturers, TAs (both in section and when they presented their own research) Weaknesses: guidelines were a bit confusing for the synthetic papers (and the grading was harsher than expected), some of the weeks were rather reading heavy",
    "The largest strength of this course was the supportive role the Teaching Fellows played in constantly applying our knowledge in many case studies and examples. I appreciated the wide survey of theories and positive case studies near the end of the course on how to lead community organizations that live out the values of empowerment, democratic choice, and self-determined, inclusive action for a better future. If anything in this course could change, I would suggest including potentially more examples of transnational or global case studies that engage with imperialism and warmongering that attempt to uphold racial hierarchies and resource control. Because this was a law case, a lot of the case studies were internal to the United States, but it would also be great to think about the U.S.'s power and influence abroad. Additionally, a minor comment would be a very large amount of the case studies in this class come from California. While this is not bad, I think that the examples could be diversified slightly, or the focus on California should be explicitly written in the course description\/beginning of syllabus.",
    "Strengths: Hosang was amazing. The information was valuable and very well taught in lecture and in sections Weakness: Too much reading!! The readings are a bit too long to keep up with",
    "Strengths: connections to art, comedy, and pop culture make the course material (which already feels very pressing) even more relevant to students' lives and demonstrates an alternate mode of questioning society. The readings are generally just the right amount -- they force you to spend a lot of time thinking about the heavy topics they touch on, but there's never too much to the point where you have to skim. Lectures are incredibly engaging (with succinct quotes and illuminating visuals) and the many guest speakers were seamlessly integrated into the course in ways that added to our understanding almost every other week. Hard to imagine another Yale course where we'd Skype Kimberl Crenshaw and speak on the phone with a man on death row. I'm not sure I've ever had a class at Yale better organized to help the students learn. Weaknesses: most of us students should have figured out how to participate more.",
    "The arc of the course is generally very good. We add layers and perspectives in an interdisciplinary way, and almost every lecture \/ reading was very compelling. I loved the first two units, especially learning about Critical Race Theory; it set up a great framework and a way into understanding (not just the content, but also the non-neutral approach). The problem with the class was mostly in the third unit. From a young age, we are brought up in an 'objective' history and contextualization of the united states that we internalize very thoroughly. I know it would be slow work, but I think the best kind of work would be being presented with information that allows us to break down that 'objective' perspective on our own (through realizing that it continues to run contrary to the truth). The first two units DID that: we saw the history of mass incarceration, the ways in which the constitution is not neutral, how liberals contribute to systems of race and racism, how race is not in any way inherent. These readings all allow us to chip away at the objectivity of early education. However, the third unit seemed to stack all of these things together, along with a few new and very difficult ideas as well, and then ask us to apply it, with very little guidance. I wish we had continued to lay the foundation.",
    "The content, care with which it is taught, lecture style, guest lectures, readings, section, etc. are all perfect. One thing I would change would be having more opportunities to do independent work with the readings\/content other than the last papers.",
    "The readings were good, sections were not. I think sections would have been much better if they had not been student led.",
    "This course has too many strengths to name. The TFs are wonderful, the guest speakers are fascinating, and the class discussions and productive. However, the synthesis papers could be a bit more pointed, and more information should be given on what is expected from them.",
    "Strengths- Professor's lecture style, TF teaching styles, reading materials (relevant, insightful), interactions of students, \"synthesis\" papers Weaknesses- N\/a. Perhaps that there are not more courses like this at Yale.",
    "My only negative comment is that sometimes it was unclear exactly what was being asked of us in the papers. But this course consistently blew my mind every Tuesday and Thursday, so it didnt really matter. The strengths: HoSang and the TFs complete commitment to the material, their refusal to oversimplify anything, the incredible diverse set of readings we engaged with, the guest speakers and extensive outside engagement involved in the course, the hopeful empowering feeling that the course managed to maintain despite dealing with extremely dark material.",
    "Biggest strength of this class was Daniel HoSang. Not only is he unbelievably kind and welcoming, he is one of the best lecturers at Yale. The syllabus that he compiled was cohesive and endlessly fascinating. HoSang also had TFs give guest lectures on what they're researching, which is unprecedented - another example of how his commitment to the ideas that he teaches shines through everything he does for and in the class. Everything. If you've ever read Pedagogy of the Oppressed... I think Freire was talking about HoSang's classroom. I mean, this class is unbelievable and so important at Yale. For a lot of people in the class, it's their first ER&M class - and sometimes their first time thinking about these issues. (What I sort of mean by the previous statement is that there are a lot of white kids in the class lol.) HoSang makes the material accessible for people who have never thought critically about race and liberalism. I can't think of a single weakness.",
    "Strengths: combination of media, guest lecturers, TA lectures and the accessibility in which Hosang provided us Weaknesses: I would have liked more solutions and what we as Yale students could do in improving certain topics",
    "I enjoyed all of the readings of the course. The Teaching Fellows were all so brilliant and I am glad Professor HoSang gave them an opportunity to introduce themselves and their interests.",
    "I wish there were more than one prompt for the essays because they were very specific and kind of boxed me in as a writer.",
    "I thought that lecture was usually pretty engaging, although there were some that got monotonous because Prof. HoSang tends to summarize the week's readings and repeat certain points of the course over and over. I thought that the quality of the TFs ranged widely. Some were very dedicated and graded seriously. Others (allegedly the law students) did not and also allegedly gave out a lot of A's. I didn't particularly like having to write synthesis papers, although I can see the academic and pedagogical benefits of them. I think the prompts for the synthesis papers were what ultimately made them frustrating and difficult to write. They are broad, highly demanding (what are possible visions of liberty and freedom?), and vague. The TFs seemed to struggle with advising (and grading them) as well.",
    "The curriculum, flow, order, assignments, everything was curated so thoughtfully. Each lecture was really focused on tying concepts together, rather than just summarizing the readings. Rather, main ideas were supplemented with examples and tied together with previously discussed concepts. The synthesis papers, although hard in the moment, were really a great way to get us to engage critically with the material outside of what a normal reading response could have done or traditional research paper.",
    "This class was almost perfect, truly an amazing experience. My only suggestions are minor: for the TF lectures to be better integrated into the course material - they were very cool but felt like there could have been 2 more minutes spent framing them within the course. Also, the first paper was severely overexplained -- just explain it clearly once and let the TFs deal with talking about it after then.",
    "A LOT of reading and sometimes prompts were pretty broad. Readings felt a little frontloaded. All were super interesting. Guest lectures were amazing.",
    "The focus of each synthesis paper felt very narrow (especially paper #2). It was difficult to see how you could write a paper that was very different from another student. Nevertheless, there was a lot of feedback and office hours that really helped with the process. There was also way too much reading for this class. I was often reading a book and one or two articles a week, along with all my other coursework. Especially, when reading dense law reviews, I was forced to skim over really important concepts and issues. I would want to see a greater focus on particular excerpts from the readings as opposed to 80 page documents in which you have to find the important parts yourself. Also, just for a course like this in general, I was disheartened to see how, especially for the first half of the course, much that we read about was framed in terms of a black-white binary. While there are many connections which were better drawn out later in the semester, as an Asian American, it was more difficult to connect with the class when we were speaking about issues that most specifically pertain to the black\/latinx communities. When we finally did bring in other intersectional identities, they seemed a bit rushed, as we would only spend a day on each new topic. I am being very harsh, but I want to acknowledge that this class is doing better than any other course at Yale to really understand how race affects every individual's perception of the world and reimagine race relations.",
    "Strengths: guest lecturers, 100%. Professors Murakawa, Blackhawk, Gohara, and others were amazing. Prof HoSang encourages students to go to events outside of class that were fascinating and showed how course issues were being addressed outside of the academic world; Prof HoSang is a wonderful lecturer as well. Weaknesses: not many, essay prompts were sometimes very vague and the essays themselves were relatively short. But overall amazing course (can't list all strengths here).",
    "Professor HoSang is an incredible lecturer, the TFs are so dedicated to the work we do and the guest lecturers are amazing.",
    "Strengths: I loved the inclusion of art, poetry, and film into the course through the lectures. I thought all the readings we read were incredibly interesting and thought-provoking, and it was a pleasure to be in lecture. Weaknesses: The reading at times was EXTREMELY heavy in a way that made it impossible to do it all (even though Professor HoSang would consistently emphasize how much he understand how little time we had). Likewise, I thought the papers often overly ambitious for the content we were given, and it would have been useful to have an example synthetic paper to go off of.",
    "Strengths: this course was well standardized across sections and lectures were enjoyable to sit through. Guest lectures were amazing! I particularly loved the second unit on prison reform and abolition. Weaknesses: it would be better if less time was spent reviewing the assignments in lectures. Unit 3 was also a little hard to follow--I enjoyed each reading\/lecture on its own, but wasn't sure how they connected.",
    "Great class, a lot of readings, but very very enlightening.",
    "Sections were a great space to hear peers' reaction to readings and class material. The TAs, guest lecturers and multimedia presentations really helped improve my understanding of the course. Although I learned SO much from this course, I sometimes found some readings hard to comprehend\/follow.",
    "The lectures were phenomenal: engaging, and always clarifying. I would have loved for section to have been used more as a clarification session for the readings, since I think a lot of what we ended up doing in section was only tangentially related to our readings.",
    "this is a good class",
    "Professor HoSang is an amazing lecturer and the TF's were also so amazing and attentive to class subjects.",
    "RPL is amazing and I feel so lucky to have gotten into the class. Overall it was really well run - lectures were engaging, fascinating, and clear; readings were interesting and germane (although at times a bit dense and long); the TAs were great; the guest speakers were awesome (although sometimes it felt like there were maybe too many of them to engage with each as much as I would've liked).",
    "Course was very well organized and clearly structured, with relevant readings and guest speakers. Only slightly weird thing was the format of assignments which are based on synthesis rather than argument. It was kind of an adjustment, but I suppose it was applicable to the course.",
    "Strengths were the lectures they were always very engaging and some of the guest speakers were really cool! The weakness would the amount of readings they were incredibly long and sometimes they'd be very repetitive. Also some of the synthetic paper prompt were very difficult given the page limit and they may need to be revised for the future.",
    "Some very dense and lengthy readings. However, many are extremely engaging and valuable.",
    "Strengths: Professor HoSangs lectures, the topics, the guest lecturers, and the reading materials Weaknesses: The reading materials were a bit long sometimes but other than that, I cant think of any other weaknesses at the moment",
    "The course covers many topics that I find very relevant in today's world.",
    "Lectures and guest speakers were engaging and filled with exciting content. Easy to engage. Teaching assistants with great passion and dedication. Weakness included reading material a lot of repeated learning with very large reading requirements weekly.",
    "For the most part the class is incredible. It's well designed and fantastically executed. There were a few points, particularly in the last unit, where it sometimes felt like we were bouncing around a bit, and it might have helped if there were a more clearly expressed theme, but in general it was great!",
    "Strengths: the number of guest speakers, we would read books\/articles and be able to engage with the author themselves, the lectures were engaging, the readings and topics were really important and would make me critically think, the content of the class Weakness: sometimes the essay prompts were vague and not well explained, the readings were dense\/high-level\/long",
    "Take this class. The grading for papers is unclear and the topics are far too ambitious, but the course content makes up for it.",
    "The course has only strengths! It was great.",
    "The class is super engaging! Despite the size of the lecture Prof. HoSang makes the class highly engaging, and there was never a single boring day in lecture. There are also a lot of guest lectures\/guest appearances--from other academics, activists, journalists, artists, or the TFs, and it was great to be able to get lots of different perspectives from many different people on these pretty weighty issues.",
    "Guest lectures were incredible, and the content was engaging, even in a large lecture. The essay prompts get a bit over explained to the point of confusion, just follow what the TA says and you should be fine.",
    "The course could be more clear about the prompts for the papers or make the prompts less stringent so that the point of the paper isnt as narrow and difficult to discern.",
    "The course is absolutely one of the best courses at Yale College and affects how I will live my life following the course. The speakers, books, and assignments stretched us, but were so interesting. We need more classes like this at Yale College.",
    "This is an absolutely outstanding course. The thoughtfulness that went into its conception and articulation is outstanding. The materials were presented in a carefully thought out and in depth way. Additionally, such a wide range of topics were covered and all in an in-depth way. We we able to hear from so many guest speakers who's writings and concepts we were in the process of studying. This course teaches fundamental histories, legislation, and concepts pertaining to race and beyond. Every student at Yale should take this class.",
    "+ Very interesting concepts + Lecturer is fantastic and passionate - Section discussion can be pretty biased where only a certain type of opinion is accepted",
    "Strengths: there is a lot of room to grow and improve as well as work on your writing. Weaknesses: the reading is a good amount, but you quickly figure out how to read for whats most important.",
    "Professor HoSang is amazing and keeps lectures very interesting. There are many guest lectures, most of whom are authors of the books we read. The papers are set up well to challenge you intellectually but arent overwhelming by any means and are so manageable.",
    "HoSang is an AMAZING teacher and thinker, and the course material was really engaging. At times, it felt like we were rushing through lectures and it might be worth it to slow down a bit on the readings so we can actually absorb the material and draw conclusions for ourselves. The grading system was also unnecessarily harsh, as the prompts often didnt make sense, and didnt really lend itself to the course structure.",
    "No weaknesses; excellent course",
    "The writing prompts were a little confusing sometimes",
    "The strength of the course is in HoSangs phenomenal lecturing and in the sheer mental power of the teaching fellows. Everyone is incredibly passionate about what they do. A weakness is probably in how sometimes the unit topics contained very distinct ideas and were hard to synthesize. I took the course as a first year so I personally felt more guidance on how to write a synthesis essay would have been helpful.",
    "Strengths: pretty much everything about it. It was engaging, applicable to real life, and allowed for great demonstration of knowledge through synthesis papers. Weaknesses: sometimes the readings were very heavy and hard to finish in the time expected.",
    "The main weakness of the course to me is that it could not accommodate all of the students who wanted to take it. In the future I think it is important that the amount of space in the course (and therefore in the room) is as large as possible as Im sure the professor wanted",
    "The course is structure very well and the professor and TFs are amazing. I thought we could have spent more time on Unit 3.",
    "I felt unchallenged by the assignments.",
    "I only wish this class was taught for a longer period! The sections were very engaging and really helped solidify some of the more complex ideas brought up in lecture. The readings, although a bit long, were very insightful too.",
    "Strengths: EVERYTHING!! but especially the guest speakers Weaknesses: nothing :)",
    "The biggest strength of this class is that it is a collective learning experience. My favorite class as a undergraduate so far. Professor HoSang is absolutely fabulous, extremely smart, dedicated to the class, and very encouraging of student participation. The readings are really interesting and the guest speakers add a tremendous amount to the class. I have no complaints- only that I wish I could take another class like this next semester.",
    "This is a fabulous course with amazing discussion and lectures. If I had to change something, I would have fewer longer papers instead of many short papers. Its often hard to write about these topics in such short space.",
    "The use of different forms of media, from art to poetry to music, to describe various angles and perspectives all pertaining to race and social issues was a definite strength of the class. Professor Hosang's lectures were always engaging and fresh, and the speakers that were brought in throughout the semester really took the class into the real world in an inspiring and insightful way; there was always a real-world takeaway from each session. I felt like a weakness was not in the class, rather in the course assignments. The primary assignments were three synthesis papers in response to a certain prompt. While it was an innovative way to have students put different critical race theorists in conversation with eachother in a single assignment, I feel like maybe a group project or a more open-ended essay prompt in conjunction with one or two synthesis papers could lead to some more interesting insights in our work in the class. Other than that, the class was really great - the content is super important, and I hope Yale offers more classes like this one.",
    "We were able to see several different opinions and synthesize them to create our own ideas.",
    "Strengths: Professor HoSang is so careful with his curation of the class, the obvious attention to detail makes everything so much more enjoyable. He also invites guests of the class that break up the monotony that is inevitable with lectures. Genuinely a fantastic class! Weaknesses: Lectures are somehow TOO fun?? You will definitely need to take notes, though you might not be tempted to by its structure. Readings can pile up on you also, you need to do them to do well on the papers.",
    "I loved the guest talks that occurred quite frequently. The speakers really helped the sometimes theoretical material seem more tangible. The course is a lot of reading but mostly doable (however some of the 60-80 page law reviews were a bit much)",
    "I preface with this course is amazing! The discussions and lectures are fantastic. Professor HoSang and our TAs in conjunction with our readings provide thought-provoking engagements with topics of abolition, intersectionality, organizing, rights, justice, and freedom. Additionally, the course is packed with iconic and awesome guest speakers who are prominent scholars in these fields. However, my biggest disappointment is a focus on the black\/white binary and the rights-based frameworks for the first eight weeks of the semester. For only four weeks, Professor HoSang assigned readings on other POC and minority communities about their relationships to the criminal justice system and their thought processes surrounding liberty, freedom, and sovereignty. There wasn't enough time to engage and to understand the stakes of any of these communities - especially if only one or two lectures is spent on each one. You end up being excited to see your community finally represented in the class. However, I didn't want to experience the burden to speak for my entire community in our discussions. I hope future iterations will try to include the politics of different communities throughout the course instead of relying on students' positionality to represent them when they are erased. But, as upsetting it can be, I understand the difficulties of representing a multitude of people and studies in a survey lecture course.",
    "All of the readings in this course are well chosen because they are super informative and actually fascinating to read, but there were many assignments for this class, which could have been consolidated into assignments that gave us options for papers or at least an opportunity to choose a prompt to write about. Even though it is a lecture, the class is very interactive and engaging. I believe this course would be better if the syllabus was reorganized into having the concepts from the second half of the semester intertwined with the theory introduced at the beginning. This would make it seem more cohesive and not as isolated in terms of the topics discussed.",
    "DANIEL HOSANG & VERONICA GUERRA AMAZING It was really well taught and Hosang incorporated a variety of sources (music, videos, law reviews, live interviews, phone interviews) for us to really be engaged with the content and take something from it. Discussion sections were also a good addition to this course and helped supplement what we did in it.",
    "It was an amazing course. I felt truly engaged with the material and the lectures were great. I loved that there were also guest lectures which complemented the material we were covering. My only complaint would be the format of the essays. The prompts were often difficult to understand and felt as if they were heavily slanted in favor of particular arguments",
    "This course does well to engage students in theories of race and class and illustrates what factors facilitate the formation of different racial groups as well as introduce students to writers and theorists that add relevant and important insight into the history of race in the United States as well as how it has been reinforced through various structures. A weakness of the course is definitely it's lack of trigger warnings in media. Many difficult and emotional topics are discussed in class that engage various marginalized students on an existential level, which can be extremely intense and bring up trauma. I am not saying that these topics should not be discussed since these students deal with them on a daily basis and it is important that they are directly engaged, but it is essential that at the very least warning are put up for the benefit of these students who have already dealt with these issues so that they have the chance at least to prepare themselves. Of course students that are not marginalized will likely not feel any sort of personal emotional turmoil, but students with marginalized identities already go through so much that it is insensitive to not take that into account when displaying certain media.",
    "This course was really good at relating very different topics together and being very inclusive of different marginalized groups. On the other hand the readings were really long and sometimes nearly impossible to get through. If they were shorter I think I would get more out of them because there is less pressure.",
    "strengths: great course material. prof is also very engaging and knows his stuff. weakness: should not be a lecture. only downside to this class. having TFs that vary drastically in grading (i.e. some graded much more harshly than others) was not the most conducive to knowing how better to improve throughout the class. sometimes, it felt like the professor would say one thing and the TFs would say another. for the topics that are taught in this course, i'm not sure how efficient the structure of a lecture was.",
    "Grading for essays was kind of vague, making it difficult to know concretely how to improve. Having students lead discussion sections was an effective way to encourage discussion, such that I felt more comfortable talking (as something with anxiety that usually has trouble talking in class). However, I'm not sure I learned any new actual information during sections. My TF had students lead the whole thing, so it was just students sharing their opinions. (Not that this isn't valuable in its own right). I would like to have TFs lead part of it and introduce new material or analysis techniques.",
    "strengths: prof Hosang is EXTREMELY organized, engaging, helpful. lecture material is very interesting and at times very surprising. sections were helpful and necessary"

   "comments": [
    "If you have never had much exposure to topics of racial discrimination, then this class will provide a great overview. Even if you've studied certain topics in a racial context (for me, for example, that topic was mass incarceration), this class will broaden your knowledge. However, if you are looking for a class with a practical teaching style, this class is not for you. Similarly, do not take this class if you would like to formulate your own opinions and have meaningful dialogue between people with different opinions.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this course Great for people who are well versed in ER&M\/discussions about race as well as people who have never considered these issues before. Professor Hosang is the best lecturer I've had.",
    "Yes! This course is so so important. Especially if you care about social justice and grass-roots movements. Even if that's not your interest, the knowledge you will learn from this course is so crucial to anyone living in America. Everyone at Yale should take this class!",
    "YES! One of the best courses I've ever taken. No matter how you identify (politically or otherwise), take this course and question your beliefs and challenge yourself intellectually, while improving your critical analysis skills.",
    "I think that everyone at Yale should have to take this course. Professor HoSang is an amazing professor, and caused me to think about critical race theory. and prison abolition in brand new ways. This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and I can't recommend it enough.",
    "Yes. I think all students should take a class like this that surveys the construction of race and examines current policy topics like criminal justice reform and reproductive justice. I think it also challenges liberal students to examine how even policies that we hold up as progressive can feed into racial hierarchy.",
    "YES - it should be required for all students. SO important, well-taught, eye-opening, indignation-stirring, empowering, moving. TAKE IT!",
    "FOR SURE!! Such an amazing course for absolutely any major.",
    "Yes, this is such a unique topic taught by such a smart professor",
    "This is a phenomenal course and I would recommend it to any Yale student.",
    "Workload is frontloaded and super relaxed final assignment. Its good.",
    "YES TAKE THIS COURSE! It will change your outlook on the way our society is constructed and force you to think about race in all kinds of new ways. This is a course that everyone at Yale MUST take because it is so life-changing.",
    "Yes, absolutely. If you are at all interested in furthering your knowledge of Critical Race Theory, race in relation to politics, and race in relation to law, then TAKE! THIS! COURSE!",
    "YES YES YES YES!! It is my favorite class ever at Yale and I don't think anything can beat this.",
    "I would recommend this course 10\/10. Material is great, professor is great, sections were great.",
    "Yes! It is very important to anyone in any field because it's teachings are so universal to life in America.",
    "Yes, if you are okay with an insane amount of reading.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes, this covered a lot of ground in terms of topics though I wonder if a true introductory class might be better if you're looking for a broad overview and if a more specific class might be better if you're interested in particular topics. The guest speakers were really wonderful and it was incredible to hear from so many people deeply engaged in and knowledgeable about their work.",
    "Yes, yes, yes. Regardless of your major, please take this course - it is such an amazing course and introduces you to so many important ideas that really don't get the recognition they deserve. This course will give you the tools to think about and critically engage with a significant number of social, racial, and political issues, and honestly, be a better citizen and voter.",
    "If you feel like you're confused by the terms critical race theory, intersectionality or mass incarceration then yes. If you already feel like you basically know what each of these means, then probably not.",
    "yes",
    "Absolutely! Race, Politics, and the Law is without a doubt the best class I've ever taken. If Yale were to make any course mandatory it should be this one. The lectures and readings are paired very well and allow for holistic understanding of some of the most important topics of today allowing us to investigate the effects prison, legal, and other systems have on racial realities in the US. The teaching fellows all cared deeply about their students and the class and had interesting backgrounds and knowledge on the topics. I learned so much from class, Professor HoSang, section, readings, my TF, and most importantly the amazing students who choose to take this class.",
    "YES! This is a great class and you won't regret it!",
    "Yes, without reservation. This will go down as one of the best and most meaningful classes I have taken at Yale. Professor HoSang has a gift for distilling down dense readings and complicated race issues into engaging lectures that flyby. Do take this class if you can.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students. Its an eye opening course that will change the way many privileged Yalies will think about the world.",
    "yes its the best ERM class to start with; DHS makes it as accessible as possible and he doesnt like final papers so the final is literally a reflection paper",
    "Yes, it criticizes Yale for many of their actions and it is amusing to watch.",

    "Of course! Though Race, Politics & the Law sometimes felt like a seminar miscast as an enormous lecture, you should take this course before you graduate. HoSang is a hero, and his class is equal parts enlightening and motivating.",
    "Wholeheartedly. I've recommended this class to several friends already.",
    "Yes, this is a strong course on how political action and law cases influence the formation of the ideas surrounding racial categories in the United States. I might suggest taking 1 or 2 introductory classes in ethnic studies or area studies to prepare yourself for the work in this class.",
    "Yes!",
    "Definitely. I cannot stress enough how important this class and others like this are. It teaches you so much about how to articulate the experiences of race in the United states and how that molds our legal system. It has taught me so much about how to express and even understand my experience as a person of color and what people are doing about these issues. THIS CLASS IS AMAZING!!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student (and my friends know I already had a hard time not shutting up about it and that I have already recommended it to many of them). Racism is structural and permeates countless fields of academia and institutions, especially ones like Yale. However, I don't think I fully understood what that statement meant until I took this course. A must-take.",
    "Absolutely. This was the best class that I have taken at Yale. It was interesting, engaging, and informative about some of the most meaningful issues in contemporary American politics. It has improved my abilities as a student and equipped me with the tools needed to fight for meaningful change. The one suggestion I would have for improvement is the paper prompts and instructions. They were vague at points, and while Professor HoSang explained them well in office hours, it was possible to misinterpret them.",
    "Yes, if you are willing to do a lot of difficult reading!!! The reading is so necessary to thoroughly understanding the theory.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to every Yale student. Professor HoSang is an incredible lecturer and instructor, he does justice to the topic, and he brings in insane scholars (like Kimberle Crenshaw!!!!). This course is so needed for our community, and wack Yalies need to enroll themselves ASAP so they can learn to be less terrible. Wack and dope Yalies alike will all be benefited by the nuance, thoughtfulness, and perfection of HoSang and the RPL teaching team.",
    "No, not really. Aside from the first unit, I thought it was kind of redundant.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. In fact, I wish all students were required to take this course. It really makes you reevaluate your place in society, and is so important to any individual's intellectual growth, regardless of prior exposure to this field.",
    "I would 1000000% recommend this course. This course has shifted the way that I conceptualize issues in America, and showed me historical context for so many of the policies that I believe in. If you're interested in critical race theory, intersectionality, or simply engaging with the world in a thoughtful manner, please take this course.",
    "Absolutely. This is one of THOSE courses. Not to be missed during your time at Yale.",
    "Yes a million times yes. This class is life-changing. HoSang is the best professor I've ever had at Yale. If you've never taken an ER&M class before, this is what you should take - the material will be accessible to you, the TFs (who are all INCREDIBLE) and HoSang will make it accessible for you. I cannot recommend this class enough.",
    "Yes! Absolutely. I believe this course is essential to a liberal arts education.",
    "pLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE!!!!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to all undergraduates at Yale. Everyone can walk away with something after taking this course.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot about how to reevaluate my ideas surrounding race and law.",
    "I would, because I found the course material very important and engaging. I would warn that the class can feel a bit prescriptive and one should be pretty well-educated on social justice issues coming into it. The readings and papers are challenging, but it is rewarding if you put the time to it (and if you are interested in the topics at hand).",
    "This was one of the best courses I have ever taken. There has never been a course that motivated me to question my own beliefs to the extent that this course did. It is the definition of intellectually rigorous. For someone with no previous experience in the field, I think that this course would have been extraordinarily difficult. If ever there has been a lecture that is not introductory, this is it. I think the class would benefit from a shared vocabulary and framework for the topics discussed, perhaps through a more comprehensive introductory unit. Justin in particular made this course the wonderful experience that it was. He embodies what it means to be a compassionate educator. He exudes thoughtfulness, sincerity, and dedication. Justin also deserves huge credit for going above and beyond to support the students in his section. This semester, he agreed to be a guest speaker for the rural student club, where he shared his own background and how it influences his teaching and current experience as a student. He also took the time to attend an event put on by a student about first-gen\/low-income activism on campus. I sincerely cannot think of a graduate student who has exhibited such a clear commitment and passion for teaching and supporting students of all backgrounds. He is a role model in the truest sense of the term.",
    "Every student at Yale should take this course. This should be what people consider to be a quintessential Yale course as it is so critical to understanding justice and injustice in America. Students from all disciplines and backgrounds would benefit.",
    "The absolute best. Every student should take it. Probably single handedly changed the way I understand the world more than any other class I've taken. As a senior who has taken lots of classes that talk about these concepts, it was *still* a powerful experience to take the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. In fact, this is a course that every student, regardless of their area of study, should take during their time at Yale. Race, Politics, and the Law will open your eyes to different ways of looking at the world, from your experience at Yale to large structural elements of our society, that you likely won't be exposed to in other Yale courses.",
    "YES TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Absolutely. Whether or not you're thinking about law school, it's an amazing class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to everyone. Professor HoSang is a wonderful lecturer and the topic is one of the most pertinent things you can be learning, now or ever.",
    "Yes! This class is amazing! Do yourself a favor and take it. You get the chance to study really important and relevant material through an academic lens. Professor HoSang is a wonderful lecturer and clearly cares deeply about teaching. He also brings in a truly amazing group of guest lecturers who are at the forefront of their fields. It has given me the foundation to understand and discuss racial formation and relationships through specific topics like prison reform. I felt like I learned something meaningful and applicable to the world in each class. Some of the reading can be dense, but the TFs and Prof. HoSang are there to help unpack it. I know some people were hoping to have a less theoretical curriculum, so do know that the class is focused around academia. That being said, I felt like there was an equal emphasis on practices and how to engage with the concepts in a very real way. I looked forward to this class and even doing the readings for it because I knew I would learn and grow from it. This class won't answer all the questions you have about race, but it definitely is an amazing place to start. Please take this class--you won't regret it.",
    "Yes! All Yale students should take this class, I think it is very essential to understanding the ingrained ineuality present in this country. Professor Hosang is wonderful and the course material is dynamic and versatile.",
    "Yes!! I had never been able to explore such important concepts (like colorblindness, whiteness as property, etc) in an academic context. I sincerely think everyone at Yale should take this course.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone looking to understand the roles race and ethnicity have played in the unjust elements of our legal and political systems.",
    "Yes. I think the course is very eye-opening and everyone should take it. Professor HoSang is a great and engaging instructor who is very understanding of students other commitments whilst making sure everyone is engaged in the course.",
    "yes, it is a good class",
    "Yes 100%! Every student at Yale should take this course. The things you learn in this class are so essential to be able to live in our current political and social state. Best class I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Yes!! RPL is a great intro to ER&M ideas for students who haven't been exposed much to critiques of liberalism before, and it really opens up your thinking about race in the U.S. in a way that is actually quite radical. But it also doesn't assume prior knowledge or put pressure on students to prove their wokeness.",
    "Yes - super important subject matter that everyone should be familiar with.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Absolutely. I would recommend this course to every single Yale student, no matter what thy are majoring in. The workload isnt excessive and the material is so applicable to every day life. It would give everyone a better understanding of certain issues that are biased in the news.",
    "Absolutely, this is really one of those cant miss Yale classesI only wish there were more classes like it. This is a super substantive lecture. You probably wont read most of this stuff in any other class here, which is sad because anyone studying anything in the realm of poli sci, con law, er&m, etc, especially anyone considering law school (and especially criminal law) needs to interact with this stuff. It will probably make you more critical of most everything you grew up believing to be true about race and how racial issues have been addressed in the law. One of the best parts about it is Professor HoSangs willingness to be critical of both conservatives and liberals in their racial ethics and treatment of racial legal and political issues. Its fresh, exciting, and insightful; I dont know what more you could ask for in a lecture. I was genuinely excited to go to every class, and was sorry when I had to miss it. Take it while you can!! Readings can be long, but you get a lot out of the lectures and really only need to have the readings done when you sit down to write the paper. I made the mistake of waiting til I was writing to read a couple times, but it was still doable. The writing assignments are short in length, but rather frequent (4 total, a presentation in section, and a short final paper), but they really ask you to think deeply. They were a time investment for me, but very rewarding. Feedback was always helpful and from what I can tell, the TFs for this class are generally great. I tend to despise sections and find most of them an unnecessary nuisance, but this one was actually fun. The discussions were engaging and it felt shockingly low pressure. The material is so interesting and fresh that most people show up wanting to really learn and engage. In my opinion, no need to credit d. Youll probably want to show up and engage. The assignments can be a bit intimidating but grading seems forgiving.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone. It is a course that everyone in this country should be taught.",
    "Yes I believe its a course all Yale students should take to better understand the dynamics of the world around them.",
    "Absolutely. This should be one of those keystone classes at Yale that everyone takes. Whether you have any interest in the topic heading in, the class, if you pay attention, will really open up your academic experience.",
    "yes!",
    "Yes! It is an absolutely phenomenal class and maybe one of the best Ive taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. If you can take it, yes. It's hard to explain why, but this was easily one of the best courses I took at Yale.",
    "I definitely recommend this course for people to be more aware of the struggles that occur around them daily.",
    "Yes! I wish every person at Yale College was made to take this course! It's a necessity to understanding other subject matters and life.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely, as long as you are prepared that the course will have a single accepted narrative",
    "I would definitely recommend this to literally any student, even if you consider yourself a non-humanities person. You learn so much about our society and the different lenses to view it through, as well as the Critical Race vocabulary in which to understand it with.",
    "RPL was an amazing class that you should take no matter your major or political views. There are so many interesting insights to past and present issues.",
    "Yes, I have recommended it to several peers because I believe race\/ethnicity course should be taken by every Yale student to obtain a critical understanding of our world and people.",
    "YES! Take this class it's amazing and HoSang is amazing",
    "Yes I would! This class helped me meet people who were interested in learning about critical race theory and in having their ideas challenged. Professor HoSang eloquently pushes left wing ideologies so I wouldnt recommend this course to someone who is very on the right side of the political spectrum and who does not want to be challenged since there isnt much engagement with conservative dialogue beyond antagonizing them. Still, if youre on any side of the aisle and want to have your thoughts challenged and to push yourself to understand novel left leaning ideas then this class is for you!",
    "YES. I wish every single yale student took this class.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes - I thought it was a fantastic and very relevant insight into America's laws and politics.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The TAs are amazing, Hosang is a great lecturer and the topics and themes will completely reframe the way you view the world",
    "Absolutely! Anyone studying any field should take this course to gain a new way of looking at the world.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! It will change the way you see the world.",
    "Absolutely. My favorite class so far. If you are at all interested in the concept of race and\/or Critical Race Theory- TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I think everyone at Yale should take this course. It should be a requirement.",
    "Yes - especially for students of color. The content puts words to experiences that people of color often observe in their lives. Beyond the readings themselves, the class really questions our conception of the law, how our institutions are constructed, and how we think about addessing social issues. One of the most intellectually impactful classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, I believe this class forces you to think about real life issues that everyone should consider.",
    "Absolutely, especially if youre a political science or American studies major. You get credit for literally such an enjoyable class!",
    "This class should be mandatory as it explains and critiques the socio-political foundation from which we build our livelihoods",
    "100%",
    "Yes! Absolutely! I loved this class - the discussions were intellectual and aware of the real-life implications of our topics. Professor HoSang and our TAs dropped knowledge gems on us! The first half of the class acts as a sort of refresher of Critical Race Theory, but it is important for people entering into these topics. I am struck and inspired by the second half and its questions - How do we re-imagine liberty, justice and sovereignty? We were equipped with knowledge and expertise surrounding the intersections of race, politics, and the law. Please take this class to learn and to implement real change into the world around you!",
    "Yes, absolutely take this class. There will not be another class that makes you think critically about our society as this class does. As cliche as it may sound, this class really changed my perspective on everything outside of the classroom.",
    "Yes!!! No matter what major you are, take this course. If you're upset by how things are in the world right now and want to understand how they became that way. If you are tired of peopling spitting liberation theory at you but no way to apply it, take this course. If you want to take a class with one of the best lecturers on this dang campus---TAKE THIS COURSE",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was very engaging and really makes you think differently about the world we live on and how we interact with the differemtsocial structures. It is by far the best class I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course. Race literally defines every aspect of life in the United States and throughout the world; it has shaped and continues to shape politics, economy, and society, and understanding the various structures that form race and inflict dehumanizing treatment onto people of various background is essential to understanding how the United States has functioned as an imperialist, white supremacist state. Furthermore, it gives insight into the truly flexible nature of race and how it is constructed differently throughout the world which is important for students to understand.",
    "Yes, of course!",
    "Yes, but tentatively. I read glowing reviews of the course and I felt a little let down. The workload and the reading is very heavy, and often very dense. I couldn't really keep up with reading, having to cram before sections and papers. I also wish we learned more about Asian-Americans place in history. It was really interesting and amazing to learn about the experiences and history of other races and identity groups, but Asians were not touched upon at all, even in the debate abut affirmative action. I did not get to feel the same ownership of the material as others.",
    "YES! The essays are short and very manageable, which made the course much less threatening and stressful. If you care about social justice at all, this course is a MUST.",
    "YES! This course will really challenge your assumptions about the world",
    "Yes! If you can only take one ER&M course (which you should take more) this would be an excellent choice. It appeals both to majors with some background in the topics and people who have never formally studied race in an academic setting."
