    "Definitely take this course! I'd recommend taking it with Henk but I hear the other professor is really good as well. Everyone loves this course. It gives you a background of information that's applicable in tons of things, so do it!",
    "Good intro course in graphic design, lots of discussion and application of important design elements. In-class workdays are a little silly and sometimes feel like a waste of time, but otherwise it is an enjoyable and engaging course. Henk Van Assen is very supportive.",
    "Yes. It is work, but it builds on basic design.",
    "First of all, I should clarify that intro to graphic design is NOT COMPUTER GRAPHICS. I thought it was, but it turned out to be a class on designing posters, brochures etc and communicating through visual elements. The requires a bit of work, but it's definitely enjoyable - an opportunity to have fun with scissors and glue.",
    "I highly recommend this class, especially Henk's section. Really cool to learn how to design without computers, especially if that's the only way you can imagine design. Fun and challenging studio assignments, but never so much work that it overwhelms other classes. You get to learn interesting basic concept of design and work with typography.",
    "if you are interested in graphic design or art or anything- take it.",
    "Intro Design is a forum in which to explore your own ideas about design without too much guidance or hand-holding. The entire semester includes about 3 informational lectures with slide shows of examples of good design or lessons about branding. There are very few assignments once you get past a few basic ones in the first two weeks, and after that the class moves quickly.I would recommend as a great first art class for non-majors. Not too much work if you are willing to put in time. The class does get a bit expensive for printing and materials. The registrar charges you $150 to take the class, though that money does not go toward any materials. You must buy all materials and printing on your own (probably an additional $100 over the course of the year). Just be aware of this."
