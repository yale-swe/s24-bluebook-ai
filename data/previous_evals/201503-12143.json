    "Senior capstone where you work on a current policy project for a real client (such as an NGO). Very hands-on",
    "I learned a lot from the TechnoServe capstone but wish we had accomplished more. The project was much less accomplish-able than it had seemed when applying to capstone projects. Overall tho, it's fun to work with a real company and solve a problem with a group of students in the major. I'm really glad I had the capstone experience but I hope that, in future, Jackson picks projects that allow students to contribute more to a company\/agency.",
    "Yes, I would highly highly recommend this course or any future courses taught by Bo!",
    "A great experience! I think it was very inspiring to worth with a nonprofit such as TechnoServe and the field research provided us with very applicable knowledge for the future!",
    "I really enjoyed my capstone with Bo and my peers, mostly because our team members worked well together. It's a great opportunity to do an interesting research or consulting project and is a very practical exercise in presenting and working in a team."
