   "comments": [
    "great and useful",
    "My favorite course. Very useful and practical!",
    "Data Management was by far the most practical course I took at the School of Public Health - I got a grasp of how to use SAS much above my understanding from biostatistics, and it had direct relevance as I was completing my thesis. The information provided is a bit dry, but definitely worth it! Some of the lecture slides were fairly text heavy and I think that the lectures could have been tightened up a bit - no need to provide us with 5 different examples for each of the subjects that we covered. The labs were definitely the most helpful just because we actually got to practice the skills that we learned about in class.",
    "Great course, as an introduction",
    "Great course. Covers essential concepts for 1st year MPH students. I appreciate how the course facilitates applied learning, i.e. SAS programming (which really requires students to understand the concepts in order to correctly apply them) and writing a summary or discussion of our results.The lab sessions are very helpful, but some are very long. Although I don't expect to finish a lab assignment during the lab period, some of the long labs are very stressful because I cannot keep up during the instruction. When this happens I walk away from the lab stressed because I did not have a chance to grasp the main concepts which are often covered at the end of the lab.",
    "I'm really impressed by the amount of SAS I've learned. I think it's a well organized course with reasonable expectations and amazing outcomes.",
    "Good. The lectures were sometimes paced too slowly, which made it difficult at times to stay focused on the material. Moving through the material at a faster rate would make it more stimulating. The lectures were extremely thorough and the professor was equally thorough. Overall, I've improved in my ability to use SAS and analyze data immensely this semester, which is incredibly valuable.If the course included more information about ideal lab write-ups early on and continued to address these in class, it would have been a huge help. I was not allowed to see an \"ideal\" lab write-up until the last lab. In order for me to improve my lab write-ups, I need to see more examples! If an example write-up could be posted for even the first few labs, that would be so helpful. I wanted to improve my write-ups, but didn't feel as though I had access to the materials that would help me to do so. I tried to improve based on short comments on labs from TAs.",
    "I feel like this class really helped me to develop a level of comfort with using SAS and interpreting statistical output. It was incredibly useful and I would recommend it to others.",
    "Strengths: well organized lectures and lab sessions with a lot of practical uses.",
    "This course is so important to public health. It really helps students to learn to use SAS in a way that they will likely use it in their careers. While we learned some SAS in biostatistics I, this course showed us the really important uses of SAS for managing and analyzing data. More than that, this course taught us to how to analyze the results for data and to write-up results sections and tables that would be found in actual publications. This class is so useful.",
    "I thought that the overall course design - lectures and lab assignments reinforcing the course material - worked well for learning the information. It was helpful as well that the lab assignments corresponded closely with the midterm and final exams.",
    "Learning SAS is interesting and useful",
    "It is very helpful for future analysis, for instance, our thesis. The lab section is informative.",
    "it is a very good class... the class provides quantitative skills that are extremely useful..Strengths:quantitative skillsi am lo longer scared or intimidated by SASweakness.. would have liked the class earlier sometime in the summer.. so that SAS and dana management in general could be used for internship.. in the spring semester... through the start....",
    "The course was really helpful to figure out how to use and run SAS, however, I'm still trying to figure out how helpful that will be to me in the long term (post thesis work).",
    "it was good. learned more data management strategies",
    "I think this is a fantastic cours,e and I wish I could have taken it even sooner during my time at YSPH. I feel that is it one of the most valuable courses offered, and I appreciate Dr. Desai's practical, straight forward approach to SAS.",
    "It was an average quality class, but nonetheless helpful.",
    "Strengths: Learning the appropriate formatting of tables, SAS coding, building upon existing data sets from one lab to the nextWeaknesses: Not feeling involved in the labs-and what the interpretation of the results are. Too much focus on just how it would appear in a academic research journal versus if you were writing reports for a job and to the general publicImproved: For labs, choosing 2 options of data sets and really building upon it so that you feel more involved in the process of the codiing. Make it mandatory to learn how to format and label variables so that they are not read as just 0\/1. I felt like I would like to actually use it but did not have time to do that.",
    "This class has been one of my favorite experiences for the year. Coming in I wasn't a huge fan of SAS, maybe a little intimidated. But while taking the final, the sections that resembled some of the midterm tasks I could complete in minutes rather than hours.I feel that this class and this class alone has given me such a good foundation for the program that for the most part I have the confidence I could learn new SAS techniques on my own.If a class can do that, then I have no recommendations for improving it.",
    "This course is a well-organized, systematic introduction to data management in SAS. It helped me feel more in control of SAS-related tasks and also supplemented my understanding of statistical concepts that other courses also covered.",
    "The material covered in this course was excellent. However, if just handed a dataset and told to \"go\", I'm not sure I would know where to start without the type of intructions we got for the homework and exams, and I think this was a main objective of the course.",
    "This course was excellent. It provided a great overview of SAS and introduction into how to do the statistical analyses we had been learning about in Epi and Statistics.I wish Dr. Desai did a second version of this course in the fall building on what we learned this semester. I would take it!",
    "I have learned so much in this course. I can not believe how much SAS I now know. Before this class, I literally did not know anything about SAS. I am much more confident in my abilities.",
    "It was a very helpful class to become framiliar with SAS and data analysis.",
    "great class- very applicable. really start to understand how to use and manipulate sas",
    "Great class! Learned a ton!",
    "Very good to equip yourself with the skill set in data management and analysisUseful courses . Well organized.",
    "very practical",
    "The class is very helpful",
    "This course was strong. I didn't feel confident about my skills using SAS to analyze data prior to this course and I feel much more confident now! The lectures were a little dry, but I mean....it's SAS - SAS does cool things, but it's not exactly exciting to learn how to make it do those cool things unless you're sitting in front of computer doing those things on your own.",
    "The class was extremely important and useful. I really felt as if I was learning.",
    "It is great to teach you how to use SAS and how to select and apply the appropriate methods to answers research questions with selsct data. The pace of the course picked up quickly towards the end of the semester and could benefit from being spread out differently.",
    "Strengths: great lectures, labs are very well-designed, and exams are clear.Weaknesses: 2 hours of SAS in the late afternoon can be a real struggle to get through",
    "This was the best course of the APMPH program, I wish I had taken it five years ago!",
    "The homeworks were useful for helping to understand the material.",
    "A must take course. A very useful class",
    "This course was great. I did not understand sas before taking this class. it was well structured and well taught",
    "This was a wonderful course. My only negative comment is that the final exam is too long. I understand the desire to create a comprehensive exam, however, in the setting of finals in all other classes the Data Management final was not an appropriate length.",
    "This course was very useful, I learned a lot of SAS, and the topics were reinforced because I was learning the same in one other course- biostats.",
    "The course was great and possibly one of the most useful courses I took all year. It really made me understand how to use SAS.",
    "I learned a lot in this course and had it will be very useful for data analysis in the future.",
    "Very practical, and very useful as well!",
    "Data management is a great course! Dr. Desai really breaks down the information and is a great instructor.",
    "This course was extremely helpful in aiding my familiarity with and use of SAS. The course was very successful in accomplishing what it was designed to do.",
    "Dr. Desai is very much a top-notch, expert in his field. At times, especially early on, he seemed very intimidating in the classroom. Talking to him in office hours proved beneficial and he is very approachable\/it is easy to ask questions to him in that context. Furthermore, he is very quick in getting back to students.His midterm and final exam are daunting. They are certainly useful in terms of getting practical experience and learning how to understand data, but they can be daunting nonetheless.His grading system is difficult to follow.He can be a bit harsh in lectures when talking about mistakes others make. Obviously we should strive to be the best possible, but we are in the process of learning.",
    "Good. Reasonable assignments and exams.",
    "Excellent course--really teaches you how to use SAS. Should be reorganized a little though to synchronize better with Biostats.",
    "One long 2 hour class per week. It is hard to sit through a class on SAS for that long, however the professor makes it fun. Section for 1 hr is not enough time to get through some of the longer labs.",
    "The labs were really helpful at illustrating the lessons we were learning in lecture. Lectures were easy to follow and understand.",
    "This course is fantastic and essential to learning SAS.",
    "I thought the course was VERY useful in understanding and using SAS. I really liked the fact that there was not assigned text, but rather we could use outside resources to understand how to do things in SAS if we needed to. The amount of work was high (if you are unfamiliar with SAS to begin with) and the learning curve is steep. You can expect to come out of this course with a working knowledge of SAS, and a very useful notebook full of instructions to refer to in the future. Highly recommended.",
    "I thought the class was excellent overall, but in general I would think it could be improved if one data set is used throughout as we learn new techniques (we largely did this, using one data set for several labs, but then switched it a bit). Perhaps another improvement would be to use a student generated data set, to better approximate real world work.",
    "Strengths:1)The powerpoints that are posted before lecture is extremely helpful during lecture and when doing homework assignments.2)The presentation of materials is organized and this makes it easy for one to follow.",
    "This was an excellent course. This was one of the most useful classes I have taken. It has definitely helped me gain confidence in my SAS skills. Although I enjoyed the lectures, the labs were especially useful.",
    "Strengths:This has been the most useful class I have taken. It really helped me understand how to handle data with SAS. The lectures were informative. I have saved them and refer back to them. The lab sessions were also very good in reinforcing the skills that we learned about in lectures. The class was very well structured and clear.Weaknesses:The class was a little intimidating at first. I did not feel comfortable asking questions in class. The lab would be better if it was two hours instead of one. I felt rushed and was not able to stay to finish the assignment because another lab session would be starting right after. The TA office hours were really difficult to attend for a lot of us. The midterm and final were very intimidating. I don't know if they could be structured differently or possibly shorter, but a change would make the class a lot more enjoyable overall.",
    "The course was wonderful and extremely valuable. I learned a lot about data analysis and how to work with SAS. I feel incredibly more confident working with data sets.",
    "This class is about a topic I do not care for, but it was still fairly interesting, and more importantly, effective and thorough.",
    "This is a very good class, and better than the biostats course for really learning SAS. The lectures are clear, the materials are very useful, and the labs are pointedly instructional. The workload is also very manageable, while making you feel like you've really mastered the skills you're trying to learn.",
    "This is an excellent course, definitely one of the best experiences of the entire degree program.",
    "really helpful and useful",
    "It is among the best I've taken at Yale. It gave me a useful skillset and left me feeling much more comfortable using SAS. I wish that it was a little better in synch with what we were doing in stats and epi II.",
    "Good course, very useful and necessary skill set. Mayur is an excellent instructor who does a good job of making the information practical.",
    "Do you want to not suck at SAS? Take this.",
    "This is by far the most useful course I took this springThis \"cookbook\" approach will serve me (and has already) throughout my researcher life, I can already see that.I cannot thank enough Dr Desai from thinking from his students' vantage point and be pragmatic and to the point!the hoemworks were extremely useful, in that they were dry runs for future articles we may writethe only thing it could be improved has already occured, that is, get the bells and whistles of SAS addressed, and Leslie Park did a wonderful job at that!! (the dessert chapter of the cookbook was excellent!)",
    "The most useful and practical course of all. Challenging for people without background in programming. Lectures are very detailed. TAs are highly proficient and exceedingly nice.",
    "It is the most useful, practical class I have ever taken at YSPH so far. The level\/difficulty of the class is very appropriate(not too easy, but not too difficult to follow)."

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The instructor was great. He brought humor to the course and taught well. While we were worried about learning SAS he emphasized a \"cookbook\" approach which made learning it and using it so much easier. He constantly showed us new concepts and supported them with real-life examples. He made understanding the material quite easy. The notes that he posted for us will definitely be kept on my bookshelf for future reference.",

    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0He is a great lecturer and is clear in his instructions. He gave good examples of coding, etc.Weaknesses: Always saying SAS is not rocket science-it takes a lot to think the way a programmer thinks. It is not always clear in that sense.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai has been one of the top instructors that I've ever had. Here is the reason why:Wednesdays this last semester were the busiest days ofthe week. I'd start the day at 8:30 and then continuously sit in lecture or lab for the day. By the time Data Management lecture starts I am wiped out from all of the previous knowledge I've stuffed in my head.Mayur's ability to not only make a subject, that I previously considered boring, interesting and enjoyable but to do it in a lecture hall at the end of the day for 90+ students is a gift. I also was a fan of his morbid humor.Thank you for a great semester Mayur!",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0The instructor is a dynamic speaker and and an effective instructor. He was able to make 2 hour lectures about data and programming engaging and entertaining. He was also good at relating to our perspective as students and was sensitive to whether we felt comfortable with the material.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is excellent. He takes something that could potentially be quite complicated and breaks it down into easy steps...his cookbook approach.

    "great",
    "Leslie is fabulous! She was SO helpful in office hours and has a knack at explaining complex SAS processes clearly.My TA was Kevin--he provided good feedback as well.",
    "Lesley is also great. very patient and know a lot of SAS!",
    "Katie LaMonaca was a fantastic teaching assistant - she was always available for any questions related to the course material, and explained the SAS coding in a methodical way that made sense to everyone in the section. She was always prepared for section and had a great attitude - it was wonderful having her as a TA!",
    "Lesley was my personal TA and she is excellent. Patient and understanding but also lets students work through the problems in lab to help us learn. She went above and beyond to make sure we all understood and learned material.",
    "Lesley Park is an excellent TA. She is very invested in her students, and this makes a huge difference in how effective her teaching is. Lesley is patient and kind, but does require students to think for themselves. I appreciate how prepared Lesley is for each section. Her instruction was a great compliment to Mayur's lecture.",
    "Lesley Park is the best TA ever. Seriously, she needs an award for this.",
    "Kevin Tran did an excellent job!",
    "Katie's section worked well for me. I learned a lot from the labs.",
    "Kevin Tran was an excellent TA. He was energetic and eager to help!",
    "Patient, guide students through the learning process, encourage participation.",
    "My TA was Hanae. She was a great TA who explained concepts well and helped us with coding in SAS. She got us to interact with each other and her in lab which made learning SAS much easier.",
    "The TAs were good.",
    "My TA for this course was Kevin Tran. He did a wonderful job of conducting the lab sessions, and ensuring that all students understood the information being covered.",
    "Lesley Park is a great TA!",
    "TA: Katie LaMonica.I appreciate all the effort Katie devoted into the course.",
    "Kevin was good...his SAS skills are very well established... Sometimes due to time constraints.. went over labs really fast.. otherwise accessible and knowledgeable..",
    "Katie L.She was a good TA, helpful and made sure that we learned how to do the programming rather than giving us the answer.",
    "Kevin did our lab. I thought he was very good! Answered everyones questions and an overall nice guy",
    "Katie Lamonaca was wonderful this semester. She did a great job in section, and I always felt comfortable asking questions or for clarification. She was always prepared, and really worked hard to make sure everyone was on the same page. I was lucky to have such a great TA!",
    "Hanae is sweet. She was a good TA.",
    "Katie LaMonaca: Katie did a great job TAing. As a previous student it's great that she understood what the class was like. However, her level of experience with SAS\/statistics at times was limiting. There were a couple times where she was behind in grading our labs, which is necessary to have when you want to fix your mistakes for the next lab.",
    "Katherine Lamonaca was my T.A. and she was an integral part of my SAS education. She had the right balance between knowing when to help us out and letting us figure things out on our own. I felt comfortable asking her questions because she was approachable and knowledgeable of the subject. She did a really good job.On another note that has nothing to do with Katherine, it was a bit frustrating to have our lab bumped by another class by the end of the semester. Maybe I'm a grumpy old man, but I just don't understand the logic behind letting one class schedule a session in the computer lab during a time when another class has regularly used the lab throughout the entire semester. I don't know, I'm probably overreacting but I just think we should of had priority.",
    "The TA, Katie LaMonaca, was well-prepared, well-organized, and effective as an instructor. She conducted lab session efficiently and clearly. She was able to answer all of our questions knowledgeably and helped guide us through the challenges posed by the material. She also graded and returned our labs in a timely fashion. Her instruction was pivotal to my positive experience with this course.",

    "Katie Lamonaca. Great TA. Very good at explaining.",
    "My TA for this course was fantastic. She was clearly very knowledgable and helpful.",
    "TAs were generally excellent.",
    "Hanae Fujii-RiosI think Hanae did a fine job as a TA, although, to be honest, I did not pay much attention to her. I gathered most of what I needed to complete the labs from the lectures and slides, and so when I arrived in lab I would usually just start without staying on pace with the class, because I found it more efficient for my time to work ahead. She seemed very patient and willing to help those who needed it though.",
    "My TA is Hanae. She did well in reviewing and guiding us through the materials that were discussed during lecture. She was helpful in answering questions about homework assignments. She gave good feedback for our homework write-up summary.Although I did not have Leslie as my TA, I had gone to her for office hours. She was extremely clear in explaining certain codes and\/or questions I had about a homework assignment and thus helping me to understand them.",
    "Katie was a great TA. She was able to clearly explain the lab material and was always very helpful.",
    "Katie was an excellent TA. She was well-organized and a great lecturer. She was also attentive to people who were having problems. The lab session was too short which made her rush but that was not her fault.",

    "Kevin Tran was an excellent lab TA, and also a tremendous resource for out-of-class SAS questions. His universal willingness to go the extra mile when helping students was remarkable.",
    "very good",
    "Katie LamonacaGreat job. Very professional and helpful.",
    "TAs were all excellent.",
    "Kevin Tran was great. Started off kind of slowly holding our hands in lab but encouraged us to slowly work on the code by ourselves (unlike what I heard regarding other TAs). Really helpful and made SAS more interesting (showed us diff. code and cool shortcuts).",
    "cannot say enough good words about Kevin Tran- he was fun, approachable, extremely organized and very dedicated!and had an endless supply of stickers...",
    "TAs are highly proficient and exceedingly nice. Kevin is very knowledgeable and helpful. Always ready to go extra mile.",

    "Highly recommend it!!",
    "If you will ever use quantitative data in your public health career, I would highly recommend taking this class. SAS is a great skill to have, and this is a nice, straightforward way to learn how to do the analyses that you may do for your thesis or future work experiences.",
    "Necessary",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. In fact, I would recommend that YSPH consider making this a required course for EMD students because it seems essential.",
    "Highly recommend this course, reinforced epi2 and biostatistics concepts and taught very useful SAS skills",
    "This is one amazingly awesome course! A must-have for everyone!",
    "Helps with learning SAS and applying concepts from biostatistics and epi tremendously. Critical course.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student.",
    "Yes. I would recommend because it is very important for thesis",
    "This course is so important for public health. Data management and analysis is relevant to many public health careers and this course gives insight into the ins and outs of creating tables and results sections for publications. I imagine that my knowledge from this class will be used extensively in the future. This course also helped to teach me SAS in such a way that I feel comfortable using it and even enjoy writing code. This course is 100% recommended.",
    "Approaches to Data Management and Analysis was a wonderful introduction to using SAS. Before the course, SAS was a confusing and difficult technique that was briefly covered in Introduction to Statistical Thinking. This course, however, provided a wonderful overview of the different procedures and techniques available through SAS.",
    "You cannot afford to miss this course!",
    "Every helpful. Everyone should take it.",
    "I definitely recommend the course... Its one of the best courses at yale and truly help expand tool box...",
    "An introductory class in how to use SAS to clean, format and analyze data.",
    "good helps with sas management skills.",
    "Depends on how coding saavy\/SAS saavy the person is. Definitely recommend taking the course to improve on management of data and analyzing data with SAS. Very useful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others. I now have confidence in SAS that I never thought I'd acquire.",
    "This is a very useful class. What you learn in this class will give you tangible skills in data management that may be very useful to you in your summer internships.",
    "It is a great course for learning SAS.",
    "Highly highly recommend!",
    "Take this course! It is so applicable and I actually feel like I learned something that I can apply in the workplace.",

    "Take this course. It will be one of the most useful classes you take at YSPH.",
    "highly recommended",
    "This was a solid course that will be very helpful for anyone who plans to do anything quantitative with their MPH degree (which is probably most of us!).",
    "It is great for those who are looking to get a better handle on SAS. It is also great to help solidify concepts introduced in intro to epi and intro to biostats.",
    "This is a great course for actually learning SAS. The lectures can be a struggle to get through (2 hours of SAS in the late afternoon is TOO much!), but they are worth paying attention to. Dr. Desai is a fabulous lecturer, and a very dedicated teacher.",
    "My summary would be this course has pretty everything you want to know to be able to understand and perform some analysis for epi studies. Its \"cook book\" approach is perfect to organize the ideas and guide you in the right direction of the analysis, and then you can go beyond it in case you want or need it.I would strongly recommend it for every student; it is far the best course of the program.",
    "An enjoyable course that ties to together material from other courses (Epi, Biostats) quite nicely.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student as it is a very helpful course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. hands down.",

    "I would absolutely recommend this course in terms of developing skills with SAS. It is extremely useful.",
    "Very practical and useful.Can be frustrating\/daunting at times.Even if you don't take this class, it would be useful to sit in on it.If you are going to take this, take it during your first year so you can have the information learned in this class in your back pocket when working at your internship\/on your thesis.",
    "YES!",
    "very intensive class! get prepared for a lot of work.",
    "Take this course if you want to get a good handle on SAS.",
    "This course is a must to learning data analysis with SAS.",
    "See answer to question 6. Ihighly recommend this course if you want to use SAS in your future career. It brings together concepts from Epi I and II, Stats I and II, and applies them using SAS.",
    "I would and have recommended data management to my peers who didn't take it this semester. It is a good overview of how to use SAS effectively and efficiently, and it introduced at the end some additional topics for those (like me) who want to geek out on SAS.",
    "This course allows students to become familiar and more comfortable with the SAS program. It allows the students to learn and practice manipulating data in order to evaluate their results. The course is extremely helpful for students to know before entering their second year because the work requires the students to perform tasks that may be necessary for when students are doing their thesis data evaluation. I would recommend that first year students take this course in their second semester.",
    "Definitely take this class!",
    "Data management was the best class in learning the fundamentals of SAS. Take it.",
    "I would absolutely say that Data Management should be a must take course at YSPH.",

    "This is a very good class, and better than the biostats course for really learning SAS. The lectures are clear, the materials are very useful, and the labs are pointedly instructional. The workload is also very manageable, while making you feel like you've really mastered the skills you're trying to learn.",
    "Excellent course; DoNot Miss.",
    "very good",
    "A great course. If it is required for your division, take it right away. If it not required for you but you might be interested in doing anything requiring using SAS or quantitative analysis, take it too.",
    "SAS is a necessary evil, and this is about as painless as it gets to learn SAS. It is rare to find an instructor who can make SAS funny, yet Mayur succeeds at that.",
    "Great class to take if you want to learn SAS (unlike in BioStats I and II) and aren't necessarily a BioStats major. Useful SAS code without going into esoteric material. Highly recommended.",
    "if you take this class you will use it in 99% of your projects in the future!if you don't, I cannot quarantee that you will finish any single of them!",
    "Essential course. You will get a lot out of it regardless of what your career will be. Prepared to be challenged.",
    "Excellent course."
