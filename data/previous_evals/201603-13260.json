    "Some weeks, there would be reading or very little work due for class. Towards the end of class, Dr. Zhang assigned a data analysis project that was very over my head. While it was a good application of material, it was material that required SAS knowledge from classes students hadn't had yet or involved material that students weren't comfortable with. This particular assignment probably took 10+ hours for me to comprehend and complete.",

    "From what I heard from students last year, it sounds like this course has been re-done from the last semester it was taught. While this seems to be an improvement from remarks I heard about last semester's course, the content seemed all over the place: we learned about Dr. Zhang's research for the first few weeks, completing homeworks and readings based on her publications or similar readings. Other weeks, we would spend the entire class discussing our midterm literature review assignments with each other. Overall, it was a helpful class in tying together some of the epi concepts we learned last year, but the organization of the class should be better addressed and set in stone at the beginning of the semester. Additionally, I wish assignments were better explained, perhaps by including the specific points they are looking for in the assignments. A lot of the points I missed on our midterm was because there was a misunderstanding on the content I was supposed to include - some sort of assignment explanation and better description should be put in the syllabus to refer to throughout the year.",
    "I liked some of the topics that we chose to talk about, but we would benefit from a review of some epi concepts--types of studies, when you use which ones, interpreting odds ratios etc. We should have talked more about how to analyze data before just throwing a data set at us. Additionally, it was hard to determine what we were being graded on for the assignments as there was no rubric. Making a sheet that explained what was expected for the midterm and the final would have been helpful.",
    "Overall, a very interesting class. Prof. and TA were both great. I think the grading was a bit unclear and wished that there were more clear rubrics for assignments.",
    "I would say that this course met my expectations. The initial assignments were weak and did not seem to relevant. However, the last lectures and assignments were very salient and I was able to take a lot away from them.",
    "I think the class was very good. Compared to other classes, this was more focused on the practical issues that may arise when carrying out epidemiological work (as opposed to just the theoretical aspects of epidemiology,) I did feel a little confused as to what was expected from a couple assignments until after I had received my grade."

    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Very engaging lecturer, interesting research that was the content of multiple lectures. She listened to what the students wanted to see in future lectures and what we wanted to get out of the course and made it happen. To me, this is a sign of a very flexible and understanding professor!",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Dr. Zhang is kind and helpful. With improved content, i think her teaching style is good.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Yawei is an excellent scholar and I very much enjoyed hearing about her work. She is also a good lecturer and her strengths lie in responding to student questions. I also think that the class worked much better in the second half when lectures were mixed in with class activities. Otherwise, I think the class time is far too long and even lectures about interesting topics start to become tedious.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0I think that she did a fine job teaching the course. I liked how the last lectures pivoted from being just a summary of the research to more the thought process behind the research. It became more of a way to construct a research question, how to approach the question and problems that may be encountered. I really enjoyed these later courses.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0The professor is very versed in the actual practice of the field and gave a good idea of what it is like to work in the area."

   "comments": [
    "Overall, it was a good course to tie together some larger concepts learned in earlier Epi courses, but the organization of the course needs work for next semester.",
    "I would say that this course is a survey on how to construct a research question of interest. Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think that the last assignments and courses were very well taught. The use of real data and real problems allowed for the assignments to be framed in a way that seemed more real to me. This allowed for me to take more from them than I otherwise would have.",
    "This is an interesting class in a field that I previously knew very little about. The instructor is an experienced practitioner and there will be many good case studies discussed in the class. If necessary, be sure to consult the professor\/TA for clarification of what is required for the assignments."
