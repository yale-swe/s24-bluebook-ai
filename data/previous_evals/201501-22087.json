    "It has been a great course and I hope that I could had taken the year long one.",
    "Independent study and writing. A lot of annoying deadlines.I would recommend doing a full year essay, you'll be expected to do all of your research in a month's time.",
    "This class is the one semester senior essay for EP&E majors not writing their essays in a seminar. I enjoyed writing my essay in a non-seminar context, although I do wish I had done the year-long, which gives greater opportunity for intellectual research, and a less crammed writing schedule. I think the EPE Senior Essay Consultant (Tatiana) is fantastic - she kept me on track a lot of the time, and was a great sounding board for ideas I had. The key to having a positive experience in this essay is finding a topic you care about and an advisor who will mentor and guide you. I am glad to have had both.",
    "You write a thesis. Make sure to start early and spread out the work. People who tackle the entire thing over a weekend are miserable; people who do it little by little actually end up enjoying the experience. At least that's my opinion on the matter.",
    "If you want to do original research I would recommend doing the year long essay. But if can't find a data set to use - then go for the single semester. Its really all about how good your advisor is."
