    "My speaking skills probably improved, learned a little vocab, read some interesting stuff",
    "Improved my Spanish a lot in general - speaking, listening, reading, and writing.",
    "You will improve your Spanish speaking skills and your grammar fundamentals.",
    "I developed my speaking, writing, written and auditory comprehension and somewhat developed my speaking skills",
    "Speaking proficiency and grammatical intuition. More confidence in my Spanish speaking.",
    "I learned how to communicate verbally and through writing in Spanish, along with the many verb tenses of the Spanish language and other grammar nuances. I also learned some cultural and historical background of Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries.",
    "I was able to improve skills in Spanishspeaking, reading, and writing.",
    "This course greatly improved my speaking abilities and made me comfortable using all of the verb tenses in Spanish in speech. This class had just enough grammar activities that it was helpful but did not seem like \"drill and kill\", and I found the online Supersite homework to be a helpful tool in keeping me on top of my work. The use of a foreign language felt natural for the first time, and it was exciting to finally be conversationally fluent. My writing skills improved this semester as did my reading comprehension. In SPAN 140 we read a lot of creative stories and had long discussions on them in class, which made the class more interesting than a standard Spanish class. I learned how to differentiate between verb tenses and how to use basically all of Spanish grammar. For the first time I felt as though I was thinking in another language instead of translating in my head."

   "comments": [
    "It's pretty fun to have a course that meets everyday with the same small group of people, though it can be a little annoying at times. It's a pretty straightforward course and relatively enjoyable although the supersite homework is confusing and annoying.",
    "The course is a lot of work but having the class every day was very conducive to improvement in my Spanish.",
    "Strengths: the nightly practice helps you to master the concepts Weaknesses: the content can get boring at times.",
    "It was extremely time-intensive and demanding, and the online VHLCentral homework assignments could be improved by changing the scoring system (so that partial credit is allowed). However, VHL was useful for daily Spanish grammar and language practice, along with the other homework assignments.",
    "A strength is that teachers work hard to help develop a solid foundation in their students. A weakness (in my opinion) is the time it requires students to devote.",
    "This class did not emphasize the book, rather, the teacher drew in a lot of information from other sources and used daily Powerpoints as a teaching tool. There was lots of This class did not emphasize the book, rather, the teacher drew in a lot of information from other sources and used daily Powerpoints as a teaching tool. There was lots of variety in the course which I greatly appreciated, such as visits to the museum, different types of compositions, many in class activities, stories, a novel, movies, short films, debates, etc. Spanish class was creative and comfortable -- the students in the class became friends. This class could be improved by focusing a little bit more on vocabulary because I did not learn many new words. I really enjoyed reading Las Batallas en el Desierto at the end of the semester and I wish we could have gone that in depth on all the short stories. Some of the stories were difficult to understand and would take a long time to work through because there were so many unfamiliar words. The workload for this course was very heavy."

    "Yeah if you wanna do an L4 language not too bad. I enjoyed it!",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, if you need it for a language requirement\/if you want to improve your Spanish. Not a particularly fun or interesting course, but if you need it, then that's that.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "This course was very challenging but rewarding. I would recommend this course to students who want to improve their Spanish language and communication skills through rigorous practice and daily usage.",
    "I would recommend this course, as it helps improve skills in Spanish in only a short period of time.",
    "Yes, I took Spanish in high school and this class was really a level up in its applicability and its course material. I learned to love Spanish and I really enjoyed having a small class that met every day. The Spanish department is very organized and well established at Yale. There is at least an hour of homework daily though, so you have to be on top of your work. The exams and compositions are fair, but it is not easy to get an A in the course. Take this class if you really are interested in becoming fluent in Spanish."
