    "This class is great if you love Japan \/ Japanese popular culture. Professor Gerow is fantastic, and I can guarantee you will enjoy the course. Note however that this is not a joyride: we spent time looking at culture in general, and how people approached studying culture. We also looked at postmodernity, capitalism and some Japanese history. I enjoyed learning about all of the above, and I'm sure you will too.",
    "A very eye-opening class for students who are interested in modern Japanese culture. There are a lot of borderline controversial topics in this class which will shock many people (especially during the screenings) who do not have much knowledge of Japan beforehand. I really enjoyed the material that we read and discussed, although one of my classmates had a hard time accepting many things in the beginning as part of a culture that she previously appreciated. Japanese 272 is a very intriguing class, if nothing else. Really good class for those not easily turned off by graphic details and social\/cultural studies of Japan and its quirks.",
    "Learn analytical approaches and use them to understand important parts of Japanese Popular Culture. Anyone who can handle the reading and a few ambitious assignments should take this course.",
    "This class focuses heavily on anime and manga, but there are some discussions of modern, social problems in Japan. Classes are just discussions of the readings required for that week, and there are 2 papers (mid-term paper and final paper). If you're interested in anime and manga, then definitely take it.",
    "I would probably not recommend this course to most people. It seems to deal with a very specific niche aspect of Japanese culture, and the 2-3 hour screenings each week were very time consuming \/ many of the the films were terrible. There is one paper, one presentation, one final paper, and participation in section."
