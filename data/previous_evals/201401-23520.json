    "L4 French is a reasonably interesting intermediate\/advanced grammar course. The novels and stories are somewhat disappointing--it seems strange that texts like \"La Symphonie Pastoral\" and a rather dated short story anthology would be selected from the entire canon of Francophone literature--but Aaron is great. If he's teaching next year, take his section! He's friendly, funny, and always generous with his time; he never minded sending extra review sheets, exam tips, etc.",
    "Well, if you plan on continuing with French, take this class. It is a review of everything you have studied thus far, and I found it to be useful and engaging. Hopefully they'll change some of the material, certain texts were a bit depressing, but in any case I would recommend this class.",
    "It's a great course to take and really improves your French but the material is rather dead - it's all sordid."
