    "This course is the soul of comparative politics. Period.",
    "Yes, the course is a good review of research methods in the field of political science.",
    "Political Science 777 01 is an introduction to comparative politics through the discussion of several books. The books are selected for various instructive purposes and by engaging them, one thinks more deeply about how research is conducted and conveyed in a bookform. I would recommend the course strongly because of the reading but also the experience of being taught by Prof Kalyvas."

    "This course is the foundation of my knowledge of my discipline and my dissertation.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of the discipline by introducing me to several books and helping me to think through the book form more thoroughly than I had previously done. I enjoyed observing the professor and watching him engage texts and ideas, there was a lot of learning there. I think this course will contribute to my dissertation indirectly through broadening my knowledge of comparative politics and an understanding of trends in political science research."
