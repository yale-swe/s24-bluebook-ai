   "comments": [
    "A rigorous, engaging course on theories of agency\/action in sociological thought and their application. I would highly recommend this to any student whose research or learning interests involve questions about human society, including issues pertaining to individual and collective identity, culture, politics, social movements and human organization.",
    "I have really enjoyed the course and I will recommend it to students who are interested in the dynamics of agency and action. Class participants need to read a lot every week and share with others their own interpretations. Each student is responsible for two presentations and a final research paper (or two shorter review essays).",
    "This course had very high level theoretical discussion. It may be very challenging if students don't have a substantial background in sociology, but every student will learn something new and important.",
    "Intense seminar on sociological theory. Highly recommend.",
    "Absolutely! Certainly useful for sociologists but also to others interested in questions of agency.",
    "I would definitely recommend to this course to a fellow student. This course is great for becoming familiar with the theoretical debates surrounding the concepts of agency and action in sociology and is widely applicable to students interested in various subfields."

   "comments": [
    "Inquiries into the concept agency and action help me identify main actors and power relations in any social event. The course's focus on collective identity after the spring break is especially useful for my current research on nationalism and student protests in China.",
    "I know far more sociological theory post taking this class than before. Diving in to such varied texts greatly improves students understanding of the broad sub-areas of sociology. I learned a great deal in this course.",
    "This course familiarized me to the main theoretical debates surrounding the concepts of agency and action in sociology. In particular, the final project helped me to think more critically about the theoretical assumptions underlying key concepts in my subfield and identify new theoretical questions I hope to pursue in my future research."
