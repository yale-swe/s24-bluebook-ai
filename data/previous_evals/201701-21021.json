    "I learned introductory portuguese, some of the more colloquial phrases, and alot about brazilian culture and society.",
    "I gained an incredible amount of proficiency in the Portuguese language over a few short months.",
    "It is incredible how much I have learned in just one semester. Portuguese is such a fun language and Brazilian culture incredvel. I will have true saudade with Fabi leaving to Iowa next year.",
    "How to communicate - by learning both language and culture.",
    "A developed understanding of the Portuguese language (to conversational fluency) and a detailed understanding of Brazilian culture and history.",
    "This course gave me quite a proficient understanding of Portuguese. I came into it having already known Spanish, which made things easier, but out of this semester I've gained sufficient understanding of the most important verb tenses (past, present, future, conditional, subjunctive present, subjunctive past, and subjunctive future) and grammar elements. I also had a ton of fun getting to know Fabi and the other students in the course.",
    "I learned how to read and speak Portuguese"

   "comments": [
    "I think that Fabiana DePaula is a great professor who genuinely cares about her students and wants them to be successful in her class. She makes herself available when student reach out to her. A weakness might be that not all students are as committed to the class, and sometimes they dont show up to class. If enough students are absent, she wont teach new material, and that sets the rest of the class back.",
    "This course was a fantastic introduction to Portuguese and should be taught exactly the same as it was this year.",
    "Only strengths in my opinion - high level of engagement and practicing of language. Great professor.",
    "Main strength was the quality of teaching. Fabi was superb. Only weakness was the intensity of the course (almost 2 hours a day) but if committed to, you will learn a lot very quickly.",
    "The only weakness that comes to mind is that I thought the course could be faster paced and slightly more challenging, given the Spanish-proficiency of most people in the class. There were a few people who came to class only on rare occasions, and pairing with them for speaking practice was not that useful.",
    "Strengths: The teacher is a native Portuguese speaker. Although the teacher is from Brazil, she made sure to teach us the grammatical and pronunciation variations of the European Portuguese. The course is everyday, which keeps everything fresh in your mind. It is a small class so you have personalized attention by the teacher. The teacher gave us the space to decide how engaged we wanted to be in the learning process"

   "comments": [
    "Fabi is a literal saint and you go through all of the major verb forms in the language in one semester. If you've taken another Romance language, especially Spanish, it will be relatively easy.",
    "I think that this a great course for students who have studied a romance language before. It is intensive, so the material will go by fast, but it is definitely manageable.",
    "This course was the most fun I've ever had taking a class here at Yale. It's definitely the place to start instead of L1 if you have the time for the extra class time.",
    "Yes absolutely! Unfortunately, with Fabi leaving, I know the course won't be the same. I am sure it will still be excellent though definitely take Portuguese if you are even slightly considering it you won't regret it!",
    "YES.",
    "Yes. The enthusiasm of the professor was contagious. You really learn to love the language and the culture that accompanies it.",
    "If you want to learn Portuguese at Yale, this intensive L1\/L2 course is the best way to do itespecially if you come into it with knowledge of Spanish. It's unfortunate that Fabi will no longer be here to teach it, as her departure will be an enormous loss for Yale. Two hours a day, five days a week might seem daunting at first, but it turned out to be such an effective structure for reinforcing the language and cultivating a close class environment. I honestly can say that I've finished this course with quite a strong proficiency in Portuguese, including knowledge of eight or so verb tenses and the most fundamental grammar elements. In the end, I'm thrilled I ended up taking this course: to have gained such a solid grasp on this language after only one semester of studying it is not something I expected to get out of Yale.",
    "Because the course covers the content of the first 2 levels of portuguese, I think the fast pace of the course is easier to follow for Spanish speakers. For someone taking romantic languages for the first time, I would recommend taking one level at a time"
