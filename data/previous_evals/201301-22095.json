   "comments": [
    "NOT with Irasema Alsonso, I ignored the comments of previous students and deeply regret it. She cannot teach for s**t and will give you p-sets and exams with questions that just don't make sense and don't directly cover material learned in the course.",
    "It's a great intro class. Much more interesting than intro micro and engaging, but make sure you take it with a professor you know is good. Put a precedent on the professor. Pick a section of the class that has a good professor over picking a section of a class just because it fits in your schedule.",
    "Macroeconomics is an extension of microeconomics, except it is actually more of a social science. Whereas micro was concentrated on quantitative reasoning and the basics of economics, macro takes the basics of micro and applies it to how people think and how the economy works in reality.",
    "No use taking Microeconomics if you aren't going to couple it with Macro. The course is relatively straightforward, with the topics being slightly more abstract than those covered in Micro. But for the love of all that is holy, take it from Katerina instead. Irasema is a brilliant woman, I'm sure, but she struggles to convey the concepts to her students, as she is altogether disorganized. The lecture version of this course is also significantly easier and has the added advantage of having a TA who can help with the concepts. Irasema isn't reason enough not to take the course, but it should be a last resort.",
    "This course really opened my eyes to the world economics as we read about it in the newspaper and listen to it on TV. Though they may seem oversimplified and at times mundane, the models you learn in this class help explain a lot of economic behavior that at first may seem mysterious. I would recommend this class to students willing to achieve this level of understanding. I highly recommend reading the textbook for this course. It provides an essential perspective and helps you double-check and review material that you may or may not absorb from lecture. If you are patient and devoted to the material, you will do well in Irasema Alonso's class. She really does look for effort and caring consideration for her subject and such participation can help your grade.",
    "Econ 111 is a good intro to macroeconomics. You should take it regardless if you are an econ major in order to gain a better understanding of economics in the world.",
    "Must take class that is way better than microeconomics. I took the lecture last semester and I enjoyed the seminar this semester way more. Class is fairly graded and is fairly easy.",
    "Necessary class to take for all potential econ. majors.",
    "The lecture format of macroecon was dull. I could not focus for the hour and a half lecture. The weekly homework is easy, so if you can prepare yourself for the two tests you will do ok.",
    "It's basically a slightly tougher version of the large economics lecture course, but its much easier to stay awake during class.",
    "A small seminar class designed for econ majors that focuses on lectures. Not very inspired."
