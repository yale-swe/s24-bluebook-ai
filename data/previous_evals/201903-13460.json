    "In this course, I learned to read large amounts of material and bring forward the most important ideas, facilitate and carry on lengthy conversations about intellectual topics, and better consider other perspectives when thinking of agrarian communities. The course helped me engage with agrarian topics that I might have otherwise neglected or missed and put me in conversation with other students and professors who also care about agriculture, albeit in different ways. The class was demanding but helpful.",
    "I learned how to 'think' about rural societies in a way that I hadn't before. The fact that Professor Scott's course was structured to immerse oneself in rural societies internationally and across various points of time, led to a unique perspective and a greater understanding of these past and current cultures.",
    "An overview of various topics connected to agrarian socities, as well as the different types and methods of research and analysis being done in these fields."

   "comments": [
    "My expectations for the class were not necessarily met, though that does not mean that I think that the class was a failure by any means. I expected to read bits of agrarian philosophy and engage with the writings of famous agrarians, and I expected to talk more about how agrarian communities are faring in the present and what can\/should be done to better serve these communities. Instead, the course took a more historical perspective and discussed agrarian communities from across the world. Only a few of the books\/papers were on current topics, and a surprisingly large amount didn't seem to discuss agrarian communities at all. While the lectures were always interesting, it at times seemed like they revolved around a specific professor's research interests rather than on what I thought the course would be about. I thought the course was fascinating and challenging (which was good), and I learned a lot. But it wasn't necessarily what I thought I would be learning (which is, again, not a bad thing).",
    "They exceeded my expectations. That the course was team-taught provided students with a trio of perspectives that melded well with the required reading and research content."

   "comments": [
    "The course helped students engage in lots of topics in very, very in-depth ways, and it presented a plethora of perspectives and historical examples of agrarian communities. These were great strengths. Another strength was getting to engage with the professors and fellow students in our \"discussion\" sections after the lecture each week. It was in these sections that we had the best conversations and got to present our own views and learn from others with similar or divergent views. I grew most as a student because of these conversations. One weakness of the course is that it didn't always seem to be focused on agrarian societies, and another is that the course was too long. Four hours in a row in any class exhausts fruitful conversations and makes them unproductive -- to the point that the talk just has to continue for the sake of talk itself. I think the class should be shortened by an hour. Further, I was disappointed that the class didn't touch more on agrarian communities in the United States. I appreciated the international perspective and learned a lot, but there are excellent examples of agrarian communities in the US that could have been included in the course.",
    "There were a lot of strengths that I had outlined above. The only 'weakness' was that we had the required discussion period following class--almost like two courses. That said, I did get an incredible amount of enrichment from attending the discussions.",
    "The topics didn't necessarily feel like they were building on each other. Discussion sections helped bridge some of that, but it really varied and depended on the students who were leading the section. I think in general more feedback and guidance in the discussion section, or better coordination between the students doing the discussion sections, to help us all better structure the discussions, draw out and connect themes would make that time more valuable."

   "comments": [
    "This course requires a big time commitment if it is to be taken seriously. Often, we were asked to read 300-400 dense pages a week and to know the material well enough to carry on or lead a small-group discussion for two hours. It was a helpful exercise, but it requires a large time commitment. Further, be prepared to be uncomfortable with the disparate nature of the course. One week, we read about ancient DNA and nomadic communities, the next we read about the Rhine River in Germany, the next was about the strawberry industry in California, the next we read a global history of fishing, and so on. It's interesting, and the conversations you'll have with fellow students and the professors will be fascinating, but it will seem very discordant, and at times, you may ask, \"Is this course still about agrarian societies?..\" All that to say, it's still a fascinating course, and if you get a chance to take a course with Jim Scott and Libby Wood, you should.",
    "Pack snacks and water for the five-plus hours of required learning, between class and discussion. Seriously. Buy the books===they're worth it.",
    "Be prepared to devote a lot of time to the readings, because otherwise you won't get nearly as much out of the discussion section. Having a strong idea early of what you want to focus your paper on can really help you focus your learning."
