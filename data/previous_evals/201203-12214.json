   "comments": [
    "Blow your mind! Get in this course. Yes I would recommend it.",
    "English 115 is a class for those who enjoy reading. For those who simply wish to learn how to write, then English 114 is the better choice. For those who wish to learn how to write while still analyzing literature and focusing on other aspects of humanities, then English 115 is perfect. I would recommend this class to another student. It works better towards getting distributional requirements since it is both a humanities and writing credit.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, especially for someone in need of some good literature to read. The material covered in this class is extremely interesting (and somewhat out there). There are only four essays (3 topics though) in the entire semester, and if you don't procrastinate on them you should be fine.",
    "Yes, definitely. Very manageable for an english class and surprisingly enjoyable",
    "Great class with a great teacher. The papers are a moderate amount of work, but it is well taught and interesting.",
    "You learn some techniques for incorporating sources in the arguments of your writing but mostly you learn to think about and analyze text in new ways. I'd recommend it strongly to sci-fi lovers.",
    "This is a good course - Professor Williams is excellent, and I would highly recommend taking 115 with him, particularly if you're into science fiction.",
    "English 115 was the best. I really, really enjoyed. I wasn't that interested in science fiction to start off with, but it wasn't just about technology as I had expected. Prof. Williams is very interesting and fun to listen to. I really enjoyed the books we read in class and really learned a lot. I would highly recommend this class. It's deff one of my favorites so far here.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, just because I had a good time in it. It's also a good way to begin an English career at Yale: the workload isn't too overbearing, but students still learn a lot about a specific genre.",
    "This was a great class. Professor Williams is a lot of fun and you get to read some really interesting books. I'd definitely recommend his section of 115, especially if you like sci fi.",
    "4 essays plenty of time to do them. Bit of reading if you like sci fi its fine. The professor is a great guy really chilled. A very relaxed but rewarding class to do.",
    "I recommend this class if you are in to sci-fi novels and want help on your writing skills.",
    "English 115 01 is a class that explore the themes of literature regarding the future. In it, we read many science fiction works, but also classics like Plato's Allegory of the Cave. Even if you are not a scifi kind of person, I think this class can still be very enjoyable because the themes revealed in the class reflect ideas that are universal, and not just about the future.",
    "This is a perfect class if one is looking for a rewarding venture into literature. The workload was very manageable, and I feel that I have gained the most out of this class compared to my others, especially for the time invested."
