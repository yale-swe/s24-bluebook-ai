    "Fun overview of the history of Western medicine. You learn trends, important people\/places\/events, etc. Fine if you need a class in whatever distribution this fulfills.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student! This is a survey course about the history of western medicine from Hippocrates to the present day and did a fantastic job in outlining the major themes and trends in medicine and medical science. It was very fun and both my professor and TA were exceptional. I learned a lot about medicine and science and how we arrived at the present day conditions. I also just really enjoyed the course. If you are interested in medicine or science, take this course!",
    "Interesting course that will make you re-frame your perspective on medicine throughout history. Pretty light workload, though you get out what you put into it.",
    "Amazing class, eye opening, awesome topics, and very interesting! Definitely take it! It was a bit of a challenge, but I learned so much and do not regret taking this class at all.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone and describe it as an amazing history of medicine from ancient times to contemporary medicine. The readings are great and the content is surprising and fascinating.",
    "Terrible course. You probably won't learn anything new.",
    "A great overview of the history of western medicine.",
    "I am so glad Courtney started teaching this course this year! The history of Western medicine is such a cool topic that comes up again and again in conversations and debates today, and you will leave this class with a solid grasp of the major trends in medical history that got us to where we are today. I loved the diversity of the class lectures as well as the primary source readings we did. They were all meaningful, short, and easy to digest, and I left each week feeling like I had learned a hundred new things.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's relaxing, yet you will learn so much. Pre-meds should DEFINITELY take it. Learning about the history of medicine really makes you understand so much more about the medical profession and how it got to be the way it is today. It is an absolutely AMAZING class. Courtney is awesome, the TF's are great, and the readings are so, so interesting. Really one of the best classes I've taken here.",
    "It's a good intro course but is pretty superficila and cursory. It does not feel particularly engaging compared to Courtney's seminar settings.",
    "Great course! Interesting and not a lot of reading. Tests are very fair.",
    "Hard class",
    "Doctors and Patients is a really interesting class for anyone generally interested in the history of science and medicine or who is thinking about working in healthcare. The tests are fair, and the readings are not too long and really interesting. I actually enjoyed researching and writing the two essays. Definitely take it!",
    "Great class if you are into hi sorry of medicine. Very dense but you learn a lot and really have to know if.",
    "A wonderful survey course about the history of medicine from Hippocrates to Dr. Oz. While the class isn't much work, it does teach you a lot about the history of doctors and medical science and also how to study the history of medicine.",
    "I highly recommend this course. The amount of work is not too much, but it is very engaging and I learned a lot. This course was very interesting and highly enjoyable.",
    "This class is amazing! I really enjoyed Professor Thompson's lectures. The workload is definitely manageable (two short essays, a midterm, and a final).",
    "It's a great course - really engaging and interesting!",
    "Take it. It's not going to destroy you in terms of workload, and is really interesting. The essays are pretty broad in scope, so you can choose pretty much ~ a n y t h i n g ~ in the history of western medicine to talk about. That's a pretty sweet deal imho.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student."
