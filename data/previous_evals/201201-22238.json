   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to anyone genuinely interested in latin america. It helps, (but it isn't necessary)to speak spanish or to have a pretty good grounding in latin american history.",
    "This class is a fantastic review of post-colonial Latin American intellectual traditions and will help you to understand Latin America far better than many Latin American historycourses could. It is also a fantastic vehicle of introduction to Latin America for those who have little experience with the region. The class was definitely dominated by Latin Americans or students with Latin American ties. Discussion was difficult with some shining moments. Take the Spanish section if your Spanish is decent, it is a chance to go deeper with the texts in a more relaxed environment. (you also don't have to write the first paper if you regularly attend Spanish section!)",
    "Decent overview of some intellectual thought in Latin America. A lot of reading, very socialist and left-leaning, everyone feels the need to push the agenda of the particular country they come from. I probably wouldn't recommend.",
    "Take it! You realize that there are other ways to look at ours and other societies.",
    "If you have any interest in Latin America, you absolutely have to take this class. It has been amazing to spend a semester reading and discussing the debates that shape the continent from the Latin American perspective, rather than from the development\/poverty\/Cold War perspective that we usually get at Yale.Also, Moira is an incredible woman, and if youtake the class, you need to allow her to influence your life.",
    "Moira is a very knowledgeable professor, clearly very passionate about the subject, and incredibly willing to help out students who need it throughout the course. That said, I wish the class would have been based on the books we read a bit more. Often times the class would go off on tangents, or debate one tiny little sentence in the 300 page book for an hour and not get the chance to talk about the meaning of the work as a whole. Great class though! I HIGHLY recommend you take it if you're at all interested in Latin American thought, or if you just realize how much of our understanding of philosophy and history is based on Western ideology.",
    "This class surveys the great thinkers of Latin America. Some weeks there is a substantial amount of reading. If you do all of it, you will get so much more of the class. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in Latin America.",
    "Take 309 if you are interested in Radical Latin American Thought.",
    "No--it's terrible. I've never liked political philosophy and was taking this class to fulfill a requirement, but even the people in the class who did looked bored out of theirminds. The material is sort of interesting, but you need a lot of historical background to really get the most out of it, and most of the time not enough of that background was provided, creating the deadly situation of ignorance + apathy towards the material. Moira, although undeniably knowledgeable, is incredibly disorganized, to the point that it will drive you up the wall. Classes consisted mostly of someone asking a pointless question or bringing up a basically irrelevant point and then Moira and that person trying to clarify\/discuss that point for an hour, with neither side understanding the other. I don't think there's a single text that we really thoroughly analyzed. On the upside, Moira talks so much in class that you don't have to worry about awkward silences (and frankly, although I don't believe in professors dominating discussions, these sections were the most helpful because she actually provided genuine analysis of the material rather than the nonsense that usually came out of the class discussions).",
    "YES!",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in Latin American Political thought. Understand that there is a lot of reading, but that if you get through most of it you will truly gain a perspective on this part of the globe that you can't really get anywhere else. The faculty, Professor Fradinger and Brais, really make this course very interesting and the discussion is great."
