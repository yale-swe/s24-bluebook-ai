    "This is more a flourless torte than a course. Take it like a rich dessert after a fine meal and it'll go down easy.",
    "A low-stress class for the opera aficionado. Great for the musician who hasn't thought much about libretti. When I took this class there were lots of perspectives: I'm a music major and besides me we had a major each in architecture, psych, music, math, theater studies, and biology, plus one English grad student.",
    "There is no real point to this class, but you get to read a bunch of librettos\/ their original sources, and discuss how they are made into operas. The only graded work is a final paper. I found the class entertaining and I enjoyed reading the librettos, so I'd recommend it if you like opera (or want to get exposed to it). Prof mcclatchy also takes the class to a rehearsal at the met for free, and a backstage tour",
    "On the whole, I enjoyed this class. The reading list is great, and Professor McClatchy is super entertaining. You probably already know going into this class if you will enjoy it - it definitely requires a liking of opera, or at least an interest. Even when I hated the opera we were looking at (cough Gertrude Stein cough) I enjoyed class enough to make the reading worth it. My only complaint is that there is literally no guidance on the paper, which is rather harrowing\/stressful. It wasn't very clear exactly what the professor was looking for. But, I enjoyed the opera I wrote about, and was definitely interested in learning more about it."
