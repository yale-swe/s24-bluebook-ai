    "This is by far the best history seminar I have taken at Yale, and perhaps the best class I have taken at Yale overall. It is incredibly demanding work-wise... the readings for each week are substantial and the 25 page research paper at the end is daunting (make sure you start earlier than you think you need to!) - but it is so worth it for what you get out of this class. Blight is incredible; he is so interested and engaged in the thoughts and ideas of his students, and also has so many fascinating facts and stories and anecdotes to share. Definitely take this class if you can get in!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. The topic is so relevant to modern America it's a shame every student doesn't have the opportunity to read and discuss in this class. Blight is amazing, and aside from weekly reading and a 25 page final paper, it's only 2 papers over the course of the semester. History major or not, take this course if you get the chance. You won't regret it.",
    "Definitely take this course considering the events of the last year at Yale and at campuses around the country. The Civil War legacy is alive and well, and manifests itself in so many different ways, whether it's a Robert Penn Warren novel from the 1940s or Confederate reenactors in the present day.",
    "Really depends. Are you liberal? Do you like David Blight? Do you want to hear stories about the way that some remember the Civil War and shake your head in wonder? Take it!",
    "I would recommend Problems with American Historical Memory to another student. The readings are incredibly interesting and Professor Blight it a delight to learn from. The strength of the class definitely depends on the other students in it, and I was lucky enough to have a very talented group of people. Be forewarned though: the final term paper is 25-30 pages which is really a doozy come reading period.",
    "I would highly recommend this seminar. The readings were incredibly rewarding and very diverse, promising exciting class discussions. Professor Blights guidance while imagining and researching the final project made for a more dynamic writing experience and a more comprehensive final product. The topic was incredibly broad, meaning students were free to narrow in on an interest in the research project. At the same time, it was very pertinent to many current events, shedding new light on the news every day.",
    "An examination of historical memory as it relates to the Civil War. Take this course.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It's a historical grounding of race relations today, a great exploration of how societies reform after war, and a class full of GREAT readings. About much more than just the Civil War. You can write the paper on anything you like related to how the Civil War was remembered so we ended up with a wild variety of awesome topics. Great discussions, Professor Blight is awesome."
