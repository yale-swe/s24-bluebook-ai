    "I would definitely recommend it. I would describe it as teaching both broad and detailed information about neuroscience systems, which may mean that at times it is hard to keep up with, but I think this approach is necessary in order to appreciate the major systems of neuroscience as a whole and also in order to understand the inner workings of each. As a result, I would sooner recommend it to Psychology\/Neuroscience\/Biology majors, but I would (and do already!) recommend it to other majors just because I think it is very interesting.",
    "You read most Kandel and write biweekly reading responses. Every class you prepare two journal articles and discuss then (mostly going over the figures). A good general overview to brain systems. Very light on anatomy and cellular neuroscience.",
    "absolutely recommend to anyone interesting in neuroscience. Workload is very consistent and manageable throughout the semester and writing the term paper was very instructive.",
    "If you're interested in neuro, would recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student in the neuroscience tracts of psychology\/MCDB. While there is a lot of overlap between this course and neurobio, the difference between reading Kandel's textbook and the actual articles summarized in that textbook is huge. The focus is somewhat narrower in this course than neurobio, but even accounting for that narrowness, I felt I walked away from this course (vs. neurobio) with a much stronger working knowledge of the brain. Just know that there's no way to skate-by in this class. If you're not up for reading a lot each week\/for each class, there's no way you'll be able to get much about of it."
