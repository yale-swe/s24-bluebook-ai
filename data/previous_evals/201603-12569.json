    "Oh, so much! I came to this class feeling very uncomfortable about reading modern\/contemporary literature and theory. But you managed to deconstruct my phobia, as I have left this class with a huge interest in reading more modern works, and feel much more at ease with names that previously scared me (Heidegger\/Pynchon--you hear some pretty dark tales about how difficult those two are. They are all true, by the way.).",
    "I developed knowledge related to the topics of the course, including but not limited to sequence vs. simultaneity. As a book designer taking this class, I thoroughly enjoyed reading novels with a lens looking for the author's construction of timeit has allowed me to understand that books themselves are all unique constructions of time."

    "I loved the format -- the lecture and then discussion. I really appreciated having those weekly insights into various aspects of the course's theme, and felt that the lectures broadened my understanding of the readings we had done in really helpful ways. I also liked the idea of asking us to present on a work that we had *not* read for class--I learned a lot from my classmates, and had fun doing research for mine. Spending a long period of time reading Pynchon was daunting at first, but proved to be really helpful, and I did very much like being able to get into Gravity's Rainbow in such depth. All of the readings were so interesting--I want to read more Sam Delaney!",
    "Personally I would prefer more presentations by the professor instead of students, but only because the professor's work is so interesting. I did enjoy the student presentations, however, and it's a good way to learn everyone's interests."
