   "comments": [
    "I would recommend to people who like math.",
    "EENG 202 is a really great course. It covers very interesting topics and the teaching (on part of both Sekhar and Alp) is truly excellent. I highly recommend taking this class.",
    "It's intro to signals and systems. Any one with some math background will find all the material pretty manageable. This class also includes an introduction to Information Theory and Graph Theory, two invaluable fields for engineering. I would recommend it to any EE, CS or Applied Math major.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a basic information theory and signal processing course.",
    "Whether or not you are in an engineering major, this course gives a very good basic overview of how machines talk to each other electronically. If you are at all interested at understanding electronic communication, take this class. You will need a solid math background, but no previous knowledge about electronics. The problem sets are straightforward about 70% of the time. The labs are not very time consuming, and are worth doing. Participate in class if you can. If you need help, both the professor and TA are very good about scheduling time to help.",
    "It was a fun and really interesting course. It gives a great overview about how signals, communication systems, and computer learning. If you are EE than the course will give you a fun overview. I would recommend the course even if you are not in Electrical engineering as long as you have some math background.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all students interested in learning the basics of data transmission and routing over networks. Very interesting material!",
    "EE202 is a difficult introductory science course in which you get exposure to the many different steps of signal processing. I would not recommend it unless you are majoring in electrical engineering, since it is hard and a lot of work."
