    "I think that overall the course was pretty solid. A point for improvement might be related to try to expand some of the issue topics such as the development which has several sub-ares in it.",
    "Strength: The reading assignments helped me to understand the discussion among scholars not only about international organizations but also about broader topics of international relations, such as the theories of realism\/liberalism\/rationalism\/constructivism and the functions of international law. The class discussion provided me with critical perspectives on preceding studies. Weakness: She sometimes didn't upload the reading assignments on Canvas."

    "Yes I would. Even if a student is unfamiliar with theories of international relations, s\/he can understand the points at issue through the course."
