    "Professor Nakhimovsky is obviously very knowledgeable in his field and knows a lot about the books in the syllabus, but unfortunately this does not mean that he knows how to impart his knowledge and analyses to his section. Nor is he a good discussion leader; he doesn't channel the discussion into a meaningful conclusion, and he rarely responds to students' comments, which makes it a Herculean task to know what is right and what is wrong regarding the relevant text. And when he responds to a comment, it is usually in the form of a cynical disapproval, which was a big blow to my self-confidence in this course. Because you rarely come across a piece of sound analysis in the discussion, and because Prof. Nakhimovsky is for the most part silent and disapproving, this class became my least favorite and most tedious DS section. On the other hand, I greatly benefited from the individualised commentary he provided me with after each paper submission, and my writing and analysis skills significantly improved over the semester. Take this section only if you are a big fan of class discussions where people say anything they want without any regard to whether their comments contribute to others' understanding of the topic or not --apparently some students do have a preference for this kind of discussion environment. Yet, if you wish to learn from the professor instead of your fellow students, I would strongly suggest you to shop other sections.",
    "Yes",
    "Hard, lots of reading, worthwhile."
