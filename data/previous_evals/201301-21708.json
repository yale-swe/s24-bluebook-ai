    "This is a great class if you have an interest in child development or teaching, or just being an effective parent (too soon?). There is a 2 hour seminar and, in addition, a 2 hour observation each week at the Calvin Hill Day care center, which is a significant time commitment if you factor in the transit time (you definitely want to factor in shuttle rides in the morning before 9:25 or you will have some cold, miserable, uphill treks). That being said if you're willing to put in that time, the class is really rewarding. The teachers are wonderfully nice and supportive and provide interesting insights from their personal experiences, and Calvin HIll is a great place! Workload is light but you still feel like you leave with valuable knowledge at the end of the semester!",
    "If you plan on working with children, having a child, living in a society that has children in it, or especially if you plan on voting about issues that effect children, please for the love of god take this class.My only caveat is this: if you get a slot in the class, DO NOT DROP IT AFTER A MONTH. There are not enough education courses here and there are many people dying to take this class. Don't be disrespectful.",
    "This course is a lot of fun, very different from most Yale courses. You learn a lot just from seeing early childhood education in action, though the class sessions can feel disjointed at times. Do be aware that the journals can take a bit of time, and though people rate this as low workload, going to the daycare past the Div School for 2 hours every week means that it takes up a lot of your time."
