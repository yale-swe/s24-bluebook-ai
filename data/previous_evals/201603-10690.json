   "comments": [
    "In this English 114 class, I learned how to integrate my opinion into a paper with expert opinions. Instead of merely summarizing the others and including my own perspective, I had to think about how to weave my ideas throughout the paper and to do more than just summarize an experts opinion. Instead, I was forced to create a hypothetical conversation and think about what I would be able to contribute to that conversation. Furthermore, I learned how to make my ideas and paragraphs flow better in a lengthier paper. Before the class, I thought I had a pretty sufficient understanding of this, but the class helped me further these skills and take them to the next level.",
    "I learned how to structure my writing more effectively and clearly. I also learned how to be more concise in my writing.",
    "This course significantly improves writing, tests the boundaries of your thoughts and challenges you to compete with yourself.",
    "I learned how to improve my writing and critically think of how the media has changed in this new digital age. It was very interesting to take this class during election season because we could always take examples from the news and that made it easier to understand what was happening.",
    "Through English 114, I got a comprehensive look at not just the subject matter of the course (the relationship between democracy and the media), but also the skills required for successful college writing in any course. While the readings were enjoyable and interesting (I learned a lot), I also liked how the class built upon writing skills as the course progressed. Starting with how to deconstruct an author's argument, adding our own novel position to the argument in various readings, and learning how to write my first research paper, English 114 definitely gave me lots of knowledge about how to approach these various tasks. Also, the in-class discussions furthered my ability to critically analyze text and discuss them with others.",
    "This course, Democracy and the Media, challenged me to think critically and argue clearly and concisely in the active voice. I gained confidence in my diction and my writing style as I wrote essays that evaluated the media's role in defending our democracy and right to free expression. I loved engaging with the theme because it had both historical applications to what the media is defined as (ex: Habermasian public sphere, the Fourth Estate), and we would then use these conceptual precedents on current events of our choosing.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the biggest strength is the personal attention that comes from a class of around ten students. Professor Carlacio only had nineteen or so students total, so she was able to meet with each student outside of class for each paper, in addition to any time that a student requested a one on one meeting. This is clearly a huge time commitment, and it was super helpful. Additionally, we got lots of feedback on each paper, so we were able to understand how to improve for the next one. Perhaps the biggest weakness was class time. I think that often we spent the class time focusing on something that was only applicable to a few people in the room. Unfortunately, I am not quite sure how to change this.",
    "Strengths: The one-to-one attention was extremely helpful. The discussions and debates furthered my understanding of the material and made me more confident when writing about the material. I enjoyed the subject matter of the course and engaging with diverse viewpoints.",
    "The many papers allowed for continual improvement, which benefitted me across courses. The rough drafts were especially important to development.",
    "The strengths are that the course prepares you for writing assignments in other classes because you learn a lot on how to structure and write essays. Maybe it could be improved by not having that many assignments.",
    "I think one of the core strengths of this class is how it integrates an interesting focus topic with basic fundamental writing skills. It did not feel so much as a writing intensive seminar, but rather a class where I was exposed to a subject I had interest in and used writing to further my comprehension of the material. Another strength was the structure of the paper assignments since each paper seemed to build upon the skills gained from the previous assignment. Also, I liked how the research paper was broken down into chunks, making it more digestible for students like myself who had never received such an assignment before. A weakness of the class would be that while we were taught some of the skills from various course books (i.e. The Craft of Research), I found that this was less effective than actually seeing how they appeared in my writing and working on applying these skills. Reading about how to properly construct an introduction or conclusion from a book did not seem particularly useful.",
    "I think a strength of the class was the freedom we had in exploring topics that we were interested in. I was able to apply the tools we learned in class to a research paper and Ted-Talk assignment which were both case studies of my choosing. It truly felt like a specialization of my education. If there were any weaknesses, they would have strictly been caused by the natural time constraint of the semester. I would have liked to do more in-class discussions of our own papers and more in-person peer reviews that could be constructive learning experiences for all participants.",
    "Strength: Lots of very interesting discussion. Weakness: A lot of things to cover in the semester, so felt a bit rushed."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class if you do not feel completely confident in your writing skills. However, if you think that you have had a sufficient writing education, you could probably skip this class. It was very interesting, but I think that the assignments were at slightly lower level than I had expected.",
    "Yes, it helped me become more confident in my writing abilities, helped me to be more concise, and helped me to structure my writing better.",
    "If you feel that your academic writing could use improvement, this course could greatly benefit your organizational and writing skills that will help you in classes to come. I would strongly encourage this course.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Professor Carlacio is an excellent professor. She is always willing to help you out and she gives you feedback on all of your assignments.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially for freshmen. Going into your first year of college, you never know what standard of writing is expected at the collegiate level (no matter your background). This is a great course to set everyone up to be at the same level (in terms of experience) and to hone your argumentative and writing skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Not only did it develop my skills as a well-refined writer, which I can use and apply in other courses in the future, but it also had an eye-opening historical theme that is relevant to all of our lies and the many social problems within our world. This course left me confident and empowered to work toward a brighter future.",
    "It would depend on their previous knowledge and previous writing experience. For someone who knows nothing about the media and democracy, then this class would be transformative. Equally, if someone is not comfortable writing university level papers, then this class would prove to be useful"
