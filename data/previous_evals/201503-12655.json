   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you are interested in Political Science with an urban perspective take this class. You will learn theory and foundations and then transition into more current situations where you will be able to utilize all that theory that you just learned. It's very practical and efficient. If you've never taken a Poli Sci class it can seem daunting at first, but it gets better and you can bring whatever outside information from different schools of thought into the fray, especially for the other students who may only know Political Science.",
    "The class is not easy, but if you are interested in urban politics it is a must.",
    "If you're interested in cities, poverty, equality, diversity, etc. etc. and aren't only interested in concrete policy conversations, but find theory (which informs the policies) also interesting, this is a great class! Professor Horan really commits to each of her students and the conversations generate a lot of great content",
    "Class was a lot more based in political theory than I expected, especially in the first 4 weeks or so while we were going over the political frameworks. Even though we looked at some case studies during these weeks, our discussion of them was mainly driven by their implications for these frameworks. Things got way less abstract once we started looking at the policy issues (urban regions, policing, and New Orleans). And the theory helped to evaluate these issues, so ultimately I think it was useful. Overall, an interesting class taught by a great professor. Would recommend if you're interested in political science and theories of urban government.",
    "This class is challenging, but rewarding. If you want to understand urban politics and policy, this class does not disappoint! The papers are very long and time-consuming, but at the end, it all feels worth it.",
    "Pretty standard poli sci seminar--the papers are kind of hard, but doable if you have drafts read and go talk to Professor Horan. You get an overall sense of urban policy which was nice and I can say I walked out of the class knowing a lot more about that than I did when I walked in. Take it!",
    "Urban Politics and Policy is a fantastic class if you're truly interested in learning about urban governments and how they function. It's not for the faint of heart, though- the amount of articles read each week and the two page reading responses are a lot of work, but they're completely worth it because you learn so much about cities and how they function. There are two papers a semester, and they can seem difficult at first because they are less one cohesive paper and more of 3-4 short essays on similar topics combined into one lengthy paper. Professor Horan reads drafts, though, and she's helpful in making sure that the paper is going as it should.",
    "No I would not recommend this class to another student. It takes up too much time, for very little reward.",
    "Pedagogically, this is a solid course at Yale. It's a great course for political science majors and those with a specific interest in cities. The course is very theoretical, and the readings can be challenging. I wouldn't take this course if you're just looking for a cursory overview of how politics work in cities or if you're looking to read up on some pressing issues that cities face. This is a demanding course and Professor Horan is very particular about what she is looking for, so if you aren't able to engage fully with the materials then you may struggle. The first half of the course is dedicated to building a theoretical framework for analyzing politics in cities. The second half is markedly more practical, yet you will need to have a strong command of the previously covered frameworks in order to engage in class discussions, weekly reading comments, and essays. Both the midterm and final were challenging, but if you are dedicated then you can earn a fair grade in this course. Professor Horan is very accessible for office hours, and I recommend that you meet with her early on in the course if you're having any trouble at all.",
    "Excellent class if you want to learn how to analyze urban political phenomenon. The reading is extensive and somewhat theoretical but theory grounds the policy analysis you do at the end of the course. Highly recommend to anyone interested in urban studies.",
    "This is a really challenging course, but exactly what you need if you want more than a surface level understanding of urban policy. Through the analysis of several frameworks, you are able to better understand the motivations behind certain policies and get a better sense of why things are implemented one way or another. Don't b.s. this class, but take it if you want to be challenged and pushed to a better understanding of urban policy.",
    "Highly recommend this class to anyone interested in urban policy, domestic policy more broadly, or anyone who thinks they might live in a city. Professor Horan is a great seminar leader, but does expect a lot from her students including 1-2 page reading responses each week, two challenging 10-page papers, and leading a class discussion with several classmates. Nonetheless, it is totally worth it, and this is one of the most rewarding classes that I have had during my time at Yale. Even if you are not very interested in urban policy, this class will give you great perspectives that will change the way you look at so many aspects of cities and politics more broadly.",
    "An incredible class that I think everyone should take. Professor Horan is strict but effective and brilliant. It is a lot of work with a lot of reading but it is worth it."
