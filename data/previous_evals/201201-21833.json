    "Yes, but make sure that you know exactly what you are turning in when. The strength of this course really lies in who you choose as your academic advisor, second reader, etc! Choose wisely!",
    "I would recommend taking the semester long independent research project because it gives you freedom to engage in material that is specifically interesting to you within your major.",
    "A lot more work than you think, considering you have no class. Helpfl to learn how to write a long essay, and I loved my advisories but i would probably have done my essay as part of another course, if I did it again.",
    "I hope underclassmen look forward to the Anthropological Senior Essay from the day they enter the major. It is a truly rewarding experience, unlike any other project you encounter in your Yale career."
