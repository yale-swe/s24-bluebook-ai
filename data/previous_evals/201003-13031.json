    "There's a lot of random assignments in this class, not all of which are helpful or even necessary to complete. Be prepared for a lot of work each week.Professor DeVos is a wonderful instructor. She's very warm and encouraging, which is helpful in a class where no one wants to speak for fear of showcasing how bad their French really is.",
    "good class overall. grammar review is helpful. texts are interesting, movies are entertaining. workload is manageable--so nice to have class 3x week instead of 5x.",
    "a well rounded class that really helped my french skills. my speaking and writing really improved. the books we read were interesting and we basically talked about them in class as well as went over grammar homework. it's a pretty standard french class and a natural step after L4.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it if you want to improve your reading, writing, auditive comprehension, and speaking in French. Overall it is a nice introduction to advanced French. However, not all the texts and films are very interesting in my view so be prepared. Nevertheless, it is still very useful.",
    "I would summarize French 150 as an exploration through some French stories and plays while also working to improve writing, speaking and grammatical skills.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed French 150, it was an excellent extension of French 140. The topics, films, and literature covered were both interesting and authentic and led to compelling class discussions. The class offered the occasion to not only increase fluency through speaking but also to enhance writing skills through the biweekly essay prompts."
