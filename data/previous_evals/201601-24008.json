   "comments": [
    "Taking one of Lussier's classes will really grow your perspective on climate change, science communication, and general communication. It's also great to get to work on real, meaningful projects. I'd recommend one class to anyone, but be prepared for some frustratingly overboard dialogue that can get repetitive. Definitely take one of his classes, but I'm not sure if I would want to take several.",
    "This is a course about network theory and collective intelligence, not really science communication. Although the course applies these theories to climate change communication, you'll spend a lot of time learning obscure theories about chaos and other things that don't seem immediately relevant. Eventually, you might learn how they are relevant, but the course tries to squeeze so many complicated theories into each week, it's hard to really grasp them and be able to apply them. The projects are really cool ways to work with real organizations, but they are disorganized and very stressful. The content of this class is important, but you'll have to put in some work to dig it out.",
    "If you're trying to save the world, you have to take this class.",
    "Absolutely positively . Not just a environmental class but a life class . Will totally utterly flip your life and craft meaning into it",
    "Absolutely do not take this class. Most stressful class at Yale. The projects are unique, incredible experiences, but they're so disorganized and expectations are really unclear. While Paul's ideas are revolutionary and important and have the potential to be so impactful, I found that his teaching and the class structure stood in the way of my learning.",
    "This class will change the way you think about climate change and global systems in general. I think everyone should take this course, as the ideas within it will be critical in structuring a future with climate change. What you get out of this course is definitely what you put in!",
    "The class goes over very interesting and important concepts in communications and sociology frameworks. I would fully recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about how to effectively communicate to various audiences using different frameworks, values, and strategies - even if it's not related to climate change.",
    "This is a course to teach you a new philosophy on how to communicate. To sum up: we often try to convince people of our own values. While this works in simple issues, when building a large-scale change network, we cannot resort to these measures. How then? Heuristics. What are heuristics? Take the course.",
    "If you're super interested in any of the projects I'd say take it'",
    "I loved this class. Although it's fast paced, you learn a lot of material and never feel left behind as long as you keep up with the readings. Paul's a fantastic engaging professor who made this class so enjoyable. I recommend taking the fall course first, however, as this semester is network theory based and it certainly helps to have the language and knowledge from the first semester.",
    "I highly recommend EVST 312 if you are frustrated by the climate change action gap and interested in climate change communication strategies. The lectures and readings primarily focus on abstract theory, which at times can seem a little wishy washy, but you will also have the opportunity to apply theory to practice through real stakeholder projects. Paul is a very inspiring lecturer and caring instructor. Even if you are skeptical of some of his claims, you can learn a tremendous amount from what he has done and what he has to say. As a fair warning, sometimes the jargon of the class can be frustrating and the eloquence of other students intimidating. Sometimes it sounds like people are just stringing together fancy words devoid of meaning. But there is real substance to the theory and language in this class. It just takes time and practice to understand it. In summary, there are a lot of cool learning opportunities in this class, but you have to know what you want and take initiative."
