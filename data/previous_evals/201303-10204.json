    "This class is exactly what the title announces it is: the development of a queer aesthetic in the avant-garde experimental film of the post-WWII period. The material covered in the class starts around 1946 and ends in 1968. You really get to see the evolution of how queerness was explores as both an aesthetic and a subject. The reading is really helpful in giving context\/ theoretical vocabulary (also a lot of times really fun) A 7-page midterm paper and a 10 page final paper or creative project.",
    "By all means, take this class! Ron Gregg is a god among men, to be sure. I had never taken a film class before, and despite its oddly specific content, Postwar Queer Avant-Garde Film actually served as a great introduction to film studies for me. Of course, this is also a great class for film buffs; some of the experimental shorts we watched on 16mm at the Monday night screenings haven't been digitized, and they might never be. I'm a WGSS major, and I definitely found it helpful to have some grounding in queer history and theory, but that's by no means necessary. There's very little work, and it's a lot of fun: just weekly free-form responses to the films (RG wants you to spend like 10 minutes on these), a 7 page midterm paper, and a final 10-12 page paper OR creative project accompanied by a 4-5 page paper.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone. It is a niche subject, but if you are interested enough in experimental film to slog through the early trance films, it is an incredibly rewarding experienceand a rigorous intellectual exercise, presented with fantastic guidance, knowledge, and support.",
    "Yes.",
    "A survey of avant garde films from WW2 until today. Some are really good. Others are strange -- even boring. But all are interesting in some way. You should take if you have a serious interest in film."
