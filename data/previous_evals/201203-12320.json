    "I'd recommend the course for students who are interested in the material. They have to be inquisitive and willing to speak up in class. They also have to be prepared to debate or at least make good arguments for their statements. This isn't a class for someone who wants to relax and have a teacher talk at them.I wouldn't recommend the course to someone who desires an incredibly engaging professor. Personally, I liked Professor Donahue's style, but I know he might not be for everybody. He doesn't have a booming voice or crazy hand gestures. He's just a relatable guy who's interested in the course material. It seems to get his engines revving, but not to a ridiculous degree.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody. It has nothing whatsoever to do with my major but it was very rewarding.",
    "The material in this class is definitely not for everyone, but I thought it was worth taking because it gave a good overview of some of the intersections between political theory and economics.",
    "This class is not about democratic theory, which was misleading from the course description. There are a few readings that raise democratic concerns, but it mostly focuses on social choice theory. If you're interested in proofs, logic, and voting methods, this is right up your alley. The reading load is very light, which is both good and bad. The light reading load partly means that students aren't really prepared to talk about the significance of an author's argument, because they really don't get enough context. Donahue does his best I think, but overall class is very slow-paced which is both good and bad at times. If you're only interested in the political theory side of things, like me, then you might want to take something else because this course is probably not what you think it is."
