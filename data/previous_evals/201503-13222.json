   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course provides a strong foundation in environmental health sciences. Dr. Deziel is a great lecturer and goes out of her way to make herself available to help students. The course material can seem a little negative sometimes and make you wonder what, exactly, you can do to promote a healthier environment. The biggest weakness of the class is its size. With a big lecture, it's difficult to have a conversation about these important topics. I know the course is required, so it might never happen, but had the class been more of a seminar, I think people would have engaged more with the material.",
    "While I understand the challenge of attempting to cover a wide variety of material in a survey course, the course content was rudimentary at best. This way the course was managed, especially with the use of pop quizzes, felt like a return to high-school.",
    "This is the worst course that I have ever taken at Yale. Strengths: midterms are graded timely. learning objectives are clear and helpful. Weaknesses: 1. slides are incomplete (intentionally) 2. lectures are terrible and not engaging 3. homework format is somehow naive - it's more like a training of our reading and writing abilities, while this course focus on our scientific sense 4. pop quiz is a terrible way to keep people coming to class. 5. too many guest lectures - and the guest lectures usually have even worse lectures and slides. 6. I don't see any point of teaching those genetic and biochemistry stuff in this course - this is an introduction course!!",
    "To be honest, I did not learn a lot in class even though there were many assignment. The material is too broad to learn any deep things about public. And the slides were too wordy and it's too much things to reveal for final.",
    "I felt like I was in a high school course. Its all about memorization and I don't feel like I learned applicable skills, although I did learn some interesting facts about environmental health. I did not think the guest lecturers were well integrated into the course. They often went into depth about things that were outside the scope of the class and were hard to understand unless you had a basic science background (thank good I did or else my eyes would have glazed over). The final paper was a good assignment. I felt like I got to use information I had learned in the class. One of the assignments was basically asking to summarize a journal, and I did not understand the purpose of that. If the class wants to reward attendance I think clickers are a good way to do that, but I was not sure how pop quizzes were being graded and I do not think they helped me learn any more.",
    "It is very high-level, which is great, but I wish it would have gone deeper in key concepts instead of covering so much content at such a basic level.",
    "Good teaching, but basic material.",
    "It's a general course that covers all the different aspects of environmental health.",
    "this course should be named as Introduction instead of Principle. The topics included in this course are too broad and too much knowledge needed to be remembered. There is no skilled gained from this course because the knowledge itself is too simple and only thing you need to study this course is to recite. What we really would like to learn is a kind of skill, for example, how could we conduct risk assessment, basic methodologies. The courses for graduate students should be based on the general simple knowledge and focus more on the professional skills.",
    "I think that there is too much material to cover and I would have preferred to have less topics but with a deeper explanation. The first part of the course was good. In the second part, even when the topics were more interesting, I feel that I lose the connection between classes and I saw that many people were not paying attention. In order to improve the course, I will complement the clases with articles from the news or videos (the ones that we saw were good).And I will mix the intructor's lectures with the researcher's lectures. Some of the researcher's lectures were too specific and required a background that i did not have to understand them. Maybe having the learning objectives at the beginning of the class would help.",
    "It was alright. Definitely some improvements can be made. Specifically, I liked that there weren't too many hw assignments. But the grading distribution was a little odd. In addition, I would have preferred to communicate all assignments via dropbox online, rather than print them.",
    "good.",
    "Interesting and necessary subject, covering a wide range of current topics.",
    "It's nice that this course provides an broad overview of the topics in Environmental Health.",
    "I do not care for Environmental Health, and having to take this class did not change my opinion on it.",
    "Deziel makes an interesting subject REALLY not interesting. Lectures were dry as chalk, and recited at us. It's an introductory course, sure, but there are ways to make the material more engaging, right? Ask Abbie Friedman for suggestions???",
    "The course felt very basic, and I'm not sure I got much out of it. If this is going to continue being a required class, it would be nice to get a little more out of it.",
    "This class is a giant waste of time - everything is in the lecture notes. I think purposefully leaving out details so people show up in class is a very ineffective way to get people to learn; if the lecture is more engaging, people show up.",
    "This class is a very elementary introduction to environmental health, presented in a way that is more adequate for a middle school classroom than a graduate level class at Yale.",
    "The course itself was fine I think. covered a variety of the topics. instructor was poor.",
    "Strengths - lecture materials are interesting. Weaknesses -Guest lecturers are unnecessarily focused on data. While some data are useful during lectures to emphasize certain points, the professor should keep in mind that this is an introductory course that provides an overview of environmental health as an academic field. As a result, I found guest lectures largely unhelpful in terms of learning the core objectives and fulfilling my environmental health requirement. -This course also feels like a high school class or an undergrad freshman course for couple reasons. 1) Lots of assignments are very short and worth only a few percentage of the overall grade. This may seem like a good thing because it gives ample opportunities for students to \"redeem\" themselves if they do poorly on one assignment. However, given the fact that they are so short (i.e., our final paper was 500 words), it is really hard to produce quality work--or even care about the assignments themselves because they are around 10%. 2) All of the grading details and criteria make the assignments seem like a standardized written test from grade school. This course should help us think about environmental health issues and properly express our ideas, not provide a list of things we should have in our papers to get a good grade. 3) The emphasis on lecture attendance is overwhelming to a point where I feel like the professor might as well just take attendance. Having random pop quizzes and intentionally leaving out too many key information in lecture slides harbors frustration and even anger in students rather than incentivizing them to attend lectures. I understand that environmental health is very important to the professor, but she also needs to understand that most students taking this course are from other departments interested in other areas of public health. Shoving down students' throat that they need to care about this course and that they will be penalized if they miss a lecture seems like a high school class. I sometimes wondered if the professor is just \"out to get us\" or actually want us to learn the materials.",
    "Interesting course content, but often times we tried to go over too much at one time so there wasn't enough time to cover everything. During the second half a significant number of lectures were guest lecturers, which are fine, but it was confusing what details we were supposed to get from the lecturers.",
    "Strengths: Good overview of the environmental health and good to have guest lectures present their topic of expertise. Weaknesses: The grading can be inconsistent at times. Additionally, there were no rubrics given for assignments in the first half of the course. Even when there was a rubric, assessment was unclear or points were taken off for minute details unrelated to the course topics and material.",
    "a lot of things to overview but most of them cannot be explained. Probably the contents are too much.",
    "The course only give basic common sense information on a broad scope of topic. Which is of not much use.",
    "Some of the guest lectures seemed not very relevant.",
    "very good",
    "The only reason any one takes environmental health is because it is required. The course is very dry and uninteresting. While the guest lecturers were interesting, they were kind of random and their lectures were difficult to get the material needed for the exams.",
    "Strengths: it's easy, it does give you a sense of the breadth of the environmental health field Weaknesses: I think there's a lot of things Dr. Deziel could improve about her presentation style. She said um and like a lot. More than even my classmates do when they give presentations. She also has this nervous laugh that kind of makes me cringe. It's clear that she often doesn't feel uncomfortable at the podium. (Dr. Deziel if you're reading this- don't feel too bad about this- I really felt for you because I get nervous public speaking too- but I think it may be helpful for you to have this information) Content wise: her lectures were often at too low a level for graduate students. (E.g. explaining the water cycle). In contrast, the lectures given by guest speakers were at too high a level and I often had trouble following them. My suggestions would be: re-work presentation so less reading off the slides, cover fewer topics but provide a little bit more depth. Maybe before a guest speaker comes in, provide a little introduction to the presentation the class before or remind the guest lecturer that many of the students in the class don't have much of a chemistry background.",
    "Overall, this was a good intro class to environmental health. I feel like I really understand the basics about a broad range of environmental health issues and have learned guidelines about risk and exposure assessment so that I can form opinions and draw conclusions about these types of pubic health issues. Weaknesses: it was at 8:30am; would have appreciated more feedback on papers",
    "I don't think this course was engaging or taught super well. I gained some helpful knowledge but nothing I couldn't have taught myself.",
    "Overall, I came out of the class learning a lot of different things about environmental health that I didn't have previous knowledge of. A lot of people consider this class to be an easy-peasy class and while the workload is less than some of the other classes I've taken at YSPH, it is definitely not a joke of a class. There was a reasonable amount of work that was involved and I felt like I actually had the opportunity to learn without being bogged down by busy work that is characteristic of some other classes.",
    "I learned a lot from this class. However, I think that having many different guest lecturers made the class kinda of choppy and although the lectures were interesting, some of the guest lecturers presented the information in a confusing way. The work load is definitely manageable and the class is relatively easy overall.",
    "I enjoyed when Dr. Deziel brought in speakers to lecture on their specific areas of research or interest. I thought the course was most interesting when we went over specific examples and was weakest when we only went over a broad summary of the topic.",
    "This course was much less challenging compared to others at YSPH and did not feel up to par with the rigor I've come to expect even in other introductory courses. Lectures also could have been more engaging (though part of this was probably the 8:30am course time).",
    "For such a huge topic, I think this course did a good job of teaching the basics. Sometimes the guest lecturers were confusing and I did not like the pop quizes because it felt like there only purpose was to take attendance and there could have been a more fair way to do attendance if that is in fact what Dr. D. cared about.",
    "I found this class to be a difficult compliment to the rest of my coursework, primarily because it was not relevant to my field.",
    "While I enjoyed this class overall, I did not like the fact that just about half of the lectures after the midterm were taught by guest lecturers. This made it more difficult to study for the final because a majority of the notes provided by the guest lecturers were scarce.",
    "I like the topics covered, but the depth was too basic",
    "Loved the material! Great guest lectures",
    "Interesting and well developed contents",
    "The professor seemed unprepared and her lectures lack clear organization. Too many guest lectures irrelevant to class topic.",
    "It would be great if the guest lecturers could be spread out throughout the semester, rather than mainly scheduled for the end.",
    "Strengths - Interesting course material and has made me think about my choices (ie. water usage, waste, electricity) - Good mark distribution so that the midterms and final are not worth a ridiculous amount - Fair midterm and final. The learning objectives were very helpful, and I felt that you had to study to be able to answer most of the questions, but you also didn't have to memorize every detail. Weaknesses - USAGE OF PAPER!! For an environmental course, I was shocked that we still had to hand in hard copy versions of our homeworks, especially for the final paper since the journal article could have been up to 15 pages. I recommend using the Classes V2 dropbox function in the future. - The clickers. What were they for? Pop quizzes could be done via clickers (we just need to register our clicker) and you can see our responses and take attendance that way. The paper usage for the pop quizzes was wasteful. - The first half of the lectures were really well done, but the second half seemed more disorganized. The guest lectures presented a good opportunity for different perspectives, but perhaps learning objectives should be given to presenters so that they can build their presentations around what we should be learning, rather than the other way around. Otherwise, when we are listening to the guest lecturers speak, we don't know what we should be taking away and how it is relevant to the course. - The course material itself could be more challenging. It feels like we cover a lot of subjects very broadly, but never really go in depth into the material. Ex: we learn the steps of waste water treatment, but we don't know why nor what is happening exactly at each step.",
    "Overall, I think the class did a good job of teaching the required core material, and I left the class with a better appreciation about my environmental impact and environmental influences on health. I think that content-wise the class was good. The second half of the semester did seem a bit more disjointed. Guest lectures are definitely useful, but I think just delineating some sort of road map before all the guest lectures start would be helpful. A few notes on how the class was run thoughI did feel a bit like we were treated like high schoolers (or younger) in this class. I understand that you want people to pay attention in class and it seemed like blank slides, clickers and pop quizzes were ways to help accomplish that. While I do like the idea of clickers for fostering discussion or checking in on peoples understanding, I wasnt the biggest fan of the blank slides and pop quizzes. I generally do not take notes on the slides themselves so it was later a surprise for me when I was going through the slides and there were blank spaces. Also, I felt like the pop quizzes detracted from class time, and only seemed to serve as a proxy for attendance, which doesnt seem necessary. One final note: this was the only class this semester where I was required to turn in paper copies of assignmentsironic for an environmental class. I understand that organizing such a large class can be difficult, but I do think that many assignments could be submitted electronically and save some paper!",
    "I think it's difficult to fit all the material into one short semester intro course, but Dr. Deziel did a great job in providing an appropriate overview. I certainly learned more than I expected, and I enjoyed the class discussions.",
    "The fact that on the first day of class, the professor announced that she would be doing pop quizzes to make sure you showed up for class gives you all you need to know how little mutual respect she gives her students. I know it's at 8:30 and I know it's a intro survey class that a lot of people have to take, but she should not let her ego drive her teaching of the class. The material can be interesting at times, but she has a habit of reading straight off the slides, which detracts from actually paying attention. But on the plus side, the class is painfully rote and straightforward.",
    "Professor simply read the material that was on the slides off, didn't really create an incentive to come to class, the guest lectures were also not very engaging. I ended up teaching myself the course material before the midterm and final. It is disappointing because the course had the ability to be very interesting and informative (great topics) but the delivery fell short. the assignments were fine, nothing very challenging. I thought that the first assignment where we had to calculate NOAEL and LOAEL was the one I learned the most from. Most of the assignments did not feel like graduate student level assignments and the exams were mostly just regurgitation of facts, no critical thinking",
    "Strengths: Dr. Deziel did try to cover a wide breadth of topics over the duration of the course, and the broad overview was definitely helpful for those of us who do not have a background in environmental health. Weaknesses: The course did not present the information in a way that allowed students to engage with it. I felt as though I was given slides and slides of facts, dates, or numbers when I should have been learning concepts and ideas about how EHS impacts public health. The exams were focused on minutia from the slides and I did not feel that they best represented student's understandings of the environmental underpinnings of the health-based issues we study.",
    "Interesting topics discussed. Suffers from many of the same issues that SBS suffers from. For course so broad in scope, I think it would be helpful to avoid going into so much detail within each topic - I don't think that knowing the structure of chemicals is all that helpful and distracts from other relevant material.",
    "the strength in this course comes from its breadth, yet that is also its greatest weakness. each week covers a different topic and all we end up learning is basic information on the issues. the best lectures are generally guest lectures - see enviornmental justice lecutre",
    "I thought the course was a decent to good introduction to environmental health. A lot of material was covered over the course which made it difficult to grasp anything but basic knowledge of the subject matter. I would have like to see perhaps a bit more depth about climate change, environmental justice, and some topics that are a bit more at the forefront of the public health arena.",
    "The course and its material felt like a very expensive game of trivia. Overall, I would argue the lectures were esoteric and would have been much more beneficial if it were to have focused on larger themes, assessments and public health tools or knowledge applicable to real world application. My hope for this course was to learn about the current state of the world from an environmental health perspective, focusing on both the successes and failures of public health practitioners while simultaneously preparing us to understand and address these issues in our careers.",
    "EHS is an incredibly important subject, and Dr. D does her best to engage us, but this class still ends up most people's last priority. To be fair, I think it has to do with this (and SBS) being such a broad survey course and with fewer hard skills incorporated than Epi or Biostats. Maybe if we did more risk assessment or enviro epi? It would be nice to reorganize the class around a few big themes, going more in depth on a few topics rather than trying to spend one lecture on each topic. But I don't know, maybe the SPH accreditation people frown on that. Finally, the 8:30am time slot is pretty brutal if you're not a morning person, and having attendance\/quizzes at the beginning of class can actually be counterproductive. If I wake up late and I know I won't make it in time for a possible quiz, I don't have any motivation to go at all. If the quiz were in the middle (or maybe occurring at a random time between 10 minutes after class starts and 10 minutes before class ends), people would be more motivated to come (even if they are late) and stay for the entire class.",
    "Great introduction course that covered very relevant information in environmental health. Strength: Professor did a great job bringing awareness to current environmental health issues that are discussed in the media today. Although these issues are discussed in the media, it is always vague. I loved how the professor went into detail explaining the processes and effects of an issue. The professor is very approachable inside and outside of class if anyone has questions regarding the material. She does a great job making the class fun and relevant, especially at 8:30AM in morning. Weakness: Too many guest speakers toward the 2nd half of the semester. Would be nice if they were evenly spaced out between the 1st half and 2nd half, but I understand that it depends on their available dates.",
    "This class should truly begin with the Environmental Justice lecture. That is the most relevant to the majority of the students sitting in Winslow. It was the only time I felt like what I was learning was obviously relevant to me. I would have put the entire class in a different light and enjoyed it much more had I had that lecture the very first week.",
    "Overall, the course provided a good overview of environmental health. I would have loved to dive a little deeper into some of the topics as well as have the opportunity to engage in discussions about the topics. I really enjoyed the majority of the lectures, however some of the guest lecture topics were heavy science and a little confusing.",
    "Strengths: Covers a wide range of environmental topics that are interesting and relevant to public health. I enjoyed the guest lectures to hear about work and experiences from various professors. The class motivated me to be more conscious of my environmental impact, and makes me want to get involved in environmental health work. The climate change lecture was really moving. Interesting and useful assignments\/exams. Weaknesses and suggestions: I've heard a lot of students say this, and I have to agree; the class uses a lot of paper for being an environmental health class, so I suggest submitting and returning homework assignments using dropbox on classesv2 and using the clickers for pop quizzes instead of paper. And use the clickers more often in class, this died down about half-way through the semester.",
    "Good slides to refer back to.",
    "Weaknesses: I disliked the pop quizzes and did not think they were appropriate for a graduate level course. Strengths: I liked the final writing assignment. Some of the lecture topics were also interesting.",
    "This courses offers no useful skills nor in depth knowledge. All I learned from the course is that we gotta protect the environment, which I have already learned years ago. Please do not make this course a mandatory one in the future. A lot of us would not show up for the class if not for the pop quiz. The information covered in the course is very random, a lot of common sense material too. It is nice to read about this information, but to make it worth the tuition that I pay for this program, it is very unlikely.",
    "Could have been more interactive and less slide based",
    "The course is true to its title of being introductory. It provides a very wide array of environmental health topics. Though no one topic is examined deeply, but I think that is to be expected. In fact I enjoyed this aspect of the course because I was introduced to concepts I didn't realize I would enjoy. I appreciated the time of the course (love AM classes) and the fact that there was no discussion section-- wasn't necessary with Dr. D's incorporation of discussion points in class.",
    "Given that we've made it to graduate school- I find the \"pop-quizzes\" condescending. People learn in different modes and at different rates- some through text, some through attending lectures. It is on us if we don't learn critical material from attending lecture and studying the material as we go, but to be assessed on it through pop-quizzes makes it seem like a middle school course rather than a graduate one. I do appreciate the clear delivery of material through learning objectives, there is a lot of material and it helps to signal the key concepts and points of importance. It allows me to synthesize and understand the material better than memorizing every fact.",
    "The content of the course is interesting, however I think it could have been presented better. There were too many topics, and not enough information on each topic. Additionally, assignments could be improved to require more high-level thinking on the material.",
    "Very good course that covers the scope of issues involved in Environmental Health sciences. I like the flow and pace of the course. It is especially refreshing to have the guest lecturers to come in to talk about their respective topics of expertise. One way that the course could be improved is to talk about the synergistic, positive interaction and relationship between the environment and humsns-- there are many ways that we help one another and this topic should not be ignored.",
    "This class was meant to be exploratory, so the breadth of the course was a bit much.",
    "In retrospect I learned a lot, as I did not know much prior on some of the subjects covered. I did not find that the guest lectures were coherently related to the course\/topic. Might be better to focus in on some of the topics for a full week\/two lectures so it feels less disjointed. I also thought that the use of the clicker at the beginning of the class was better and that it should have been used throughout the semester.",
    "I understand it is probably difficult to provide an overview of so many environmental health topics in a set period of time, but I was disappointed in the depth of the material presented. All of us are graduate students at Yale, we don't need to be memorizing pros and cons of landfills vs. recycling. The course was too easy, to the point that it was almost offensive and it felt like a complete waste of time. I studied for less than 2 hours for the final and had no issue at all answering every single question. The homework assignments all took less than an hour and and felt like nothing but busy work - I don't feel like I learned much from them. I would strongly recommend providing a deeper understanding of topics, even at the expense of having to exclude others (I'm pretty sure we had three different lectures on epigenetics, so this shouldn't be a problem). This would also eliminate the need for the ridiculous pop quizzes, because if the material is actually difficult, students will show up and pay attention. I strongly disagree with the use of quizzes to boost attendance. As a fully functioning adult who was clearly successful in college, I should be able to make my own decisions about when and when not to attend a class.",
    "I liked Prof. Deziel's assignments and lecturing style. They were informative and usually interesting. I was less engaged by some of the modules with guest lecturers, although one or two were quite good. Most guest lecturers did not appropriately tailor their material to their audience. Either it was too anecdotal and steeped in their own specific experiences and did not speak to the topic in general or occasionally was too scientific and not focused on public health enough. Was glad to stop using the clickers to answer questions. They were a waste of time. As were the pop quizzes the way they were mindlessly asked and graded. I also would have liked more feedback on written assignments than a couple words explaining a demerit. for instance one comment was along the lines of \"stated evidence does not support this strong a conclusion\" which I think should have flushed out more. What counterpoint would you have made to my conclusion?",
    "Professor Denial is a good lecturer and you are introduced to necessary topics. However, the guest lectures are often hard to understand.",
    "Tried to cover too many topics in one semester; was very surface level when could have dove deep into a smaller selection of material",
    "I found the lectures uninspiring, which is strange because I love the topic. Somehow the passion Dr. Deziel has for the subject just didn't come through. That said, the pesticide lecture and the final wrap-up lecture were engaging. I was particularly lost during the guest lecture on circadian rhythms. In contrast, though, the guest lecture on occupational health was really engaging, probably because of the case-study approach. I know a lot of people didn't attend lectures, but I'm not sure that external enforcement in the form of pop quizzes was a good way to deal with that. Epidemiology I, which I took at the same time, had no external means of enforcing attendance, but people still attended those lectures much more regularly, probably because their content was more clearly tied to success on the exams and the lectures were a little more interactive. I don't mean interactive in the sense of having students raise their hands, but in the sense of the professor presenting a problem and then explaining how to solve it for us. Instead of instituting external enforcement of attendance, I might try to make the lectures themselves more engaging in that sense, i.e., perhaps via more case studies or just a clearer argument and organization within each lecture. I might also, paradoxically, be less accommodating to students. I'm not sure what we have to say when we raise our hands is really worth everyone else's time. There was also an odd split in the course between the difficulty of the readings and the ease of the exams and assignments. Some of the assigned readings, particularly those on exposure assessment and study design, were nearly impenetrable, yet the exams were very easy. I suspect that most students stopped doing the readings entirely after the first exam, bluntly, because of that split. The final paper was also essentially a book report (technically a paper report), which felt a little too basic. I think the examinations and assignments could expect a little more from us.",
    "The class was semi-informative to the variety of fields associated with environmental health, but it does not fully explain the relation of other disciplines' interaction with environmental health. Issues like global warming and air quality interact closely with EMD, CDE, and SBS but aren't clearly explained in terms of our potential working influence. Providing basic information seemed to me to be a more undergraduate level focus, but seems to requisite a more in-depth analysis into policy, intervention, and research focuses that will help to have those of us who aren't in the specific field to aim to better assist in pushing the environmental importance in our specific fields.",
    "This class was so terrible. Everyone hates it and hates being forced to take it. The only positive attribute of this class is that it's not very hard and doesn't take up much work. This class is difficult to take seriously. Everything I learned in this class I could have learned from reading a short 9th grade level book. The definition of \"epigenetics\" used on the final exam was something like \"the effect of the environment on genes\" which is such a dumbed-down definition of epigenetics that it is no longer even accurate. Every lecture is about something different. It would be much better if the instructor chose 4-6 topics to focus on in the course and went in depth on them. Everything feels superficial and disjointed because every lecture stands alone. Rather than forcing students to take an intro overview course, it would be 100000000x better if YSPH offered a few topic-specific EHS-related courses (like tox) and let students choose between a few EHS-related electives. There is no need for this massive stupid intro course. Instead we should encourage students to go in-depth in an elective. This intro course provided ZERO information that would have helped anyone to do better in a more in-depth elective, which would have been much more engaging. Anything from this course that would have helped for a more in-depth elective could have been taught in literally 45 minutes at the beginning of that elective course. YSPH should entirely do away with this general overview course and offer a few higher-level electives instead. Believe it or not, we are actually smart enough to take more specific electives without taking this utter crap first. Enforcing attendance in lecture via pop quizzes is degrading and infantilizing. Students should be able to attend if they want to and because they think they will benefit from being there. Forcing students to attend via pop quizzes has no evident pedagogical benefit. All it does is foster resentment among the students. Students should have the option to attend if they think it will help them learn. If no students are attending lecture, then the instructor should take it as a sign that whatever they are offering is not helping the students learn, rather than try to strong-arm the students into attending by directly linking attendance to grades. For example, some pop quizzes were obviously just \"attendance points\" because the instructor gave out the answers to the quizzes in class. No one wants to attend this lecture because it is terrible and boring and not engaging. Forcing students to attend by including pop quizzes may make you feel better because the lecture hall is more full, but it will actually only make the students resent you. Treating students in such a way makes YSPH feel like a much less legitimate institution. In classes that are good, students actually choose to show up to learn.",
    "The course is a poor overview of general aspects related to environmental health.",
    "The guest lectures were pretty good, the lectures by the instructor were informative but unengaging",
    "Strengths: comprehensive course covering a range of environmental health areas. Professor was able to keep lectures concise. Weaknesses: too many guest speakers, the pop quizzes were patronizing. Professor gives the quizzes to encourage attendance, but given that we are adults and paying for our education, we should have the freedom to attend\/not attend class as we please.",
    "I think environmental health has the potential to be interesting and engaging. However, this course was not. It gives the very basics of environmental concepts at a level that is beneath graduate level education. (For example, we had to draw a diagram on the midterm). I think this course needs to deepen the level of discourse and the difficulty of concepts presented. This may be challenging as the course needs to be accessible to students in all concentrations, but the current syllabus is not working. I don't really feel like I learned that much that I couldn't have gotten from a Google search of the topic (like fracking, or air pollution). I think one of the problems with this course is it tries to do too much with too little space so ends up doing none of it well. I think this course would be better served by becoming two (or more) courses with more specific focuses. For example, a course on air, water and climate change and a course on occupational exposures and the built environment. There also wasn't a particularly good tie-in to public health issues. For example, when we talked about water, there were only maybe ten slides about water-borne diseases out of about 100. Instead there were slides on the water cycle, and points about what industries use the most water (which again I could Google). It also seemed like the homework was pretty randomly graded. I received work back with a number at the top and random sentences (almost the whole page really) underlined. I have no idea what that means or how to use that information to improve for the next assignment. On the plus side, I had a few difficult classes this semester so this course was a nice break. The guest lectures were also good.",
    "Overall, I found the class very informative and enjoyed what I learned. I feel like I have a solid understanding and basis in environmental health.",
    "Strengths: class content ties together so many different fields of public health. Taught in a straightforward manner with no hidden traps. Content is engaging and applicable to current problems. Weaknesses: Too many guest lectures, some of which I found not very engaging (especially the genetic lectures).",
    "I felt frustrated that we studied environmental health as if it exists in vacuum. I don't think it makes any sense to teach any environmental health class and spend one lecture out of the entire semester on environmental justice. That is one the biggest ways that the environment impacts population health, yet we spent so little time addressing it. And all environmental health issues have some justice aspect and it would have been possible to weave it into multiple lectures, thus grounding our knowledge in real world issues.",
    "The course material is very interesting - I felt like I have a deeper understanding of the complexities of environmental health work. I think the material could be conveyed in a more interesting\/engaging way, the assignments could ask students to go into more depth and they could be more at the level of a masters program, and there could be less guest lecturers.",
    "Much more effective ways to ensure attendance rather than pop quizzes; would be interesting if number of topics covered were decreased to allow more time to more thoroughly cover specific topics.",
    "Dr. D is a great instructor--she is always looking for ways to become a better lecturer and that is really nice to see as a student",
    "Strengths: super interesting topics presented in engaging formats Areas for improvement: assessments and assignments could be a little more rigorous and engaging- have us grapple with environmental ethics issues! Also, guest lecturers are super hit or miss.",
    "strength - intro survey, as expected; weakness - not very engaging (maybe because of class time, size, or format)",
    "Professor lacked in depth understanding of the information presented on the slides sometimes. For example, a student asked where the Precautionary Principle originated (presented in a few slides), and she did not know.",
    "This course is a basic introduction to environmental health. The strength is the breadth of topics and the accessibility of the material presented. However, the assignments were often very elementary in nature and were more about formalities than being challenged on the material.",
    "This course had a lot of material that we had to go over as a result,I felt lectures were quite rushed. Discussions seemed like they were just checked off and in an effort to go through that topic. There were some guest lecturers that were quite hard to understand and did not add any importance to the course. Although, there was a guest lecturer who spoke about occupational hazard and that was fantastic. Homework assignments were quite elementary as I felt they were mostly busy work and did not add much weight or understanding to the course. Some aspects of the course should be filtered a bit to strengthen the course.",
    "I understand why this course is in the core, but I don't think its taught responsibly. It's something to make high schooler's memorize everything wrong with the environment, but I'm not sure that's the best approach for budding professionals. Everyone who is not staunchly conservative knows that the earth is being polluted. I think that overall, the class would have been MUCH better if we talked about the overarching political and economical causes for pollution and environmental health rather than individualized and seemingly non-anarchal causes.",
    "I don't have a clear understanding of how the introductory environmental health course is applicable to specific public health disciplines. The course is structured around \"topics\" and in my opinion the material is too \"soft\" - I didn't walk away with applicable skills to apply to my focused area of study.",
    "The course material uploaded had issues which were discussed in the class but not addressed.",
    "The information is very interesting and important but it was not given in a very engaging way. Professor Deziel basically read her powerpoints, which was good for studying but not great motivation to pay attention in class. Her presentation was not exciting and it did not make her sound like an authority on some of what she was talking about. Some of the guest lecturers were also lacking in enthusiasm.",

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel is a fantastic lecturer - informative without being overwhelming, always willing to answer questions, and highly organized.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0The professor could be more personable and less nervous, which would go a long way towards making the content more engaging. Most of the time it felt like she didn't want to be there. Also varying up the styles of teaching could be valuable rather than relying almost exclusively on PowerPoint slides, try group projects, small group discussions, student presentations, etc.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I can see that Dr. Deziel really tries to improve this course and I do appreciate her efforts. However, this cannot overwrite the fact that this course is a failure, and I feel Dr. D should take the responsibility. First, why are we getting slides that have some intentionally left blanks? This does no good to us when we are trying to review the course, and costs us a lot of time trying to figure out if we missed anything in class. If you want students to pay attention, improve your lecture skills. Second, I don't really like the pop quizzes. Although they did keep me coming to classes, they did not help me learn at all. They only made me hate this course more. There are many more effective and advanced ways to keep students in class. Improve your lectures instead of using these tricks.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel is a helpful instructor, however, her class is a little bit boring.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0At times I felt like the professor was trying to assert dominance over us rather than have an experience with us. She \"laid down the law\" in the first class, which created a distancing effect between professor and students. It was repaired a bit by the end of the semester because she is a sweet person and people eventually saw that, but there was serious damage done in the beginning and next year that should be avoided. Some things that made me a little weary in the beginning were her insistence that we \"call her Dr. Deziel.\" I would never call her anything else, but the fact that she insisted it as though she assumed we would disrespect her without even knowing us was a hard pill to swallow. Also, the fact that she made it clear that asking for a re-grade could result in a loss of points on a test \/homework was scary. I never needed regrades, but I know people didnt ask questions about assignments out of fear. Rather sad unintended consequence. She also seemed to feel uncomfortable talking about race and SES, which made the class uncomfortable. At least once she asked specifically for the contributions of SBS students for a race and SES class discussion, as though we were the only ones who should know\/care enough about those issues to comment. That sort of thing perpetuates harmful divisions between departments. She also seemed really concerned about preventing collaboration on homework. Even in office hours we were not allowed to talk to one another. I'd like to know where that fear comes from because she could make homework pass\/fail or something, but being scared to talk to classmates was isolating and made the class less enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel is an excellent professor. She is very passionate and knowledgeable, so learning from her is both a privilege and honor. She is engaging with the class, and listens to everyone's views on questions posed in class. One criticism is that her public speaking could use some adjustments. Otherwise, GREAT JOB!",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She is an okay teacher.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She tries her best to engage the students. Sometimes it comes to be too much and it rubs some students wrong (pop quizzes) but overall, she is a decent professor trying her best to make students attend class.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0The instructor is very serious and would like to make the course better. she is so nice and willing to answer every student's question",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I believe that the instructor was a little nervous at the beginning of the course, but she improved a lot during the semester. I feel that the people would like to discuss more and to understand how to apply this knowledge to our fields. Maybe you should use more the clickers, i liked the review questions section at the beginning of the class, that helped us to link the materials. Maybe I will add a couple of review sessions with the TA before the Review session with the instructor.",

    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She is not good at teaching at all. Most of the time, she is more like reading off from the slides than actually teaching.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0It would probably help her impression if she didn't talk to students like a parent talking to children, enforcing punitive measures so that people would be incentivized to come to lecture. She's good at putting material into powerpoint format and moving through powerpoints. Also enjoyed many of the guest lecturers.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D is very enthusiastic about the work she does, but I was confused by some of her policies. The only class that requires paper copies of assignments is the intro environment class, which seems backwards. I felt like she had to come up with as many ways as possible to get us to come to class (pop quizzes, paper copies of assignments due at the beginning of class). I don't think this much effort needs to be put into getting people to come to lecture. The point should be to make sure we learn the material (either in lecture or in our own time), not making sure we are in lecture every time.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I think she means well and is extremely intelligent, but compared to other YSPH core classes, there's really no reason to attend the class - it's just memorizing a bunch of stats.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel is insecure as a professor and it comes across in the way she presents the material. Her lectures are sub-par and have little value add than just reading off the slides. To compensate for her ineffectiveness as a professor, she assigns pop quizzes to encourage attendance.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She says \"um\" every other word. She doesn't seem confident on stage. When students ask for clarification she tends to give sassy responses often telling them to just \"google it\". And some point she gave up teaching and just had other profs come in and present on their specific research topics. Which was very interesting. But she wasn't aware of the material they presented on and is constructing a final based on it which I find absurd. During the final review students asked for clarification on some topics taught by other profs that she invited in and Deziel couldn't AND woudn't provide an explanation. I think at times she can be unprofessional, condescending, unapproachable and uninterested in student's needs\/wants.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I just want to reiterate that we are graduate students and should be treated as graduate students. Often times, I, along with many other students, felt that the professor wanted to assert her superiority and her position as a professor far beyond necessary. She does not need to emphasize anything - we all know that she's our professor and that she's an expert. Just because we are taking this class and don't have the level of knowledge that she does, it doesn't mean that she should immediately take on a role as a \"caretaker\" for young children. Many of us have professional experiences in ways that she never had as an academic. We know how to prioritize our educational and career goals. Her focus on attendance, little assignments, whether people pay attention in class seems petty. I would suggest that she just focuses on teaching the course materials well and grant students the autonomy to do well or poorly in class. I believe the course has a great potential to be very interesting, given the current political climate and the materials themselves, but it's not quite there yet due to peripheral factors not related to course materials. Overtime, as the professor refines her presentation skills and course structure, it could become a course that students feel and understand the importance.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Probably very proficient in her own field of study, but not a great teacher\/presenter. Lecture was almost word for word exactly what was on the slides, making readings (or even coming to class) pointless. Not a good first impression either - demanded respect from students but was slow to show it in return (I felt like I was being accused of cheating when I was asking about a homework problem during her office hours).",

    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Lacking organization. Often e-mail sent said homework is back to your mail box and there is nothing. no logic in the slides. contents and concepts poorly organized.",

    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Good instructor. She has a passion for a the material.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0For the first half of the semester, I thought the material was too simplistic. The second half of the course was taught by guest lecturers who focused on the hard sciences too much. I thought the class was a combination of too general and then too detailed. Evaluation methods were bogus and inconsistent. Took off lots of points for how essays were structured, which was assessed in a biased way.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel really tries her best to convey her enthusiasm about the course to the class. I appreciate her willingness to accept feedback and be available to students who may have questions about the course. Overall, I think she's a great professor! Her slides are pretty detailed and informative and her exams are fair. Sometimes I feel like they ask very nitty-gritty questions but I'm fine with that method of exams.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I think she is a good professor and explains the material clearly. However, I think that she could be more responsive to and engaging with students outside of class and in office hours.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel covered a ton of material during the semester and I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D was always available to talk and that is greatly appreciated. I understand that it is probably difficult teaching a class that some people are not thrilled to be in, but I think if she focused on the people who did want to be there it would be a lot easier for everyone. Overall, I think that this course and Dr. D's knowledge of it will only improve with time (not that either are bad now).",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She is a wonderful instructor - however, there was so much material per session.",

    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strengths: Great knowledge of the topic. Support material very useful Need to improve interaction with students",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0The professor seemed unprepared and her lectures lack clear organization.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel was great about communicating with students, and giving us learning objectives to focus on for each exam. I also appreciate how helpful she was during office hours.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strengths - Dr. D seems to know her material and it is clear she cares a lot about the environment - Dr. D is a good teacher and I think the course will improve each year as she continues to feel more comfortable teaching. Weaknesses - People who don't show up to class is not a reflection of Dr. D's teaching, but rather because it's 8:30AM in the morning. - Promoting discussion is good, but when someone answers or gives their opinion, Dr. D tends to just say: OK, next person. I don't think it's meant to be dismissive, but maybe she could try to expand on their comment or offer her own to encourage more participation. - Slides need better organization. Ex: the lecture with NOAELs and LOAELs---needs to be better organized between non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic. It jumps around too much. The slides could be better woven together so that there is a link between each slide.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I felt like you did a good job of presenting the material. One slight note: it was a bit distancing on the very first day of class that one of the very first things that you said was that you preferred to be called Dr. Deziel. I can respect your decision to maintain that formality, but in an environment like YSPH where most professors do allow or suggest that we call them by their first names, having that be the very first thing said was a bit offputting. If that is your preference, I think it could be mentioned at another point in the lecture, or as a correction for someone calling you by your first name.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D is clearly passionate and knowledgeable about the material, and she did a good job fitting so much material into one semester. The best class sessions were when she had the class participate--I think adding more opportunities for class participation would be great. Further, in my opinion, people are really quick to judge professors in a harsh manner when they teach the intro courses. It is obvious that EHS is hard to teach at an intro level, and I applaud Dr. D for organizing and teaching it the way she did.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I would like to give Dr. Deziel the benefit of the doubt and say that because she's only in her second year of teaching she's still coming into her own as a professor. I think she is too self-conscious that she is new to teaching and it shows throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel would develop ways to encourage students to come to class but they felt more punitive than anything (ie. having blank slides or having pop quizzes) Rather than devising ways to get students to come she should restructure her lectures\/teaching style to make it more engaging",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strengths: Dr. Deziel did try to engage students to participate during class and facilitate discussions about the topics we were covering.. Weaknesses: I wish Dr. Deziel relied less on her slides. I also think I would have benefited from assignments outside of class that helped me gain more depth is a certain topic--although the final paper hinted at such depth, I think assignments like this one should have been dispersed throughout the course instead of homework focusing on slide-based material.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Very knowledgeable. Responsive to e mails and office hours are helpful.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Nicole Deziel is no doubt an excellent public health researcher and does her best to make the material interesting, but overall the course she has constructed is weak.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0See Question 6. Professor makes and 8:30AM class fun in the morning.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0A more interactive teaching style would have been great.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0The instructor was really passionate about the topic. These made some of the lectures really great.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel is enthusiastic about environmental health, and clearly has widespread knowledge and experience. She could improve by being more confident in her responses to student questions during lecture. I like how she gives learning objectives at the beginning of each powerpoint, this is helpful in studying.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Very helpful with any questions we may have",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I think Dr. Deziel is very sweet and responsive to students' thoughts and concerns. However, I think there could be a way to make the class more interesting. For example, tying in more current events. Some of the later lectures on climate change incorporated current events (the Paris talks) and this made the lecture more interesting.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She is a good professor and passionate about teaching. However, I think it's better if she can teach a upper level course, because the material in this course is really worthless.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D is such a wonderfully intelligent, strong, passionate, and kind instructor. I am so grateful that she is in the EHS department. Perhaps she seemed a bit nervous during lectures, but I am confident that as as she continues to teach she will gain authority. I would suggest that she don't ask for her students to call her Dr. Deziel instead of Nicole because \"there is so little respect these days.\" The request was legitimate, but the reasoning was a bit off-putting.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0The instructor is knowledgeable about the material, and tried to incorporate both lecture and discussion into class sessions. However, delivery of material could have been improved.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Very concise powerpoint slides and it was clear what the learning objectives are for each lectures. She always had a smile on every day while teaching the course, depsite the fact that it was every other day in Winslow at 8:30AM with blasting airconditioning.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0The rules she set in the class were interesting.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel clearly tried hard and her lectures were much easier to follow than many of the guest lectures. I think that she should be more open to admitting that she doesn't always know the answer to student questions. This course covers an amazing array of topics and sometimes, even when it was clear she was not sure, she would answer anyways. Even as the instructor, we don't expect you to know everything.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel obviously has a lot of knowledge about the topic, and I think that could be better put to use with more in-depth lectures on more difficult topics. Also, I would suggest not requiring students call her \"Dr. Deziel\" - it's off-putting, especially when the course is excruciatingly easy and hard to take seriously.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I enjoyed her lecturing and thought she did a fine good explaining the material she was covering and answering student questions in class. Although I myself did not have any negative experiences with Dr. Deziel, the common perception was that she was at times less than helpful in explaining assignments or was unreasonably paranoid about student discussions related to assignments.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Clearly knowledgeable of material, but read directly off slides and did not expand much further; her grading seemed arbitrary and not consistent; not engaging",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She was very prepared, and her instructions and expectations were quite clear.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0The instructor was kind and responsive to questions when they were answered. I enjoyed learning the subject matter for which she had expertise and respected the use of supplemental professors and researchers that could give greater catered material for specific subject matter.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She is ok but seems to take herself too seriously. It would be nice if she were more available to students. It can be hard to make it to office hours so it would be helpful if she were more available to answer short questions over email.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0By far one of the worst professor's I have ever had. The entire year she seemed nervous teaching and was almost never able to answer student's questions directly. She should be embarrassed by her lack of knowledge of the material she presented and how unprepared she was for every lecture. Her poor teaching skills are exemplified by the fact that she had to give pop quizzes to make students come to class. We are all adults. If we choose not to attend a class taught by a professor with terrible pedagogic skills then instead of mandating pop quizzes, the professor should reconsider her teaching style to make the class more useful and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Overall good professor, but I sometimes felt frustrated about her lack of clarity when students asked questions. Her answers were always ambiguous. It seemed she did this to not give us the answers for exams\/homework, but if students don't understand the material, we need the professor to clarify. Recommendation: assignments should be submitted on Dropbox to save paper as this is an environmental health class.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0It seems like Dr. Deziel is not comfortable teaching. She always seemed to be a bit nervous while lecturing and would get flustered pretty easily. Survey courses are difficult because you have to talk about a wide variety of information, but she didn't seem particularly comfortable lecturing about any of it. I would expect her to at least feel confident in her own area of study. But I think she tried to make the course so basic that at times I almost felt that she thought the material was beneath her. Ironically, most of the class felt that it was beneath us as well. I think Dr. Deziel underestimated what we are capable of and the level of information that we can process. I think she would be better served by raising the level of discourse. It would make her more engaged and thus more interesting, and would improve the course overall. It also seems like she took in her experience teaching last year and tried to fix it in the wrong ways. Ultimately, I found her style infantilizing. For example, last year I know a lot of people stopped going to class. So instead of working to make the class more engaging and creating lectures that people would want to attend, she introduced pop quizzes which basically scared people into attending lecture. It was obvious that this was a ploy as the lowest grade was an 85 and one of the quizzes was self-graded. Similarly, she would post slides after class with purposefully blank slides so that if you didn't come to class you wouldn't have access to certain information. Basically she penalized absence instead of incentivizing attendance. This didn't really work though as most of the information presented was so basic that a quick Google search would easily fill in any blanks and then some. Dr. Deziel means well, but she definitely needs some guidance and mentorship when it comes to teaching. I can think of several large lecture classes that I attended not because I was worried about a pop quiz, but because the course was interesting and engaging. Talk to Dr. Niccolai about Epi I or Marney about SBS. Ultimately the passion for the subject is infectious and makes students want to come back.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I thought Dr. Deziel was a great professor and was very attentive to the needs of her students. She was very passionate about the class and tried to pass that on to her students.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strengths: cares about students, very clearly cares about getting the content to us, is available to help Weaknesses: seems a bit nervous while teaching at times",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I think she can continue to work on her teaching skills. She has created lectures that are very static and her powerpoints teach directly to the exam. We are not asked to think critically about environmental health or to understand how it affects the work we hope to do. This message is one I would have like Dr. Deziel to demonstrate through her lecture style.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel is incredibly kind and thoughtful - she seems really invested in ensuring we are engaging with the material. I think her lectures are not as engaging as I know they could be (because the material is so interesting!).",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D is excellent!",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strengths: very nice and respectful of students and the answers they give Areas to work on: pacing of lectures- generally runs out of time at the end so has to speed through topics that probably need more time to be well explained.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0strength- creative and tries to engage students; weakness - sometimes it seems she has low expectations for us",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Relatively young for a professor. A little nervous sometimes. Requiring students to call her \"doctor\" (while other professors don't have this requirement) creates a weird and uncomfortable dynamic compared to other, more friendly\/open classes. Beginning of class quizzes are very unnecessary. If she wanted to test for participation, a quiz or clicker question in the middle of class would suffice. Some students are just a little late and miss the quiz because they overslept. Sometimes the information is a little over-dramatic and sensationalized. Sometimes, a \"the sky is falling\" moment occurs when talking about a substance and the population's exposure to this substance.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel visibly wants the course to be engaging and beneficial to students. She cares about the students and does want all students to enjoy the course.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She was quite a passionate individual about environmental health and did her best with the course. I felt at times, it was very visible that she was very uncomfortable discussing a topic and this can be seen with the introduction of a topic and not much facilitation going on after. Additionally, I felt the first lecture was quite awkward. It is clear that she understands environmental health through and through but when she required us to only call her Dr. Deziel, she had quickly set the tone for the remainder of the semester. I was not quite sure what else we would have called her considering how a professor introduces herself the first day sets the tone for the remainder of the course and she definitely set the tone with that. All in all, she was a good professor but I just wish she seemed more approachable.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I thought the lectures were read off the slides, and couldn't offer much beyond what someone would gain if they didn't go to lecture. Again, I really wanted more critical analysis rather than just reading off facts.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I don't find the instructor to be very confident in her teaching which affects my learning experience. For all questions being raised in class, her answers are not very extensive and do not offer much new to be discussed further.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0The instructor although thorough with her knowledge of the material could have been more supportive in accommodating the understanding ability for students .",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel basically read her powerpoints, which was good for studying but not great motivation to pay attention in class. Her presentation was not exciting and it did not make her sound like an authority on some of what she was talking about. Although she made her lecture notes in a very structured and sensible way, her presentation was definitely lacking.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0she is patient"

   "comments": [
    "Provides a solid foundation in environmental health sciences. Even though the course is required, I would have taken it anyway.",
    "It's a very basic course if you're deeply interested in environmental health, this course will be a disappointment. I'm not sure I learned anything new",
    "Actually not. I did not learn a lot in this class, and it's just general introduction of public health issues.",
    "It was a good course, but I feel that environmental health is such and important subject that I would have like to learn more.",
    "You gotta take it.",
    "A little bit too general on EHS topics.",
    "Recommend it.",
    "Basically a high school course.",
    "I mean, EHS is a required course.",
    "It's unfortunate that we have to take this class",
    "I heard Tox is a better course.",
    "As the course stands now, I would suggest the course if the other student is interested in the materials. Otherwise, it may be hard to retain students throughout the semester, unless they are required to take it.",
    "Very easy but don't expect to get a lot of new information or insights out of the class.",
    "",
    "grin and bear it because it is required.",
    "It's an easy course for someone who wants to know about the range of topics that fall into the environmental health field. I wouldn't recommend for anyone who has any background in environmental health and could waive out of it.",
    "It's a required course and thankfully, it's not a brutal one. Instead of looking at this class as a joke, really try to understand what you're learning. I came out a little depressed with how we're treating Earth but I don't think I would have realized the magnitude of our human actions on the world had it not been for this class. Easy, reasonable amount of work, and enjoyable despite the early 8:30am class time.",
    "I would recommend taking it, but it is very surface level",
    "Some busy work. Good material.",
    "I would recommend to another student. The course provides skills and knowledge necessary to have a strong opinion on environmental health issues.",
    "I would not recommend it to any other student but we have to take it anyway.",
    "The material is straightforward and very intro (even for an intro class). You'll take this because you have to or need an EHS requirement and you'll take this over Tox (don't take Tox).",
    "very easy course, not challenging. lectures are not that interesting",
    "It's required - I hear its better than Borak. Do it, get the grade, and graduate.",
    "Yes, recommend.",
    "It is not a lot of work. It is important to think about its importance in whatever you are focusing on at YSPH. Try to understand the bigger picture.",
    "This course provided a nice overview of environmental health. I would recommend it only if a student wanted a broad summary of the topic. If they were looking for a more in-depth approach, I would recommend taking another course.",
    "While this is a required MPH core class, I would still recommend it to other students. It is an eye-opening class, and makes you think about all types of exposures that you may not normally consider. Environmental risks have a widespread effect on population health, and every public health student should be at least familiar with the major topics in this class. I also enjoyed many lectures, and wanted to learn more about specific areas such as gene-environment interactions and climate change.",
    "It is helpful to get a broad sense of environmental health. Good to know these facts as a public health student that we may not learn from any of our other courses if not in Env Health concentration.",
    "This course is worthless please do not take it. However, it is required in the curriculum, so put as least effort as possible in this course and focus on other courses.",
    "It is mandatory, but if given the option I would recommend that other students not take the course.",
    "This course was a brief introduction into many topics in environmental health. While interesting, topics were not covered in enough depth to result in a great understanding of any one individual topic.",
    "Although this course is required for all students to graduate, I would recommend this course to any outside students that wishes to get a taste of Environmental Health Sciences. The mix of homework assignments, media paper, and the exams will solidify your understanding of certain concepts such as the impact of pesticide use, exposure assessment, and more.",
    "Exploratory course on environmental health.",
    "Ummm, it felt like a waste of my time most days but I think studying for the midterm\/ final helped me learn some things!",
    "A painfully easy intro course that requires minimal effort.",
    "I would recommend it to another student to fulfill the EHS requirement. It is a decent survey course of the field which will be enlightening and occasionally enjoyable. The grading is quite easy.",
    "Ok for an introductory\/ required course",
    "I'd call it an easy honors grade, if you need one, and the content covers the breadth of environmental health, but the lectures were a bit dull.",
    "The course was resourceful in a basic instruction sense of breadth but may not provide an appropriate sense of depth to understand specific subjects in environmental health, either due to the high quantity of material or the teaching style.",
    "The course is terrible and you will likely not come from it with useful information. If its time conflicts with another course you would like to take, enroll in both and just don't attend this one. You would still be able to earn an Honors and definitely a High Pass without attending and will get more for your money.",
    "Solid comprehensive course on environmental health",
    "This course is required unless you want to take Toxicology, so you pretty much don't have a choice. That said, I would recommend that you opt out of this course if you have the option.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student because I found it enjoyable and informative.",
    "Very important course that ties many different fields of public health together. It's a requirement, but not one that I hated taking. I found the class engaging for the most part and the material interesting.",
    "I took it because it was required but learned a lot nonetheless",
    "It's a pretty comprehensive course that gives a great introduction to the intersection of health and environment. Do the readings and engage in lectures to get the most out of the course.",
    "its required",
    "A lot of the information is google-able. Very broad overview. If you have specific interests, take something else.",
    "This course gives you a taste of many different environmental health topics I had not learned about before. The course is survey in nature and not very technical\/computational so I would recommend another environmental health course if that is what you are looking for.",
    "It's part of the core. It's an important subject, but I wish it was taught better",
    "It is pretty easy, nothing to worry about in terms of work load and grades. The info you'll learn is very interesting, but the lectures themselves are pretty dull in the way that they are presented. Plus it's very early in the morning"
