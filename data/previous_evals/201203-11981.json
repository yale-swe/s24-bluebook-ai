    "This is mostly a reading\/writing course but you also watch movies. Class is mostly a discussion and you learn about current issues in France such as the topic of national identity, the environment, education, etc.",
    "This class is a lot of work. Four to five hours of homework in preparation for each of three weekly classes. I took it to brush up on my high school French before taking French literature classes. My section was small so we had a lot of opportunity to speak, which was nice. The reading material is quite boring \u00e2\u0080\u0094 kind of a general overview of current issues in France, such as immigration and the environment, as well as a bunch of fairly useless information about the French schooling system and employment rules. My writing and vocabulary definitely improved, but I think a literature or history class would have been a much more interesting base for a conversation class.",
    "Lots of work. An interesting class, but a tough one, and probably not the right one if you still need to fine-tune grammar or other linguistic aspects of French rather than simply focusing on culture.",
    "I would recommend it only if you don't mind working hard and taking a class with a lot of technical terms. You will be much better versed in current topics."
