   "comments": [
    "I learned about opera, Italian literature, film, and politics. Most importantly, my ability to speak and (especially) read and write in Italian improved greatly. Before I'd started the course, I had tried to read a book in Italian with what I'd learned at L4, but stopped after a couple pages because it was too difficult; now I'm reading it over break for pleasure and it's really an enjoyable experience.",
    "My writing and presenting improved tremendously. I believe that I became a better, more thoughtful Italian student and speaker under Patrick's instruction.",
    "Advanced Composition and Conversation is a course that makes a broad survey of various literary styles in different time periods. We read two great novels, looked at newspaper articles, listened to the opera, watched films, learned vocabulary, and had engaging discussions. You will certainly improve reading and listening comprehension, vocabulary, and speaking by the end of the semester.",
    "In having the focus of this course be on Italian conversation and composition, I was able to greatly improve such skills. I felt that I improved as a more confident and fluid Italian speaker due to constant conversation in class. The writing component also helped with organizing my thoughts better in Italian, something that additionally translated well into my conversational skills."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths were definitely the experience reading and writing, especially because Professor Waldron was so willing to (a) adapt the course materials to our class's interests and (b) provide detailed and careful explanation of grammatical constructions and vocabulary. I feel capable of tackling basically any kind of Italian media now. The only weaknesses were time spent speaking and listening--granted, all of the class was conducted in Italian, but I think 2.5 hours per week of class is only enough to maintain proficiency, or improve it slowly. the professor had us go to some Italian tables, which should've theoretically helped, but most table participants were in L1 and L2, so there wasn't really much conversation to be had. Incorporating more spoken practice would've been great. My only other suggestion would be showing us how to find Italian media like TV shows, podcasts, and movies to pursue on our own.",
    "Patrick was flexible with the course syllabus, allowing us to choose what we wished to study and write our final papers on."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course--it teaches you how to consume Italian media, which allows you to maintain your language abilities outside of the classroom when you're not actively taking an Italian class.",
    "I recommend for anyone wishing to continue their study of Italian - any one that is willing to commit the time and effort. Such a small class environment is not fun unless everyone is willing to commit and partake; however, I think we had a great group.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you are passionate about Italian culture and literature.",
    "Yes! It's a great advanced Italian course. It allows you to practice and build on all the grammar you have learned in the L1-L4, while still learning interesting material related to Italian culture."
