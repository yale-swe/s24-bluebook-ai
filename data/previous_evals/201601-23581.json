   "comments": [
    "Took it for the HU, since it only had 2 1-page Op-Eds. I enjoyed it more that I thought I would. The readings are long and pretty boring but Rankin's lectures are clear and he makes sure you know what are the important concepts for the test.",
    "The class was okay. I took it because I wanted a HU and a class at 10:30 T\/TH, but in hindsight, if you need a HU, I would probably recommend a history\/AMSTD course like Les\/Gay or Origins of US Global Power. Bill Rankin was a sweetheart, but I never felt engaged in class. The material isn't hard, per se, but sometimes it was difficult to keep up with the course themes. It felt like a hodge podge of information. The work is two one-page Op-Ed assignments, a midterm, and a final. The Op-Eds were fun and interesting. The midterm, most did well but I didn't knock it out of the park. The final is probably like the midterm. The readings were usually pretty rough, but thankfully the bulk of the class is from lecture. Okay class, would recommend, but only if you just want a class that's low work to slip into.",
    "Yes- for perspective changes and a balanced view of climate issues from both sides looking at political, social etc. barriers not just science. Really Cool.",
    "It was a bit too much subject matter to fit into one course. The title was vague (Global catastrophe?) which, in retrospect, I think was intentional just so he could shoehorn a bunch of different stuff he was passionate about from different periods in time into one course and put it under the headline \"catastrophe\". I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone looking for intense depth in any of the subject matters, but if you're looking for a cursory survey of the stuff covered (or a Hu credit), then go for it. ALSO: IT'S A LOT OF READING, BEWARE",
    "Definitely take this class, interesting, not terribly difficult because its intuitive. Easy to get an A-, hard to get an A. Go to lecture and actually listen and you will learn a ton, it will make the exams and midterms, which are very straightforward, easier.",
    "Might be interesting for someone in the EVST major, however, as an HSHM major, I did not enjoy it. Lectures posed many unanswered questions and the structure of lecture didn't really provide concrete answers to the questions.",
    "Interesting class but be prepared that this is really an HSHM course with emphasis on being able to really tie things together. Don't expect to skate by with memorization alone. Professor Rankin does a good job summarizing things for you in lecture so you just need be ready to pay attention to him.",
    "Great class! Will definitely make you think things you've never thought before. Very interesting material and Prof. Rankin is awesome.",
    "Do it! Rankin is a fabulous lecturer and the class is fascinating. Really makes you think, and not hard either!",
    "Really good course that is not hard to study for, just get the take home messages and learn the peoples names (not many) and you can get an A. Difficulty comes in time managements on tests (only the midterm) and if you are not active in section. Lots of lengthy readings but just skim and you are fine (this is what is recommended anyways)",
    "This class was initially not what I expected. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is definitely more of a history of science class than a G&G or EVST class, but I definitely learned a lot of valuable things. Professor Rankin is an amazing lecturer, and I was constantly impressed by how organized and well-timed his lectures were. Unlike most other lectures I've taken at Yale, the section was incredibly helpful in helping me understand the material. This class is not much work (apart from the weekly readings), and the exams were all very fair!",
    "Would not recommend.",
    "Would not recommend, seems very interesting in theory and some of the topics are interesting but the way information is presented is not good.",
    "A very very easy class that will expose you to important issues you might not realize are happening. It's a great exploratory class and it's hard to mess up in it since the exams pose you like four question options and you only answer one and it's an opinion question anyway.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I think it has a reputation for being easy, and I can't say that it isn' true, but it's thoroughly interesting material, and if you want to learn a lot, you can.",
    "Interesting course and worth your time. Take it if you can.",
    "A must-take. This class will challenge you world view, and you will leave perhaps knowing less for certain than when you started, but certainly knowing more about how to think of the world in non-binary terms. A magnificent course.",
    "A good course with a lot of good topics, but way too much information to absorb and retain.",
    "Good introduction to the history of the interaction between science and the world.",
    "Not a lot of work, and there is a lot to learn. This class will give you a new perspective if you are willing to listen.",
    "Take it!!! Not a heavy workload and you learn a ton of interesting things!",
    "This course will help you to abandon any narrow perspective on science, religion, politics, economics, etc that you may have. And it will help you to break down long-established dichotomies between these subjects.",
    "The class itself is very interesting, but it is certainly not going to be anything like what you think you are signing up for. It has very little to do with global catastrophes at all, but rather is about the historiographical evolution of scientific theory about catastrophes. If you don't want to memorize a bunch of obscure people and theories and you're not interested in the history of science, DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. Also, the exams are quite hard and graded very subjectively, so keep that in mind before taking it.",
    "Great teacher, but he talks really fast sometimes to the point that its hard for me to wrap my head around the ideas he's talking about and once I do he's on a completely new topic. He's not making any revolutionary claims. All of them make intuitive sense but he is trying to convince you that societal tenets are wrong which can be a bit of a mind fuck sometimes.",
    "This is an interesting class. Changed the way I thought about science. Really is a class about the history of science and how science works in relation to religion, politics, and capitalism. Professor Rankin is very interested in dispelling the myths you have about science and spends a long time trying to get you to think about science differently. Not too much work and fairly easy. Good HU credit.",
    "This class should be re-named. It was not as interesting as i would have hoped. The professor tried to re-define the word catastrophe with the material, but instead was irritating and not great at lecturing. I would not recommend this course.",
    "This class is an okay humanities distribution for science majors. I'm a chemical engineering major but a lot of the arguments from Rankin are asinine. This is really a philosophy of science class, not really history. Rankin has a relativistic's perspective of history so the outcome of the arguments in history don't matter to him, which is honestly ridiculous. Remember that he's a historian and not a scientific. This class should be called \"Science vs .______\" class was not worth attending nor was it very interesting if attended.",
    "The class was as described; if you find the topics in the syllabus interesting, definitely go for it. Workload was low, just two short op-eds, reading responses for section, midterm, and final.",
    "Good class that's not too much work.",
    "An interesting history of science class if you're excited about historical development of scientific strands of thought. There was more emphasis on the historical side of things than contemporary issues like global warming, but this served to put contemporary issues in a well-developed historical context. If you're looking for a class *just* about global warming, this isn't it. But the material is very well-presented and presents an interesting perspective on scientific and political issues, and the work load is pretty light, so if you're looking for a different take on environmental issues, it's worth taking.",
    "I really enjoyed the class as a whole.",
    "Not at all what I expected but a must for anyone really",
    "Essentially an environmental history class, but the prof does a really good job of tying into bug questions about the nature of science and it's relationship to religion, capitalism, politics, and culture. Overall better than I expected, and minimal work (this is a class that teams sign up for, so beware)",
    "An understanding of a historical analysis of catastrophes",
    "It's a very well taught, very interesting course. The exams test your ability to take the exams, not your knowledge. It's not intended to be a terribly hard course, and it isn't. Anyway, you'll have a gut feeling whether you'll love or hate the class based on the first few classes. Act accordingly. Be warned if you're GPA-hypersensitive.",
    "Love, love, loved this class. Professor Rankin is one of the best professors I've ever had. The course is extremely well-structured, the lectures are so interesting and informative. The ideas are theoretical but super grounded in tons of concrete examples. Definitely, absolutely, totally recommend this class. Assignments and readings are relevant and fair.",
    "Take it if you want an easy class, but want to actually learn something.",
    "A look at how humans conceive of, study, and react to catastrophes such as the Biblical flood, overfishing, nuclear winter, and climate change. Lectures are interesting, and section is very interesting because students from many different fields and backgrounds take the course, leading to genuine differences in worldviews and opinions.",
    "Yes- this course will change the way you think about contemporary environmental topics. Prof. Rankin is an engaging lecturer who synthesizes information from many fields into digestible themes and arguments."
