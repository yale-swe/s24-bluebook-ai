    "This course introduced several research topics within the field of high-dimensional statistics. This included the estimation of sparse vectors and sparse regression, matrix estimation, and convex optimization methods, as well as conditions needed to characterize solutions to high-dimensional problems (e.g. incoherence, restricted nullspace\/eigenvalues). We began with a review of concentration inequalities and other concepts in probability that are important to understanding the methods we discussed. For most of the algorithms we covered, we went through a detailed mathematical analysis of the key results (e.g. proofs of convergence\/error bounds\/recovery rate, etc.) As a result of taking this course, I feel much more able to read research papers in the field. The course provided just enough background in a number of topics to enable me to teach myself more about the ones which interested me most.",
    "Lots of concentrastion of measure and bounding techniques."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Sahand was a great teacher (more details in response to last question). It was nice that the class was quite small (~10 students); this alleviated my usual fear of asking questions in class, and I appreciated that Sahand also encouraged questions and made me feel like the ones I asked were valid. The class requires a lot of self-motivation (mainly stemming from wanting to understand research in the field), and would be best for students who are willing to invest time in deepening their understanding of the material outside of class without the incentive of grades; but, for such students, this class does provide a lot of the foundational material needed to go further on your own. The project at the end of the semester was also fun since we were allowed to explore any topic in high-dimensional statistics that we found interesting. Improvements: adding a couple more homework assignments (even if not intended to be graded) might be helpful; the one assignment we did have really improved my understanding of the material from the earlier part of the course, so having a few more throughout the semester would have been a helpful self-diagnostic."

    "Definitely. It brought me from knowing nothing about high-dimensional stats to being able to read papers.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to graduate or advanced undergraduate students who are interested in exposing themselves to research in this area, and who are motivated and excited to invest time into learning the material for the sake of learning rather than grades.",
    "Yes, definitely. I was very happy with the content I learned in the course."
