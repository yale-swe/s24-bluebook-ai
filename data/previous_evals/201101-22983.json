    "This class is about radiative process only as they pertain to stellar atmospheres and more specifically as they relate to high resolution stellar spectra. If a student was interested in doing exoplanet research, I would recommend it with the caveat that it was not particularly well taught and they will probably just a well off reading the book. All other students looking to attend a course on radiative transfer and process, please look elsewhere.",
    "I would recommend this course for a student interested in stellar spectroscopy. There are many other aspects of radiative transfer which were not covered (radiative transfer in the IGM, etc), so the course might not be very useful to such students."
