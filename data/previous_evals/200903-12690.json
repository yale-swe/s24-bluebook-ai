    "A class that deals with anti-American sentiment in various regions around the world, the types of Anti-Americanism and what our diplomatic approach should be towards solving it. I wouldn't recommend it. It's a pretty narrow topic to have a whole semester on, and neither the professor nor the readings were great.",
    "Do yourself a favor and do not even shop this course. It may sound very interesting, but the course is absolutely disappointing. The readings were very interesting, but we did not discuss the readings at all in class. Professor Weiss made no attempts to regulate the class discussions, and they were always dominated by obnoxious people who actually did not do any of the readings but were just very opinionated. It was even more frustrating that half of our course grade was based on class participation, and it is not fair to those who actually did all the readings but could not say a word because the discussions were dominated by certain individuals. She showed clear favoritism to those who were opinionated and did not even try to hide it. Even if you want to get some advice or feedback on your research paper, she just expects you to figure it out for yourself and gets extremely annoyed (and clearly shows it). I really regret taking this course.",
    "Take it if you have a strong personal investment in discussing anti-Americanism, but know that there isn't going to be a lot of theory involved, and that the ending weeks (when discussing Asia) get pretty repetitive and boring. If that sounds like a pretty lukewarm endorsement, it is.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. The class itself is pretty straightforward, there is not much reading to be done (assuming the student does the reading) and class once a week plus the final paper makes for a class that doesn't have a heavy workload, but the class itself felt like a waste of a credit. Take it if you need a IR distribution for Political Science, but unless there is some drastic syllabus change, or you know that the people in the class are phenomenal people, I would strongly advise a student against taking this course.",
    "Anti-Americanism in World Politics questions the consequences and origins of the persistence or emergence of adversarial relationships to the United States. It breaks down social, political and cultural representations of the United States.I would recommend it for anyone who think they know what to do about Anti-Americanism, and to anyone who doesn't know anything about it, because either way their view of the United States in the World, and the of its role in World Politics will change.",
    "Yup, take it. There were some kinks, and the student presentations were hit or miss, but I imagine prof weiss will work some of them out and it was a good class despite some flaws.",
    "selection of readings about different areas of the world and an analysis of their forms of anti-americanism-- its roots, manifestations etc.",
    "I would recommend it, but only if you are really interested in the subject. Since the discussion can drag on at times, it wouldn't be a good class for someone with only a passive curiosity in anti-Americanism. With the exception of the final paper, the weekly work load is definitely reasonable. The readings are pretty interesting as well. Each week a different student would distribute questions for the upcoming readings and that student would lead the discussion. It was an interesting way to conduct the seminar, though it did lend itself to a more hands off approach by the professor since the students were left to guide and direct the discussion themselves. Some people may like this, I personally would've preferred Professor Weiss to have been more active in the discussion. At any rate, this class is definitely worth a good look."
