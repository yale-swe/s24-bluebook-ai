    "I have little to no motivation to improve my Spanish ability. I have no interest in the class and solely took it in order to fill the language requirement. Getting me excited about Spanish is, if not a lost cause, certainly a waste of resources better spent on other students. I became a marginally better speaker and writer. I have no intent to practice these abilities in the future and I fully expect to forget most of what little Spanish ability I have within the coming years.",
    "spanish grammar, fluency speaking, and writing skills",
    "All aspects of my Spanish improved - grammar, speaking, listening, reading.",
    "I think I have made a lot of leaps forward in my Spanish this semester. This is the third institution in which I have learned the grammatical forms we went over, but this is the first time in which I feel like they were taught in a way that made sense. Additionally, having class and homework due everyday was a learning experience in terms of time management.",
    "Continued spanish.",
    "I developed a much better understanding of some of the more difficult grammar rules. I also ended the year with an improved ability in understanding written grammar, which I think will be very useful as I continue to study the language. Finally, I as the semester went on I grew to be more and more comfortable speaking Spanish. This is what I think I benefitted from the most."

    "My presence in Spanish class certainly degrades the experience of my peers. I am unable to conjugate verbs correctly, so when I am paired up with one of my peers, I do not correct their mistakes as I do not notice them. I have an incredibly limited vocabulary, so when speaking in Spanish to the rest of the class I often take up valuable class time saying, Uhhhhhh and Ummmmm. I struggle to think of ways in which I benefit my peers. There should be such a thing as \"Spanish for STEM majors\". I actually find it unfair that no such class exists, especially when courses that are essentially \"Math for humanities majors\" do exist. As someone with dyslexia, Yales Spanish department is poorly equipped to support me in my learning. I think that I would benefit from a slower class pace where I can take more time to think about conjugations and spellings. At the moment I feel rushed such that I dont have the time to fix or even notice mistakes that I make while speaking and to a similar extent writing. I really hope that this feedback is passed back to the Spanish department, so that they can consider ways in which to accommodate future students who have similar troubles in class. The course also requires an unrealistic time commitment. I have a number of courses that I must take this semester to fulfill my major requirement. It is imperative that I have the time to focus on these classes so that I can ensure that I am learning the material fully. Spanish takes away from these courses. In order to get a passing grade in Spanish, I must spend around an hour in class every day and at minimum an hour and a half outside of class. This is a ridiculous situation.",
    "There were a lot of tedious assignments and the workload was particularly heavy at the end of the semester, but I think that I learned a lot.",
    "This class is rigorous, which is how it should in an advanced language course. Towards the end of the semester, we were being assigned multiple major projects\/exams every week, which got to be a lot, so I wished it was a little more spaced out towards the end. I really enjoyed getting to read a full book at the end of the class.",
    "It's fine for the required class it is.",
    "This class was very well organized and the work load was not too much to handle. I liked that the type of work (both homework and classwork) varied throughout the semester. My one suggestion for improvement would be to better distribute the work throughout the semester. I felt as though we had much more work towards the end of the semester."

    "It's about as good as a Spanish grammar class can be. Definitely hard and boring at times, but I did learn a lot and the material was taught in a relatively engaging way. I definitely wouldn't take it for fun, but if you want to learn Spanish, it's definitely worth it.",
    "It's required.",
