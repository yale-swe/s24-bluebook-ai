   "comments": [
    "Be wary that you may get easily frustrated with the way the class is organized and graded. Knowledge\/understanding does not result in a good grade often, even if the course work itself is manageable. At the end of the semester, I still was unsure how to perform best in the class.",
    "Really good base for future linguistics courses. Take it your sophomore year, so you can take more complex courses junior and senior year and not have to wait.",
    "The first half may be somewhat easy\/slow if you've taken Intro Linguistics, but Zanuttini's a great professor - she didn't simply lecture, but used a lot of example sentences and asked us questions about them to get us thinking about underlying structures and syntacticians' methods. I would recommend for non-ling majors who are very interested in grammar.",
    "you should only take it if you have to, especially if you're coming at it from a cognitive science\/psychology perspective. this course doesn't really tell you what \"we know when we know a language,\" rather, it's a summation of abstract principles that allow syntacticians to resolve structural tree diagrams with grammatical sentences of the language.syntax is an amazing field, and the way it uses cross-linguistic phenomena and deduction to create rules of combination is beautiful. most of the rules, however, concern only the static representations of sentences, rather than the combinatorial processes that underlay the dynamic nature of language (comprehending, processing, and speaking).in short, if you want to learn about the linguistic methodologies and phenomena having to do (pretty much exclusively) with syntax, this course is perfect for you! if you want to learn how more ecologically valid ways of how all aspects of language work, then perhaps it isn't.less importantly, the grading in this class often seemed highly arbitrary; getting the correct answer and showing your work could result in full points, half points, or even less than that! there wasn't a clear rubric about what errors would result in what point deductions, and often that caused unnecessary distress.",
    "Recommended for anyone interested in Linguistics! I learned a lot about my own language, as well as others.",
    "Great class; take it. Even if you're not a major, this class is interesting and will change how you think about language and sentence structure as well as the human mind. Raffaella Zanuttini is a great professor. While it might be helpful to have a linguistics class (intro or something similar) under your belt, it's not necessary. The workload is manageable and always relevant to the class. The exams are fair, and the lectures are engaging. Overall, definitely recommended."
