    "Great course with very interesting topics discussed.",
    "Over the course of this class, I was able to interact with researchers in biology, administrative officials, seniors working on honors theses trying to stratify police perception by income and area of upbringing, students looking for indicators of human trafficking in a large, untidy dataset, and people in the insurance industry, and this made for an overall valuable year. Jay's wide-ranging, in-depth experience with working with data also lent itself to decent growth in this hands-on area for me.",
    "Learned a ton of things about using R for tasks I'd normally have considered only doing in python.",
    "I believe that this class greatly helped me prepare for job interviews, which I am very grateful for. I think this was a great class to reinforce the ideas of basic statistical concepts applied to real data problems in fields\/areas of research that were very interesting to learn about.",
    "Statistical Consulting developed many basic data exploration skills when presented with various forms of data (sometimes raw\/uncleaned)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's very much dependent on who shows up and whether we can get anyone to show up. Some years, I'm told, are full of people week after week, and others, like this one, just happen to be sparse. Jay did as good a job as could be expected filling the empty days, introducing us to his own data sets and parsing over new ones alongside us. I don't think there's any way one could ask for more.",
    "I think it does a great job of providing a problem and spending several weeks working on it, often transitioning units when the problem requires new techniques, which is very elegant. I sometimes think the pace slows down (it felt like the birthday problem unit dragged towards the end, and many other units felt like the ending had a week where not much work went on before moving onto something new).",
    "Strengths: engagement level with the class was excellent Weaknesses: I wish more people came to the clinics for help",
    "Really strong course, with a great introduction to the important steps one should take when presented with a new data set.",
    "The class is very well designed and led, but if I were to tweak anything I would try to build in more required participation."

   "comments": [
    "Yes definitely. Hands on practice with interesting data sets and intellectual challenges.",
    "Yes, I would: it's a change from the usual theoretical fare a Yale student might be accustomed to, and it's good exposure to applying our skills to the world outside.",
    "Yeah, it's a good class. It's a great combination of reasonable enough work that it doesn't dominate your semester in any sense, but a good collection of well taught ideas that make it very interesting and engaging.",
    "Absolutely. Really interesting course, and Jay is a great facilitator of discussion.",
    "Great class. No brainer to take this for half a credit. You learn so much.",
    "Absolutely"
