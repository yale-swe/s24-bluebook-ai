   "comments": [
    "The course is broken up in two sections, the first is a small working group that meets weekly, and the second is attending the WGSS lecture series. The weekly meetings are meant to evaluate and discuss the lecture series as well as to discuss research methodology, pedagogy, and representation. I would definatly recommend this course to other students.",
    "The major requirement of WGSS 900, which exists regardless of who is facilitating the class, is consistent attendance at WGSS workshop and working group sessions. This year, we heard a lot of presenters who were either at very early stages of their research (for example, out of five total student presenters we heard THREE divinity school students who were perfectly smart, but who were presenting seminar papers from undergrad or personal side projects that didnt set a foundation for an informed discussion). With the exception of Anthony Reeds presentation, the working group presentations of faculty projects led to fairly stymied conversationwhether because people hadnt read, or because there were a few especially eager and uninformed participants who monopolized, Im not sure. Those of us required to be there made the best of the difficulty and used these sessions as foundations for later discussions about the shape, stakes, content, methodologies, etc. of work within the interdisciplinary field of WGSS. This brings me to the second requirement of WGSS 900. In addition to the time spent at workshop, those pursuing the certificate met as a cohort with Jafari Allen, the current DGS of the department. This was EVERYTHING. Jafari framed the semester by asking our small group (five students) to discuss our expectations for the class, whichI gatheris a fairly new requirement. Many of us were trying to think through how our respective projects, and later our pedagogies, could and would enact a feminist and queer politics. This question structured our time together, as we read feminist work (Jacqui Alexanders Pedagogies of Crossing), did numerous writing workshops as a group (various exercises to define our projects, think about WGSS as a field, and move toward a full teaching statement), discussed what makes an effective syllabus, discussed strategies for navigating academic lifeand most importantly responded to each others questions and work. With Jafari as facilitator, we created a space that asked for and welcomed full engagement from each participant. It was a transformative space that, I am sure, will remain a foundational reference point for all of our ongoing work. So, perhaps this goes without saying, I would encourage any student seriously interested in enacting feminist and queer scholarship\/pedagogy to seek out the opportunity to work with Jafari. I would certainly encourage students interested in the WGSS Proseminar to seek out courses that strike the kind of balance between practical exercise and theoretical discussioninsofar as we can invoke that binary with a straight facethat Jafari facilitated so well. Perhaps WGSS can find a way to make the structure and requirements for the certificate clearer and more consistent. As it stands, it seems like the class could be very hit-and-miss depending on who is teaching this class, so without the same DGS, it would be hard to speak to it in a way that could recommend it to another student. But this year it was definitely a hit! I feel so lucky to have been there.",
    "The best class that you can take. Yes."

   "comments": [
    "The writing assignments required a level of thoughtful analysis and care which made me write things that I will certainly use later on in my career. The course also allowed student the freedom to delve into their own interests in research which was very useful.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of WGSS primarily by providing a framework for asking and exploring questions central to this field: How is this work feminist? How is this work queer? Through discussion of work emerging both in WGSS broadly and among students in our cohort, we discussed ways that scholars have answered these questions in their scholarship. In addition to this theoretical and methodological component, this course focused on helping students commit to disciplines around writing, discussing others writing, and articulating\/developing an approach to my own teaching. Of course all of this is crucial to my ongoing research, scholarship, and teachingin both tangible and intangible ways. The class was both a threshold and an oasis: it held space for students to find new creative edges for our work and pose challenging questions of our projects, our disciplines, and our colleagues. This is a rare accomplishment for one classhard to articulate on a written formand I imagine that much of what we learned in our conversations will continue to reveal its impact far beyond the semester itself.",
    "From the onset, it enabled me think think about my project as a feminist project, and encouraged me to think through that question throughout the semester. There is something beautiful about being able to critically think through a question over that long of a time, and I was joined by wonderful people in the class. The explicit demands to write about my project has widened my breadth of scholarship, for which i am thankful."
