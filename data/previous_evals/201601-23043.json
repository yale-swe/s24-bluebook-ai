    "It's a well-designed and interesting class. Lots of the topics are fascinating and underappreciated in other classes. The assignments are not too difficult. Recommended!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for any student interested in studying intellectual history. Although this course was a seminar, it was unique in that the syllabus had a broad scope and was not hyper-focused on one period. As a history major, I have taken quite a few intellectual history courses, but this one was my favorite because students were able to engage with a broad array of authors and topics. For the last month or so, we mostly read contemporary authors, so the course felt very grounded in reality and relevant. The workload was extremely manageable and Professor Renaud offers awesome feedback to really help you grow as a writer and Historian. Also, listening to him speak will make you smarter, so take this class!",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it. Learned ALOT",
    "I absolutely loved the seminar! Terence is amazing, and the reading list was just wonderful! 10 out of 10....one of the best classes I've taken at Yale (and I'm a second semester senior). Take it!!"
