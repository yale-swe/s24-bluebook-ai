   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths- Instructors are goodweakness- the course itself the way it is structured. the information given are too basic and does not do justice to both the knowledge level of the instructors and also MPH curriculum.",
    "I thought this course provided a helpful overview of important environmental health topics. I liked the structure of the course in that each week the lecture focused on a different environmental health topic. I especially enjoyed the case study sessions towards the end of the course, since they provided a deep dive into a topic that we had covered on the surface in the lecture the same week. I think the case study sessions could be made even more helpful, though. It is difficult to talk through a whole case in a short one-hour class time. Perhaps the case study section could tackle one topic for every two weeks instead so that students have a chance to read about the topic, write a short piece about risk assessment or management, and then really have time to talk about it in class.",
    "This class is very disjointed and actually feels more like two classes -- we had two exams, two professors, two syllabi, and often discussed two different topics in the different sections. Even standing alone, both of the parts of the course were quite weak. The lectures felt like long, rambling lists if issues and problems. The sections were poorly guided and not helpful. There was also a lot of overlap between this class and other YSPH courses. I think that the professors were so interested in making the class interesting for students from different divisions that it sometimes felt more like an SBS, policy, or epi class. There was a great deal of emphasis on the \"environmental health\" approach to problems, which seemed exactly like the \"public health\" approach to problems; so it was unclear how this class was meant to strengthen our understanding of public health, given that we'd already covered this approach in other classes.",
    "This course was poorly designed and executed. It was essentially two different classes, which were both bad, though the case studies class was far better than the lecture. I honestly don't even understand how this is a class being taught at Yale, the school should be embarrassed. The assignments were poorly organized, there were two syllabi, none of the assignments really required much critical thinking or analysis, as they were all short. The lectures (Stowe) were unbearable. If I were an admitted student and I visited this course, I would not come to Yale.",
    "The lecture portion is dry, but a good background on the issues. The discussion section was confusing and not terribly educational, and didn't link with the lecture so the concepts were not solidified in my head. We just weren't given enough direction to have meaningful discussion in that time. I think I would have liked two 1.5 hour lectures instead of 2 hour lecture and 1 hour discussion.",
    "This class was a complete waste of my time and money. It's juvenile - very little that you haven't already learned (often in middle school); lectures were pointless (instructor reads off of a PowerPoint), and discussions were even more worthless.",
    "strength:covered a lot topics in environmental health and very up to dateweakness: the lectures and session are too independent in the first half of the semester, they improved it after the mid-term evaluation",
    "As an introductory course, this class was okay.As a second year, I thought it was way too basic and kind of a waste of time. Would strongly suggest students take the course in their first yearstrengths- gain a broad understanding of environmental issues, teaches you to be aware of these issuesweaknesses- the lecture and the discussion did not go hand-in-hand. the two professors had starkly different approaches which made for a confusing semester. definitely need to work out the kinks in the flow of material and continuity of assignments",
    "Strengths: the material in the course can engage individuals from all departments as it is both broad enough to cover many subjects, and specific enough to be relevant and interesting.Weaknesses: the 2 hours and 50 minutes lecture makes it difficult for the professor to retain student's attention. This class could be much better if this session was split into two classes.",
    "Strengths: I learned a lot of information about a variety of EH topics and we were encouraged to think about the topics in a way that related to our individual interests and departments.Weaknesses: The class set up was a bit chaotic but I attribute that to the redesign. I think the lecture could be effectively done in 90 minutes and the discussion session could be an hour and twenty minutes. I think the little questions to determine attendance are kind of unnecessary.Unfortunately, I think the last two years of bad reviews and complaints about the class biased people going into it and the restructuring won't get a fair critique which is unfortunate because it seems like they are actually trying to change this class based on feedback but the transition years are always hard.My biggest complaint is that there is absolutely no transparency in the grading critera and you don't know how much individual assignments count for, etc.",
    "This class was a disappointment. The lecture was too basic and long regularly going over the allotted time. I don't feel I learned very much from the lecture. The section was a completely separate class which increased the work load substantially. Though I understand it was the first time teaching it this was the assignments in section felt poorly organized and too vague to get much out of them.",
    "I think the lecture seems to be a little easier given it is a 500 level graduate course. The disscussion session appears to be detached from the lecture and the topic of discussion is vague and inpractical. Also the workload of discussion session is too much.",
    "I did not learn anything substantive other than reinforcement of the obvious facts: pollution, food deserts, etc produce negative implications for our society. It is very, very easy, and to that point, I would recommend fulfilling the Public Health requirement with this course over Toxicology. That said, this class was very much a waste of time. For the midterm, I studied for 2 hours total and got an A. That should not happen in a graduate course.I enjoyed the section more than the lectures because pertinent cases were presented which gave a more applicable framework for graduates studying Public Health. If I were to take another environmental health related course again, I would look into FES over YSPH.I do not take the time to evaluate most courses, as most are above average, but it was painful to sit in the lectures on Mondays. This is a high school level course, with the material taught being at the middle or high school level. Graduate studies should push the boundaries of what is known already.",
    "I loved this course. At first, I felt that there wasn't as much connection between lecture and session, but after revisions were made, I really felt they complemented each other well. A shorter, smaller discussion session really helped me better understand case studies and hazard analyses.",
    "The class was a bit disorganized and sections seemed very different from the lectures.",
    "I understand that environmental health is necessary for all MPH candidates, but it was not the most engaging class I have taken. Assignments are not what engage students, so the weekly questions just felt like a test to make sure we were doing the reading.",
    "Strengths:A bootcamp to understand historical and contemporary environmental health issuesWeaknesses:1. Very bad powerpoint slides2. Unstructured- Two classes per week for a subject that teaches basic environmental health science is not required. It does not allow students to take other courses that they might want to take purely out of passion",
    "Course objective is too broad which made the professor cover topics that could have been several courses in themselves. A lot of material was covered, but as it was a survey course was difficult to present in a coherent, cohesive, and detailed fashion. Difficult to follow at times.",
    "I wasn't very enthusiastic for this course, but took it because it is a mandatory requirement. Overall, I like that I know more about concepts that I didn't know before. I think it's important to understand current environmental health topics as they are often current public health topics. So I liked the overview that I got. However, I found the course challenging, because it was difficult to understand what I needed to take away. The materials weren't too organized and I wasn't quite sure what I had to learn. It would be better if there were fewer slides per lecture and those slides only focused on the key concepts to take away.",
    "The classroom lecture and the case sessions were disconnected although a lot of effort was put to connect them. It often felt like we were taking two courses. The case session would be helpful if we had a real case study and we evaluated strategies or we went over a relevant issue in a systematic way rather than ambiguous ways.",
    "I think the discussion sections are interesting and engaging. I thought the lecture sections were much too long, and not particularly interesting. I understood the connection between the lecture and the discussion, but the course still needs a lot of work in terms of effectively joining those two components.",
    "I actually preferred the case studies part of the course over lecture. It was interesting we are able to kind of figure out how to tackle a wide variety of issues from different angles. It was better later in the course when we formed groups that had people with different different specialties in them so that people learn how to work together when they come from different settings.The two sections of the class did not connect directly so I kind of separated them in my head. In lecture there is a lot of material covered in class (which is fine) but it doesn't always seem as cohesive as it could be. I struggle a bit in terms of knowing whether we are supposed to be memorizing every detail on the slides and specific facts (like you would if you are being tested on a multiple choice exam) or whether we should be able to explain the overall picture of health\/concerns\/issues that may come up within a particular topic of EHS, such as the built environment, etc. Other than that, what I have heard is that people are a bit confused in terms of how we are being assessed and what expectations are in terms of assignments. I know it says that it'll be approximately half and half between lecture and the case studies portion but I think people (myself included) like numbers. So people don't know I guess what the breakdown is for grading so people are having trouble tracking their progress.The case studies segment really has potential. It appeals to my natural desire to want to figure out how to solve problems rather than just saying that a problem exists. And, I think it is a great way to see how different individuals approach problems and facilitates discussion. But, I think they should be a little more structured. It's a little too vague in terms of what expectations are.",
    "I think it is very interesting material, but the class was poorly structured. I was never really sure what was expected. I think the class could be better structured if there was more connect between the lecture and the sessions component.",
    "This course was varying and disorganized at times. The lectures were long so when it came time to study it was difficult to know what to focus on. Please provide study guides in the future.",
    "This course could be improved if it looked at specific environmental health cases and taught us the basics through case studies rather than lectures.",
    "I had never taken an environmental health course before and found that I often talked excitedly with friends about what I had learned in this course. Although it was a survey course, I felt that focusing in more depth on some topics would have been highly beneficial. I also didn't always feel like the lecturers themselves were cohesive or flowed properly into the next topic.I enjoyed the creativity of the assignments for the section portion of the class. I also liked that we often had to draw upon our concentration of interest while discussing in section. However, I felt like a more organized type of interactive problem would have improved the section time.",
    "Strengths: A good introductory course to various important environmental topics.Weakness: Lecture was not very engaging, the whole course was too general, hard to identify what were important. The exams did not reflect the course materials, and overall, I did not feel I learnt much from this course.",
    "Meredith Stowe's SectionStrengths - Covered a variety of interesting material. The final required us to apply knowledge we had learned in the course.Weaknesses - The course material and homework assignments were not at all challenging. The course seemed to focus more on environmental issues instead of environmental HEALTH issues. I think most public health students would prefer to learn about the health implications of these environmental issues, rather than hearing what the issues are since most of us are already aware of the current issues. E.g. we learned about the water cycle and global warming which most of us already know. Also, I would prefer not to have crossword puzzles assigned for homework in a graduate school course.------------Catherine Yeckel's SectionStrengths - It was great to have smaller sections, so that students had more opportunities to share their ideas. It was also helpful to be divided up by departments during discussions, so we could understand environmental issues from a variety of perspectives.",
    "Although the course was good, the separate discussion group was almost like a different class, which added to the workload.",
    "very disorganized, some interesting public health topics were mentioned but nothing was explained in detail, the connection between lecture and the session was weak",
    "The lecture part taught by Dr. Stowe was good. A bit basic, like a high school science class, not challenging at all, but covered the basics. It was interesting and gave a good overview of environmental science. I'd suggest the material should be a little more in depth and challenging and more current.The discussion section was useless in my opinion. It did not follow the lecture much if any at all. The structure was not good, the assignments didn't have any value, and class discussion always felt forced and confusing.One complaint for both classes is we never had a clear outline of the class. Like there will be x y z assignments worth this many points and this many points is a pass, this is a high pass, etc. Especially for the discussion section we were never told if we would be graded on assignments and how much they would be worth. It's annoying to learn you wasted time working on a paper that wasn't worth any points.This class was like taking two separate classes, not like a discussion addition to lecture. Taking two midterms, two finals, etc wasn't fair.",
    "The course was poorly structured and did not have consistently through the lectures and discussions. While the lecture attempted to provide a basis for the information, it was filled with information that the students were not sure to digest. The discussion left many open ended questions which left the students frustrated since many topics felt like they were very similar. Perhaps a better lecture and discussion that integrates the topics would help to reinforce the material and not confuse the students.",
    "The class was a very general intro course. It felt more like a spew of information was thrown at us vs. a learning experience.",
    "The course was very informative and the material was presented in a clear manner.",
    "This was a good course to introduce one to environmental health studies. I enjoyed the weekly homework assignments and I found the readings very interesting. It would be great if the readings were incorporated more into the class part of the course but overall, I learned a lot of useful information that affected my personal lifestyle choices as well. I think maybe the class time is a little long and can be reduced to an hour and twenty minutes.",
    "I realize that by nature a \"introduction to environmental health\" course is really scattered, but it seems like the course was much too segmented each lecture. I was really confused about what would be on the exams, and felt like it was a mix of having too general of concepts and too specific of slides.",
    "n\/acourse requirement was waived",
    "This course was too basic for the graduate level.",
    "Strengths: The instructors are really committed, the topic selection was great, the tie to real life examples and topic events highlighted the importance of discussing these issues.Weaknesses: The weekly homework for the lectures felt a bit like high-school attendance checking. Perhaps something more meaningful, like a 2 page essay on the last three week's of lectures might provide a better learning opportunity than weekly trivia.",
    "I really enjoyed the course--I had not had any sort of environmental health class before and I really learned a lot. The section was a bit disjointed from the lecture, although I enjoyed sections and the assignments we did. I wish there had been a little more guidance about what to expect on the midterm and final.",
    "strengths - covered a lot of environmental topicsweakness - discussion and lecture sessions were not in syncDifference in evaluation demands from discussion and lecture sessions was somewhat frustrating.",
    "This is a great course if you are looking to learn about the very basics of environmental health science. The best way to improve it would be to increase the overlap of topics covered in the lecture and discussion.",
    "great course to give you a overall understanding of the big issues in comtemparary environmental health and give you more insight into issues in daily lives such as food safety and the spread of chemical pollutants.",
    "The material is really interesting, but the lecture format was often dry. Extended lecturing was not the best way to present lots of interesting topics. Also, the sessions often seemed disconnected from the lecture. Generally, the class seemed like a huge survey course with not enough of a theme connecting different lectures.",
    "too much workload and seperate exams",
    "This course provided a general overview of the environmental issues. As a course in the graduate school, its level of difficulty could be higher. Also, the discussions could be better integrated with lectures and aim to be more focused and constructive.",
    "The course is helpful in providing and overview of environmental health, it covers a wide array of topics in a good way. To improve the course I would make work in the sessions more related to class work. Assignments in the could be more sessions are open but this can be confusing, they could be clearer.",
    "Given the breadth of material this course has to cover small assignments such as the weekly assignments do ensure students read material beforehand. Lectures occasionally seemed top-heavy with information. Also while there were many changes to the class structure this semester, most students tend to consider discussion as an extension of lecture topics; while I enjoyed both lecture and discussion it almost seemed like two different classes tied together by name. One may want to consider renaming the two portions as lecture. Also decreasing discussion size half-way through the semester def. improved the discussion section.",
    "I am sorry to say that this was definitely one of the worst classes I have taken both in undergrad and grad school.",
    "This class was taught at a level far below what I would expect from a graduate level class, or even an undergraduate level class. The level of material and discussion was disappointing."

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0I enjoyed having Dr. Yeckel as a professor. She was always very patient and willing to help with questions both inside and outside of class. I also appreciated that she asked us what our interests were in the beginning of the course so that she could tailor the topics to those that would be the most interesting to the students.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very approachable and seemed interested in improving the class, but also seemed not to be able to translate student suggestions and complaints into improvements. Was not very clear in giving assignments. Most of the time in section, everyone in my group agreed that we had no idea what she was asking us to do.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel' sections were far more interesting and interactive than lecture. We actually had the opportunity to delve into some interesting issues, though most of the class seemed bored the majority of the time. There should have been more readings assigned for section, and fewer, but longer assignments that allowed us to delve into a few issues in detail.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She is enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but has a different communication style then at least I do and I know a few other people. Our assignments and discussions guidelines were unclear, and thus I don't think I got much out of it. We sometimes focused on things that we have discussed many times throughout the core curriculum and would have liked to discuss something new.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She has difficulty asking questions that require meaningful answers - her questions are often vague and you end up bs'ing everything (and getting away with it). hat being said, she was herself a knowledgeable, passionate instructor and eager to engage all of her students.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0strength: very nice and easy goingweakness: i didn't think i leant a lot from the discussions though...",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel allowed students to engage in the practice of environmental science, both by making relevant, current issues the topic of discussion, and by assigning group projects that allowed to analyze some of the course topics in greater depth.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Catherine Yeckel: I greatly respect the fact that she chose to teach the four sections which was probably very difficult rather than rely on a TF who may or may not know anything about EHS. I thought she made an effort to tailor assignments to a variety of interests and she is one of the few professors in YSPH that seems to understand the need to help people improve their writing. The frustrating thing is she doesn't always clearly communicate what she wants and while there seems to be a lot of room for creativity and individualization, when she grades she seems to know what she wants so it is difficult to understand her expectations. She was very good at solicting feedback and incorporating it. She seemed geniunely interested in making this a valuable course and I think she is really good teacher.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Really enthusiastic and she clearly gave it a good effort.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0I hope the homework problems and the dicussion topics could be less vague and more relavant to lectures.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Strengths: She seemed to care about students, and I appreciate that she changed the section time to 1-hour blocks. She was also very responsive to email, which I appreciated. I enjoyed most of the cases presented.Improvements: The structure of some of the assignments were very vague, and I found myself writing in hopes that I was touching on key concepts that she wanted. This could easily be improved upon with examples and specific frameworks. Most of the assignments were the same (aka risk assessment\/management), so I did not feel like I was continuously learning throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0I loved Dr. Yeckel. Her passion for the material made me excited for the class and her kindness and approachability helped me master the material.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel was incredibly sensitive to those of us in the class with other MPH focuses. I appreciated that she worked so hard to integrate and show value in all of our different perspectives.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Weaknesses:UnstructuredLack of coherence between content taught in the lectures by Prof. Stowe and discussion sessions taught by Prof. Yeckel",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Case-study sessions were good. Helped provide a real-world scenario to ruminate on, but could have been better if the slides were posted ahead of time to get acquainted with the topic. Sometimes this course felt like 2 separate courses---extra papers and assignments specifically for this course that were not really relevant to the lecture course. But overall, provided good thought exercises.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy was great! She's clearly very responsive to student feedback as she changed the session times and made them more frequent. She's very passionate about these topics and the students' learning. She really cares, which is great! I'd say that for the sessions, we were always a bit rushed. So less lecture and more discussion time would be great. In terms of discussion, sometimes the instructions were a little vague. So even having a framework that students should use in their discussion could help. I understand that part of it could be to exercise creativity, but sometimes that's difficult to do when you don't have a starting structure. Frameworks could even be handed out as part of discussion or even a set of thought starter questions for the cases. Another idea is reading the case study in advance (i.e. Everyone reads the same case) and then discussion in class.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel tried hard to connect the session piece with the lecture but it didnt feel like it was successful all the time. She is very knowledgeable but often it is unclear what she expects from the assignments. I'm sure since this is the first time the sessions will be structured in a better way next year. She is very responsive to questions and is very approachable.",

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0First off I think she is a great person, very kind and willing to help and genuinely wants her students to learn, so I feel bad saying anything negative about her, but the way she conducted this course could have been MUCH better.Assignments were unclear, too open ended and not relevant to the lecture. Any clarification she would provide just made things more confusing. I think she was trying to keep it open to give us variety and flexibility to make the material work for our own personal interests, but I felt that made it more difficult and helped me learn less.The structure of discussion classes was painful. Discussions were awkward and Cathy would ask us questions and keep pushing us for answers and no one ever knew what she was talking about.She also would \"call out\" students for good and bad reasons in front of the class which was unfair and best and embarrassing at worst. It's not ok to critique a student's homework assignment in front of the entire class.The idea of trying to make case studies out of current events is a good idea, but it was extremely poorly executed.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel was a very understanding instructor who could take on the students' perspectives.

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr Yeckel is a great professor. She did a great job of finding interesting articles for us to read about and she made the discussion sessions very interesting. I always looked forward to her mini vignettes and writing assignments. She did a good job of engaging everyone in the class and she finds ways to make the class more interesting, and enjoyable for us.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel was very genuine in class, and it seemed she really wanted to keep the discussion flowing, even when the class was not very responsive.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0The session were very informative and interesting. They were well taught!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Catherine is a very committed lecturer, very responsive, and overall encouraging. I enjoyed having here as an instructor.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is very very approachable, friendly, and knowledgable. I appreciate how much time she spent re-working sections, and I enjoyed working through as many case studies as we did.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Discussion session instructor, I believe.Great teacher.Her assignment prompts were almost always vague though.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She was fantastic in this course. She took our feedback and improved the course in many ways. The only bad thing was the times of discussion that were later changed, but that was to improve class size.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0is very passionate and patient . Always fully prepared for the discussion session and is very devoted to teaching.It will be great if clearer instruction for the goal of discussion could be given. e.g., an example could be given before.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0very responsible and devoted",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is very passionate in her teaching and put forth a lot of effort during the discussion session. Some interesting topics were discussed during the sessions. However, the materials taught during the sessions are less helpful than I expected to work around environmental issues.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is a great instructor, she cares that the students understand and promotes discussion in class. She could improve by being clearer about what she wants in her assignments.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very knowledgeable and passionate about environmental health topics. Good at leading discussion and finding case studies that were interesting and current. A pleasure to talk to outside of class. Exams were clearly defined beforehand. Appreciated her time and commitment to run small discussion sections which really improved my course experience.Could have sent assignment reminders out earlier or outlined them in a syllabus at beginning of course.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She tries really hard to engage the students in class, but most of the time she is very, very confusing--does not explain things clearly and does not outline her expectations for the weekly assignments very well. Moreover, her discussion section does not correlate with the main lecture and felt more like a separate course all together. It just meant we had double the work each week for this class.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe is great instructor. She explained things very thoroughly. Great introductory course.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Stowe is brilliant but lacks skills of holding the attention of the class. Monday session is too long and Stowe goes through information that are basic and unnecessary for students at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0I thought Dr. Stowe was a great professor, from the perspective of someone who had never taken an environmental health course before. She went through the material at a manageable speed and presented various examples for the topics. I also really liked how she brought in current events, which reminded me how current and important environmental health is!",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Should organize lectures more clearly.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Professor Stowe seems very nice and knowledgable but the lecture is truly painful to sit through. It's not interactive, it's boring, it's at's a 7th grade level, and I leave lecture every week having learned almost nothing new, and I am not even knowledgable about environmental health. When I think about the worst uses of PowerPoint, I think of this class. Nothing is structure well, nothing is interactive, nothing is challenging, and very little is educational.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0I liked this portion of the class but it was very long, it would be nice to have the lecture split up into 1.5 hour sections and not have a discussion.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Friendly and personable, and clearly passionate about environmental health. However, the fact that she essentially stood up and read 80 slides\/class really did not encourage attendance at her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0strength: very nice professorweakness: slides are super long",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe provided us with a significant amount of information through the course, taking some broad subjects that might have been less interesting, and emphasizing portions of them that were relevant to us as public health students.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith Stowe: She works to ensure that the information is general enough for everyone to understand it and explains how it relates to all of the different areas of public health. The tests are fair. Unfortunately, the lectures are too long and too rambling. She could organize them better and be more succinct. Also, the class continuously runs late which is unfair for those of us who have 3PM classes. I appreciate that she graded our exams and not a teching assistance (unless ther was a ghost grader--then she should recognize that fact). Also, she also solicted feedback and tried to incorporate the feedback.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Fine",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Strengths: Professor Stowe seemed to care about the material and put a lot of thought into her slides.Improvements: The material needs to be more applicable. Everybody knows that asbestos and toxic materials dumped from companies are not good for the environment. Focusing lectures on these relatively obvious facts leads students to be unmotivated to listen. The material 100% should change in focus and be more applicable to students at the graduate level. This is the only course in Environmental Health for most Public Health students, and I learned very minimal substantive information that I will incorporate into my future career endeavors.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0I really enjoyed having Dr. Stowe as my instructor. Her lectures were interesting and I felt she did a thorough job covering lecture content and reading materials.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Professor Stowe worked hard to engage a large lecture hall of students, many of whom are not in envirnomental health tracks. I appreciated her lecture style and humor.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Strengths:Receptive to students complaints",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Lectures covered broad topics that were difficult to go into detail, but instructor tried her best to provide the basics. Slides were often upwards of 80 slides. Could be more informative if the topics were narrowed down or the course split into 2 days instead of 1 long lecture.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith is clearly very passionate about these topics. Her eyes light up when she talks about these issues. I think the lectures could be more effective if less was covered in a given topic and there was a cohesive storyline. I found the slides hard to follow.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe always had interesting stuff put in her slides but the lectures were too long. She was great.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She was very friendly and passionate about environmental health. Her lectures are MUCH too long - often as much as 85 slides - seems as though they could be condensed to keep people engaged for longer periods of time.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Lecture has some interesting information but is scattered. I wish that this portion focused on some more specific examples and then had us discuss them in class. The power points were very cluttered with information and it was difficult to come away with the take home messages. Expectations were unclear for finals and midterms. Discussion and analysis was limited.This class has potential. I would consider splitting it up into two classes both of which satisfy the EHS requirement: one for those who want a broader survey approach and one for those who want to focus on discussion of case studies. Having two professors with very different approaches was particularly challenging. A more cohesive class would make this class better and more useful.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Lectures were too long so there was not enough time to interact with the class and talk about relevant topics.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Seems very knowledgeable on the material.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe definitely cares a lot about students and her passion for environmental health shows. I would suggest that she spend more time on certain topics rather than glazing over many per lecture. I would also suggest some modification of the weekly assignments, since they seemed that they were most for attendance rather than participation purposes.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Overall, I felt the lectures were not very engaging. All of the information can be learnt just by looking at the lecture slides.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Was good at explaining material to students. Would prefer more challenging material",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Loved the lectures. Interesting, and well organized.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0lectures were rather dry, slides were disorganized, exams focused on small details and when she was asked to provide a practice exam or an idea of questions that would be on the exam, the questions that appeared on the actual exam were not at all representative of the practice",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She's good. Class discussions were good, lecture was a bit boring, but she would get us involved in discussions which was good. I would suggest that she update her slides and have less of them. Too many were just figures she glossed over that didn't add anything to the experience. Midterm and final were very fair. Questions of the day were a good way to get us thinking about the topic for the day and learning some interesting facts.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Professor Stowe is very knowledgeable and informed the students about new topics that many were not aware of. However, her lectures felt disorganized or full of too much content for the students to fully understand and appreciate the material.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She seemed to have a general interest in the class and course, but seems to have been teaching it for awhile with little revision. The lectures felt like random sharing of information on topics, and the tests were mostly memorization.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Did a great job presenting the material.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr Stowe is a great professor. Shedid a great job of finding interesting articles for us to read about and she made the homework assignments very interesting. I always looked forward to her weekly assignments. She did a good job of engaging everyone in the class and she finds ways to make the class more interesting, and enjoyable for us.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0I appreciate that Dr. Stowe tried to modify the course at midterm, but I did not feel engaged during the lectures and felt sometimes that I really did not need to be present to learn the material.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0The lectures were too elementary for graduate level work.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith was similarly very open, responsive, and tried hard to deliver a good course.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe is very knowledgable and approachable. I enjoyed her lectures and learned a great deal from her class. I appreciated doing the questions of the week before each class.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Lecture session instructor, I believe.Meredith was not very responsive to students' feedback.I also think she should not have required physical copies of the weekly assignment. It seemed counter intuitive to ask the entire class to turn in sheets of paper in a class that promotes \"going green.\"",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She was a very good lecturer, it was just hard to follow for two hours, but she always had in depth knowledge of every topic. Going into greater depth for each topic we discuss would be great in the future.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0is nice, clear in logic and fun in teaching. The topic she chose were very interesting and can be delivered in a easily understandable way.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Very nice teacher",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe provided a good overview of the environmental issues up-to-data. The concepts and materials taught in class could be deeper and involve some practical skill building.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Great instructor, provides a great overview of environmental health. Because there is so much to cover classes and slides can become very long, maybe if it could be summarized more or choose less topics to cover but more in depth the class could be improved.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Very knowledgeable about occupational health and environmental conservation. Lectures were well prepared. Occasionally slides were too full of information so that during test time it was occasionally unclear what would be covered and what was an example of case-study. Weekly assignments were interesting and I liked that they were always referenced in lecture.Could have references topics covered in discussion more often to tie to areas together.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Not engaging at all. Lecture material very disjointed."

    "I would not recommend this course to others because of the long Monday session out of which I do not gain information that I am looking for at this school.",
    "This course provides a very broad overview of the main topics of environmental health. It is structured so that you have a lecture each week on a different environmental health topic and a smaller discussion section each week to examine a case study that relates to the overarching topic of the week. The work load for this course was less than for other courses I have taken, and so it is not as challenging, but very practical. I would recommend this course.",
    "I would never recommend this class to a fellow student, though it is required, and I've heard that as bad as it is, it is still better than toxicology, which is sad and incredible.",
    "A good overview of environmental issues as they apply to health. I would definitely recommend over toxicology.",
    "This class is absolutely worthless. I did nothing and barely went to class and did very well in it. It ended up essentially being two separate classes (and yes, there were two midterms AND finals). Save yourself a waste of money and time and take something you're actually interested in, or a class where you'll actually learn something worth learning.",
    "It's a core, so take it..",
    "Contemporary Issues of Environmental Health provides a student with a novel and engaging way of learning a subject, and then making it relevant through its application in global issues in health and safety. I would recommend this course to students, especially if they wanted to hone in on the type of health issue they are most interested in.",
    "I think this is a decent core course. If you don't have the background to take toxicology and Borack creeps you out, this is a great option. I learned new information and enjoyed the assignments. You need to be comfortable with a little ambiguity for the section but it actually makes it kind of fun.",
    "I would strongly encourage students to explore other options to fill this requirement.",
    "I do not recommend this course if you have some background in evironmental health, most of the topics are broad and simple.",
    "Easy A. Boring. A good time to get other work done.",
    "I really enjoyed the class and would recommend it to other students. I felt I learned a lot about the environment and environmental health that helps me make sense of other case studies. I felt the discussion session built upon lecture materials and really enjoyed both lecture and discussion sections.",
    "It is a required course, so you have to take it. But I learned alot about current environmental health issues (which I appreciate).",
    "Okay, but do not take if interested in more specific environmental health topics. This is a survey course.",
    "Gives an overview of environmental health topics that are currently debated. It's a course that gives a broad overview rather than deeply focusing on a topic.",
    "Good course to finish of EHS requirement. Not too much work!",
    "I think that this course could be a really cool mix between basic environmental science and public health, but joining the two still needs a lot of work. I would recommend focusing on a few smaller environmental health issues and really digging deeper into the management and assessment of them. Even if it means spending more than one class period per topic, the course seems too broad as it stands.I would recommend the course to someone in their first semester because it is manageable while getting used to the graduate schedule.",
    "Has potential.",
    "We deserve to be challenged more as Yale students.",
    "This is a general survey course of environmental health issues as they relate to public health. I would not recommend this course to another student because a lot of the information is very basic and you may leave the course without feeling as though you learned anything substantial.",
    "A good survey course in environmental health that could use some improvements in cohesiveness and organization.",
    "Meredith Stowe's lecture portion of this section is helpful to someone who does not have any background information on current environmental issues.",
    "I would reconsider the idea of separating the course into the sections, but it adds more work. It's almost like singing up for two classes.",
    "One of the core courses, it's not a lot of work.",
    "I'd say as is this course is very painful, but not hard. Just annoying in an \"I'm not learning anything useful\" kind of way, and doing assignments that aren't worth any points and don't teach you anything, just waste your time. However it was very, very easy.",
    "This course is basically 2 courses for one of the introductory courses for public health. Be prepared to take 2 midterms and 2 finals that do not necessarily overlap. However, I would recommend this course over the other requirement for EHS, since this course seems more applicable to the overall public health issues. I also think that this course has great potential since it can attract people to be more environmentally friendly if it finds the right strategy to engage the students.",
    "A very easy but not very worthwhile classthat will give you a very basic understanding of environmental health",
    "Great course!",
    "This course provides a good introduction to environmental health for anyone who is interested in pursuing a public health career. I would highly recommend this course to another student because I learned so much.",
    "It's structured the same way as a introductory course in college is, with a new topic every week. It's not necessarily a difficult class, and the instructors clearly care about the course, but navigating through the expectations is difficult.",
    "It's a brief overview of environmental health science topics.",
    "Environmental health is an important course and part of the requirements. I enjoyed this course and would recommend it to fellow students.",
    "Very interesting, broad introduction to environmental health--very much recommended!",
    "The discussion and evaluation syllabi and evaluation need to be in better sync.",
    "This is a great course that will help you determine whether or not you are interested in EHS. It fulfills a requirement for you, does not take up an ungodly amount of time at home, and is interesting.",
    "It is a good course to have a overall understanding of environmental health. yes",
    "Interesting material, but lectures are long and often pretty dry.",
    "okay",
    "no",
    "Yes. Many small assignments, but interesting material and good course instructors."
