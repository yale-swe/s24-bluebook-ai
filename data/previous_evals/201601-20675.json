    "Yes! As far as Directed Studies classes go, Professor Darwall's class was the perfect level of challenging and enjoyable.",
    "Overall, I loved this class because it was engaging, had a well-chosen reading syllabus, and didn't claim to be a complete overview of its content material. I welcome that Directed Studies continues to be an ever-evolving program that refuses to leave behind the classics but also increasingly places these works in their historical context and modern context. Professor Darwall is one of those rare instructors that has all of the qualities you want in a professor. He is extremely knowledgeable and cares deeply about what he teaches. He also cares deeply for his students and loves to engage them in and out of class. Office hours were plentiful and he makes a real effort to understand all of his students. If you are questioning taking or continuing DS, please, stick with it! Even if you didn't like philosophy in the fall, Professor Darwall does an incredible job of making clear the meaning of philosophy and the role of the philosopher.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I especially enjoyed the time we spent discussing ethics.",
    "Don't expect to understand anything from the month and a half you spend on Kant, Hegel, and Hume.",
    "A rigorous survey of the philosophical western canon, will be incredibly useful in honing your critical thinking, analytic and writing skills.",
    "Very hard and intense course. More than the fall correspondent. Really remarkable.",
    "An overview of the foundational works of modern Western philosophy. I would recommend it to another student for the reasons listed above."
