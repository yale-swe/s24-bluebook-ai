    "Definitely! I learned so much, and Lourdes is amazing.",
    "I did not take L1 Spanish, so I do not have a comparison. I thoroughly enjoyed Spanish 120. It moves quickly, but the teachers are willing to work with you and help you. I feel like not only do you get a grasp on the language itself, but also the Spanish culture. If you are interested in Spanish, I highly recommend taking Spanish.",
    "I would recommend and I did recommend.",
    "Profesora Sabe is amazing and you should definitely try to take her section. I really liked that she NEVER spoke to us in English (it only happened like once during the semester); it really helps you get a handle over the language a lot more quickly. She also tries her best to make the class extra fun, as often as possible (chocolates, mexican cookies, etc).",
    "The quantity\/volume of exercises may be daunting, but the format may be sufficient for you to maintain your interest for the entire course."
