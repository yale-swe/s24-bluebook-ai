   "comments": [
    "This class has a lot of reading that can get difficult to finish when you've work for other classes, but overall it's eye-opening, and I'd definitely recommend it",
    "You will learn the ins and outs of the Rwandan genocide! Absolutely terrific class, nice balance of lecture and student contribution though I always enjoyed the lecture bit more. If you can get in, take this class! Plus, Professor Simon has a great sense of humor and is so very kind.",
    "Definitely!",
    "If you're interested in African Studies or any from of human rights or humanitarian work I would definitely recommend it. If you're not the topic may seem tedious (although it's still important)",
    "It's an interesting course and an important subject to study. The class is well-structured with a good balance of class discussion with speakers, debates, and simulations. There are a few small assignments, but Professor Simon did not always return them promptly.",
    "Definitely take it! This class was really great. I feel like I learned so much about the Rwandan genocide and about genocide studies in general. I really have found it truly truly valuable. One weakness is that the professor tends to lecture a lot, and so there is less discussion. So keep that in mind. Also we didn't always talk about the readings of that week during class, which was a little bit confusing for the structure.",
    "This is a really great class about genocide. Do not be fooled by the title, as you will do no \"comparing\" to other genocides. It is completely about Rwanda. There is a fairly large amount of reading, but it is do-able. I felt like this class was more of a small lecture than a seminar, because Professor Simon spent a lot of time telling us information about Rwanda. That is not to say that we did not have in class discussions.",
    "An in-depth look at a crisis that everyone should know more about.",
    "I took this class because I knew little about Rwanda (and Africa in general). Whil I learned a lot about the genocide (and international law), concentrating on just one three-month event meant the course felt a bit thin at times. Plus, to be honest- it's just depressing. I could engage for the first month but after that my reading just dropped off because the subject is so dark. Be aware. Plus, at least 25 pages of writing over the course of the semester. Prof. Simon is nice though.",
    "Yes! Great class, lovely professor, hard-hitting readings."
