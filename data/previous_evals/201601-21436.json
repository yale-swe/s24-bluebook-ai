    "German is a hard language but it feels rewarding when you do take it. Yale languages are very intense so be prepared do constantly do work for this class! Great experience!",

    "This course is a great way to start off learning German. The course moves quickly through a lot of material, but it's all very worth it. The class is small which gives you plenty of time to practice and learn. I would definitely take it!"
