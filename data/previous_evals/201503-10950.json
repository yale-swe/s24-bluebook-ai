    "The class where you get to know the faculty. Certainly recommended as knowing the faculty is necessary.",
    "It's a great way to become familiar with the department as a first year student. I would recommend it to other students but it's also required so they really don't have a choice, now do they?",
    "EEB 500 is a weekly seminar series for first year students, in which you hear from faculty in EEB and other affiliated departments about their ongoing research. The intimate setting allows for discussion of various related topics in ecology, evolution, and biology, which is encouraged by the faculty. Even if we were not required to take this course, I would recommend it because I think learning about research being done at Yale is incredibly important to taking full advantage of the resources here. This is especially true of speakers who are not primary faculty in our department."

   "comments": [
    "I was able to meet professors from the department that I otherwise may not have met for a year or two, particularly professors who share appointments in other departments. Forming relationships with other researchers is invaluable.",
    "This course exposes students to research being done at Yale, and to a variety of topics in ecology and evolution. Being so broad, it's difficult to say how this will contribute to my future research. However, I learned a lot just from the brief exposure to each topic and will likely follow up on some of the research we discussed."
