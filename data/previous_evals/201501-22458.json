    "Take this course. It's amazing - you learn so much. Very valuable continuation of MB&B 300. All pre-meds and anyone interested in biochemistry should take this course. It's 100% worth the work.",
    "This is an amazing course - take it and you will learn so much, and gain so much enthusiasm about the subject!!! the lecturers are amazing, and Joan Steitz is but the cherry on top. Great course. Take it. It's SO worth the work. It will make you love the work. You can't regret it!!",
    "very hard but rewarding and interesting material. well taught",
    "DNA, RNA, snRNPs, all of that fun stuff that you didn't get to talk about in biochem I. But definitely more enjoyable and interesting than Biochem I.",
    "Hard but useful\/applicable. I think if they're thinking of taking this it's probably because they have to so....",
    "An incredibly rich survey of how genetic information is passed down, stored, and used in living organisms. Understanding the machinery and systems you learn about in this class is critical to any higher-level molecular biology or biochemistry research. It is stressful to wade through so much information, especially since if you're taking the course you're probably MB&B, but it pays off in a huge way. I work in a lab and I would leave every lecture having learned something new that I could apply to the work I was doing in lab.",
    "Wow, I cannot believe I got through this course. Literally put my LIFE into it. The professors are really quite amazing. Schlieker's accent can be hard to get used to, but all professors have SO much knowledge and really know how to teach the material, which is GREAT because Yale professors generally don't know how to teach what they are so well-versed in on the research end. Had to put hours upon hours into this course. But really got a lot out of it.",
    "This is a tough class. It's one of the main classes that separates MB&B from MCDB. That being said, TAKE THIS CLASS. It'll be incredibly tough, the final was long and rough, but it is a very rewarding class and is very well taught. Professor Schliker was one of the best lecturers I have ever had, and Joan Steitz was amazing as well. Professor Neugebauer is a bit young, but I can see that she will also be a great lecturer in no time. Take this class (you have to for MB&B) and be prepared to work.",
    "A beautiful in-depth glimpse into the perhaps most difficult course of the MB&B major. However don't get dissuaded: after taking this class (whether you aced it or really, really failed at trying) afterwards, you feel like you might start to feel a real semblance to what a true biochemical scientist thinks and how they analyze problems in this complex yet fascinating field. To sum up some frustrations of this course: in essence, this is critical thinking for biochemistry--however, unlike English, where there are multiple interpretations and possible solutions to questions, in this class there are also multiple ways of tackling a problem and arriving at different conclusions\/answers, BUT THERE WILL ONLY BE ONE RIGHT ANSWER ACCEPTED AT THE END OF THE DAY!!! No points for \"trying\"--what is wrong is wrong! With that said, enjoy taking this course, not only will it stretch your boundaries like you never felt before, but you'll emerge out of it a better student and scientist!",
    "This class is really hard but when you finish you feel like you've learned something important (aka, how vital processes in eukaryotes and prokaryotes actually work on a biochemical level) as well as a lot of interesting material. Therefore, I would recommend the course, but only if you're interested in the sciences and can use the credit toward your major.",
    "MBB 301 is the most stressful and challenging course that I have taken at Yale. Every lecture is crammed full of material, and almost of the lectures ran over the 1 hour 15 minute class time-- which was annoying for those of us who had to walk from the Bass Center to Cross Campus for a 1PM class. The instructors cover material very quickly during lecture, and I often left class confused and had to spend a couple of hours each week reviewing that week's lectures. The workload was demanding (daily quizzes, weekly problem sets, two midterms, and one final), and the exam questions required critical reasoning that far surpassed what was covered in lecture. I found it difficult to ask for help in this class; because the lectures ran over time, there was little time to ask thoughtful questions during or after lecture. Also, two of the instructors had office hours at the medical school, and there was no Piazza page (the instructors claimed that Piazza fosters unhealthy stress, but honestly it seemed like they just wanted to avoid creating another avenue for students questions). This class definitely seemed like a weed out; I have enjoyed all of my science classes at Yale thus far (MBB 300 is my favorite class that I have ever taken), and I entered this class extremely enthusiastic about biochemistry and scientific research. Finishing off the semester, I feel exhausted, disheartened, and doubtful that I would be able to do well in a research career. Overall, I would only recommend this class to students who are passionate about research or are taking this course Cr\/D\/Fail.",
    "MB&B 301 is a good class, I liked it better than 300. It's not too much work and the material is very interesting and well explained by the professors and the textbook. The expectations in the class are very clear, which makes it very possible to do well.",
    "Really interesting stuff but a lot of it. Hardest class in the major by far.",
    "This is a fantastic course - one of the best I've taken at Yale. The instructors are incredibly knowledgeable, and in particular Prof. Steitz was actually actively involved in the research that led to the RNA-focused parts of the course, which is just awesome. The course is very close to what I want an ideal science class to be - it's focused on data and experimentation, and exams are largely focused on data analysis. If you have an interest in Biochemistry, take this course.",
    "MB&B 301 is a rigorous second-semester biochemistry course that you think will sink you at times (if you have other heavy courses or outside activities). For students who have lots of time on their hands, it is a manageable course but know you will spend A LOT of your time on it. The problem sets don't take an extraordinary amount of time but reviewing lectures and staying on top of the material before exams will. There is plenty of help in the course so absolutely take advantage of it (TAs, professor office hours, and discussion sections). You can do it!",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student if you have a moderate course load to focus a large amount of energy on this class. It can be discouraging as much of the test is dealing with experimental data and your studying might not yield an A. But if you want a solid ground on this material and want to challenge yourself with this class (and the major in general) I would highly recommend it.",
    "Horrible class. Tons of work. Tons of information. Brutal curve. Backbreaking treks up science hill. Don't do it. It's horrible. Do yourself a favor and become a MCDB major please. but if you're one of those premed curve destroyers who just like biochem, maybe you should take it. Or maybe I should just encourage you to take it so you can ruin your own life too.",
    "MB&B is very difficult, but extremely rewarding. This class singlehandedly taught me most of what I know about molecular biology and data analysis - and I am sad to see it end. The professors are all-stars, genuinely interested in your success, and always available to answer even very basic questions when you are confused. I would recommend this class to non-MB&B majors if you are interested in any sort of graduate program in biology or medical school, as it is so incredibly practical and helpful in advancing one's knowledge of biology.",
    "Biochem II is by far the hardest course I have taken at Yale. It was and will be very valuable to me thanks to it introducing tons of information to me and pushing me, but it was really, really hard to keep up with all the material. It's not a reason to not take the class, and you probably have to anyway, but be prepared to work your butt off in a way you probably haven't had to do before.",
    "Extremely challenging but you learn an incredible amount, and by the end you feel proud to have chosen MB&B as your major.",
    "The hardest class I have ever taken at Yale. I feel like it would be greatly improved if the instructors could make a key points summary per lecture because when I was studying for the final, our key terms sheet had like over 700 words, and that's not feasible because a lot of them were really vague anyways. Perhaps an enrichment section would be useful for this class? Regular section is not enough time to get through more than one experiment (out of like 5) per lecture considering how dense the material is.",
    "By far one of the best science classes I have taken since coming to Yale. You learn so much about the biochemistry involved in prokaryotic and eukaryotic replication, transcription, and translation. You also get to explore techniques in biochemistry, the biochemistry of lambda phage (viruses are awesome), immunology, and a little bit of development. Although there are a lot of details and things you have to memorize, the exams mostly involve critical thinking questions such as analyzing data and designing experiments. although there is a lot of information, this class taught me how to be a better scientist and I was actually able to apply what I learned in my own lab work. Part of the reason why this class was so great was that the professors were phenomenal at teaching. Christian Schlieker and Joan Steitz (OMG STEITZ) teach most of the class and their lectures are engaging and very informative. They really wanna make sure you understand the material. They were phenomenal professors. As for course details, the psets aren't too hard and the class curve is very competitive I guess because premeds and all. My advice: TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "Keep up with the lectures, because the info piles up. Also, pay attention to the problem sets and quizes because the same problems tend to show up on the exams. This is a lot more experiment based than 300. Expect the tests to consist of a blot or some other form of data, and to be asked to explain it. I think it's a lot more fun than 300, but then again, I'm a Biochem major. No idea how grading is going to work, but they said they would count the final more if you messed up on one of the midterms.",
    "An intensive survey of key processes in genetic and nucleotide biochemistry. It's certainly not an easy class, but the professors are really good and the information is really important, so it feels valuable to learn. The class covers a ton of material, which is daunting at times, but you leave feeling very accomplished.",
    "This course is essentially the central dogma in ridiculous amounts of detail and with an emphasis on the experimental methods used to understand everything we know about it. Harder than 300, but definitely worth the time it takes to learn the material. (Be warned: there is a LOT of material). Make sure to review the lectures every week; that'll make the p-sets (and the exams) much more tolerable.",
    "MB&B 301 is an excellent continuation of first semester biochemistry. In this course you delve deeper into how RNA and DNA work. As I'm sure other students will mention, a lot of homework and test questions will require you to be able to read gels and use your scientific intuition in order to come to conclusions, as some questions are directly adapted from results from scientific papers. Studying for this course is a lot of work, but if you work hard, you will be surprised at how much information you will retain. Additionally, the professors are are fantastic and are exceedingly open to patiently answering any questions that you may have during class, after class, and in office hours. Also, as a side note, it is especially amazing seeing Professor Steitz in pictures together with people who discovered the things we are learning about.",
    "I would absolutely recommend MB&B 301 to another MB&B or MCDB student. I recommend this course over the MCDB course and I would also recommend taking this course in conjunction with microbiology as well since quite a bit of the class material pairs very well.",
    "There are really only two things you need to know about this class: First, the material you learn is absolutely fascinating. Second, there is a vast amount of material you will be asked to learn. A lot of the class deals with very recent science, which is both exciting and a little difficult- at times while studying I didn't understand something from lecture and asked my TF about it only to discover that the reason I didn't understand it was that science doesn't actually understand it yet. If that's exciting to you, if you think you'd like to know fifteen reasons why RNA is much cooler than DNA, or if you're interested in seeing Joan Steitz's family photos with Nobel-prize-winning scientists, you'll enjoy this class. I would recommend it to another student (provided that student has studied proteins and DNA\/RNA before to some degree)with the caveat that it's probably not a class you should try to squeeze into an already taxing schedule. You CAN take it if you have other hard things, and if you put in the time to study for the exams you'll probably do okay, but if you have more time to put into understanding the material you'll be more able to be interested in what you're learning rather than panicking about it.",
    "Difficult course with an incredible breadth and depth of information. Tests are very demanding, and require an intimate familiarity with interpreting blots and making inferences off of class facts and out of class knowledge.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is by far the hardest, best biology class here at Yale. The very heavy experimental focus of the class causes you to think like an actual researcher and see biology completely different. Studying for a midterm is the equivalent of studying for a final as far as time is concerned so plan your schedule accordingly."
