    "If you have the opportunity to take this class, DO IT!!! Really. Not only is it an absolutely excellent overview on judgment and decision-making, but it also equips you with the skills necessary to conduct your own research.Professors Dhar and Novemsky have wonderful chemistry together, and they do a very good job of facilitating discussion. It's intellectual and thoughtful, but not pretentious or awkward. You will learn a lot yet at the same time not feel hesitant to contribute - the class has a very comfortable dynamic. You will look forward to it each week.I cannot recommend this class highly enough. You would be crazy not to want to take it - in which case it's all the more necessary that you take a class on decision-making!",
    "If you can get into this seminar, take it! Unlike almost any course you might find at the undergraduate level, this truly exposes you to a great breadth and depth (rare to have at the same time) in the literature of behavioral decision making. As an undergraduate, this experience has been incredibly helpful for more in thinking about how to approach my senior thesis; additionally, though, it is a course that will make you come home each week and look at moments throughout the week, seeing the very research you have studied at play. It's truly fascinating.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. I took it as a senior in Yale College, so my perspective might be a little different than that of a grad student, but I felt that I learned a lot about the topics covered. It's also a great forum for sparking ideas; I felt like I walked away from every class with notes about studies that would be really cool to run. Professor Dhar and Professor Novemsky are both fantastic.",
    "The basic course structure was three hours to go over three studies. When especially new topics would come up (about every 3 weeks or so), one of the professors would often give a 30-45 minute overview of the topic.At the start of the course, I had some trouble figuring out what to focus on with the literature. I would recommend reading the literature with an eye for1) Two-three sentence summary of the main findings.2) How the study could be extended\/refined in future studies.While I would recommend reviewing the methods and statistical findings, I would not have a critical perspective, searching for the flaws in the experimental findings and results, be the primary perspective a students uses.As mentioned, previously, my overall assessment: A very interesting course with a great syllabus and strong professors--a great way to learn about some of the ways our attention is likely to be manipulated and the effectsthat can have. If you like the syllabus, the real thing to keep in mind is whether you think the three hour length is too draining\/inefficient.",
    "The most essential class for a cb student."

    "It gave me a strong foundation for my senior thesis.Reading and analyzing academic papers each week was incredibly helpful in two ways:1) The professors picked important papers from different subfields of the decision-making literature. This helped me understand what research had been influential, what research is currently being done, and where opportunities are for future research. This perspective is valuable to get a feel for the state of research in different areas and to find an area that interests me and has relevant questions that I can answer through my own research.2) I learned how to design good studies through our class discussions. Analyzing the papers each week taught me how to eliminate confounds, prevent demand effects, and avoid countless other pitfalls. In addition to learning what I shouldn't do, I also learned what I SHOULD do in future research. So it was very helpful to build this framework from which I can now design effective studies.",
    "The anchoring day really helped me pull some things together. Enjoyed the discussion of adaptation a lot as well."
