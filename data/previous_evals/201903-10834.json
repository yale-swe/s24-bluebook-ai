    "I learnt the basics of microeconomic analysis and how to effectively use different economic concepts to understand the market economy.",
    "Thinking like an economist (more useful than you'd think), supply and demand, consumer theory, firm theory, different market structures",
    "Basic understanding of microeconomics and applications in our daily lives.",
    "Basic microeconomic knowledge, relatable applications in the real world, etc.",
    "I really learned quantitative analysis and learned the basics of microeconomics.",
    "Learned basic knowledge of how the consumer and producer operate in the market. Also learned how to think like an economist, relate global patterns to the economy.",
    "Knowledge of both quantitative and qualitative microeconomics. I feel very prepared to take intermediate microeconomics.",
    "I had no previous experience in the field of economics and I learned some basic concepts about supply and demand, market structures etc.",
    "I learned many new concepts in microeconomics, including indifference curves, duopoly models, and much more. I learned the importance of seminar classes, since we can be better engaged in the lectures and meet and study with the other students in the class.",
    "I developed a better understanding of how to analyze situations through an economic lens, specifically taking into account errors in logic which plague decision-making and how these pertain to large economic models at the individual firm, industry, and market levels. I also gained insight into how to conduct economic calculations in general."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was engaging because it was taught in a seminar-style, but I think more discussion could have aided my learning.",
    "Tolga is a phenomenal lecturer - entertaining, funny, wacky anecdotes, contagious laugh, life advice, thinks chickens are better than people, and sees econ everywhere. I genuinely looked forward to going to lecture because I did get a lot out of it conceptually. But quantitative ideas were somewhat better explained by the textbook (or by spending some time at office hours). Exam review sessions were really comprehensive though (and hosted at a time that is convenient for everyone). One thing that does feel very off is the dynamic. From the first day, it's established that the class is graded on a curve, which makes the vibe kinda competitive (read: very because we're comparing to normal Yale competitive), especially before and after exams when he talks about what you should study and where you are compared to everybody else. I know this keeps us all motivated, but it also creates a lot of unnecessary stress - shouldn't learning be about learning and not the grade? This a bad mindset to bring forward throughout the rest of your time at Yale given that this class is almost entirely first-years.",
    "Strengths: Tolga's lecture and notes are always very well organized and explained. He provides many real-world examples. Weaknesses: occasionally we would rush through some material and slowing down a bit might be good.",
    "Tolga's lectures were very well organized. Study groups were not helpful and teamwork within study groups or classmates was not emphasized, but would've been very helpful.",
    "Strengths: Tolga is one of the most entertaining lecturers ever. I was never bored in class. Weaknesses: Tolga goes super fast. If you don't ask questions (which most of us didn't), he will not slow down. The curve in this class is also extremely harsh compared to the lecture. (Just for reference, a 75 in the lecture was a B+, while on our exams, it was an 88.)",
    "It was a very good course. However, I felt that I was behind the other students, and thus at a disadvantage, because my high school did not offer economics. Thus, I recommend that there be an intensive section or something like that to help those students without the same background knowledge as others.",
    "Strengths: Tolga's teaching",
    "Strengths: class is taught at a rigorous pace, allowing it to cover a lot of ground in only a semester's time. Class is engaging and very funny. Office hours are very useful. Online lecture videos are very useful. Weaknesses: PSETs could be improved to cover more of class material, particularly for conceptual questions.",
    "Strengths: Tolga is a very engaging professor, all the material in his lectures will most likely be tested, the blackboard notes are very helpful for keeping track of ideas, and he relates material to bigger ideas or real-world examples that make you form connections between what you're learning and what's going on around you. Weaknesses: The midterms will test you on stuff that you did not go over in class but are only in the textbook, so when Tolga says put in eight hours of work a week, you may have to put in more than you think you will.",
    "Unlike all my other classes, every time a midterm was taken the answers to the questions had to be seen in class the day after because they were not posted on canvas and I rarely had the opportunity to revise my work and therefore learn from my mistakes. However, I spent a great deal of time studying from the book and revisiting the class lectures from the media library and I still found myself having trouble in the exams because I could not see the answers to the questions and thus learn from that.",
    "The course utilized the seminar format very effectively, and the teaching was supplemented with relevant stories.",
    "The strengths are how the professor makes economics fun, and the seminar style of the class. The weakness is that not much material is covered in depth each class in proportion to how long each class is, making it hard to focus the entire time.",
    "The strength of this course is that it provides a general basis to begin anyone's study of economics, however, the course fails in that it does not teach the course material any better than just reading the textbook would. To improve this course requires having students engage with topics through constant application and problem-solving. For instance, problem sets should be weighed much more and should be discussed in class in such a manner that students are encouraged to better develop their ability to think like an economist. In addition, the course should be far better organized in having questions on the problem sets and tests reflect each other and the courde work discussed in class. There were many instances when a topic not discussed in class nor in a problem set found itself onto an exam, which speaks of a lack of organization."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, because it provides many important basic frameworks for understanding the economy and economic issues that are current today.",
    "THE FIRST DAY OF THIS CLASS IS SCARY. Don't let it scare you away. Tolga is a phenomenal teacher (very funny and you'll remember the concepts because of the whacky examples he uses)...but he tries to only keep people in the class who care a lot about it, which may scare you as a shopper who's never taken econ before. If you find yourself interested in the concepts he goes over (and surprised about how econ applies to your personal life and Tolga's personal life lol), take this class. You'll learn a lot.",
    "Yes, very good introduction to Microeconomics",
    "Definitely. Tolga is a fun and knowledgeable lecturer. You learn so much econ and real-world examples.",
    "Yes! Especially taught by Tolga, because he will make sure you really understand before you leave the lecture or office hours or after any exam.",
    "Yes, but only if you've taken AP Micro OR you're willing to put in the work to catch up to most of your classmates who have taken AP Micro.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think being in a seminar setting makes the material much more engaging, and microeconomics is an important subject to learn. However, I would make sure to tell them that because it is a seminar, there are less students, so the curve is definitely more stringent than the lecture.",
    "Tolga is a great teacher, so if you are going to take micro I recommend you try to take it with him. I think it's important to know some econ in life, so it is good to take this class. It also is a prerequisite for macro, which seems even more important to know in life, so yeah I'd take it.",
    "Yes, for the strengths listed in 3.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it as the material of the course can be applied in one's day to day life.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! Although it was difficult, especially the final, the material covered gives a great basis for microeconomics and is a great introduction class. I prefer it to big lecture classes.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student in that it helps students better understand economics itself as a tool and model of thinking which is applicable across fields and disciplines. However, I would advise the incoming student that the style of instruction is not conducive to creating a satisfying and rewarding intellectual setting. In other words, students should take this course if they wish to see what economics can be about, but in order to truly benefit from it they must be capable of finding the connections to what they want to do themselves. For most students, this class will feel like a waste of time to learn how to do simple calculations which have been hidden under a swamp of ridiculous wording and circumstances which seem to be designed to confuse rather than help the student.",
    "Only take this class if you have take AP Econ in high school or are willing to put in lots of hours to study the material with a tutor (get them! they're great!). While Tolga is probably the best of the seminar econ courses, he goes really really fast, which only works if you already have the intuition for economic concepts, but otherwise most classes are a blur of desperate note-taking and fooling yourself into believing you'll figure it out later."
