   "comments": [
    "This is probably one of the only math classes I would recommend to someone not interested in math. You really learn how to manipulate symbols and write rigorous logical arguments. There's not too much work, but the problem sets were graded very strictly (due to the grader, not the professor). Tests seem like a time crunch, but are curved.",
    "Math 270 covers the basics of Zermelo-Fraenkel axiomatic set theory. This approach to set theory is important to learn since it is often implicit when set theory is used in other disciplines. It is very cool to think about Russell's Paradox, and how this whole axiomatic system was created to provide a foundation for mathematics which avoided it. The course itself is not that hard, especially for people with a math background, but it covers very important and basic stuff. Make sure to go to lecture even if it seems slow since Professor Zuckerman goes over a large range of concepts that aren't covered in the book. Unfortunately, the class doesn't address some of the more interesting stuff, like the ramifications of the axiom of choice.",
    "I enjoyed set theory as a non-math major, but I would suggest you search deep within your heart and ask, \"Why do I want to learn about set theory?\" I find set theory interesting. At other times, I wonder if that's all it is to me\u00e2\u0080\u0094something interesting but not very useful or important to me. Additionally, the exams can cover material that's somewhat... unexpected. Studying the book and PSETs will not be sufficient because exams test informal set theory, which is discussed a bit haphazardly in lecture. All that being said, Professor Zuckerman is great. He knows his stuff and has lots to share from his life about set theory and mathematics in general.",
    "Deceptively difficult class. This class goes by very slowly at first, but by the end, the theoretical concepts are very complex. Take it though. Zuckerman is very approachable and willing to help.",
    "This class is an incredibly unique opportunity. I came to Yale to challenge myself to think in new ways, and Set Theory forced me to do just that. Professor Zuckerman is great: he is knowledgeable and loves to teach. As a non-math major (one of few in the class), I found the material accessible (though NOT easy), although I would definitely recommend going to Zuckerman's office hours and contacting him if you get confused, because chances are that everyone else is also confused. In terms of workload, it isn't bad. There were four problem sets our year, two small and two larger. If you're looking for a challenge as a non-math major, then I would definitely recommend this class!One warning: if you don't like ambiguity, you shouldn't take Set Theory, because both the subject and the organization of the class can be somewhat ambiguous at times."
