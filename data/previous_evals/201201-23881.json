    "This class is just fantastic. The readings and discussions are engaging, the essay assignments are thought-provoking, and the professor is just awesome. I highly suggest taking this course!",
    "I recommend ENGL 114 if you feel like your academic writing needs improvement. I felt very unsatisfied and uncomfortable with the level of my writing before coming to college, and I still don't enjoy writing papers, but I made myself take this course because I knew I needed to improve my writing. The course itself did not help me very much in this respect, but I saw the residential college writing tutors as much as possible throughout the course, and my meetings with them were extremely helpful. I probably learned more from them about writing than I did from taking ENGL 114. However, if I had to do it over again, I would probably still take ENGL 114 because it forced me to practice academic writing and allowed me the time to really focus on improving my writing.",
    "It barely has to do with monsters",
    "Probably my favorite class this year, because of the section subject. English 114 in general is pretty dry, but I'm so glad I chose monsters.",
    "Take this course! The material is incredibly interesting and fun! The writing feedback is good, and the assignments are placed well in the context of monsters. Great way to get an English credit, and not an enormous amount of work. Just some reading and some papers.",
    "takes monsters as an odd hobby and interest and uses that topic to practice writing techniques and analyze writing style, great class, highly recommended",
    "Take this class but make sure you take it with a good professor and a topic that you like otherwise it can become boring really quickly. You could also just skip this and move to the more interesting ENGL 120.",
    "Great course if you want to solidify your writing skills and prepare for college-level papers."
