    "I really enjoyed this course. Foundations in research ethics were very helpful but, most importantly, I think it was a very valuable opportunity to explore the mechanics of research credits and independent work (i.e. being responsible for moving ahead on research without the infrastructure of a course). Os was very available, gave good constructive advice, and seemed invested in the success of students.",
    "The course was very well structured for the goals - having the month of October to devote to our research project was hugely helpful.",
    "I thought this course was very valuable. However, there were some elements that seemed unclear or still need to be tightened up. I understand the course changes a bit in an effort to improve year to year.",
    "The overall research proposal was helpful. I didn't feel like I got much out of the in class discussions and readings. It was good to hear about things like being an advocate vs broker, but reading dozens of pages and talking about it for 80 minutes was rough. I think the class could have been improved by spending more time in class doing peer reviews of the proposals",
    "Question 10: I wish Professor Schmitz had given more clear instructions about what he was expecting in each of the assignments. Particularly on the proposal outline, he mentioned that he had been looking for more progress on the methodology section than most students had provided and that our advisor should have known that. My advisor did not know the level of detail of Professor Schmitz, so I did not spend as much time on that section as I would have if I had been given more clear instructions. In addition, I wish that he had provided more written feedback on the graded assignments to help steer us in the right direction. I also felt that Professor Schmitz did not allow for adequate debate in class. In most of our class discussions, it was very one-sided in that we were given his opinions as facts without much exploration of alternative points of view. Question 4: I would have appreciated more instruction and less time off. While it was nice to have a dedicated time to work solely on research, following up on question 10, I think additional lectures could have helped give a clearer picture of what was required for the course.",
    "Very useful course for learning how to write a properly structured and informed research proposal for applying to grants. While this may be less applicable to students who are not planning on entering PhD programs, when they may have to apply for a grant, it does provide valuable skills that may be useful in the future. Most students, along with most of the examples explored in class, are based in the ecological sciences, especially because that is Os' research focus. Though when we were provided previous examples of the final research proposal, there was a good spread among disciplines. Ultimately, I found the ecological focus to be beneficial in retrospect, though you may not see this while taking the course. The month-long break between classes may have been a bit unnecessarily long. I may have added an additional rough draft deadline (perhaps rough draft 2 due at the end of Thanksgiving break) because additional comments would have helped.",
    "This course was challenging and fast paced, but critical for planning summer research. The readings were all very relevant, and Os's lectures are candid, informative, and enjoyable."

    "I really liked the structure of the course. Having a month off from class meetings was very productive for me, allowed me to develop a good relationship with my advisor, and made the research feel less abstract.",
    "Finishing with a drafted research proposal.",
    "The best thing was having substantial time to review the process of proposal writing. And, having time built in to plan, revise, and review with our advisors was helpful.",
    "Refining my proposal was super helpful.",
    "the courses teaches how to do research on science and write a proposal",
    "This course truly prepared me to think like a scientist and to write research proposal.",
    "Discussions and lectures were well-oriented to help us develop our research questions and protocols. I appreciated the directness of the information in how it was presented,and in the emphasis on how what we were doing or discussing would fit in terms of our research and our time at FES. The ethical discussions and information on grant and fellowship applications were especially helpful.",
    "I enjoyed the research proposal board exercise and having the opportunity to read about the work that my colleagues are doing. I was very excited to learn about a wide range of research topics that people are interested in, and I was happy to get constructive feedback from 3 students as well as Professor Schmitz and my advisor.",
    "The best aspect of this course, was the chance, in your first semester at FES, to really delve into the design of your research project. Furthermore, it offers the chance to really understand the details of proposal writing, which considering the overall lack of focus on scientific method in other courses is essential to any student pursuing a research based degree at FES.",
    "Having a complete research proposal that I can modify to readily apply to funding opportunities. More importantly, I now understand the process of writing and reviewing scientific grant proposals.",
    "the panel",
    "The readings were well chosen and useful, particularly Friedland and Folt, which I think should be a required textbook and will probably use for the rest of my life. (Fortunately it's cheap.) I definitely felt like I learned how to write a research proposal from the course as well as basic scientific principles I didn't have. Even the assignments were helpful at keeping me on track. The pseudo-NSF grant panels at the end in which we evaluated each others' proposals were also really helpful. I talked to first-year doctoral students who wished that their research methods class had had those.",
    "presentations; opportunity to discuss projects in depth with classmates",
    "Os is a great instructor. So knowledgeable and insightful in his knowledge of the grant application process and how to be a proper researcher. The chance to craft a research proposal was also a very important outcome of the course. From discussing with students who took the other research methods course, we had a much more detailed and structured lesson plan behind developing our research proposals. We also worked on it for the majority of the semester instead of for just a couple weeks at the end of the semester, which the other research methods course seemed to do.",
    "This class provides a full month for students to work one-on-one with their research advisor, which I think is great. It also is a \"no fat\" kind of course--every single component is critical to the end goal of writing a solid rough draft of a summer research proposal.",

   "comments": [
    "Perhaps there could be a class session where 2nd year grad students, PhD students, and\/or postdocs come to class and discuss proposal\/grant writing (i.e. tips for success, things they wish they had known, etc.)",
    "So many of the topics covered would be great material for discussion. Instead, Dr. Schmitz spent the time telling us his view on the subjects with the clear implication that his perspective was the right perspective and anything else was wrong. I think leading us in guided discussions would be much more valuable for my learning and developing my thoughts on the role of research than completing the required readings and repeating them back to him in class. I don't disagree with his views, but this was not a very engaging way to discuss the role of science in environmental work.",
    "Some class meetings and the interaction could be improved. We could have done more collaborative work like with google docs that could have been more efficient. But generally discussion was better than in the other classes I took this semester.",
    "See question 13",
    "Teacher should use various examples in class, not only focusing on biology, ecology, and forest!",
    "Fewer readings",
    "Grading objectives and expectations were sometimes unclear. Specifically, in the case of an outline we were to present (a substantial portion of our grade) the expectation seemed to be for more of a draft. This is in contrast to the assignment as it was presented beforehand, which emphasized that we were developing a guideline that could later be fleshed out, and we were then penalized for lacking a level of detail that I don't believe was well-communicated.",
    "I think that the grading process and rubrics that Professor Schmitz uses should be a bit more transparent.",
    "I honesty, can't think of how this course could improve greatly. I know that changes have been made to the course structure recently and I think those changes worked really well. It was great to have limited meetings through the second half of the semester. I would also have wished for increased conversations about funding opportunities available for research at Yale, other than the one meeting with the research department.",
    "The major issue I had with the course related to the communication of expectations on the project outline assignment (and, to a lesser degree, the presentation assignment). The documentation for the outline assignment requested an outline of the methods, but then in grading the professor assigned the plurality of the points to that section, graded it as if he expected it to be a finished section rather than an outline, and flunked maybe half of the class's methods sections. In the next class he then spoke about how one bad grade is not the worst outcome that will happen to us in science. True, but had he requested full methods sections, I'm sure he would have gotten them, and a lot of students would have been spared a lot of unnecessary panic and frustration. What really concerns me about that dynamic is what I learned from speaking to maybe four other students in the class who had also flunked that section. As this was, for a lot of us, our first exposure to designing an independent research project, some people, including me, internalized that evaluation and were left insecure about their general fundamental abilities to do research. I know I didn't really want to touch my own project again, personally, although I eventually rallied and did. Others expressed general frustration. One actually told me she'd had to institute a policy of not crying in class. Moreover, in my (admittedly inexperienced) judgment, some of these reactions were coming from some of the most talented budding researchers in the course. I realize that research is a competitive field with a 5% funding rate at the big government agencies, and I'm all for high expectations and realistic, harsh grading. I am, however, against penalizing people for failing to meet standards they didn't know existed. I'm also particularly concerned about potential interactions between the internalization of unfounded negative evaluations and structural factors like race, gender, class, etc., that already leave some students uncertain about whether they're welcome in the scientific community. I'd hate to see an unfounded sense of inadequacy gleaned from this course lead otherwise talented environmentalists to drop out of research careers and leave a less diverse group of environmental scientists ten and twenty years down the road. Finally, I think the problem could be solved easily. Since the professor graded the outlines (and the presentations) according to a very clear rubric, why not simply provide the grading rubric with the original assignment? That, plus asking for a completed methods section instead of an outlined one if that was his true expectation, would have solved all of this.",
    "May not be feasible with limited time frame, but would be ideal to have a chance to edit classmates's work and discuss before the final version (eg. rough draft edits)",
    "More in-class time to discuss general problems with the research proposals would have been beneficial -- maybe we would only break for two or three weeks instead of closer to one month. In addition, having another draft deadline would potentially motivate students to work on their proposals more in the months of October and November, instead of saving the majority of it for reading period.",
    "I'm really not sure. I spoke with a few students who struggled to meet with their advisor, or who didn't feel fully supported. I did not experience this, though, so I cannot adequately make recommendations for improvements in this area.",
    "Course flow and structure. I didn't understand some of the reasons why certain concepts were being taught while others neglected. Also the philosophy of science discussions seem extremely prescriptive which seems counter-intuitive to a discussion on the scientific method."
