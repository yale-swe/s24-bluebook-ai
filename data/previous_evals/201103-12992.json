    "Really great Spanish class. I thought it was a lot less work than Spanish L2 or L3. My professor, Reymundi, was really great. The content of the class, itself, was basically a review and refinement of L1 and L2. We watched Pan's Labyrinth at the end of the semester which was a great cap to an enjoyable class.",
    "Yes! There is busy work, but its not difficult.",
    "Yes, it's interesting and useful.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Reymundi is amazing and the course workload is very manageable. The daily reinforcement of speaking, listening, and writing spanish means that it is easy and fun to immerse yourself in spanish and learn quickly.",
    "I personally found it to be easier than L2, but I believe I grew much more in this class. I'd recommend to take it with Reymundi. She was a great instructor: very clear, offered useful explanations for any questions, and was extremely supportive\/really nice! She was very good at suggesting ways for us to improve and created a comfortable environment to ask questions or seek help.",
    "This is a pretty standard Spanish class, from what I can tell. Go ahead and take it if you're looking to continue your Spanish!",
    "I would recommend it. It fulfills the requirement without being too difficult or time consuming.",
    "Yes! This was a great course! I thought it was a great way to review and practice grammar that we had already seen and new grammar and continue improving our language skills. I saw my confidence in speaking and writing come back and felt like I had better control of grammar. There is quite a bit of work, but you will get out of this class what you put in."
