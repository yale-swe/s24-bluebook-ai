    "This was the first year the class was offered, so some of the scheduling issues with internships in New Haven will I'm sure be ironed out in the future. This is a great way to learn about Latino culture and about New Haven through the community-based learning project. However, the class material isn't really focused on New Haven.The workload is totally manageable: one presentation, weekly responses, a final paper, and the community-based learning project. Professor Camacho is so nice and so passionate about these issues. Overall I would recommend it if you're looking for something different.",
    "Latina\/o New Haven is an interdisciplinary course which roots in socio-historical debates about the place of immigrants in American society. We explore the current population in New Haven through political issues that are current and controversial.I would recommend this course strongly, with the changes I've suggested above being incorporated into the course. Considering that we know so little about Latinos in New Haven from the literature, I believe this class should be an opportunity to exercise our research skills.",
    "It was a great course. It helped me discover a part of New Haven I did not know about.",
    "Though the readings are more focused on the Latin@ than the New Haven, the CBL helps tie in the location specific aspects of what is being discussed. Camacho is wonderful - it is worth taking the class just to get to work with her. The workload was manageable, especially since my CBL was very relaxed and I did a lot of the work off-site. However, I wish I could have done more on-site because that is the whole point of CBL. In the future, the syllabus might be more cohesive and that would strengthen this course."
