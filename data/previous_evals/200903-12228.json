    "I'd definitely recommend this class if you are interested in the Anglo-Norman world, or music. It's a little bit tough to throw yourself into if you don't have a little bit of amusic background, but the literature component is also really phenomenal!",
    "Take if you want a fun class to fill out your schedule - it's a great peek at art, architecture, lit, and music from England and France from 1050 to 1250 or so. What it lacks in intellectual stimulation it definitely makes up for in fun. Be prepared to do a lot of research, though.",
    "This was a kind of crazy, ad hoc, but wonderful class. Fassler and Bloch were so odd, but so great together. They were both incredibly helpful. Definitely not a class you would want to take if you aren't interested in the material though, as they expect you to be just as enthusiastic as them about everything."
