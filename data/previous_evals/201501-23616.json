   "comments": [
    "Learning about how to use the technology the way it was intended to be used is helpful. Having a Protools expert as a teacher makes the program a lot less intimidating because any question can be answered.",
    "The introduction to Pro Tools was very valuable but the software itself was very complex and difficult to use. I learned a great deal that will now have to be perfected away from YSD. Working with Nick Lloyd was very worthwhile as he is a professional in the field and knew the software in and out",
    "Meeting in the studio and being able to work hands on with the soft\/hardware was invaluable. The instructor's methods were very helpful to learn. I appreciated the focus on organization, and workflow and the focus on using recording techniques to enhance the musicality of content. This class was extremely helpful."

    "I would like to cover more ground. I could have moved faster through what we learned.",
    "Nick should have had some intern knowledgeable about the software and recording arts assigned to him so that we could get answers to questions during assignments. While I could, and did, ask my fellow students questions, they did not always have answers and were busy with other assignments. Emails to Nick did work but the responses was sporadic due to his assignments. In fairness to Nick, I did reach a frustration point in the semester and he did come in to help me out.",
    "I wish we had more time with the instructor, as the term ended with much more to learn. Maybe one less project so that we could focus more time on practically looking at what we had recorded and talking about them. I think trying to look at sampling and using Kontakt might be too much for the amount of time we had. More time to focus on recording audio would have been more useful for me."

   "comments": [
    "The instructor provides an open learning environment that is inviting and fun to be in.",
    "The class was taught in a manner that did not allow review of everyone's assignments. Thus we had to attempt to learn from the review of a single assignment which may have had issues totally different from those I had on the same assignment. More class time would have helped a great deal and, since the class is small, a review of teh assignment of each student would also have helped.",
    "Nick is a great instructor, and was very generous to bring us to his studio. I feel lucky to have been able to learn from him for a term."

    "Since Nick's place of business is close to YSD, even some \"office hours\" at his place would be very helpful."
