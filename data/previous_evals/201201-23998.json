   "comments": [
    "The instructor is very knowledgeable, but this was the first time that the course was taught for a mix of graduate and undergraduate students, which meant the level of experience varied greatly from student to student. In addition, global health itself is a very broad topic that perhaps might be better suited by a course that meets more than once a week.",
    "The first few classes started off strong but in the end, the class was somewhat of a disappointment. It was hard to keep up with all of the changes, the changes weren't always communicated in a uniform manner and there was very little opportunity for actual classroom discussion. The proposed case studies would have made things more interesting and applicable. The one time we did one, it was really interesting. I would suggest keeping the guest speakers but having fewer of them. It has hard to engage with people over Skype and a 3 hour class on a Friday needs a bit more interactive learning. Some of these things will probably be worked out after the class is taught a few more times. He seems like a very organized person so there seems to be a lot of potential for the class.Also, there was way too much reading. There needs to be a better balance of quality over quantity. When reading hits over 200 pages, you are reduced to skimming things or only reading certain things. Having more manageable class readings would actually allow people to learn more because they would have a direct focus. Related to this, the class tried to cover way too many issues. Also, having two four hour classes at the end of the semester was a little too much.",
    "Probably a bit unreasonable in the reading demands. Other than that, it was great.",
    "Excellent course, professor, and TA. It was more than just common knowledge global health, I felt like we got into different issues, solutions, and obstacles we face in trying to solve the issues. The workload was usually manageable, and I gained skills by writing the policy briefs. One weakness would be the amount of students who did not complete the reading by class time. I would suggest making reading more mandatory somehow, even if that means cutting down the amount of required reading. It was obvious most people did not read, and I felt it slowed down the class. There were some weeks when I was less able to do the reading, and a more mandatory reading rule would have forced me to do more before class.",
    "I really liked the course and I learned a lot about global health. It was really great to get a comprehensive overview, though I think there was a lack of organization\/planning.",
    "Great course! Extremely informative, and very, very relevant to what we learn in public health.",
    "I wish that the policy briefs were more evenly spread throughout the semester or that our grade was dependent on more than just three policy briefs.",
    "Very good overview class on Global Health. Some of the administration could have been smoother. There were far too many announcements, when they could have been combined to make things easier to find, and it was difficult to know what slides to get ready and printed off in advance. The guidelines for the policy briefs kept changing. The syllabus was revised too many times. Some of this was bound to happen with a new class, but hopefully it will smoother next time.The instructor's grading comments on the policy briefs were very good indeed. This is a style of writing we don't get elsewhere in the program, so there were some good learning points given.The skyping sessions were a fantastic idea. Most were a little too long for their didactic purpose, but well worth doing.",
    "A terrific survey course. Its strengths were the devotion and passion of its instructor, the terrific guest speakers, and the wide range of its syllabus. Its biggest weakness was being on Friday afternoons--unavoidable, I know, but I think the class would work better if taught twice a week. It would make the workload more manageable and a shorter class time would make it easier to pay consistent attention.",
    "This course was incredible. I did not come in with a background in global health, but after having taken this class I now feel so much more prepared. I learned so much, and Professor Skolnik was incredible. The material was presented in a straightforward and clear fashion, and I really enjoyed the group discussions and the way that class was run. The skype conversations with leaders in their fields were also wonderful. Loved the policy briefs and the readings too. I would just add more lessons where groups break off and have to solve sample problems.",
    "It is an excellent introductory course on global health for those without much knowledge and experience of the field. Whereas the global health seminar did not offer adequate background (due to the nature of the seminar), the course is structured and provided comprehensive background on different topics of global health. The policy brief assignments were also very helpful practices, with good guidance and feedback from the instructor."

    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0The instructor was incredibly knowledgeable from years and years of experience in the field and made an incredible effort to meet with every student in the class. However, the fact that he was also a professor at George Washington University meant he could only teach once a week.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0The instructor was always meeting with students and tried to grade papers in an expedient manner. He also knew almost everyone's name. He seemed more accessible than many EPH professors despite the fact he was only here one day a week. He seemed committed to the class.However, there was an unusual clasroom dynamic between him and some other students which at times was uncomfortable. He seemed to polarize students in the sense he clearly had his favorites and yet at the same timedisregarded others. While it isn't clear that this was carried over into grading (probably not) it didn't create the best classroom environment. It also seemed to be split in the sense he was very engaged with the undergraduate students and some grad students from other areas but not so interested with the public health students.Also, he has a very high opinion of himself. While this is most likely merited given his accomplishments, it can be offputting. He has obviously had a myriad of experiences and it would be more valuable for him to talk in detail about those experiences versus commenting on his 85 trips to India or his work with someone most people don't know.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Great professor. Very approachable and open to our ideas, even for us Undergraduates who he knew had significantly less experience.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Superb",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik is probably the only person I know who is intimidating yet approachable at the same time. He has had so much experience in global health, yet he is willing to meet one-on-one with students and talk about their hopes and dreams,and suggest how to achieve them. He was a very clear speaker, and I loved most of his lectures. At first I was scared when he would randomly pick on people in class, but eventually saw it as a beneficial challenge to all of us. When he gives powerpoints, he should make sure that he's on slideshow view rather than in user's view (so there isn't all of the powerpoint tools in the way).I also loved how he was able to bring such successful speakers to class through Skype. However, sometimes I felt their talks were too basic, or something we covered earlier. The speakers are a chance to dig deeper into something that may not be Professor Skolnik's main strongpoint.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0I really wanted to like Professor Skolnik. He is a brilliant man and has a lot to offer, but unfortunately I will leave the class frustrated with him. In a class of only 20 students, he failed to remember my name week after week. He only called on undergraduate students and favored them INEXPLICABLY. He constantly praised those who were from India, from Bhutan, those who are doctors, those who sing in Acapella groups, those who have parents who work at the World Bank, and those who work at the Global Fund. I have never felt so small in my entire life. On top of it, he is very unwilling to gain perspectives from others. He often corrected me about things I knew too well. He failed to realize he could be wrong. He is so arrogant that it is nauseating. For these reasons alone I actually ended up hating the class. I hope he can change this in the future. It is a graduate level class - please stop favoring the undergraduates and recognize the graduate students who are working just as hard!",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Great instructor! Very knowledgeable, and also a lot of fun to listen to.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0I really enjoyed Professor Skolnik. I think he was passionate and interesting. I also appreciated his view on the topic as opposed to a strictly academic view.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Very good. Almost put too much effort into getting the class just right (see comments for question 6), but it was a real privilege to take the class.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0A fantastic professor. Great knowledge of the subject are and true devotion to the course. I am grateful to have had Prof. Skolnik as a teacher.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0Professor Skolnik was so wonderful. He was always available for his students, even though he teaches at GW--the fact that he took the train up every Friday morning shows his dedication to his students. He was an excellent teacher, and knew the subject matter so well; even when he was less sure about a topic, he told us, and then had his friends who are experts in their field skype in and teach us the subject matter. He is good natured, fun, funny and just a really kind person who cares about his students. I also really appreciate that he was always trying to help his students succeed.",
    "Instructor: Richard L Skolnik \u00a0He is very dedicated and passionate on teaching this course. His knowledge from work experience has always amazed me. He is very friendly and willing to spend time with students outside classroom, on topics not just class-related, but also personal and career advises."

    "Jared Augusten He didn't seem very engaged in the class or his position. He often couldn't answer questions but that seemed more of a result of the the instructor not clearly explaining things to him. It seemed odd that he graded or commented on some people's papers and not others. He didn't seem to have a lot of experience or knowledge of things outside of a classroom setting.",

    "Great.",

   "comments": [
    "The course is great as a survey of the issues in global health, but only if you are willing to work for it. The topic briefs which make up 100% of the grade teach you a very specific and very useful skill, but do not teach you the basics of global health, which you will need to learn on your own.",
    "This class is best suited for someone who wants to learn more about issues that affect global health but has little to no exposure to either public health or global development efforts. It should maybe be called Introduction to Global Health and be at the undergraduate level. The instructor seemed much more enthusiastic about teaching undergrads than grads so it would probably be a better fit for all involved. If grads elect to take it, they at least know it is primarly a class for undergrads. Also, he may be better at teaching the course if he just used his own textbook that he alluded to many times.",
    "Very good course. I would recommend it for anyone interested in Global Health. It gives a broad and holistic overview of the current situation as well as the history and the future looking forward.",
    "If you don't know much about global health, then I would take this course. It is introductory so do not take it if you consider yourself well-versed. Otherwise, this class is a great introduction (more in depth than what would be normally offered) and fun!",
    "An excellent course, you can learn so much from the material and the professor! Professor Skolnik is intimidating yet approachable, which, from my experience this semester, is a good combination to learn a lot. Some of the material may seem basic, but we did go in depth in many different health issues. He also brings renowned speakers in person, or over Skype (more likely), which is a great addition to the course, and probably the only opportunity to learn from these people in such an intimate setting. The work is very manageable - usually only readings, and 3 policy briefs due throughout the semester.",
    "Could be great - but beware of the instructor.",
    "Must-take! Especially, if interested in global health, and like interacting with experts from the field of global health.",
    "This class was a great overview of global health. However, it also allowed for some in depth perspective at the issues. We also had perspective of some of the top professionals in the topics we covered.",
    "A very good overview class on Global Health that will also introduce you to some big names in the field and teach you some writing skills you won't get anywhere else on YSPH.",
    "A great survey course on Global Health. You will getas much out of it as you put into it, and Prof. Skolnik is a terrific instructor. Class on Friday afternoons can get long at times, but it is worth it.",
    "This is a tremendous course--a must-take for anyone who wants to expand their knowledge of global health. Richard Skolnik is the best professor you're going to have at Yale; he memorizes everyone's names, is always available to meet, and he's just generally awesome. The course has a lot of reading, but it's all really interesting, and the policy briefs are great preparation for writing any type of brief in the future. Skolnik also brings in his friends from the World Bank and other areas in global health over skype for guest lectures, which are also incredible.",
    "Very excellent introductory course on global health. Highly recommended."
