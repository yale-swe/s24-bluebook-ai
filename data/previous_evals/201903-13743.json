   "comments": [
    "I gained a preliminary understanding of Susan's policy framework.",
    "I learned a new way of thinking about problems related to natural resource use and underlying values.",
    "I learned how to use the policy sciences framework which was the primary objective of the course.",
    "New ways of thinking about policy and policy analysis",
    "I developed a new way of thinking about problems and a new way on how to approach problems.",
    "thinking about the world in generally a different way\/ beyond the conventional.",
    "I learned to engage in problem solving and decision making differently and more intentionally with a mindset geared towards collaboration, integration, and comprehensiveness. The course highlighted areas of oversight that often occur in social and decision processes that lead to poor policy and decision making and ineffective policies. I also learned how to question the process in a way that might reveal how it can be improved to achieve a more holistic policy that truly advances the common interest. Questioning fundamental and foundational aspects of society, the way one thinks, etc. is difficult, but this course helped me begin to do that in a more productive and intentional way.",
    "I learned more about how people think and how to be an effective problem-solver. This class was particularly valuable by giving me insight into when I have been making poor life choices and how I can improve my own decision-making.",
    "I learned how to apply a practical framework to natural resource problems. I also learned more about the theory of being a good leader of a project...in particular identifying problems, identifying assessing the social and decision processes that underlie them, and designing an approach. Additionally, I found content about different types of decision processes and aspects of a leader to be very helpful. I also worked on my presentation skills.",
    "Exposure to and practice with the policy sciences framework - -tools, strategies, ideologies, cases Communication with small group and within larger group discussions organizing my thoughts in written form public presentation",
    "Policy sciences framework",
    "This course introduced me to the policy sciences metaframework, which may have some positive impact on my future as an \"environmental manager,\" but the most important takeaways from this course were a shift in my understanding of what environmental problems are, a change in thought surrounding technical solutions, and an introduction to broad thought processes surrounding social processes and policies that extends beyond most conventional problem solving methods.",
    "I learned about the importance of having a critical framework to bring with me when working with stakeholders in complicated natural resource use problems."

   "comments": [
    "I think I expected to gain more concrete skills from this class, but the way Susan teaches and thinks wasn't completely compatible with the way that I process information.",
    "I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from this class, but the knowledge and skills certainly exceeded those expectations.",
    "We did not talk about how to develop policies. The way this class referred to the policy was VERY different from my expectations.",
    "Well, but the course was not about actual policies - more policy theory\/framework.",
    "They aligned very well.",
    "Very well",
    "To be honest, I found the knowledge, skills and insights gained in the class did not align well with my expectations. I was hoping to receive more direction and develop a skill set applicable to my future career. While I feel the class successfully got us to engage with the material and question things, I feel I did not really learn what I expected to learn. That being said, this is neither good nor bad, and I would still have taken the course regardless.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class did not at all align with my expectations, but did achieve what the purpose of the class was as said on the syllabus.",
    "Very well. This is a great class and Susan's approach provides a realistic way to move forward on vexing issues. I also think the class is realistic about what a student can learn in a semester and the class is well-designed to deliver the right amount of challenge.",
    "Fairly well. I don't think I knew exactly what to expect going into this course but I think I got a lot out of it.",
    "Much different from expectations",
    "This course did not match up with my expectations and was completely different than the course I anticipated. Foundations of Natural Resources Policy and Management was not like any policy or management class I have taken-- it wasn't like any class I've ever taken. Instead of a class on policy or management, it was a broad view on philosophy and society and a class specifically on the policy sciences. I wouldn't say it was not interesting or useful, but it was very different from the class I expected.",
    "I came into the class with limited expectations. I wanted to be apart of a class with Susan becasue I had heard good things about her as a professor and I was blown away becasue I didn't expect the class to do much else besides confuse me. At the end of the day, I'm grateful to have a better understanding of the complicated ways we as humans approach and fail to successfully orient to problem solving."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course provided a good forum for discussion on complicated and important issues. I think the course is catered to a certain type of learning style and it could be improved by taking into consideration linear thinkers. I think some of the concepts were overcomplicated when they could have been expressed in a much more straightforward way.",
    "I think a bit more structure at the onset of the course could have helped some class members be more engaged. Responsibility for getting feedback fell on particular students to get as much out of the course as possible.",
    "there was no clear course structure, lectures were chaotic, and readings were almost never discussed in class. We also did not receive grades during the course, so we had no idea how we were doing.",
    "The professor's engagement is a strength. A weakness is the lack of clarity and structure around assignments\/due dates.",
    "Strengths include the course classroom style. It was discussion based. Weaknesses is that is three hours long once a week, so it can get a bit tiring.",
    "Weakness- The class was rather disorganized. It would have been nice if there was more time for class discussion as I felt that there was so much for us to learn from one another in addition to Susan. Strength- pushes you to think in a way that none of the other classes I have taken have pushed me",
    "I find the strengths of the course to be in Dr. Clark's passion for the policy sciences and sincere care for what's happening in the world, what will happen, and all of our roles in that process. I also find the openness of the classroom in terms of discussion and engagement is a strength in achieving the objectives of the course. As far as weaknesses, the course could use more structure and direction. Often students felt unclear about assignments, expectations, and even generally about the material or purpose of the course. I also think it could be helpful to include more specific activities throughout the course so that students are engaging in the material throughout the course rather than a big push at the end.",
    "I think the first couple of classes could have met students more at where they are starting from - the so-called conventional level. Immediately using all of the terminology leaves some students unhappy.",
    "Strengths: -The course material is really useful - The textbook is really useful and provides critical grounding on the topic - Small group meetings were very rewarding - Our projects were well-tailored to the learning needs of the students - The overall layout of the class was initially confusing but in the end I think it was really well organized to facilitate our learning in a way that was tailored to the students in the class - The journals were interesting and I really liked hearing weekly reflections - Susan's feedback and discussions were really interesting and I appreciate her open-door policy Weaknesses: - The class could improve on some time-management issues",
    "Strengths: Course structure is set up well for learning. I really appreciated some of the assignments, I like the exercise of writing each week. The small group discussion sessions were great. Improvements: More feedback from instructor and TA, especially on concrete skills being taught (writing, presenting); more in class discussion, fewer redundant readings, slightly better organization and communication re assignments due, expectations for assignments etc.",
    "Strengths: uses a variety of unorthodox pedagogical methods that help to reinforce content, including consistent group work, visual mapping, journaling\/reflection, presentations on case studies, etc. Weaknesses: at times felt a bit unpredictable or disorganized",
    "The primary strength of this course was the obvious investment that Susan has in the curriculum she teaches. I always felt like Susan had something to say that was not conventional (in a helpful, expansive way), and the often-critical lens she and Chris brought to the class felt like a necessary breath of fresh air this semester. However, I felt like the structure of this course was often so disorganized that I couldn't follow the thoughts, assignments, or expectations of the course. From the myriad of underexplained handouts to the seemingly random books that circled the room (interesting books, but not necessarily tied in to the lectures) to the purposes, intended outcomes, and submissions of our weekly journals, the disorganization of this class detracted from potential benefits of a new, interesting, and thought-provoking course. I also felt as though the course functioned more to promote a way of thought, the policy sciences, than to teach it, and felt as if there was an underlying motive to elevate a thought community that distracted from the actual course. In future semesters, I would have liked to form groups differently, organized assignments and goals more effectively, and followed lesson plans\/unifying bodies of thought in lectures more closely.",
    "One major strength was that we as students were expected to do processing and learning outside of class. My discussion section was a critical component of my learning. Together we created a space to process the class and learn from one another's experiences. The course can be improved by including a case study at the beginning of the class so students can share a language and experience to compare to as we learn more about the policy sciences framework."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is not for everybody. It seems that some people really benefit from it, but if you are a more linear thinker it might not be compatible with your learning style.",
    "Class should be called \"the philosophy of thinking about natural resource use\" or something along those lines. It is a great class if you are willingness to think about things in a new way and suspend your preconceptions of the world. Don't take this class if you think you know everything about everything already and you're not willing to expand your way of thinking.",
    "Study the policy book.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "Take it. It will seem strange and weird but I truly am grateful for being in this course. This class will push you and confuse you and won't make sense until late in the semester. It changed how I approached my other classes and daily life and I know that I will continue to keep learning and thinking about the material as I move forward in my career.",
    "I would advise the student to be open. This course seeks to challenge how one thinks and approaches problem solving in such a way to encourage improved methods and thoughtfulness. I would also advise students that the course is about the policy sciences, which is one approach to natural resource policy development. I think being more up front about the methods that will be taught over the course of the semester would be helpful so that students do not hold false expectations.",
    "Come in with an open mind and read all of the readings.",
    "This course could be considered unconventional by some and may seem unfamiliar at the start. Ultimately, I think the policy process framework presented is the most useful tool you could learn as an environmental manager because it is an all encompassing decision making framework for any policy problem. It is simple to follow as laid out in the Policy Process book and if followed through you will see just how much more you know about a case at the end than you did at the start.",
    "Relax - this is a fun and interesting class and it is not about your grade, it is about your personal learning journey. Enjoy it. Be patient with this class. Some of the language and theory is really difficult to grasp at first so give it time. Spend time chatting with Susan in office hours and get to know your group. You may not get everything that the class initially says it offers and you may not agree with everything offered in class but you will almost certainly get a lot out of it. Leave your expectations about what a class should be behind.",
    "Go in with an open mind, reserve skepticism, and you get out what you put in -- do the readings, do the journals, meet with your small groups",
    "Be prepared for a very different learning experience. Take advantage of the different teaching methods to get the most out of the class.",
    "I would be prepared for a highly unconventional class that focuses heavily on .",
    "Take the class becasue with minimal expectations and come prepared to be surprised."
