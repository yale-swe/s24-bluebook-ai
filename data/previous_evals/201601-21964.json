   "comments": [
    "Chamber has been a highlight to my Yale career. Repertoire is chosen for you as are the chamber groups. Collaborating with other students and being able to share my passion for music has been extremely rewarding.",
    "MUS 220\/221 is a great course. If you are even a little bit serious about chamber music, definitely audition. The workload is a little heavier than a half credit has any right to be (around 3 hours a week of actual class time, on average, plus any personal practice you feel compelled to do), but it's a lot of fun. I've taken it every semester I've been at Yale, and haven't regretted it once. Wendy Sharp is a delight, the people are lovely, I've made great friends and had the chance to play some amazing music. There's basically no downside to this class. Take it.",
    "Take it! Great music, great musicians, great course.",
    "I would recommend this course every single time, and say it is a wonderful experience",
    "You know what you're getting into.",
    "If you are at all interested in chamber playing at Yale, take this course! It's a great way to fit in music into a busy schedule, and I feel like I have been exposed to a lot more repertoire, as well as chamber playing rehearsal techniques.",
    "MUSI 221 is a continuation of 220 and a great way to explore your love of chamber music at Yale! The level of music making is quite high and it's always fun to hear what other groups have been working on in class every other week.",
    "A wonderful way to engage in high level chamber music with a long term group. you learn how to express your own ideas and collaborate with a diverse group of musicians while finding your own voice.",
    "take it!",
    "MUSI 221 01 is a chamber music performance class in which you rehearse\/receive coachings in a chamber group. You also attend a performance class in which you play for others and listen to and evaluate them. I would absolutely recommend it-- you learn a lot from the coaches and other groups."
