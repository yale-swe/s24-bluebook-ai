    "Hilary had a series of Health Care related seminars and meetings arranged throughout the semester. Most were insightful and provocative. Nonetheless a few potential meetings were canceled. I would have expected a closer coordination with Health Care.",
    "complete. i appreciated the many seminar format discussions which were organized, as well as the session with a structural engineer.",
    "As a building studio, a comprehensive design was encouraged from the very beginning. And given our difficult site as well as manageable program, it was quite reasonable to achieve a high amount of detail and resolution through the course of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "the instructor would be available anytime for individual meetings, and be in studio full time both on Mondays and Thursdays. A TA would have maybe helped with time management and studio organization.We had too few studio pin-up reviews, especially in the middle of the semester.",
    "most valuable= the trip, out experts (of which their were fewer than promised)",
    "Class discussions were the most helpful in this studio. The group was top-notch and very diverse in their interests. This made for fruitful cross-pollination between members of the studio.",
    "The siting of the project is my only complaint. While Mont Royal was fun and challenging, the positioning of a clinic as an alternative to the Super Hospital led many of us to believe that the site should have been in the city fabric. If only to satisfy the premise that the clinic performed a different kind of health role in the city."

    "The topic was very relevant given the current national awareness of the health industry and infrastructure.",
    "Health is a complex and demanding subject which I was happy to take on, and will continue to research. While architects should have a role in its future, unless we get in there, it will never happen."

   "comments": [
    "This studio was not my first choice, so I had no real expectations for it. In the end it turned to be really interesting, even though the instructor could have been more engaging in setting the challenges for the project.",
    "I expected more information and discussion on the Health Care industry and the architecture it has produced in recent history.",
    "I was happy for the opportunity to design a small, highly-detailed building. While I did not anticipate being in the studio, it was a highly productive semester and I am more than happy with my performance and my design."

   "comments": [
    "The instructor was really competent and prepared about the topic, which she framed with clarity and precision.Some problems in conveying enthusiasm and inspiring students. It was hard sometimes to understand her appreciation\/opinion about students' work.",
    "the studio needed an assistant teacher hilary was there too much, 2 days is not enough time to digest, rdesign and re-package",
    "Hilary is incredibly professional. She made extraordinary efforts to connect us with the profession throughout the semester, from CCA insiders to local architects. She always treated us as peers. This was an excellent and generous position to take, and a particularly relevant one for a terminal studio.That said, I do wish that she was more forward with her critique. It was difficult to find \"something to push against\" and, as this was not a thesis semester (in which we would all presumably have a more invested position), the studio always seemed in a bit of limbo. I'm not sure we ever established an \"urgency\" to what we were doing.That said, it was a fine semester. It was a pleasure to learn from Hilary.",
    "Hilary was a quick critic and very facile with the intricate design problems we all devised for ourselves. At times, however, it was unclear if the motives of the studio were related to the overall topic of health, or simply health as a means toward formal complexity. While we arrived with a variety of projects exploring any number of procedures, health conditions and formal solutions, a common or ongoing discussion of health within the studio never arose. Even at the studio's end, it was difficult to judge successful projects against those which were assumed to be less successful. Perhaps a common bar or argument for the clinic needed to be encouraged of each student, such that the projects could be evaluated against one another more readily.Also, have more informal pinups.The site walkthrough of the UHS building was great.The trip to Montreal was an excellent tour of offices and site seeing; having a clear itinerary was a nice change to past studios.The end of the semester seemed a bit clumsy, given the mock-review with Michael Meredith, which felt a week early...and the mock review Monday before the final, which felt too rushed.Institute a 3\/4 review and then get everyone into production mode early...encourage students not to until the last minute!"
