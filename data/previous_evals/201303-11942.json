   "comments": [
    "I recommend Portuguese to anyone who wants to learn another language. The portuguese department is much stronger here than the spanish department. The professors seem more engaging, and the homework level is much more manageable.",
    "TAKE IT, especially with Fabi! Yes, this class is 1.5 credits, and meets everyday, but it really is manageable; the nightly homework load is usually light. Tests aren't too bad. Portuguese is such a fun language to learn and speak, and Brazil is super fun to learn about. If you've taken Spanish before, you might feel like this class is simplistic at times, but that just means it'll be easier for you than someone else; it doesn't take away from the class as a whole. Fabi genuinely cares so much about every individual student she has, and every week she has one-on-one's, just to sit there with you for 30 minutes, speak with you in Portuguese (not intimidating!) and help you with anything you might need help with. The class can be a little slow at times, but for the most part, you'll feel like you're learning a lot, and the small size of the class makes it a really good language experience. Definitely recommend it!",
    "Portuguese 110 is a fun and interesting class where you not only become friends with the students but the instructor as well. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I feel like it has helped me grow as a person.",
    "I highly recommend it if one is interested in the Brazilian culture.",
    "Great introduction to Portuguese! You learn a ton and it sets you up to travel in a Portuguese-speaking country or to continue to study it.",
    "Summary: a challenging and intense course taught by an amazing professor who makes it so much fun.Recommended for those willing to put in a little effort and learn an amazing language."
