   "comments": [
    "I learned many things about issues beyond the classroom that deeply affect education in the United States as a whole. I learned to engage in a class with 7 others and speak my mind on issues that do not yet have a right answer beyond my personal reasoning, and to write in formats that are unfamiliar to me (like a policy memo).",
    "I received a really broad knowledge of K-12 education. I became familiar with concepts I had heard before, but never actually knew about. I feel like I can have an intelligent conversation on topics from common core to teachers unions and I have a balanced understanding.",
    "I got a solid background in the various parts to K-12 public education policy. Although the content was broad, there was plenty to pique my interest for further study.",
    "Looking at a wide variety of issues, I was able to gain some insight into subfields of education I probably would not have engaged with otherwise.",
    "This class provided a pretty broad overview to Ed Studies and many different aspects of education.",
    "This is a broad survey course that attempts to scratch the surface of many issues surrounding contemporary education. It presented material in a meaningful and insightful way, and the inclusion of guest speakers made the class even better.",
    "I learned how to think more critically about the components and agents of the American K-12 public education system. I used to believe that the condition of my local school system which did not accomplish in harness the potential of students and educators was simply a result of issues in leadership at the local and school levels. However, now I am aware that it is much more complex than that. At every level, national, state, local, there are countless decisions and factors that affect the classroom experience of the student and teacher, some of the most pressing including comprehensive teacher training and continued support, policy that is effective while fitting flexible enough to specific needs of local settings, and well-developed, suitable standards and curriculum, among other things.",
    "I learned a lot about the American education system, especially regarding issues of inequity. It was something I was not really aware of, and it made me realize how limited my perspective and experiences had been.",
    "Although EDST 110 is, by nature, a general survey course, it triggered for me a love of the material that inspired me to apply to the Education Studies Program. I obtained a lot of information, which triggered an interest that I hope to pursue in my remaining time here.",
    "Learned how to write a policy memo and got a really broad overview of issues in education.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of how the education system functions in America and a stepping off point for many issues I would like to explore in greater depth.",
    "Learned more about some of the terminology that I've heard a lot of: common core, charter schools, school choice, etc.",
    "I got more insight into the world of policymaking, and the kind of thinking required to analyze policy\/education issues.",
    "This course was a very broad survey of many issues facing American public K-12 education. I am no more aware of the many debates occurring in the field of education and the different policies that have been proposed or enacted to solve them.",
    "I gained consciousness of just how broken our public education system is, felt inspired to learn more, and learned the basics of policy memo writing.",
    "I really came away with a much better appreciation for the complexities of education. I believe my views are much more nuanced now as a result of this class.",
    "I gained a better understanding of the relationship between practice, policy, and research, as well as the challenges faced by each of these \"branches\" of education.",
    "I definitely learned a good amount about different policy issues regarding education in the United States and a bit about the rest of the world.",
    "This course really emphasized looking at an issue from all perspectives and considering the nexus at the center of education: practice, policy, and research. It teaches deliberate and careful thinking and analysis. It also helps students develop different writing styles that are relevant to education, as each writing assignment is in a different format.",
    "This was a rather exciting class because it allowed me to connect with a topic that I'd been interested in for a while but not had the time to thoroughly explore. It's always nice to put yourself through the stress of writing a decently long paper to keep those skills fresh.",
    "I learned about American education policy in some depth, and learned a lot in my final research project.",
    "I don't think I learned much in this course. Everyone knows the education system sucks but this course was way too brief to cover everything. The lecture style was terrible.",
    "In EDST 110, we learned a lot about the inequity that exists within the American system of public education. We view it through a historical and philosophical lens, while touching on topics that include bilingual and special education, teachers' unions, and more. Personally, I was exposed to the scholarship and vocabulary that allowed me to elaborate on my experiences with education thus far.",
    "It was a great course where I learned a great deal about education policy. Great intro course in education.",
    "More information about educational systems in the US",
    "From this course, I gained an extremely broad perspective on the American education system as a whole. I learned just how intractable education dilemmas are, along with some potential solutions that, of course, come with their own sets of potential drawbacks. Overall, this class reinforced my belief that education practice\/policy is maybe the most effective avenue for enacting wide-ranging societal change.",
    "I think that this course improved my methodology when it came to thinking about education, more so than anything else. Although this was good and the readings and lectures taught me how to be better skeptical of graphs and charts that are provided on policy statements, for example, I went into this course expecting to be exposed to more diverse or unfamiliar content. Although I would say that I was interested in education studies prior to taking this class, I did expect to learn a lot of new content through this course. Unfortunately, not much of the topics we learned came to me as a surprise and although I developed a new language with which to talk about certain issues in education, my awareness of issues in the field did not expand.",
    "I learned about a survey of educational issues in the U.S. K-12 education system such as teacher quality, school choice, charter schools, ESL\/ELL education, emotional intelligence, pedagogy, teachers unions, and more. Each week was a different topic so you got to scratch the surface of each one, while choosing the topics you wished to explore in more depth through your papers and posts in the class Facebook group. We also heard from education professionals as guest speakers which shed a lot of light on what people in the education field can do. I have a better understanding of just how complicated the education system is in America, and my passion for and interest in the education field has been intensified.",
    "I developed a wide-ranging background knowledge in education and a very detailed knowledge of the subject of my research project. Because of the nature of a survey course, we didn't delve all that deeply into any one specific subject that we studied, like early childhood education or school choice, but we covered each with enough detail to get a sense of the current educational landscape in the U.S. The final project also allowed us to explore one area more thoroughly, and I really enjoyed the opportunity to dig into the subject with Lizzy's guidance.",
    "I learned various theories of education as well as gaining an introductory look at issues such as school reform, standardized testing, development of standards, school diversity and integration, school choice, etc. These are issues that I am glad to have encountered before entering the workforce as an assistant teacher next year."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are really in the information that gets put forth by the readings, the documentaries assigned, the classroom-esque discussions that occur among even a lecture of 70 students, and the guest lecturers. From what I can tell, the course caters to students already vested in education-- from what I could tell, people that were taking this class to explore and become interested in education appeared to not be as satisfied. Thus, the greatest weakness in this course is likely engaging the weakest links. The TAs were amazing, and overall, I felt that the classroom environment was encouraging and very positive and tight-knit in proportion to the size.",
    "Lizzy's expertise shined through the entire semester, so it was great to have an expert teaching us about the difficult issues in education policy. One might weakness might be that we had relatively few grades and concrete feedback - I know a few of my classmates found that frustrating.",
    "Fewer longer, more repetitive readings. Instead, reading\/watching more interviews with people in the field would be more worth the time spent reading. Darling-Hammond and Chenowith were very similar, and I think reading more deeply Into one chapter of either book would be worth replacing the other book.",
    "A lot of readings and lecture can be pretty dry, but it isn't too much work and sometimes the readings are interesting.",
    "This course is only limited by the broad material that the syllabus covers. Professor Carroll designed the class to be insightful and engaging regardless of topics only being discussed at the surface level.",
    "The readings, particularly at the beginning of the course, though heavy, was incredibly interesting. I appreciated how it allowed me to consider and understand different concepts and points of view that I was not previously aware of. I do however wish that the presentation of material were more engaging and better presented in a matter that is interesting. It seemed as though presentations are were composed of often long regurgitations of reading and timelines that were sped through without little context. Additionally, it would be much more reasonable to have the final paper be due sometime during reading week\/exams, because for many students, the last day of class deadline fell when they had extensive midterms, final presentations, and the like. In order to ensure that students can adequately prepare for those and still do their paper justice, it would be better if they could have more time to complete it to the best of their ability.",
    "The actual content of this course was highly interesting. I found myself doing the readings for this class first, which is always a good sign.",
    "Readings are very interesting and the professor facilitates class discussion in an effective way. Sometimes the readings were too long to be able to finish, and it was at times difficult to pay attention for the entire 75 minutes of lecture. Also, section times were very inconvenient and I was unable to attend either the normal one or the alternate one.",
    "This class often felt very disorganized and lacking in focus, the material was so broad that it was incredibly challenging to determine what was going on. There was also a crazy amount of work for what wasn't a very rewarding class.",
    "The course didnot teach us the skills it wanted us to do. IE policy memo. Graded harshly but never taught us how to do it",
    "I wish the class weren't so large. More discussion would have been great.",
    "The lecture style felt a bit dry and this class would be more engaging in a seminar format but understanding that that is not possible given the demand. The grading is a lot harsher than expected so be careful with the writing assignments.",
    "The course is way too long!",
    "The strength of this course is the readings-- they are interesting and thought-provoking. A weakness is the lecture itself, which is often not engaging and, for an education class, does surprisingly little to make connections between material.",
    "This is a good overview survey course on educational issues in the US, though it is a little boring at times.",
    "This course is unfortunately very dull. By the nature of it being a survey course, it covers a wide range of topics, and not very deeply. There were many times when I was really excited about a certain topic, but it was only discussed in passing for one lecture and then never mentioned again. Posting reading responses in a Facebook group didn't seem like the most effective way to engage with the reading and promote conversation within the class. Perhaps it would have been more effective to have a small group of students take responsibility for each reading, leading a class discussion for a few minutes at the beginning of lecture. I think this would have been more valuable for me, and would have led to deeper and more thoughtful discussion than can be achieved through a Facebook group. The strength of this course, however, was absolutely the guest speakers. It was so informative to hear from union leaders, administrators, teachers, researchers, etc. I especially loved the presentation that Dena Simmons gave on emotional intelligence- probably one of my all-time favorite classes in my time at Yale!",
    "The course material is meaningful and interesting, as are the readings. Lecture often did not add much to the readings for the week, however, and I wish class time was used more productively. The seminar-lecture hybrid activities were awkward and rarely contributed anything new.",
    "Only suggestion: If possible, it might be helpful to have section after 6 pm. I wish I could have attended.",
    "The lectures are the biggest weakness. The readings are really pertinent and interesting but you will need a strong will to soldier through them sometimes. Professor Carroll is a nice person and easy to talk to but the lectures need improvement",
    "The clear strength of this class is the final project, which Lizzy has allowed nearly complete freedom. Because the discussion section was held during a time that was inaccessible to most, I felt that I did not always have the chance to engage with the reading beyond doing a 100 word Facebook post.",
    "Strengths: - Lizzy is a caring Professor who is engaged with the course material - The other students in the class are very interesting to talk to, and I enjoyed getting to know them through Lizzy's in class discussion activities Weaknesses: - The class focused too little on things relating to identity and difference in ability. - The class was too traditional in its methods, and the assignments were too writing-centric. - We learned very little about things such as social and emotional learning, experiential learning, etc., and very little about teaching, pedagogy, etc. - The class talks about the question of whether education is an art or a science, and I feel that it learns too far in the direction of approaching it as a science.",
    "It's a very boring lecture because Lizzy just gets in front of the room and lectures. She spends 30 minutes on announcements that could simply be posted in the class course. We posted our reading responses on Facebook and a lot of times, people just end up repeating what others have said. This method is meant to create discussion but I don't think that worked. There was way too much reading for us to properly understand. Also, because we don't have to discuss the readings in class, I rarely read all of them.",
    "The course did a good job going over a variety of subjects related to education. I especially liked it when Lizzy allowed us to discuss with fellow classmates on topics that were currently learning during class.",
    "The course readings were excellent. Students had to submit reading responses on a class Facebook Page Professor Carroll created and i found it to be a very helpful way of thinking about the readings and engaging with other students online. The TFs and professor were warm, welcoming, and always willing to meet outside of class. As for a weakness, I really hoped that we had more opportunities to engage in small group discussions on the readings and how they tie to our personal experiences with education. Honestly, I would have preferred for section to be mandatory for everyone.",
    "The course seemed to be taught in a way that was very similar to high school... was this trying to be a lecture or a discussion section? I wish the boundary between the two was clearer and I wish I could go to lecture and sit and listen and feel inspired. These were things that didn't happen that really wanted to happen, not only in teaching quality but also in subject material and the way the course is structured. The course isn't very proactive when dealing with issues and is quite depressing. The flexibility in the final project was wonderful, but most other things of the class were really disengaging. There was one guest speaker (Deena) who really stuck out and caught my attention -- it was the one lecture where I was really engaged and took something away. I would love if things were like this more!",
    "I think the lecture was always really boring. Also, the lecture format limited the option to have deep conversations about the readings",
    "The course's main strength was the variety and depth of the course assignments. Writing a purpose statement, policy memo, classroom reflection, and extensive research paper offered me practice with multiple different writing and argumentative styles in addition to deepening my knowledge of education. Also, the final poster presentations were unlike anything I've done at Yale, and were extremely helpful for narrowing my focus for the final paper. The course's main weakness is an unavoidable one, given its nature as a survey course. We simply covered too many disparate topics, to the point that I found it difficult to sustain my interest from class to class. Because we had to jump around from teachers' unions to ELL's to case studies to education philosophy, I never felt I had a strong grasp on any one topic. Still, I guess that comes with the territory when designing a course that covers all of American education, and the course definitely met its goal of introducing me to the multifaceted nature of education practice\/policy\/research.",
    "As a survey course we covered a fairly wide range of topics, in a way that did not feel as rushed as other survey courses I have taken previously. The major weakness of this course, in my opinion, is how much structure is lacking in the assignments. Since it is a survey course, I do appreciate how the assignments provide students with the opportunity to essentially talk about specific topics in education that interest them the most. However, sometimes students were left with such little structure and ideas to work off of that it would cause them more harm and difficulty in completing the assignment. For example, talking to my peers, I recall many students being initially excited about the final project because we finally had the opportunity to talk about specific issues not touched upon in the course that we were interested in. However, upon choosing a topic and aiming to write about it, we found that we were lacking in constructive ways of talking about a topic that was not or seldom discussed in the course. Furthermore, the policy statement project was a great opportunity for students who had previously not had written a policy statement. However, even the samples that were given did not help enough because we simply have not focused explicitly elsewhere in class on how to think like a policymaker.",
    "You learn so much about the education field, and it's great to hear so many perspectives from your classmates in class and in the class Facebook group. Definitely take it if you're interested in education at all! Some weaknesses would be the \"leminar\" setup. The class was around 70 students and was run at times like a lecture and at other times like a seminar, which made it a little awkward and difficult to share your thoughts if you're shy. Sometimes, we had small group discussions, which was wonderful. The class should have more small group discussions as that made for more thought-provoking sessions. Also, Lizzie is very insightful and passionate, but at times her voice was monotone. The interesting course material makes class interesting though. One of the biggest pro's about the class is the guest speakers who were absolutely inspirational. Learned so much from them about their expertise, their lives, and their jobs.",
    "A strength of the course is that the material it covers is essential and fascinating. Prof. Carroll has chosen engaging readings that contain information which I consider genuinely necessary to my growth as an American voter and a future educator. The major weakness of the course is time management. A lot of time was spent discussing logistics before each lesson (once a full thirty minutes!) and even more time was wasted each day in organizing the notes for the lesson, setting up the projector, complaining about the awkwardness of teaching in a mathematics laboratory, and apologizing longwindedly about how difficult it would be to cover the full course's worth of material in only one semester. The fact that lectures were poorly organized and rarely added any new depth to the readings made me (and many of my peers) feel that attendance was unnecessary. I skipped half of the lectures for this course--something I've never done before in my time at Yale--and still got an A because I did the readings and approached assignments diligently. I was very disheartened that the class whose material mattered most to me was the one I was least compelled to actually attend.",
    "Strengths: -Prof. Carroll's wealth of knowledge and her dedication to the content of the course -The openness of the assignments, and the preparation given for each Areas for improvement: - The technical difficulties of the room and the A\/V system really did influence our learning and made it difficult to engage. - I found some of the lesson structures very difficult to follow. It seemed often ideas were presented and then not followed up on, and the lectures jumped around without a cogent takeaway."

   "comments": [
    "If a person told me that they were really interested in the problems of education, I would absolutely recommend that they take this course. If they told me that they just wanted to take a class that would fascinate them, I might not suggest this class because, unless one is already deeply interested in the content, it can come across as dry. I found Lizzy, and the TAs (I spoke mostly with Clare) to be wonderfully supportive, kind, and helpful in fostering my already existing enthusiasm for the subject. If I think that my friend would approach the course with the preexisting interest that I had, then I would absolutely encourage them to take this!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Students should not graduate form Yale without knowing more about the education system.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in education policy. If you're interested in the field, it's a great class.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone without any prior study in education. Having read a good deal of the material before taking the class, I found it hard to get motivated for readings, classes, and assignments; however, If the material were new to me, as It will be to most, it is a very worthwhile class.",
    "Would recommend to people interested in applying to the education studies program, if you aren't you might be better off taking a different education studies class.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Carroll is an incredible professor and the course will leave you wanted to keep taking Education Studies classes. It is my hope that everyone at Yale take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in education theory, practice, and policy. The readings and class discussions on Facebook are often very insightful and you will better understand the issues present in the K-12 American education system. One warning is that lecture tends to be very slow and at times boring, particularly later in the course. Overall the course is good and the assignments are doable, though expect lots of reading especially at the beginning of the semester.",
    "Yes. I think this is one of those courses every Yalie should take before they graduate. Not only is the content very interesting, but it really broadens your perspective. Most Yalies come from very privileged backgrounds, and I think that makes this course even more necessary.",
    "Anyone with an interest in education should absolutely take this course, even if they don't plan to pursue the program. Invaluable background.",
    "No, this class wasn't engaging or interesting enough if you were actually interested in Education Studies and not easy enough if you just needed a SO credit.",
    "Yes. The issues covered in this class are so important. Even if you are not an \"education\" person, these things are important to know!",
    "Yes it is required if you want to be an educations studies scholar. Otherwise, other education classes are probably better if you just want to learn more.",
    "Yes-- very relevant topic to everyone",
    "Yes, but only if they are VERY interested in an array of education issues.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in education and wants to get a basic knowledge about many different, possible areas for greater depth of inquiry in the subject who is willing to put up with some boring lectures.",
    "Depends. It's required if you want to apply for the ed studies program. I'm glad I took it now that it's over because I thought it really opened my eyes to a lot of problems in the education system and I learned what certain catch phrases (common core, school choice, etc.) mean. I think these are important issues for Americans to be aware of. On the other hand, lectures weren't always the most interesting and you can totally get away without doing most of the reading, which is both good and bad.",
    "If you're genuinely interested in education, take it and you'll get to explore topics that are interesting to you without much strain in terms of workload. However, if the topic isn't one that you're really passionate about, I think you'll be both bored and intimidated by other students\/policymakers in the field.",
    "This course is required if you want to apply to the Education Studies Scholars program, and most people seem to take it for that reason. But if you're just in it for the So credit, then there are plenty of much more exciting classes to take at Yale. I like Lizzy as a professor, but it just seems that she doesn't really enjoy teaching this course that much- and I can see why. I imagine it was even more frustrating for her than it was for me to have to spend an hour or so on a complex, interesting topic, and then promptly move on. Such is the nature of a survey course. In many ways, this class is a necessary evil to get to the much more interesting education electives. The class does have a lot of strengths though- the guest speakers are incredible. We got to hear from union leaders, school administrators, teachers, researchers, and more. It is inspiring to hear from people that have made an impact in education right here in New Haven. On that thread, I also really enjoyed the classroom observation component of the course. It was encouraging to go into a New Haven public school and see the incredible work that is happening on a daily basis. Lizzy assigns a lot of reading, but it is not the end of the world if you don't read every word. The assignments vary in difficulty a lot. At the beginning of the semester, you will write a \"purpose statement\" about your educational beliefs, which was straightforward and easy to write. However there is also a policy memo, for which we received little guidance- this was very difficult to write, so start it early! The course culminates in a 12-15 page research paper on a topic of your choosing.",
    "The information is depressing but incredibly enlightening. Take it if you are grateful for your own educational experiences and want to learn how incredibly fortunate we are to be at Yale. This course will remind you to never take your education for granted.",
    "Yes! This is a great foundation for understanding the education world.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in education or education-related fields. It provided an important overview to a lot of the current and most important topics in education today.",
    "This course provided a very good survey of important and pressing topics in the K-12 American public education system. This is a great course for anyone interested in learning more about American education, regardless of their major. It doesn't go very much in depth into any of the topics (and is designed to be that way), but instead helps students identify issues they're personally interested in. The course is very interesting and involves a lot of student participation! Would definitely recommend.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone who is not interested in either the final project or at least the Education Studies program. The content of the class alone is intriguing, but the reading is always too much and too little discussed, and the lectures involve the mindless droning on of PowerPoints. Professor Carroll would be a fantastic seminar teacher, but the nature of this course, being a large lecture, would lead me not to suggest it to anyone not interested in either the final project or the Ed Studies program.",
    "Not unless you are considering the education scholars program for which it is a prerequisite, or are very interested in learning about education policy in the US.",
    "This course is required to get into ed studies concentration. It's honestly a really terrible intro lecture class with about 70 students and just Lizzy lecturing in the front of the room. A lot of the information isn't new. If you went to school in the US, you have probably experienced all of the problems she described. The class is 1 hr and 50 minutes long but most of it will just be spent with you sending out emails on the computer because the lecture is too boring.",
    "An overall solid course, though I don't know if I'd take it if presented with the choice again. The readings were interesting and the assignments enjoyable, but Professor Carroll's lectures generally felt less than fulfilling, and I often found myself questioning the value of class time.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it's always important to learn about the fundamental problems within our education system and how such problems translates into other aspects of society. Having this knowledge can really give you a multifaceted perspective of the people you work with and the decisions you make in almost any field.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The readings were amazing and the professor was always willing to meet outside of class to discuss course material or assignments. I think this course is an excellent way to learn about the American public education system - something many of us have benefited from, but have not thought about how lucky we are to have had the experiences that we did.",
    "I think you should only take this class if you are planning to apply for the Ed Studies program. Lectures were boring and the course doesn't really focus on philosophies of education but rather kind of mopes around about current problems in education. It can be fruitful if you get really engaged, but it's quite difficult to do so since the lectures are so dry.",
    "Ultimately, you have to take this course if you're interested in the Education Studies program. I wouldn't recommend it if you're not interested: information is presented very disjointly, reading responses on Facebook are interesting to read, but the way Professor Carroll mentions them in class isn't helpful. It seems a significant portion of the class didn't go to lecture. Lectures were often disorganized, and didn't seem worth attending. However, it is an easy class (although grading is nitpicky and doesn't seem normalized by grader). There are no tests and the final project doesn't have to do with the rest of the course, so you could get by with doing very little of the readings. I'd recommend doing reading responses at the beginning of the course, and then spending less time in the later half.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're thinking about pursuing a career in education. It made me less enthusiastic about going into teaching after college, but only because it offered a blunt, honest, and critical look at the harrowingly substandard American education system. Others may be inspired to go into the field when introduced to the same material, which covers everything from education inequity to ELL education. Also, the final poster presentations were unlike anything I've done at Yale, and were extremely helpful for narrowing my focus for the final paper.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who either (1) has no previous background in education studies whatsoever or (2) who is interested in applying for the Education Studies program and needs this as a prerequisite for their application. Otherwise, if a student is interested in education studies but not the academic program, I would suggest that they simply try to get into one of the upper level seminars in the Education Studies program.",
    "Take it if you're interested at all in education!!!!!!! But the class is what you make of it, so try to do all the readings and engage with the material.",
    "If you're interested in education, there isn't a better place to start. The background you get in EDST 110 will serve you extremely well in future education studies or just as a voting citizen. Lizzy presents the material in a way that really lets you grapple with the concepts and ideas and come to your own conclusions. The classroom observation gives a nice insight into New Haven schools and is an incredible way to concretely see all the topics you've studied abstractly in class. The research project allows you to basically pick the most interesting topic in education and dive deep into it. Overall, I think the class does a great job introducing education and giving you a solid foundation to interpret education policy and current debates.",
    "Just because the syllabus\/readings cover so many topics of deep importance to the aspiring educator, parent or policy-maker, yes, I would recommend this course. However, I'd forewarn you that the lectures are poorly organized and don't add much to your learning. The real meat of the course is in readings and assignments. I know that Prof. Carroll cares deeply about the issues at stake in education and gives helpful feedback and reflections one on one, but unfortunately, the lectures are very weak."
