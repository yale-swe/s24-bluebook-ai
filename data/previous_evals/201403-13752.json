    "Take it! Blaakman is enthusiastic, positive, and helpful. The subject is slightly obscure and might fail to motivate someone who thinks it's arbitrary. This class heavily prioritizes analysis of primary and secondary sources over learning facts. You don't need to do all the reading, but you should do some. The readings are mostly interesting. Class is rarely boring as Blaakman is excellent.",
    "Blaakman is great! if he teaches this again, take it!",
    "It was a really enjoyable course that I would recommend to those interested either in U.S. history or in the history of capitalism. I was quite fortunate this year that it was went somewhat under the radar as a history department seminar, which greatly added to the experience. Despite the fact that students taking this class at a later time will likely not have this advantage (such is the quality of the course), I would still highly suggest it. Traces the growth and emergence of capitalism in the United States, as well as the intricacies which helped shape this development. For instance, one highlight was a discussion on counterfeit currency and, in general, paper money and the role this played in shaping the American political economy (though I did have reservations about the text we read for this session). Even for someone with very little prior knowledge of U.S. history this course is absolutely worthwhile.",
    "I would strongly recommend it. You will learned about the interplay between economics and politics in the early republic from a variety of different portals. You will probably come away from the course with a permanently altered way of thinking of the founding.",
    "The course focuses on the American Revolution and then zeroes in on many \"smaller\" events in US history. The course attempts to identify how such shaped and molded capitalism and politics in America. It's not a course focused on giving students a running list of events; the course focuses much more on a student's ability to read effectively, synthesize information, and write convincingly. A student can begin to memorize a list of dates and events from the information that is covered, but that is far from the focus of the class and the assignments given won't help a student memorize events. I would recommend this class to anyone looking to improve his\/her reading, writing, and critical thinking skills and to anyone who wants another vantage point from which to look at history. I would certainly recommend taking Blaakman up on his offers to assist in writing papers or just going by for office hours as my short meetings with him were often more insightful than much longer meetings with other professors."
