    "Orientalism in Art and Literature is a fantastic opportunity to push yourself out of your comfort zone and learn a lot about a both interesting and crucial topic. If you aren't familiar with art history, some of those articles may be dense and difficult to get through, but the class discussion usually accounts for that. We used a lot of mediums to gain insight into the topic: paintings, movies, plays and books. We also had several guest lecturers. The workload is manageable and the professors really want you to succeed and get a lot out of the class. Take it!",
    "Definitely recommend it. A great class if you are not very familiar with art history",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to my peers. The seminar setting was truly wonderful, and I enjoyed having only six students in the class and two professors. The expertise of the professors is extremely evident, and the amount I learned this semester, not only about Orientalism, but about art and the modern impacts of Orientalism, is extraordinary. I loved this class, it was definitely one of my favorites. The readings and the discussions were always very interesting and I never felt bored in class. The professors worked very well together and were always willing to help us one on one. The subject of Orientalism is still extremely relevant today and I would recommend this class to any student that has an interest in the Middle East and the relations between the Middle East and the West. Overall, a wonderful class that I enjoyed the entire semester.",
    "This course was an excellent survey into the history of the development of Orientalism. We began with reading a piece of the landmark work of postcolonial literature, Orientalism by Edward Said, and then analyzed pieces of literature and artwork through the lens of the work. As someone who is double majoring in two STEM fields, the course was extremely accessible. Each student's observations were valued and considered throughout the semester, fostering deep, meaningful discussions. I would recommend that anyone who likes discussion courses and cross-cultural narratives. Also, I took Dr. Camacho's Introduction to Ethnicity, Race, and Migration ER&M 200 course in the fall before taking this seminar. Orientalism in Art and Literature was a perfect expansion on Intro to ER&M, so someone who is considering taking that course should definitely take this one."
