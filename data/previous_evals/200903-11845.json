    "A fun class. Prof. Weiss is a riot, and also the very top of his field. There are some really interesting ideas in this course that are really the cutting edge of the discipline. The class is also ridiculously disorganized. If you don't mind this, then go for it.",
    "This course was an overview of the major climate changes throughout history and the corresponding effect on and response of major civilizations at the time. The first half of the course was focused on more recent changes and involved reading Late Victorian Holocausts and Jared Diamond's Collapse. The second half was focused on ancient climate changes effecting the Anasazi, Maya, and Mesopotamian civilizations."
