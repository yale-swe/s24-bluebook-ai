    "No. Not enough threads to tie it together; relied too much on close reading.",
    "Amazing class. The guest lecturer series had some very high caliber Nietzsche scholars. The professors were extremely friendly. The material is what you take from it. If you're a bum who doesn't do the reading, it won't do much for you to take this class. And the seminar will bore you.But, If you are passionate about Nietzsche or Emerson, you need to talk with one of the two professors.",
    "This class was more intellectually rigorous than almost any other I've taken. I think it functioned much like a philosophy graduate school course would, and perhaps because I don't have the strongest philosophy background, I would have appreciated more structure in the discussion and course.",
    "Amazing class. Take it, take it, take it. A working knowledge of 19th century philosophy will serve you well.",
    "YES!",
    "A chance to read some amazing works by Emerson and Nietzsche in a structured context. Really I feel like we just scratched the surface, these essays and books go so very deep. I felt that the true understanding came only from writing about these works, not from discussing them in class. The supplementary lectures were hit or miss. The final lecture was mind blowingly good.",
