    "You cover the Tokugawa to 1910, but I wanted the class to go on because you stop right when you start to know how things end. Not too much work, great lectures, great TAs, and it's fascinating period of history.",
    "One of the best history classes at Yale. Take it. Great material and a passionate professor.",
    "Japan's Modern Revolution is a survey course of Japan's history from the Tokugawa Period until the early 20th century - worth it if you are interested in Japan, East Asia, an interesting history course on a period that isn't studied very much. Great for East Asian majors like myself, even if you are not planning on concentrating on Japan, gives a great perspective on the region, and you learn a ton. Botsman is great + he gives an excellent lecture + cares about his students, workload is not bad at all, and section turned out to be pretty good. Highly recommended.",
    "Really great way to fulfill the non-western credit. The reading isn't too difficult and the lectures are interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. You will learn a ton and be privy to awesome lectures without having to bear a stressful workload.",
    "Take this class if you're at all interested in Japan, the formation of Imperialism in Asia or if you just want a rest of the world credit. Botsman is an engaging lecture that made coming to class a huge amount of fun, so there's really no reason not to. Workload minimal, although there's one essay in the middle of the semester that's pretty annoying.",
    "This is an excellent history course. I took it knowing absolutely nothing about Japan, and now I want to know more. Botsman is a great lecturer, the readings are generally interesting, and the workload is reasonable for a history class. Highly recommended!",
    "Best lecture class I have taken at Yale so far. Professor Botsman is a boss and this class (and any others he teaches) will only grow in popularity. Workload isn't bad, and really, you will likely pay so much attention in class that it won't feel like much work outside of the lecture hall.Wholeheartedly recommend this class if you are interested in a pivotal time in Japan's History.",
    "A really interesting lecture and so worthwhile, especially if you know very little about East Asianhistory. I knew hardly anything about Japan, let alone pre-industrial Japan before this class and throughout found myself really enjoying the material and the professor. Readings were interesting and grouped by priority for section. Exams were very reasonable.Please do yourself the favor and at least shop this course. Just because the professor is Australian does not mean you should take it though! Fortunately, he's a good lecturer and a great guy, legit reasons to take a class.",
    "Definitely take this course. This is one of the best lecture courses I have taken in the history department at Yale. Professor Botsman is an excellent lecturer and presents a wonderful mix of political, social, and cultural history, which is a rare find for a history lecture. I knew little about Japanese history prior to taking the course, but have completed the course with a newfound interest in the subject. The exams are fair and the papers are definitely manageable.",
    "This is an excellent class. To those who have not taken a class in Asian History, this class is a great start. The readings and lecture are highly interesting, and Professor Botsman is a great lecturer with a superb sense of humor. There isn't one lecture when you do not walk away feeling highly entertained and satisfied. It also offers a great survey on Japanese history between 16th-19th century, especially the 19th century. It has a pretty sensible workload (1 mid term, 1 finals, 1 paper (5-6 pages) and 1 short paper (1-2 page). I would highly recommend this class because of its wonderful lecturer and its amazing lecture content. Students will be intrigued, amazed and impressed by the depth, breadth and highly fascinating content of the lectures.",
    "Yes, yes, yes. This course is worth it for Botsman alone - he is easily one of the best professors I've ever had. Not only is he incredibly personable, he has the patience of a saint, he stuck out his neck in order to get us better section times, and has the most brilliant accent (oh, and a beautiful family). He wrote the book on punishment and penal revision in 19th century Japan (really pay attention to that lecture), and knows this material cold. No, you don't have to speak Japanese to take this course - although it helps - and no, you don't have to be studying Asia to warrant a look at HIST 303. It's just a solid class that will get you thinking about the power of ideas in the realm of historical change. Be forewarned that the course is unusualin that it is top-heavy: that is, the first half of the semester is work-intensive (reading response, research paper, midterm) compared to the second half (essentially, just the final). So don't get bogged down early on. The reading for section is often gratuitous but often interesting and from primary sources. Make sure to get to know Botsman on a personal level because he is just the sickest guy. For the first time in a long time, I found a course at Yale in HIST 303 where I could sit down for 50 minutes and take continuous notes - the lectures are that involved and fascinating. In short, you should probably just take this class!",
    "It's a very interesting topic and Professor Botsman is a great lecturer. Shop it once, and you'll probably sign up.Things to know going in: 1. Almost all of the readings, and all of the attendant section discussions, are primary sources. I happen to think this is awesome, but if you really prefer jumping into scholarly arguments, you're out of luck. 2. The class is very front-loaded (or at least, it was this term). But after the midterm, which does actually come around the middle of the term, it was nice, smooth sailing until the final exam. 3. The tests and assignments are very easy if you've done the work. 4. There will be some lectures on oddly specific subjects (Tokyo's architecture, penal system reforms, etc.). They will be interesting, but if you're sitting there wondering, \"Why on earth do I have to know this?\" don't worry, because you probably won't. The tests deal a lot with the narrative line of history and very little with these tangential topics. They're just fun to learn.",
    "I recommend it to any student who's interested in Japan. No need of past experience of learning Japanese or Eastern history.",
    "This is a interesting class for someone, like me, who knows next to nothing about Japanese history. Professor Botsman is an entertaining and informative lecturer. There is more reading than most history lectures, at least a hundred pages a week, but most of it is interesting stuff.",
    "Absolutely take it! Japanese history is a lot more interesting than you think and the class is fascinating regardless of whether or not you have a background in studying East Asia. Botsman gives thoroughly entertaining lectures, and the readings are all very compelling.",
    "It's a good Rest of World. Botsman is wonderful, both as a lecturer and as a person.",
    "Really fun class. Professor Botsman is very engaging and he has really interesting lectures. This class is a history of 19th century Japan, and it provides a great background for understanding Japan's role in the 20th century. The readings are also pretty fun...a lot of primary sources, diaries of samurai and whatnot. It was really fun to just go to lecture and absorb so much information without even trying. Not the most stressful class, but very interesting and fun.",
    "This class is a comprehensive look at 300 or so years of Japanese history. It is a good class if, like me, you don't have too much experience with Japanese history. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in history.",
    "Very good class! Take it",
    "History 303 with Professor Botsman is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. He is an engaging lecturer, whose humor and sometimes quirky insight make you want to discover more of Japanese History. I loved this class. All you had to do was pay attention in lecture, do the readings, show up and participate in section, and you were fine in the course. Great course!",
    "This class is broken down into three general groups: people who speak Japanese very well and know a lot about the country, history majors looking for a rest of world credit, and jocks. If you belong to the first group, this class will be easy, entertaining, and informative. If you belong to the second or third, it will be somewhat less so, but still probably worth taking.",
    "Great class! Definitely take. Botsman is a great lecturer, readings are very manageable. Our TAs this year were really easy graders (might change from year to year). Great ROW credit for History, and gives you a novel and interesting view (on events like Perry\u0092s opening of Japan) even if you\u0092re a non-major!",
    "I definitely recommend this class if you're interested in Japanese history or even if you just need to fulfill the \"rest of the world\" history requirement. The time period covered in this course is one of the most interesting in Japan's history, in my opinion, and the class does a great job in teaching the material. Professor Botsman is a great lecturer and his lectures were always very engaging and informative. The workload was also very doable. I learned a lot from this class and would definitely recommend others taking it."
