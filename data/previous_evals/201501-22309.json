    "Excellent course. Interesting readings and a great professor.",
    "A survey of Microhistory as a tool for understanding broader narratives in modern Imperial history. A lot of reading, but some very interesting topics and fun research.",
    "An amazing course of reading with a paper you'll be excited to write.",
    "I highly recommend the course. Prof. Stephens is a phenomenal, energetic, and kind teacher.",
    "Definitely take it. A great junior seminar and introduction to higher level history discourse and academic work, especially with Professor Stephen's guidance and help.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to every history major, as well as any non-majors interested in taking a history seminar. Family and Empire covers a broad range of time periods and locations, so there's something for everyone. Also, you can write your research paper on any era and region, which both allows for a lot of freedom and means that you'll learn a lot from your classmates (through paper workshops and presentations), who will likely be working on topics quite different from yours. As a history major, this class was useful because it introduced me to the genre of microhistory. There was an emphasis on both research methods and styles of writing history that will be indispensable for anyone who is starting to think about their senior essay. Although there is a fair amount of reading, all of the books are thoroughly enjoyable; the sort of books you would read even if it wasn't required. Prof. Stephens is absolutely amazing: enthusiastic and extremely helpful when it comes to helping with research papers. Short version of evaluation: take this course!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The course had a very global perspective on ideas of family and empire. The reading list was awesome.",
    "Fantastic junior history seminar that weaves together (post-)colonialism, diaspora, gender\/class\/race relationships, historiography, and micro-history. I took it as a non-major and loved it. Prof. Stephens is so sweet and accessible to her students -- she'll go above and beyond to make sure you're getting everything out of the course. The emphasis on archival politics and subaltern studies, both specialties of hers, is fascinating. Highly recommended for majors and non-majors alike -- don't be scared by the standard research paper.",
    "Yes, particularly if you are interested in approaches to history. Look at the syllabus closely",
    "GREAT CLASS! If you think history is boring THINK AGAIN. Take this class, read about the stories about families, about individuals and think about yourself and the historical canon. Everyone is a small part of a larger narrative and this course really taught me about how I fit into the canon as well. If you are afraid of primary sources TAKE THIS CLASS and Professor Stephens will help you tease out the history behind a diary entry, a will, a letter. Take this class."
