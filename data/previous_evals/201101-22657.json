    "You should absolutely take this course. Professor Wood is fabulous and led such interesting class discussions. There is a good amount of reading each week, which is good to do. The two hours each week felt like nothing, and the trips to New York were great. There are two short writing assignments, a long final paper, a mini-research project, and a presentation of the final paper topic. Professor Wood is brilliant and you can't leave Yale without taking one of his classes. I definitely feel like I learned a lot from this course and would take it over again and again.",
    "As you might expect it is a detailed seminar on these artists.",
    "Good course, especially at the start. The course trailed off towards the end",
    "Absolutely take this course.",
    "A wonderful class with a wonderful professor. Wood is fantastic. Brilliant and a very deep thinker who pushed our class and truly valued our intellectual contributions. He made class an incredibly collaborative exercise. His paper comments were thoughtful, his syllabus carefully crafted, and his emphasis on scholarship was refreshing. The class focuses intensely on two artists without being overly narrow. The field trips were especially enlightening and gave the class even more depth.",
    "Don't take this class unless you are REALLY interested in the artists.",
    "This course focuses on the work of Bosch and Bruegel, so it is inevitably fascinating. The readings are really good and the trips to the YUAG and to the Met are wonderful.",
    "This class was such a joy. It kind of flew by such that I feel like we still had so much to cover, but I still feel like I got a lot out of the course-- mainly from the chance to share ideas and be in an environment in which everyone was excited to be there. Professor Wood is great (obviously knows his stuff but is also very approachable) and the trips to the Met are a highlight of the course. It's a very narrow subject, but as a non-art history major, it was a great opportunity to enjoy another field of study.",
    "If Professor Wood ever teaches this course again, you should do whatever it takes to get into the class. It was the best class I've ever taken at Yale. To be honest, I think Bosch&Bruegel are interesting, but they're far from being favorite artists in art history, but Professor Wood made the material so interesting and so relevant that I got more out of this class than I could have ever imagined going into it."
