   "comments": [
    "It's required for 118 (which it really shouldn't be...), so take it if you want to take 118.",
    "Only recommend if they are taking Chem 118",
    "I mean the only reason most people take this is for pre-med so you probably don't really have a choice. But definitely don't take this as a class for fun or to learn. It's way too much work and you hardly learn anything.",
    "A good introductory lab course, and a good reason to take CHEM 118. From what I've seen from friends in other labs, 119L is one of the more relaxed settings. Quizzes are not that hard, and the labs are generally pretty easy to do. I was never strapped for time, and Dr. Parr is a great resource if you're stuck on something. I was nervous coming into a high school lab course, but it didn't take long for me to realize that I was more than capable of doing the tasks.",
    "Recommended lab. Take with CHEM 118 of course. Be sure to do well on the pre-lab quizzes even though some are impossible to score 20\/20",
    "A standard, useful, interesting chemistry lab.",
    "It was a great class that did wonderful experiments over broad range of topics.",
    "A basic chemistry lab course. Not the most exciting, but required and useful in learning how to structure and write a basic lab report.",
    "Only take this class if it's a requirement for 118. It's nothing exciting and you don't learn all that much, but it's ok in terms of getting used to working in a lab.",
    "119 is a good lab course that goes with 118. Parr is great, take advantage of meeting with him one on one. He will explain everything very clearly, he wants people to do well. Your grade depends a lot on TA leniency or lack thereof. The quizzes matter A LOT for your grade so take them seriously. This class does take time and you have to put in effort to do well.",
    "recommend",
    "It was the perfect course for familiarizing students with the lab setting without too much pressure.",
    "I would recommend Chem 119L. It is a great introductory lab course that is engaging yet not overwhelming. The grading is fair and the labs for the most part are enjoyable, though do not often align to the Chem 118 curriculum.",
    "Would definitely recommend. A good course to reinforce proper lab etiquette and accumulate some lab experience. Also the work load is not bad at all. One lab report a week (you have one week to write it up), but very often these entailed only a results\/calculations section and discussion (only 2 full lab reports if I remember correctly).",
    "I don't really understand why labs are only 0.5 credits; I think labs should count as 1 credit - 4 hours of lab in one day in addition to writing a weekly lab report that takes some time to write. I had Friday labs with Dr. Parr and labs were fun. In the beginning of the semester you will have to buy the Lab Manual, a skinny packet that will contain the details and procedures and everything you'll need to know about the 10 labs you will do in CHEM 119L. I had labs on Friday from 1-5. Every Friday my lab (around 15-20 kids) met in a room in SCL upstairs, Dr. Parr would talk to us for 20-30 minutes explaining the purpose of that day's lab and procedures. Then we would get a 5-10 min. quiz (most of which were very fair, honestly only 1 or 2 were kind of hard), and then we'd go to the lab room and do the lab. Most kids finished by 3:30 or 4. You will only need to stay in the lab room until 4:30 or 5PM for 1 or 2 experiments. Overall, the class was enjoyable. What I recommend to kids taking this lab. If you have, for example, Wednesday labs, then to prepare for that day's experiment you should read the experiment's details twice in the lab manual. So if you had Wednesday labs, read the lab manual pages for that experiment on either Saturday or Sunday, and then read it again Wednesday morning before labs (which start at 1PM). The lab manual is about 120 pages. 10-15 pages of general stuff, and then each lab takes up 8-10 pages (it's really not as bad as it sounds trust me). For example, in the Lab Manual, Experiment #3 would have Background Info, General Idea, Purpose, Materials, Procedure, Equations, Calculation Examples, What You need in your lab report, etc. Doing the actual experiment itself isn't that hard, but what really annoying about CHEM 119L was writing the lab reports. The lab reports weren't really hard to write, they just took a lot of time and were a pain. You're expected to do everything on Microsoft Word\/Excel, typing in all equations, using excel to graph things, stuff like that. It's not hard, but it takes a long time just to type all the numbers and equations and make everything look pretty and presentable. Dr. Parr is cool and doesn't make you write a full lab report. Only for one lab will you have to actually write a full lab report. For the other nine lab reports you will only have to do 1 or 2 sections like Calculations\/Data and Discussion. Lab Reports take a lot of time to write, and what always happened to me was that I always had other work to do and I ended up doing the lab reports with my friends at 10PM or 11PM on Thursday night (I had Friday labs) and ended up finishing the lab report around 2-3AM. Thursday nights were always rough too cause sometimes I had essays due Friday for my English class, so I either wrote my essay early or wrote my lab reports early. Have better time management than me when it comes to writing lab reports lol. I ended up with an A in the lab but that's because I put a considerate amount of effort into each of my lab reports and I did fairly well on most of the in-lab quizzes. A 95% or higher is an A in CHEM 119L, and an A- is a 90%-95%. Almost everyone gets an A- or an A. What's also nice about CHEM 119L is that there is no final lab, no final anything; other labs have some sort of final, but since we have weekly quizzes in CHEM 119L (a total of 9 or 10 quizzes), those quizzes cumulatively counted as a final, which you'll be thankful for during finals week. Obviously looking back most kids will say that CHEM 119L really wasn't that bad, and they'll say this because they're done with the class and got it over with. I'll be truthful and say that CHEM 119L wasn't a hard class, but it was definitely time-consuming - 4 hours of lab a week and a lab report that took time. There is a lot of guidance in CHEM 119L and lots of directions to follow, so you 95% of the time you will never feel lost and feel like you know what you're doing.",
    "Lab course to accompany Chem 118; illustrates concepts through physical experiments. Take class if interested.",
    "Chem 119L should only be taken with 118 or for someone who needs a lab credit or basic knowledge on how to do different techniques in a chemistry lab. Titration is a recurring theme in this course and you get a lot of practice doing titrations. However some of the labs are very tedious and the lab reports can take a very long time.",
    "I recommend! This lab was very fair; a lot of knowledge obtained without an unneccesary amount of work. Like any other lab, it can be tedius, boring, and repetitive when reading measurements and repeating trials, but understanding the lab reports reinforced my understanding of chemistry concepts. Professor Parr and my TA were both really helpful and approachable for any questions on the lab. Some of the labs were harder to understand and the lab manual can be unclear.",
    "It was a class that introduced students to chemistry lab and taught us a lot of basic skills such as how to use a buret.",
    "Overall, this was a decent general chemistry lab. The material in the lab course aligned fairly well at times with the material in the accompanying lecture course (Chem 118). Dr. Parr's pre-lab lectures were very clear and informative. However, he was extremely condescending whenever people asked questions or answered questions incorrectly, both in the pre-lab and during the actual lab. The work load for this course was much greater than I had anticipated. The lab reports were challenging, and Dr. Parr really pushes you to write thoughtful and analytic discussion sections. Despite how difficult this course was, I do feel that I gained a lot from it.",
    "It's a great way to understand Chem 118 concepts from a lab perspective.",
    "Overall, this lab gave an overview of different general chemistry topics. I would recommend this lab to a student who has taken AP chemistry or some advanced chemistry class. One of the faults in the lab were that information covered in pre-lab quizzes and on lab reports were not always given in the lab manual or learned in Chem 118 (the class that accompanies the lab). As a result, a strong background in chemistry is needed in order to do well. The pre-lab quizzes could be fairly difficult but the lab reports were not as challenging. In the end, the lab reports weigh more than the quizzes so everything balances out.",
    "Overall, chem 119 was a good course. I would recommend it. Putting a lot of the principles we learn in lecture into practice and combining different principles enhanced chem 118 lessons but also deepened my understanding of chemistry. However, the lab and lab report write-ups were very, very tedious and very time consuming.",
    "Although I do find it necessary to understand how to use chemistry lab equipment and that one should see how theoretical chemistry applies in the physical world, be prepared that you might get frustrated with how the class is organized or the difficulty\/time-consuming nature of some of the labs.",
    "You have to take this lab if you're in CHEM 118. This is the only lab I have taken at Yale, and I do feel that it taught me lab skills.",
    "Overall, this class is only worth the time investment if you are committed to a chemistry major or a pre med program. The class is not the most informative from a theoretical standpoint, emphasizing practical skills in the lab over the concepts behind the experiments. If you are interested in chemistry as a major I would recommend this class, but otherwise I just can't see the lab contributing anything useful to a student's workload and learning."
