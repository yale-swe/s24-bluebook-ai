    "This course would teach you a lot about FDA. So if you are interested in regulatory affairs, it might be a great introduction course. However, this class is not well structured. You may need to spend more time outside classroom if you truly want to learn.",
    "Very Useful course",
    "The lectures are dry and hard to follow. The textbook is not available online.",
    "The guest lecturers for this course were excellent. Learned a lot from the course overall",
    "Strengths: - The professor actually has regulatory experience. This makes for a more insightful class lecture and discussion, and a view on current issues in the field. - That outside lecturers in various roles in regulatory affairs come into class to give us his\/her insights is really great. This makes the class so much more informative. - The timeliness of the class, once a week for 2 hours enables it to fit into our class schedules easily. Weakness: - Student participation in lecture\/discussion was poor. I would have hoped that fellow students would have had more questions and fostered a better discussion around points Prof Makuch brought up in lecture.",

This makes lecture enjoyable and educational. - He also actively shares his network and invitations to conferences with the class to help us facilitate getting into the field. Weakness: - He is difficult to get ahold of in office hours.",
