    "Awesome course. Sometimes can drag on because it is on a Friday afternoon but is low key, low stress and interesting way to be updated on the current research going on in the different scientific fields. Would definitely recommend to other students.",
    "Science 030 was a very fun class. You get to explore many different topics, without having to throw yourself completely into the homework loads and exams of Chemistry or Physics. I would recommend it if you like science, especially recent advances in science. However, do bear in mind that it is an all year course, so you should check and make sure it doesn't conflict with anything you want to take next semester, as well as this one.",
    "This is a very fun course that presents thought-provoking and interesting material from the cutting edge of science. The instructors and guest lecturers are great and there is not too much work. I would recommend it whether you are very into science like me or if you just find it interesting.",
    "Fun class to take - very interesting overview. good class for non-science majors.",
    "I would recommend the course to science and non-science majors. The topics are exciting and there will be something interesting for everyone.",
    "If you want to learn things without going throug unnecessary details, go for it."
