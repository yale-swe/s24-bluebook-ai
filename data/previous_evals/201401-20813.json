    "Definitely take this class. The teachers are great and the material is actually interesting. The only issue would be if you slack off because it's easy to fall behind in this class.",
    "JAPN 140 helps you to go beyond the basics, to a highly level of proficiency and understanding. It's incredibly interesting. I looked forward to this class the most this semester. Absolutely - take it to push yourself in learning Japanese.",
    "Definitely recommended - one of the most enjoyable and rewarding class experiences ever at Yale. The senseis were very understanding and patient, which made the course experience a breeze. Workload was totally manageable, plus you do learn a ton from the assignments and the super detailed feedbacks that the senseis provided. Class size was pretty small, which made the class all the more fun and interactive. Overall a must take if you are set on learning Japanese and its very interesting culture."
