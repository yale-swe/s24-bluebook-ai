    "Great comprehensive introductory course to the study of lithics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who works on a site with stone tools or even anyone interested in stone tool making.",
    "ANTH 750 01 is an interesting course for a student interested not only in lithic studies but also in geochemical analysis studies as well. The workshops on knapping stone tools were very informative. I highly recommend this course to whoever interested in these issues, unless the student hates intensive readings!",
    "Definitely I will recommend the course, since it involves many aspects in the lithic study, which will also be beneficial in the whole archaeological study."
