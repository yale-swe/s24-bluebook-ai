    "ENGL 120 is for the student who already has strong writing skills and wishes to improve on them. I would not recommend this course to someone who is unsure of their writing ability, simply because the course is more focused on stylistic qualities (the decoration of an essay).",
    "Professor Sexton is great. He's incredibly helpful and my writing improved so much. A few things to know about the class. If you're an English-y person, beware that there can be some boring moments that feel like AP English (defining tone, motifs, voice, etc), but it's overall still a really great class. If you're not an English-y person, beware that it is a lot of writing. BUT the writing is really fun if you enjoy it. It often didn't feel like work to me, which was awesome. I'd definitely recommend it if you want to balance out a semester of a lot of analytical essays or just try something different. Despite those warnings, I would 100% take it again. The readings are really interesting and the essays felt so rewarding. It might not have been \"life-changing\" in the way some people say it is, but it definitely improved my writing.",
    "Take this class with Professor Sexton!! English 120 is a great class, and professor Sexton is a great professor. The 2-3 articles\/essays you'll read before each class all display great techniques that you'll discuss in class, and you'll find that by the end of one semester, you'll be a much stronger writer. Definitely take 120 over 114-- not a ton of work, and you'll probably even enjoy writing the five essays.",
    "You write five final papers, with a draft for each. One of those papers will be workshopped with the entire class. Start your drafts early if you're a slow writer, and make sure your drafts are good! Would recommend this course to another student, since it definitely improved my writing a lot.",
    "Take this class it's never read anything besides a typical AP English essay. It's so much fun and you will absolutely have a good time. Plus she wanted to write about the thing every day for critically about the world around you in general.",
    "Take it!",
    "It's an english course that teaches you how to write about people, culture, places, and how to write in a way that is satirical and humorous, and how to d it well.",
    "This is a great class, and I highly recommend it! Be prepared to work hard, but in the best way, since you will definitely grow as a writer if you put in the time and effort. I loved Professor Sexton - he is beyond dedicated to his students and gives lots of feedback on every essay. He is also always willing to schedule meetings outside of class to work with you. This is definitely a great writing credit!",
    "English 120 is a rewarding and refreshing English course, especially if you've never done writing of this sort. The creative aspect of the class takes a lot of pressure off the students in terms of research and literary analysis, and allows them to focus on their writing instead. The readings don't take very long, and are actually very enjoyable - I looked forward to doing them every week, and the classes go by quickly. If you get Professor Sexton, take the class! He is incredibly helpful and kind, and provides lots of feedback. You will learn so much from this class, especially if you're a freshman or sophomore."
