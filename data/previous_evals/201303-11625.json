    "A must-take course if you're an engineering student. This is what the major is all about, and you learn more in your first 3 weeks than you could in a year in a lecture series.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student that would like to complete independent research. There are only three assignments submitted for grading, so this course really allows you to focus on what you are researching. Depending on what your research project is this course can be very time consuming.",
    "It's a basic research-for-credit class. Take it if you want to start your senior project early, which is definitely a good idea.",
    "This class will vary greatly based on your research and professor. Find a lab the really interests you, because you will be committing a lot of time towards it. Be prepared to be flexible and acommodating as things will naturally not go as planned.",
    "Convenient research arrangement.",
    "If you like research, take it. Not an easy A if you don't put in the work. Often times, the 10 hour minimum is nowhere near enough to get your project moving and get enough results to have a worthwhile report at the end.",
    "Independent research. Midterm update and then a final report\/presentation. Very manageable and a nice way to get started on your senior project. The time you put in is dependent on your project."
