    "Ling 224 is a comprehensive tour of the mathematical foundations of linguistic theory, especially in syntax and semantics. Ever wanted to know the math behind \"categorial grammar\" or \"transformational grammar\"? If you take this class, you'll see a theory of grammar emerge naturally from our discussions of automata and string rewriting. Ever wanted to know what's the deal with quantifiers \"some\" and \"every\"? If you take this class, you'll also see the beginnings of formal semantics take shape under the mathematics of it all. I would recommend Ling 224 for students especially in computer science and mathematics, although advanced linguistics students would also find a lot in the course as well, as long as you're willing to learn LaTeX and use it for your problem sets for this course.",
    "Lots of mathematics. A great way to change the way you look at linguistic frameworks and issues. Problem sets are challenging, long, but enlightening.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to any student with an interest in linguistics, computer science, or mathematics. Indeed, anyone with an interest in the human language faculty would do well to take this class. Although the beginning can be slow for anyone with a thorough grounding in modern mathematics (as it is largely basic set theory), the rewards by the end of the class are well worth it. The only people I would caution against it are those with a thorough background in theoretical computer science, as much of the material will be familiar. The applications, however, will be different.",
    "Ling 224 will give you a very interesting perspective on language and math and how the two relate. Make sure you are up for the challenge - shop it for a few days and see if the class is for you.",
    "See question 1. That said, I am a bit hesitant to recommend it to someone who's never taken a linguistics class before; however, it can be done if you're willing to put in the extra work.",
    "I would recommend the course. A lot of linguistics background probably wasn't necessary, although some exposure to basic discrete math would be helpful.",
    "This class is a lot of fun if you like linguistics and math-y things. Bob Frank is totally engaging and enthused about the material, which was interesting in and of itself. Problem sets are manageable, though challenging, but both he and the TA were great at answering questions. The first half of the course is pretty set theory heavy, and then it goes into linguistics after midterm. Weekly problem sets, take home midterm and final. Tons of nerdy goodness.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in the subject matter, i.e. the mathematical models used in linguistic theory. Students with weak math backgrounds can take the class, but may struggle--this isn't an easy QR. Take it with Bob Frank. He is an excellent teacher who cares about his students and will work with them outside class to understand difficult material."
