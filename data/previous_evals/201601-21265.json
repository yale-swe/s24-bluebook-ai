    "Yeah you should take it. You learn real applicable material that you could actually use in life, something that is rare at this university. Lots of work though fyi.",
    "Only take it if you really need to learn about corporate finance and you are willing to teach yourself just about all the course material with very little help from the professor or TA's.",
    "No, not a helpful way to learn corporate finance - you are better off learning on your own because you basically teach yourself the entire semester anyways. Also, the mandatory attendance to a class that doesn't help you learn is absurd and a waste of time.",
    "Do not take this class. It is horrible.",
    "Easy but boring.",
    "It was a very applicable, interesting course from which I learned a lot that I will use in the future.",
    "The material is pretty useful in learning more about finance but you would have to spend time on your own in learning the material because it's not exactly covered during class.",
    "I am not sure I could recommend this class. Though I did learn interesting material, I felt my friends in the other Corporate Finance course were learning more under a better administered class.",
    "The lectures follow the textbook closely, so stay on top of the readings. There are also weekly quizzes. Work in groups on the problem sets and study early for the exams."
