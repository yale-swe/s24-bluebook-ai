   "comments": [
    "I would say if you've never taken French before, it is really difficult. Immersion starts day one, and it can be so frustrating, especially when everyone else around you seems to be miles ahead. Dustin makes the class worthwhile, but even so, the student should be prepared for a lot of frustration.",
    "The tests are tedious but the material is interesting and fun to learn.",
    "Do not take French 110 03 if you do not plan on putting in the effort necessary to succeed in the class, but if you stay focused and dedicated then it is a worthwhile class.",
    "I would recommend this class. I felt that it was a great introduction to conversational French, and it was taught very well.",
    "I recommend it if you are either rusty with French or if you have never taken it, it will really help you get the basics down.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it. It is a well-organized language program, which makes the challenges associated with intro language learning a lot more manageable. I would caution, however, that it is a fair amount of work. Nothing is too difficult in and of itself, but the workload is relatively constant and you will be most successful and happy with the course if you have the time to dedicate each day to your homework. (About a half hour minimum would suffice to get you along on nights when you are crunched for time.)",
    "Its definitely not the easiest language course offered, and a consistent amount of work, so be prepared."
