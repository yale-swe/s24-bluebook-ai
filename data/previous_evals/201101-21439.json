    "Unlike other departments, the Spanish thesis is very approachable. You get an entire semester to write an 8000-12000 word paper with the support of a faculty member. As far as thesis-writing goes, I never felt like I was working alone.",
    "Writing the senior thesis is a chore, but can be a very fun, rewarding one. Every Spanish major has to do it, so I obviously recommend it, but make sure that you're prepared for the task. Start earlier than you think is necessary, stay on track, write large bits at a time and you'll do fine.",
    "It's a lot of work, but if you love what you're doing, it flies by! I'd suggest you try to be disciplined in writing -- if that means 3 pages a day for 2 weeks, or 1 page a day for a month -- do it. Just do what works well for you."
