   "comments": [
    "This is great course for anyone who loves art. I had never taken a HSAR class before, and I'm so glad I took this one! I really feel that I've learned a lot and that I will continue to take similar classes. There's a specific joy I associate with learning about art that I can't quite get anywhere else.",
    "Yes. Professor Jung is absolutely great and makes class interesting for everyone, from people who have taken multiple art history classes already to people who have never looked at a painting before. This classes covers material every person should know and understand upon graduation.",
    "A survey class on the beginnings of art and its progression through the Middle Ages. It's really cool and romantic and stuff. Amazing to see what humans could do back in the day... I would recommend it if you're interested in how art got to be the way it is today. Jung is really charismatic and the lectures were really nice.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in art history. The class provides a thorough overview of the western art canon. The workload is very manageable and the pacing is good. The lectures are interesting.",
    "A great introduction to art history\/history before the Renaissance. Super informative lectures, really fun sections, and definitely the unfairly underrated half of the intro art history sequence. Definitely take this. Such a great decision, especially as a credit\/d class so you don't have to worry about memorizing slides.",
    "I originally took this course with the intention of possibly majoring in Art History. This course was not what I had hoped it would be. The lectures are uninteresting and very difficult to follow. There are slide lists, but she rarely would follow the slide list so you spend a large portion of the lecture trying to figure out what it is she is talking about. The paper is really easy and straightforward, but the midterm and final were a bit silly. They told us to prepare for the exams by memorizing slide lists and dates, but knowing the correct ID will only get you 5 out of a possible 25 points. If you do intend to take this course, DON\"T kill yourself memorizing IDs, it's not worth it.",
    "Good class. Midterm is rough, final is horrible, although they turn out okay if you really study the slides. So much memorization, and a lot of it was of pointless slides that didn't really have any particular significance. Regardless, I feel like I learned a lot. Jung's lectures are actually interesting and I looked forward to them. Work is very concentrated (two papers, a midterm and a final). Prepare to memorize SO MUCH INFORMATION for so many slides. I would recommend starting early with that because I didn't and it was not pleasant. I would highly recommend this class, Nemerov's gets more attention but this is also worthwhile and a much smaller lecture (60-80 kids).",
    "GREAT CLASS. a lot of work but knowledge you can keep forever. section is fun, the material is interesting. maybe take it credit d if memorizing isn't your thing",
    "A really fun and interesting course, an appropriate first experience in art history. Informative. Reasonable expectations of work load.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Although the Renaissance to Modern Art course offered in the spring seems to have much more hype, I can't imagine a more precise analysis of various periods of artistic style.",
    "Good class, not too much work, but the exams are more difficult than you would expect from the workload. Otherwise, you learn a lot, and the papers are pretty straightforward though sometimes may be graded rather arbitrarily.",
    "This course was really interesting. The only difficulty was the amount of memorization needed for the midterm and final, but it should be no trouble if you start early. Take this course for an informative intro to art history!",
    "This is a great class no matter what major you are doing. take it. it is fun and worth it. You may not think you will need knowledge of art, but after taking the class you will realize its practicality.Take it!",
    "The course gives you a broad survey of art throughout a large part of human history, as well as giving you a chance to personalize some of your experience with the pieces. I enjoy the pace and coverage of the class. The workload is very manageable.The examinations require a lot of memorization, which is not so bad as long as you stay on top of the work. Professor Jung is exceptionally eloquent. The discussion sections are also very interesting and fun. I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in History and\/or Art."
