    "This was a great course - but I do think it should be worth 4 credits.",
    "Question 8 - - It'd be great to space the field trips out a bit more so they are not all in the beginning. I found myself getting a little sick and tired of them when they were one right after another,but would've loved one later in the course.",
    "Extremely well thought out and well taught. excellent.",
    "Overall, great course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 fascinating material clearly presented.",
    "The main out-of-class assignment-- reading responses-- weren't super useful for me, though they did get me to closely read certain papers.",
    "This was the best class I have taken at FES to date. I found the professor to be dedicated to teaching the substance, very patient and thorough, very responsive and willing to make himself available to students, whether through multiple exam review sessions or private meetings. In sum, a pleasure to learn from.The course did a fantastic job of connecting science to policy, while still be firmly based in the science. I believe this should be the balance that all FES classes aspire to strike, but have not found that to be the case. I also found the student presentations to nicely complement the substance of the course, successfully allowed us to gain deeper exposure on specific issues. Personally I learned a lot through the student presentation process and found that independent research process to be a very satisfying test of knowledge accrued through the course. I also found the one page article summaries to be unexpectedly challenging, but a very useful exercise, both in terms of acquiring skills for science writing and for parsing out scientific literature.My only criticism might be regarding the coverage of evaluative indicator systems for the final session. As a capstone or opportunity for synthesis of the materials covered over the course of the semester, I'm not sure what would be a better fit, but I found this subject (and the last chapter of Valeila) to be underwhelming generally.Thank you for the great course.",
    "Great class overall. The field trips were extremely helpful in reenforcing material covered in class. Wish there were more field trips.",
    "I loved this class and the TA and professor were just amazingly helpful.",
    "I thought the course was well designed and well executed--all while maintaining a necessary degree of flexibility and responsiveness to students' needs and concerns. The syllabus was obviously carefully thought-out and balanced. The in-class experience was captivating and informative, even if it was a bit slow at times due to the long single class period each week."

   "comments": [
    "The field trips to reaffirm the material! Also, it is evident that Shimi truly cares about the students and wants to make sure we understand the material!",
    "Excellent professor, really engaging material, and his clear commitment to teaching it to us so we really understood it.",
    "The field trips were outstanding. We did a ton of learning and I think really became familiar with the marshes. It was a little sad to stop visiting them for the second half of the course. Maybe we could incorporate one final one (up to that site in New London?) on a Friday?Loved guest lecturers. All did an excellent job - especially Penny Howell and Andy Kemp. That definitely switched things up and kept the class moving.Doing reading summaries was slightly tedious, but I think I would walk into class with a pretty good understanding of those key papers rather than my more typical speed read. I also like that we didn't follow up with a super dry \"discussion\" about what the papers said - you just took us through them to ensure we really understood methods, findings and criticisms.Similarly, studying for quizzes seemed annoying at first, but absolutely solidified our knowledge week after week. I appreciated being able to ask questions to clarify things that had been confusing during the prior week, even though that took up some time. I think the points we would hit were confusing for each person in the class and brought our understanding up to the next level.I liked learning about studies that you and Troy were really involved with (and Andy Kemp and Penny Howell for that matter). Definitely appreciated hearing from the experts.I really liked the combination of learning foundations of coastal ecosystems, management issues\/practices and reading key papers that go through scientific findings. I thought it was a great mixture of material. Also our few discussions were quite enjoyable. There were so many people in the class who are experts or whose past classes have given them fascinating experiences.",
    "The teacher expertise and enthusiasm.",
    "We spent alot of time discussion salt marshes so the the field trips were great opportunities to see exactly what we studied in class.Professor Anisfeld was one of my favorite professors this semester. He was informative and accessible and showed concern for his students learning.",
    "I'd say the material itself is really interesting. The course is a crazy rapid survey of everything coastal, but while you might occasionally get a little overwhelmed, ultimately it feels more comprehensive than confusing. You have to be really engaged by coastal science to take this course; if you are, you'll find the material and the pace exactly right.",
    "Thoroughness of coverage of salt marsh ecosystems",
    "Field trips were the best aspect of the course. It was extremely helpful to go out into the field and physically see the environment that we were learning about in such depth.",
    "See above.",
    "Instructor and TA knowledge about subject matter. Guest lectures also helped broaden concepts covered in class. Coffee and cookies were also great!",
    "It\u00c2\u00b4s a LOT of material. So I really felt like I got my money\u00c2\u00b4s worth with this class. The field trips are great. Shimi makes sure you\u00c2\u00b4re really understanding everything.",
    "It's balance of science with just the right amount of management, policy, and conceptual applications sprinkled in. As a non-scientist, I thought this balance was maintained remarkably well. The readings were informative (if slightly redundant in some areas--i.e. PHAU control) and the field trips weren't simply excuses to get out."

   "comments": [
    "The workload - weekly quizzes, responses, and large amounts of reading, plus a final, presentation, and paper are a bit much.Reading responses could be eliminated - at this stage in my academic career, I do the reading, I felt that it was just busy work.",
    "This is a small detail, but slides with graphs and charts on them need to have the whole caption from the paper so we can study.",
    "I think quizzes should force you to study, but should be easy to do well on if you study. There were a few questions that weren't that clear and tripped up the majority of the class. I think better to use quizzes as a check point than a trap.I didn't always follow the order of why we were addressing certain topics. I know that was tricky because you wanted to hit so much material and it is all related but also all over the place. I don't know if I have a suggestion for how to address this. Zonation was a clear theme that we returned to a couple of times, but not in order - so maybe grouping more of that together?The class should start at 1:10 to accomodate Wed lecture speaker series (I know that's a administrative issue not you). The length of time is tough. I generally could stay focused for the first 3 hours and then had trouble retaining the last bits of information. Switching between different speakers\/quiz\/cookies\/presentations definitely helped.In terms of making use of the experts around us, I think it might be cool to offer up opportunities to go out into the field with you, Troy and Andy to help collect data. Not sure about quality control issues\/requiring this, but I think some people might really enjoy seeing how collecting this data actually happens. Perhaps a few Friday opportunities?I didn't like the Valiela (I know, not Variela) textbook. Is there a more Tarbuck type textbook for coastal ecosystems? I just didn't like the style or his outlook that much.Seems like there are some marsh experts up at Conn College. Any chance we could meet up with them? What about an opportunity to meet with an oyster co to hear about their side of management. I think Becka Schultz went to Norwalk the other week and had a good experience hearing about their management issues.The final covers an incredible amount of information, and given that there is no midterm, took a lot of time to review for. This is nitpicky, but I think it would be helpful if it were one of the later exams during the exam period.Finally, the part of the class that was most frustrating were the student presentations. I think there is a lot of opportunity to learn from others in our class, but the given time made it pretty much impossible to provide a decent explanation of background and 2 papers. Here's my suggestion. Stick with the 9 minute preso and 3 minutes of questions. The in class presentation portion can be all background with some bits and pieces on interesting studies. Then the paper could be minimal background and a more in depth look at studies. I guess the utility of this exercise depends who its for. Maybe each student better understands their two studies by explaining them to the class. But the entire class might better understand 15 topics if we just learned the background and some tidbits of studies as a supplement. Like I said, it's impossible for you to get to all of the topics of coastal ecosystems, so it seems like a great opportunity to spread out the teaching. You could even offer up 30 sub-topics that you don't have time to teach that people could give us the 10 minute basics of. The 3 page limit on the actual paper was tough to stick to. I think we need four pages to do a good job. We also could have used more information about what you were looking for.",
    "None.",
    "I understand that Professor Anisfeld's research focuses on salt marshes and that why we spent so much time on them. I would have appreciated a deeper discussion of other types of coastal ecosystems.",
    "Shimi teaches the class in a rather piecemeal way, involving a lot of jumping around from topic to topic. Partly that's because he's seeking to break up the four-hour class length, which I understand and appreciate; but still, it made things occasionally perplexing... it would have been helpful if the salt marsh lectures, in particular, had been delivered in a more logical and sequential fashion.",
    "The reading responses seemed unnecessary and time consuming. I think that it would be almost impossible to do well in the class without reading all the materials, and I felt like almost everyone can read and understand scientific articles. I really enjoyed the last couple discussions and hearing about people's varying aspects on the issues.",
    "The name of the course is definitely a bit of a misnomer. It would probably be better to call it 'Marshes: soup to nuts'. But I like marshes and it was good to go into depth, but if there\u00c2\u00b4s a way to spend just a bit more time on other systems (like say a field trip to a rocky intertidal?) it would be even better.Maybe assigning topics for student presentations could be one way to help balance the course?",
    "Probably a slight tweak here or there to the readings paired with lectures. It seems that we jumped around a little bit, especially towards the end of the course, and re-visited some things we learned earlier in the semester that were at odds with the earlier semester's teachings\/materials. While it became clear that this was intentional and with purpose, it could have been explained a little better to the students so as not to confuse us."
