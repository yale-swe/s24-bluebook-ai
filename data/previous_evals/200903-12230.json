   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you like reading primary sources. It's a lot of reading. Class discussion is what the class decides to make it.",
    "I highly recommend this course, especially if you're interested in learning history outside of the AP curriculum :).",
    "This is a class you should certainly take. Professor Hansen really cares about preparing students for success both in her class and at Yale in general. This class gives lots of tips about writing at Yale, and succeeding both in history at Yale and in Yale generally. A good amount of reading, but most of it interesting. Take this class.",
    "History 003 is a historiography course: you read a bunch of early historians, discuss their writing in class, and write four papers of varying length. Secondary articles supplement the primary sources. I would only recommend History 003 to another student who is either 1. fully committed to improving their writing or 2. interested in earlier historians\/historiography.",
    "I went into this course expecting a broad-based discussion ofwriting history, but it surprised me in that we started with the philosophy of how history is and should be written. We then employed that understanding throughout the course to evaluate primary sources and works of history. As it ended up, the content of the second half of the semester did not particularly pique my interest, but the method that we used in the course did. Though I do not expect to use this course towards my major, the way that it forced me to write and think was rewarding and challenging. Professor Hansen makes a concerted and personal effort to improve her students as writers, and it shows. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in history or how it is written.",
    "If you have the opportunity to take any freshman seminar with Prof. Hansen, do it. She is a fantastic teacher who will help your writing skills. I wasn't sure about the course material when I started, but ended up becoming really invested in the class. Prof. Hansen really cares about her students and makes a great effort to show them the many resources at Yale from Beinecke Rare Books Library to going to the Met in New York. She exposes all her students to a new way of thinking and challenges the class to work together as a group. Signing up for this class was the best decision of my freshman fall.",
    "Excellent course if you are interested in the topic, because Hansen's presence makes it much better. Not for the thin-skinned however.",
    "This class is a perfect experience for any incoming freshman. The professor is wonderful and the course material is extremely engaging. This class helped me look at historical sources in a new way. I'm so happy I took this course, and I highly encourage anybody interested in history to do so."
