    "I would definitely recommend this class to a friend, if Inca culture and society is something you're genuinely interested in. If delving into the intricacies of specific components of an ancient culture doesn't get you excited, then the class might get a little stale. But if you like that kind of thing, it's a really interesting class! It's very intimate with only a handful of students, and Professor Burger is always willing to spend a lot of time on any specific question you're interested in. The readings are a bit much, I don't think anyone was able to do all of them, but he assigns people to present a general outline of most readings, so I think he's aware of that. The only issue I would have with the class is not really knowing the whole time if I am absorbing and learning what I'm supposed to be learning. There's a midterm exam, which is the only piece of evaluation you have to determine how you're doing. The short paper on an object in the Peabody was interesting and I loved doing it, but we never received any feedback on it. The final research paper is worth 60% of your grade (which I think is technically not allowed anymore, I thought the YCC changed the limit to 50%), and there was very little guidance-- you presented your idea for a rushed 5 minutes and he provided some feedback, and that's it. So I think if you're a self-sufficient student you'll be fine. But if you need assignments along the way as check-points, then I think the final paper will be an unpleasant surprise, because you're expected to create a meaningful argument that no one has made before, and to be confident enough in your own writing that the lack of feedback and guidance doesn't phase you.",
    "If you're interested in learning about the history of the Inca and the history of Andean archaeology, this is a very good course to take. It is an interesting and well-taught class. There is a fair but manageable amount of reading. There were only two papers, a short 2-3 page essay and a 15-20 page term paper. It is a relatively easy class, with interesting material and a good professor.",
    "Good class if you're interested in the Inca. It spent more time focused on people who studied the Inca than I anticipated but I ended up really enjoining exploring the different ways they approached the subject."
