    "ONLY TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOUR SERIOUS ABOUT ARABIC!! This isn't just for kicks and giggles or just to fulfill the language requirement. If you just need a language to take study some other romance language (I hear the French program is amazing). The first couple weeks will weed out the non-serious students.",
    "Arabic is an absolutely essential language to know. I have the full intention of taking it for all 8 semesters. Is it a phenomenal department, no. It is a luck of the draw with teachers. My arabic has improved immensely and I am happy, not thrilled, with this semester.Also, the grades are really easy so long as you are good at memorization (and there isn't even that much memorization)",
    "This is definitely a course to take only if you are serious about learning Arabic; otherwise, it will just seem like a drag. The first few weeks are quite work-intensive; you will find yourself doing 20-30 pages a night. However, this load decreases by a lot once those weeks have passed, and the workload is totally manageable from then on. Make sure you get a good professor-- ask people who have taken the course to give their recommendations. Trust me, it will make a huge impact.",
    "I would only recommend Arabic at Yale to someone who is determined and prepared to study hard to keep up. If you have a genuine interest in Arabic then it will be rewarding, but if you're just looking to fulfill a language requirement go take Indonesian or something."
