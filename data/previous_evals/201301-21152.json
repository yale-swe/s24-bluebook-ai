   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Ideal for those with previous exposure to the content. Still a delight for newcomers willing to play catch-up.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. The class gives you a solid grounding in the recent historiography of modern Mexico.",
    "This is an absolutely essential course if you are interested in Latin American history at all, and it is useful if you are simply interested in publishing and different types of books (edited volumes, monographs old and new), or interested in peasants, revolution, and theories of hegemony. May be somewhat repetitive for experienced students of Latin American\/Mexican history but if the student group is as solid as mine was, the discussions will be interesting and the course will be helpful to anyone. The professor knows so many people in the field that he arranged for several of the authors we read to come to New Haven and meet personally with the class in the seminar and after at dinner which was a great opportunity to get to know people in the field and your fellow students better."

   "comments": [
    "Was a fantastic experience in learning the collegiality of a graduate seminar and the way peers (+ prof) can help me process my reactions to scholarly work and think about my own questions.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of some of the recent historiographical \"turns\" in Latin American history, particularly the so-called New Cultural History. I felt I was equipped to think more carefully and sensitively about cultural phenomena (and political culture) by the end of the class.",
    "It allowed me to check off a number of titles from my reading lists. More importantly it gave me an opportunity to meet and get to know fellow students and established historians in the field. It was also useful to think about and draw upon the professor's extensive experience in academic publishing."
