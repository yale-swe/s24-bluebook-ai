    "The gaming part of the course and the interactive classes taught a lot of concepts hands-on without being too heavy. The challenges also posed a real problem that should be solved through the tools of design and entreprenuerhsip. Most of all I liked the idea that in this class we had to embrace all sustainability frameworks and put them to practice.",

   "comments": [
    "organization of lectures, flow of content, better hands on learning",
    "I think there is a lot of unnecessary busy work in the course that just took up time and did not really provide much educational benefit. The incredibly long homework assignments in which we basically restated material from the readings is one example. Another is having to produce 12 identical \"1 pagers\" for the judges which did not have much educational value. Having undergrads and graduate students in the same course felt strange. As a grad student, I felt as if I were being \"babied\" sometimes as there as a lot of oversight and hand holding from the professors and TAs.",
    "Homework problem sets were FAR too long and arduous - I didn't feel like it was a valuable use of time as many times the questions just required you to regurgitate material in the book or lecture (like a high school homework set) -- it would have been better to make students do more analysis (or nothing at all).",
    "More interaction between the TA and the student teams, as well as shorter challenge goals. The homeworks were not adequate to the learning of the graduate students. The questions required lengthy responses without actual application of the learnt material.",
    "There was far too much lecture on subjects that only tangentially had to do with our projects. The class at times felt like a low-level undergraduate or even high school class, with the problem sets basically just being busy work. We should have started building and prototyping and designing much earlier, with less lectures that most people aren't even listening to and don't really effect the coursework."

    "The advantage is that I was able to learn from my teammates and we were able to bounce ideas off each other. The disadvantage is that not everyone in the group contributed equally. It is frustrating when two of your team mates do little to no work leaving you to pull their weight. Having peer evaluations as a warning was perhaps a bit helpful to motivate them to do work, but still did not truly alleviate the problem.",

    "The class is interesting and interactive, provides a different approach to sustaianbility problems. It also teaches important concepts of design. Depending on the end-semester challenge, towards the end there might not be a lot of learning involved, since for example somoene needs to make a PowerPoint or a customer survey. Overall, an interesting class that can lead towards an interesting story for the resume, along with skills. Besides, the CEID is a very nice space to hang out.",
