    "Grab a camera, shoot. Re shoot, Learn techniques, Re shoot. Explore!",
    "Yes, if you want to become a better photographer and are willing to put time into it.",
    "Art 138 is an intense digital photography course where you will need to do a lot of picture scouting and picture taking. The syllabus can not define the amount of time you will really need to get projects done to your developing eye's liking -- so while you may need very little time in some situations, other situations may call for an exorbitant amount of time that you should be prepared to give up. But if you want to improve your skills with a camera, it's a must.",
    "Summarize: Take cool pictures, learn photoshop.Recommend: Yes, it rocks.",
    "I would definitely recommend Art 138 to anyone interested in photography. Amazing class and not too demanding - the work is very enjoyable.",
    "Intro Digital is a course that you take cause you love art, wanna make art, and wanna get better at making art.It's not a class you take for an easy A, because you will be challenged and you will have to work hard.That aside, if you put in the work necesarry, and simply try, you will see yourself grow as a photography, and learn some valuable skills along the way.",
    "ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND!!! If you're wondering if you're into photography, this gives you all the skills you need to shoot, print at high quality (you get to take all of your prints with you at the end of the semester), and discuss photographs in a compelling way.",
    "absolutely, take it if you can get in. remember that it's not only a lot of work, but you only get out of it what you put into it."
