    "Twice as much work as you'd expect, not a horrible course in terms of material covered, but AWFUL in terms of organization.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone. The flipped classroom approach is not at all effective, and lectures are little more than a waste of time and energy.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anybody who is not considering the physics or mathematics major. I would recommend it to anybody fitting those categories.",
    "PHYS 200 is definitely a class for a STEM major. I would not recommend it to anyone who didn't have either a good grasp of mathematics or enough motivation to work hard in the class. PHYS 200 is, I would say, the right physics class for physics majors. It is tougher and more rewarding, I think, than PHYS 180 - and again, 200's flipped classroom approach really works well. My year was actually given the same midterm given about six years ago to a class taught by Prof. Ramamurti Shankar, whose video lectures we watched this year, and our class did very significantly better. There were about the same number of perfect scores, but the middle of the class shifted significantly towards higher grades.",
    "If you're taking this class it's probably because you're an engineer or a chemistry major afraid of physics. I think this year in particular, although the course is going through a transition to a flipped classroom model, it struck a good balance in terms of workload and material. In the past problems sets have been unbearable, but this year (save for the one on special relativity) the psets were challenging but informative. It's a solid physics class and the general absence of pre-meds is refreshing.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course unless it is a prereq for a major. In that case, it's unavoidable, so you might as well take this one over 160, which I hear was miserable. For the sake of future students, though, I hope they switch back to a normal lecture format rather than this flipped classroom format.",
    "Take 260.",
    "It is a great introductory course to various areas of physics on the university level, including the use of math tools such as multivariable calculus, complex numbers and second-order differential equations in solving physical problems. Most formulas are being derived either in textbook and\/or in classroom, and the classes are focused mostly on solving problems. The course is well-taught, and both professors and TAs are really helpful.",
    "I would recommend the class to a perspective physics student, because there is a lot of important material. I would warn them that some weeks have 10 hours of work while others have 2. I think next year the reverse learning thing will be cleaned up a bit too",
    "Physics 200 starts with easy concepts but quickly delves into more complex material. At least in the flipped classroom, it's impossible to do all of the needed learning and practice in class and still difficult when spending a few hours each week watching lectures (as the course is intended). Students should be prepared to attend review sessions and office hours to iron out the harder concepts, and should be able to learn and take notes on their own by watching online lectures. Take Physics 200 if you're interested in Physics and willing to put in a little extra time, otherwise 180 may be a better option.",
    "Not if it's a \"flipped classroom\" again. God no. Worst use possible for Coursera... we literally used it as a way to: (a) take quizzes online [already a classesv2 feature] (b) watch 2005 video lectures [already hosted online at open yale courses] (c) read pdfs [already a classesv2 feature] So first off, it felt like this class was an excuse to pay Coursera for something (President Levin scratches our back, we scratch his?). I am not totally convinced that online education can't be done well, but this was NOT what good online courses look like. Some serious weaknesses: 1. The professors did the exact same thing as the TAs, except I guess they probably wrote the problems while the TAs graded them. What's the point of having professors if this is the type of course you're offering? What's the point of even going to Yale? 2. Normally, having a textbook is useful because it uses a different approach from the lectures. Here we get a transcript of the lectures, so if you don't understand Shankar's development, you have nowhere to go. 3. The material was dumbed down -- our problem sets were easier than Shankar's. And they still confused people, which makes sense, because there was very little actual teaching that happened in this course. 4. Of Coursera's many features, apparently letting students ask questions publicly is not one of them. So midway through the course, the TAs set up a Piazza account. In most classes I've been in that use Piazza, use of Piazza has been strongly encouraged, and questions get answered in minutes. This course, despite the fact that the professors had NO JOB TO DO other than prepare problem sets and exams, wasn't like that; students would post a question that would go a day or sometimes several days without being answered. This made Piazza a less appealing resource.",
    "This is a well taught, thorough class. You get a fast but enjoyable overview of a lot of physics. If you have taken AP or A Level physics, the first part of the course will be fairly easy, as it covers similar topics to those courses, just in more depth and with harder questions. However, there is plenty in this course for those who have already done high school physics to challenge themselves with: a fair but challenging class.",
    "I would recommend it but I would warn them that the class requires a lot of work.",
    "The class covered all of the main physics topics aside from E&M physics. I would definitely recommend this class because it is an eye opener. So many things in the world become much clearer after learning the concepts of the class. It is definitely a very challenging course with a lot of work, but it is much worth it and if you put in the effort, you will do well.",
    "A good class with a refreshing learning style (flipped classroom). The teachers were ok in quality, but if you watch Shankars videos, do the psets on-time, go to study hall, and try to focus in class, you should find the class to be a rewarding experience.",
    "This class was presented in a flipped classroom setting where we'd watch the lectures the night before class and work on problem solving during the class itself, but it needs some more time to hit the right balance. There's also no textbook, which made for some frustrating time with the homework, as there were limited resources I had available to try to solve the problems or figure out their intent. I feel like the lack of a real \"center\" (meaning a textbook, extra practice problems and learning resources, etc.) hindered this class where it could've been totally coherent otherwise.",
    "PHYS 200 is organized weirdly: you watch video lectures by Professor Shankar for homework and then do problems in a group in class. The video lectures are great; Shankar is a fantastic professor, understandable and funny. Class time is a complete waste of time and very frustrating. The problems often do not hep understanding. There is little to no structure. The TAs are not very helpful. Recap lectures and confusing and incomplete. I do not enjoy this \"flipped classroom\" experience. Nonetheless, the stuff you learn in the video lectures is useful and well-taught. I just felt like I could just as well have taken the class online by myself.",
    "I would recommend physics 200 to any student interested in learning about why things happen the way they do. Many of the basics are covered, including mechanics, oscillations, relativity, and entropy, although the inverted classroom can remove motivation to learn material until it's needed for exams or problem sets. Warning: implicit math prerequisites include line integrals, partial deriatives, and complex numbers.",
    "Although PHYS 200 claims to be an introduction to Kinematics and Dynamics, Waves and Oscillations, Relativity, and Thermodynamics, it is mainly a Dynamics course. A strong background in dynamics gets you through at least half of the course, and most of the final exam, honestly. The class focused more on that than on any other topic, with Relativity coming second (I should note that I liked how relativity was covered: nothing like in high school...) Needless to say, the course gets exponentially harder and much more mathematically intensive after the midterm, and complex numbers in Oscillations are just frustrating. Overall a good course which does not require extravagant work.",
    "Phys 200 is a good choice for those who have a strong familiarity with physics from high school. The course is very fast paced (especially for the subjects after relativity) and it can be easy to get behind. Obviously the course is very math heavy, but it was not as calculus-laden as I was expecting. Certain subjects can be especially difficult (e.g. waves) when there isn't much time given in class to discuss the subject (especially compared to relativity, which is given plenty of classtime to reiterate key ideas) The course's teaching style is interesting, having implemented the \"flipped classroom\" where you view video lectures before coming to class. I thought this style worked for the most part, but it sometimes had issues where class went too slowly and didn't cover enough problems to clarify the large amount of information presented in each video lecture. The instructors and TAs are very helpful in answering questions and have a great grasp of all concepts covered (the TAs especially surprised me with how well they grasped each concept as well as their ability to teach students productively). I certainly recommend attending all the study halls you can make, they were very helpful for resolving problem set questions.",
    "A very interesting class. I would consider it to anyone who ever wanted to take a physics class. However, if physics is not your thing, then these are not the classes for you.",
    "This is an advanced physics course. It covers many different topics (newton, thermodynamics, special relativity, fluids, waves, oscillations) . The professors and the TA's are amazing. The course is challenging, but actually teaches you physics. You don't need to know multivariable calculus to take this course. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves physics and has a good physics backround.",
    "This is a tough physics course, preferably for students who have taken AP physics C in high school. Although I got a 5 on the AP, this class was by no means easy; every lecture is crucial, so if you're looking for an easy class, this is not the one. The second half of the semester is MUCH more difficult, but the workload is definitely manageable, and if you set time aside, the concepts are definitely comprehendable.",
    "If this class is being taught as a flipped class, take it for sure.",
    "PHYS 200 is a class for a student with a strong high school physics background. Assignments are easy and the midterm is harder than the final.",
    "PHYS 200 is similar to AP Physics B in the material it covers, though it goes more in depth with equations and the types of problems solved. Although having a table group with whom to work on problems was a great idea, the execution was sub-par, and often the material of the course was not well presented.",
    "Shop around to see if its right for you.",
    "Physics 200 is a solid introduction to mathematical physics and engineering. You'll cover mechanics, simple relativity, waves, oscillations, very basic fluid mechanics, and heat. It's a decent proportion of material but you'll get a grounding in all of it. The professors (Caines and Robinson) are fairly good lecturers, but both have a tendency to go too fast. Talk to them in office hours if you can though, as they are both very nice. The problem sets can be a bit tough, but if you go to office hours the TAs will be really good, and in general they don't take up too much time. The flipped classroom is fine; it has its upsides (problem solving and question asking) and downsides (a tendency towards confusion and distraction). Some people will say that watching Shankar's lectures in addition to the p-sets means you're doing a lot more work than you otherwise would be; this is categorically false. Plus Shankar's lectures are quite good, and the book is helpful as well. Overall, it's a good course - the only reason to not take it is if you're allergic to math.",
    "The course is taught in a \"flipped classroom\" way, with recorded lectures being watched online and with material being reviewed in class and practice problems being done in class. The class is incredibly quick, and it was hard keeping up. ONLY TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU'VE TAKEN AP PHYSICS. Easily amounts to 10 hours a week of work, if not on the problem sets then on learning the material with lectures and supplementary material.",
    "The structure of PHYS 200 is undergoing experimentation and changes so I am not sure what the class will be like for you. This semester the class was taught in a semi-flipped classroom structure using Professor Shankar's video lectures from Yale's open online courses. the emphasis of class time was usually solving practice problems in groups. I feel that this semester's class was a lot easier and less intensive than previous years. The psets are not particularly difficult (especially if you go to the TA office hours) and the exams had straightforward questions with 1 or 2 trickier ones. People in this class tend to have pretty strong backgrounds in physics though so there is not much of a curve and not much room to make silly mistakes. I recommend watching the video lectures at a faster speed to save time. Also many of the derivations in the video lectures in the 2nd half of the course are extraneous.",
    "This semester of PHYS 200 was a flipped classroom, in which video lectures are watched outside of class, and class time is spent reviewing concepts and working through practice problems. I really enjoyed this formate - it kept me on top of and involved in my learning process - but obviously don't take it if you know you'll skip video lectures & fall behind. As someone who didn't previously have a strong physics or math background, I can say that the class is definitely manageable if you're somewhat interested in the material and are willing to do the work."
