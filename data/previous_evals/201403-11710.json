    "This is an absolutely great discussion class for learning RNA topics, whether you have any intention of studying RNA or not.",
    "MCDB 670 was a great course, and very enjoyable. The professors did a fantastic job of making sure we understood all of the literature as we read through it, and I believe my ability to read research articles critically and completely have improved very much as a result.",
    "Yes. I liked the small class, seminar style of the course."

    "This course was really good for learning about different kinds of RNA. I had never read about RNA, so it was perfect for broadening my knowledge on the subject. This course will be very helpful for writing my antithesis next semester.",
    "My research concerns proteins, pharmacology, and cancer biology. The course did not directly impact my research. However, RNA is fundamental to biology, both in its physiology and in its uses as a tool in science. For that reason, the course was incredibly useful to me. Not only do I have a better understanding of RNA fields, which are becoming more and more relevant to cancer, I have a broader and fuller understanding of my own project."
