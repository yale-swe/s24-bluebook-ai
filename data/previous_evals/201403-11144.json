   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely. It brings up many fascinating questions within law, ethics, policy, and globalization.",
    "Very interesting class. Mix of political theory and legal history. Lots of jargon-y reading, but easily masterable over the course of a semester. Mix of undergraduates, graduates, law students. I enjoyed the mix.",
    "I would highly recommend the course for all the reasons stated above.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course because it gives a good overview of some of the core thinkers and concepts with respect to topics such as sovereignty, cosmopolitanism, and human rights.",
    "This course is a mix of political theory and international law, appropriate to anyone in those fields who is interested in the themes of sovereignty, human rights and cosmopolitanism. It is probably not a great fit for theory students who have no interest in international law, since that comprises a big part of the readings, but it is a useful way for theory students to see how Professor Benhabib integrates empirical issues with philosophical methods."

    "As a divinity school student I was surprised how strong the intellectual structures of the disciplines involved are connected to theology. It encouraged me to continue an interdisciplinary path in comparative legal theory in law and theology.",
    "This course allowed me to explore some topics that I have been wanting to engage more deeply with for a while. Thanks to Professor Benhabib and Yale for offering it!"
