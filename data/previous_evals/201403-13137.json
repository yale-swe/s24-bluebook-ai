   "comments": [
    "Entirely different from AP Language or Literature. You will explore early English authors and learn the roots of modern literature.",
    "ENGL 125 is a good choice for a prereq for the major. It encourages you to speak intelligently, yet openly, about the literature, and it forces you in an extent to think differently about many things than you would have. It is fairly writing intensive, with 5 papers over the course of the semester, but each of them are well spaced, and you are given the prompts well in advance so you can begin your planning. Feedback on the essays is always helpful and fair, and can be used to improve the quality of the next paper.",
    "Take 125 if you are considering the English major or enjoy poetry!",
    "A good class if you like old poetry, small and discussion-intensive seminars, or both. Or if you're an English major, then you don't have a choice. Also good if you like to just talk about poetry and literature with other people.",
    "Be prepared to submerge yourself in very old, very intricate language for the entirety of the semester. From the complexities of Middle English with Chaucer to the heavy allegories of Spenser, there is a fairly decent load of reading, particularly in the earlier poets. The class discussions will often be very interesting and rich, so do not assume that a cursory analysis of the poetry when reading it is enough. Overall, this is a course I would definitely recommend to another student, but be very aware of what you will be immersed in reading throughout the semester. It is particularly appropriate for those who are passionate about poetry and what are essentially its origins.",
    "ENGL 125 is the first half of a two-semester sequence exploring major English poets. The course is a survey, moving through Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare and Donne, spending about two weeks on each poet. There are 5 required papers, as well as a low-pressure in class presentation and class participation. The material is interesting, and raises a lot of interesting thoughts and questions about people and poetry itself. The readings were very manageable, incentivizing you to complete them and making class ultimately more rewarding. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially one who is interested in learning a foundation in early English poetry.",
    "A fantastic and essential course. Take it--but make sure you take it with Professor Walsh. He's friendly, funny, knowledgeable, and, best of all, clearly excited by the material he's teaching. He expertly leads discussions--he interjects when necessary but is never an overbearing presence in the classroom. A fair grader with fair expectations. Put in the work and do the reading and you'll do well. Plus he dispenses with all of the extra BS blogging assignments that some other sections have to do--you'll just have reading and papers. He's the dawg.",
    "English 125 is a course that surveys four major English poets: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Donne. I would highly recommend it to a student who feels secure in their current writing abilities and does not feel they need further instruction in paper-writing. I would also say that initial qualms about the poets in the course (I myself was uncomfortable at the thought of reading Chaucer in Middle English) should not be a deterrent from taking the course, as it offers an excellent way to expand interest in English literature.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in the origins of poetry or if, like me, you are an English major for whom the course is required. I still think we win the game of required classes.",
    "If you're at all interested in great classical English works, you should take this class. Some of the material is dated (*cough* Spenser *cough*), but the majority is really interesting and fun to read. These are also all works everyone should read.",
    "If you take English 125 with Professor Walsh, you are likely to get a fair amount out of the reading, and moreover you will enjoy it. The class discussions were well cultivated and perhaps it spoke to the strength and interest level of the students that no section was ever dull or boring. Comments flowed from the moment Professor Walsh stepped in to the very last second, when he'd call to wrap up the discussion. The papers were not atypical of English seminars, the main papers 5-7 pages, and professor Walsh gives very good constructive feedback. He is available for office hours and will make every effort to help you if you send him an email. This was a wonderful class, and I highly recommend it. (even if you're not an English major)",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I had my trepidations about the course, as I heard mixed reviews. But, I loved it -- I think a large portion of that was due to Professor Walsh's great teaching style and the supportive atmosphere he generated in the classroom. It's difficult, and a lot of reading, but easily manageable."
