    "I'd definitely recommend this class if you're interested in statistics or more theoretical electrical engineering courses. I'm an EECS major, and while some parts of the course were somewhat intimidating, I felt like I got a lot out of it. Don't be scared if you don't fully understand some of the more esoteric proofs in his lectures Professor Barron is very helpful and very willing to go over concepts in office hours, and the midterm and final are very doable, easier than the homework assignments.",
    "I like the course, though there are times that I could not follow the professor. But Prof. Barron was definitely passionate about the material and sometimes got philosophical, which was great. Statistics is a beautiful noble subject that makes sense of uncertainty, which dominate the world. He presented the material with this big picture and the history of statistics\/information theory. Reading the text ahead would help you.",
    "Yes since it is helpful in understanding areas of study in data processing and data compression and even gambling"
