    "PHYS 440 is an amazing and thorough introduction to Quantum Mechanics.",
    "Understand the theory behind quantum mechanics.",
    "Before this course, I had mainly been taught quantum mechanics through a conceptual perspective. This course provided the beginnings of the mathematical and physical formalisms that helped me gain a deeper understanding of several topics in quantum mechanics I had previously been taught.",
    "A good introduction to the basic math and ideas behind quantum mechanics, starting from the Schrodinger equation and solving it in various regimes and ending with quantum spin.",
    "I learned to solve Schrodinger's equation for a number of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional time-independent potentials. I also learned the 5 postulates of QM, and their applications to sequential measurements and identical particles.",
    "Maybe some quantum",
    "This course attempts to be an introduction to quantum mechanics. It's pretty much what you'd expect. I learned a lot of quantum mechanics.",
    "PHYS 440 improved my math skills (especially linear algebra concepts). Of course, it also taught me a lot about quantum mechanics! I am by no means an expert now (but is anyone, really?), but I feel that I am able to think about many fundamental quantum problems on strong footing.",
    "This course helped me develop a personal first-principles approach to learning. Using these skills, I feel more prepared and confident to learn topics bout inside and outside of physics.",
    "I learned the basics of quantum mechanics, which consists of a lot of new conceptual learning since quantum mechanics is so different than classical. I also learned the mathematical techniques used to study quantum mechanics, such as solving the Schrodinger equation and learning Dirac notation for linear algebra.",
    "Quantum mechanics!! I didn't know it before, but now I do.",
    "This class made me really question my ability to conceptually understand physics due to both the nature od",
    "Basics of quantum mechanics, including wavefunctions, operators, uncertainty principles.",
    "This course was a great first quantum mechanics course that definitely gave an introduction into how to solve problems quantum mechanics problems and understand the basics of the theory. It was also very good at building general problem solving skills",
    "I learned much more about quantum mechanics, which is a fascinating subject. I also applied several subjects I had learned recently in mathematics courses to physics for the first time.",
    "I learned the basic concepts of quantum mechanics from the introduction of the Schrodinger equation to the beginnings of quantum mechanics of multiple particles.",
    "this course gave me a wonderful understanding of the basic concepts behind quantum mechanics. As none of us have quantum intuition, Prof. Skiba's thoughtful explanations of the mathematics behind quantum phenomena and their physical repercussions was invaluable.",
    "Gained a lot of insight into the quantum world. Was really cool to see and learn something deeper than a qualitative description of phenomena. We solved infinite and finite square wells, Dirac potential, quantum harmonic oscillator, and the Hydrogen atom. Learned about bound and scattering states. Learned about the four quantum numbers.",
    "Before taking this course all I knew about quantum mechanics was that you had to normalize the wave function and the Hindenburg uncertainty principle. Now I have solved Schrodinger's equation more times than I can count for various potentials. I learned a lot about abstract vector spaces, operators, and eigenstates; and now know what the \"generalized form of an inner-product on an n-dimensional Hilbert space\" is. I practiced and developed a slew of mathematical skills and the ability to know how to apply them so solve a very non-intuitive physical system. I come away with a much greater appreciation of angular momentum, the ability to solve for many things about spin but with even more questions about what it actually is, and a new perspective on chemistry that makes it very exciting.",
    "I legitimately loved this course. I feel like I actually have the beginnings of the ability to start grappling with quantum, which is incredible to me. Skiba is incredibly good at helping students work through concepts, especially when they can't be intuited.",
    "I definitely gained a solid foundation for delving into further topics in QM from this course, as well as a (useful) review of linear algebra, which becomes important for the material in the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The instructors and TFs are amazing and very dedicated. Prof. Skiba is fun and engaging and also takes the time to answer questions. The TFs are very useful and thorough in their answers and they are very willing to give us a lot of their time. I wish that some of the psets were less computational (pset 4 was particularly annoying). In my opinion, psets should be more about exploring the theoretical concepts and putting us in novel situations and less about computation. Most of the problems were not very challenging on a theoretical level. For instance, we were asked on many occasion to find the probability of getting eigenvalues of an operator and to explain what the function would collapse too. I feel like asking this once would have been enough. Computing eigenvectors again and again can get a bit dull.",
    "The problem sets are very interesting. Lectures are good. Maybe we can have two lectures of 1hr 15 min each instead of three lectures of 55min each per week.",
    "I would flip the order of the 1st and 2nd halves... i.e. start with vector spaces and then move back to continuous distributions.",
    "The course had good problems the the Griffiths textbook is excellent. Professor Skiba was also a very good lecturer and provided great answers to any questions students had.",
    "I thought the pacing was fantastic, problem sets very fair and reasonable length, the teaching\/TA office hours quite clear, and the grading extremely fair. Skiba follows Griffiths very closely so going to class is not imperative, but I think it is worth it; he is a very engaging and nice guy and always willing to answer questions. He also does a wonderful job explaining, to the best of anyone's ability to really explain quantum, what exactly is going on while doing calculations. Not too many weaknesses I can think of.",
    "It's QM, so it's interesting and non-intuitive. That said, I think the motivation of the lectures could be made clearer at the start of class, because the techniques used were new (to me) and the derivations were long. I sometimes got caught up in trying to follow the proofs, and didn't always see what the end result meant.",
    "Skiba followed Griffiths almost section by section. This was nice, but sometimes Griffiths isn't the best resource. Perhaps a little deviation from the book wouldn't hurt.",
    "I like Shankars book at least as much as griffiths. Also, the class was too large this year.",
    "If I could change one thing about this course, it would be for Skiba to hold regular office hours. The dude is awesome. I would love to get to know him better, and office hours would be a great place to do that! Aside from that, I would say this has been a near perfect course. Easily my favorite course of the semester.",
    "PHYS 440 is overall a strong course. The material follows the textbook very closely, which I appreciate because the textbook is very good. Some problem sets felt like they involved more tedious calculation than was necessary, so perhaps more explicitly permitting use of Mathematica to simplify expressions would be nice.",
    "This course was taught exactly by the book. Which is great, because the book is excellent, but the lectures are basically useless and Skiba takes a whole class period to derive one equation.",
    "Professor Skiba is really fantastic. He cares about his students a lot and presents the material in an engaging manner.",
    "The material was straight from the textbook and the pace of the class actually seemed a bit slow. But, the material was well covered and thorough.",
    "This course covered a lot of material and was taught well. At times, it was maybe going too fast and there was too much to absorb to put it all together. Perhaps a small quiz or two to help review might help reinforce topics as the year progresses.",
    "I enjoyed this course very much. I thought that the problem sets were interesting and appropriately challenging, the lectures were engaging, and the exams were fair. I might advise including two midterms rather than one in the future, or at least making the single midterm longer than 50 minutes. I felt that 50 minutes was not nearly enough time to adequately test half of the course's material.",
    "I thought that the topics covered were generally good and liked how the course paralleled the textbook to make it easy to follow along. However, I felt as if the lectures were often confusing and difficult to follow (and that it could sometimes be easier to get the concepts out of the book). I felt that if either the pacing had been slower or more explanation had been given, it would have significantly improved the course. Additionally, it would have been nice to have talked more in class about some of the underlying concepts. I felt as if there were challenging conceptual questions on the exams but that we didn't often talk about concepts in class or have that many conceptually oriented questions on the problem sets. Finally, I felt as though grading was oftentimes unclear for the course. Grades for problem sets were put on Canvas, but we had to wait to get the problem sets back to see what the grades were actually out of (plus, the score distribution feature was disabled, making it impossible to see where we fell). Similarly, for the midterm, we were given an approximate grade distribution but not information about how it would be curved\/scaled. More clarity around grading\/course logistics would have overall made for a better course.",
    "Since many of the students in this course come from VERY different physics and mathematics backgrounds, it would be very helpful if there were more check-ins throughout the semester to make sure the majority of the class was following along well",
    "The hard questions on the problem sets were proof-like, whereas the hard questions on the tests were conceptual (so the problem sets didn't really prepare you for the test). The tests were less of your knowledge than if you could apply your knowledge -- which is way more difficult, but I think the right way to test. The TAs were great and Prof Skiba is great.",
    "By the time they take this course I think most students have realized that the activity of physics is not really something that can be taught, its something that you have to learn through very rigorous study and practice. In this respect I think the choice of Griffiths as a textbook is very good as the book is an excellent resource and is well structured with proofs and explanations of nearly all the mathematical steps. Skiba's teaching style worked well for me as I sometimes need to hear things explained multiple times and ask dumb questions when I get lost in details. All of that being said, I think the course could be improved with more knowledge checks. I would have really benefited from weekly quizzes resembling the more conceptual questions on the exams. These would be especially helpful if they were not for points or just graded on completion. This would have helped so much showing me what I didn't know or had misunderstood. Professor Skiba, is there any chance you could do this next semester?",
    "I think the class is very strong as is. One thing that I could have found helpful would have been solving problems in class, as class was largely conceptual and problems solely the domain of psets, but the structure worked.",
    "The course was built really well in that it followed the textbook (Griffiths) fairly closely, and the material covered in class complemented the material from the textbook pretty consistently. The brief (but I think sufficient) review of linear algebra was really helpful, so that it wasn't a total deal-breaker to not have taken linear prior to the class (though it would definitely be useful). The lectures were also generally pretty engaging."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Quantum Mechanics is an amazing field that is filled with facts and phenomena that will challenge your intuitions. If you took PHYS 261, don't think that this course will be a repeat of what you did. PHYS 440 is much much more thorough and gives you a much clearer picture of what you did in 261. Prof. Skiba is the best physics teacher I have ever had. He is fun and engaging and explains the material really well. He makes himself available for questions and encourages people to ask plenty of questions during the lecture. PHYS 440 is the best physics course I have taken at Yale so far.",
    "Definitely take the class if you are interested in quantum mechanics.",
    "If you're interested in quantum mechanics (fundamentals, not applications or devices) than this is a great bottom-up course that uses a lot of math to arrive at really cool results that describe the quantum world.",
    "I would certainly recommend Physics 440 to another student. It is an excellent and interesting introduction to quantum mechanics. It mostly follows the first five chapters of David Griffiths' Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, which, as Griffiths' textbook is quite good, is not at all a bad way to structure an introductory course. Witold Skiba is an engaging lecturer who explains the subject clearly.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody who wants to gain a deeper understanding of quantum physics as well as any current\/future physics major. It serves as a good introduction to rigorous quantum mechanics and sets up students for Quantum II later on.",
    "Absolutely. I took this having only taken PHYS 180 and did just fine (pending the final...). I think anyone willing to do calculus and interested in quantum should absolutely take this; arguably having less physics background may even help you, as you'll just shut up and do the calculation as opposed to worrying what actually is happening (usually, there isn't a good answer anyway). That isn't to say that this class is solely calculation; there is a lot of intuition behind it, but it's mathematical intuition, not physical as we know it. Skiba is wonderful; I highly recommend him. Weekly problem sets that take like 3 hours. Midterm was straightforward but really time crunched so the average was pretty low. Final was pretty reasonable. The TAs were pretty helpful the couple of times I went to office hours, so there are lots of resources to help you succeed. So I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a SC who could not care less about sliding blocks on frictionless incline planes and wants a legitimate course to take.",
    "Highly recommend, particularly if Skiba is teaching it again. QM is one of those things I always wanted to learn about, because it's cool and weird, and Skiba made the topics approachable and clear. I would recommend taking lin alg beforehand (or being generally familiar with linear operators, spectral theorem, etc.), because it makes the course easier to follow.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another physics student, but they do have to take it anyway.",
    "A fun class, exams are just stupidly hard. Unreasonably so. Otherwise enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 440 in a second, in a millisecond if it is taught by Skiba! There are so many cool concepts that you learn about and the class is incredibly well structured and taught. If you are a math-y person, this is a must take!",
    "If you're not confident or prepared to take graduate level quantum mechanics (like some of your more precocious peers), this is THE undergraduate quantum mechanics course. Any others offered by the department lack the rigor required to learn this difficult subject. Math majors often take this class, but they are not necessarily at an advantage. You will be on equal footing as long as you're comfortable with complex numbers, multivariable calculus, and ESPECIALLY LINEAR ALGEBRA.",
    "I would highly recommend quantum mechanics to anyone interested in physics. It is a completely different way of looking at the world than classical mechanics, but is just as useful. The course is interested because of how different quantum is than regular mechanics.",
    "I'd recommend PHYS 440. It's a very solid quantum class. Skiba is a dank professor, and the textbook is very good. If you're good at learning from a textbook, it's not really necessary to attend class because he follows Griffiths very closely (and Griffiths is great).",
    "This course was taught exactly by the book. Which is great, because the book is excellent, but the lectures are basically useless and Skiba takes a whole class period to derive one equation.",
    "This class was really interesting and well-taught. It's essentially taught straight from Griffiths, so it's easy to go over things from class. The psets aren't excessive, but the tests were pretty demanding.",
    "Yes! If you are a physics major or just want to learn some new science that you likely haven't seen that much of before.",
    "It is a required course for the intensive major. I know several who have taken it without intending to major in it and it was not very pleasant for them.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. You are probably taking it if you are a physics major and you have to, but Skiba does a great job keeping classes interesting and distilling the topics to be simpler and easier to understand.",
    "Quantum mechanics is a fascinating subject, and I thought this course was very well taught. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if it is taught by Skiba(e)!",
    "Overall, I would not recommend this course. Professor Skiba is extremely nice\/willing to help, but I found lectures to generally be unclear\/hard to follow (and that I had to mainly rely on the book\/problem-solving sessions in order to understand the course material). I also found problem sets to be extremely time-consuming and often not that rewarding (as often they consisted of very lengthy\/laborious algebra\/calculus which didn't really help me conceptually).",
    "I already have. Although PHYS 440 was one of the hardest classes I've taken so far, it should be obligatory for anyone interest in the hard sciences.",
    "A great course to complete the Math B.S. requirements!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Attending class was not really necessary because the content was taught straight out of the textbook (Griffiths Quantum). The problem sets are time consuming and at times difficult, but not impossible by any means. The midterm and final were both challenging, but the midterm was graded very generously and I assume the final will be as well. Overall, quantum mechanics is a very interesting subject.",
    "I would recommend if taught by Skiba. Skiba was very dedicated to letting students inquire, which is exactly what you want. He let us ask questions regularly, without which I am sure that many of us would have been totally lost.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in a hard quantum mechanics class. (Not sure what 439 or 344 are like, however, so check those out and see if those are more suited to your desires and needs.) Skiba is the best STEM professor I've had in my four semesters -- he's one of the clearest lecturers I've had, he is funny and engaging, and he is nice (When I wrote \"Mercy :(\" on the cover of my midterm bluebook, he wrote back \"always!\" So nice.) Also, for your info, there will probably be some hotshots, but they're not so hot. This is hard for everyone.",
    "Have you always wanted to derive the orbitals of a hydrogen atom from the radial and angular components of the three dimensional Schrdinger Equation? Want to understand the Pauli Exclusion Principle? Want to derive the uncertainty principals for observables other than position and momentum? Now is your chance. Absolutely take 440, especially with Skiba if he is teaching it. Stay on top of the work (yes, I know its hard) and go to his office hours and ask all of your questions. He is very helpful. That being said this class is still hellishly hard and will stretch your intellectual limits. Prepare to spend a lot of time on psets and make sure you have a study group. Not only will you need it, but explaining things to others is an excellent way to learn what you don't understand. Get ready for Hamiltonians, Hilbert spaces, Eigenstates, and quantum numbers! Can honestly say it changed my entire perspective, especially on chemistry.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class, especially if Skiba is teaching it. He is fantastic, and makes the class a joy.",
    "Though it is part of the intensive physics major, I would still probably recommend this class. It definitely provided a solid understanding\/foundation for quantum mechanics. I would definitely recommend having some degree of linear algebra and diff eq prior to taking the class, though it is definitely not absolutely necessary, nor is the class impossible without having taken these maths. Definitely a considerable workload with the weekly problem sets, which took a fair amount of time. If the class is taught similarly each semester, then there is plenty of opportunity to seek help from the professor (Skiba) and\/or the TFs."
