    "YES TAKE IT! This is my favorite class at yale so far. Professor Dorfman is an amazing teacher, and really critiques you in a way that helps. She tells you exactly what will make your screen play better, whether it's through writing or directing. It is a time commitment though, so be aware.",
    "Playwright-Director lab is a great class to take to gain more directing and writing experience, but it is also a very intensive course. I would recommend it to Theater Studies majors who are directors, especially to students who already know Professor Dorfman and how she teaches.",
    "We all chose to both write and direct, so we were writing a 2 page scene a week and then putting up a classmate's scene the next week. There are little exercises (both written and in class) in between. This is a great class. Aside from the panic of rehearsing, not a ton of work, and all very enjoyable work. Definitely recommended, but go into it with an open mind. Don't expect a traditional playwriting class."
