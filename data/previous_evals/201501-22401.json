   "comments": [
    "Take it! It's really complicated and hard, and should be a Science credit not a social science (since when were accoustics, the physics of sound, and vocal anatomy social science?) Argyro is super nice and the material is really fascinating. Also, the final project is pretty cool, especially if you are friends with the informant you use.",
    "This is an excellent course if you're interested in learning about every sound humans use in language. It does get quite technical on the physics part of speech, but it's a really great course. If Prof Katsika is teaching it, the presentations are all great, there are weekly psets that are doable, and the midterm and final are challenging but interesting. I'm not a linguistics major, but I'm very interested in linguistics and this is totally a doable course for non-linguistics majors!",
    "There is a lot more theory to phonetics than I expected. I thought this class would be focused just on learning to recognize and produce different phonemes, and while we did some of that the focus was more on theory: what is it that makes phonemes distinct physically and acoustically, how are they grouped etc. The theory is still very incomplete--you find out there are conferences where people argue about whether syllables exist--but I did find it very interesting. I took it as a non-major and while it was very fast-paced content-wise it was not in any way inaccessible.",
    "TAKE IT. Especially if Argyro Katsika and\/or Gregg is teaching again. I've never had a class that was this organized, effective and clear. Workload consisted of weekly p-sets (reasonable), one midterm and one final (both reasonable), as well as a final project (definitely reasonable if were start when Dr. Katsika suggests to) and a production exam. Grading was fair; expectations were clear. And the material is interesting! You get to learn ~all of the sounds in the languages of the world, but at the same time, you're introduced to so much more of the field. Phonetics is surprisingly quantitative, with a good deal of science to it, but it was all very enjoyable to learn. Overall, an excellent linguistics class.",
    "I recommend this class to another student, but only if the student is either (a) very interested in the subject or (b) very good at studying when they're not, or (c) somebody who takes classes they know nothing about just to build different frameworks in their mind of thinking about things. This class works a bit like a language class: You have to push through the basic pieces to understand how they fit together and appreciate the subject. As with any language, if you're not super motivated to learn the language you'd have a hard time pushing through the basics. That being said, even if you're not in (a) or (b), you will learn A LOT just by being in the class. This is either the best class ever to take credit\/d\/fail or the worst class ever to take credit\/d\/fail, depending on your philosophy of what a credit\/d\/fail class should be. The class is a good amount of work, but you always know what to expect because Professor Katsika is super organized.. The difficulty of the coursework is such that it is accessible to anybody who wants to learn the material (unlike, say, Intermediate Russian for beginners, or CPSC 223 for somebody who has never seen a computer). This year, it met WF at 9am for 75 min, including one day in reading week, had reading every week with an assignment over week or so, had section, a midterm, a final (with transcription part), a final project, and a production exam. I'd say it has about the same work amount as a language class that meets twice a week, although it has different work. Argyro Katsika is SO COOL. Honestly, I took this class because I was a (c) person who was browsing a possible fifth psych elective, and Argyro Katsika was a cool name. Which I realize isn't a great reason. But you soon learn that Argyro is as cool as her name, which you learn how to pronounce by the end and transcribe in IPA. She's like one of the coolest people ever. She makes the coolest powerpoints I've ever seen at Yale. She's super nice and super smart. She seems tough in class, but she's super sweet. Gregg is super cool too. Section was really fun and informative and useful, and I really enjoyed going to section. You learn a whole new framework of thinking about speech and language. A WHOLE NEW FRAMEWORK. You'll never see speech the same way again. After this class, you'll see why linguists and phoneticians obsess over their fields. Every time you utter something, you can't help but think about it a little: \"Wait, what is happening?\" A caveat: you can't learn everything you need to know to do the work from the readings or online resources, so you really have to pay attention in lecture and in section, and make use of the instructors' knowledge, or else the class will be kind of hard. These sorts of classes where everything isn't just in the book tend to be more worthwhile to take, but also require more vigilance on the part of the student."
