    "I recommend this course very highly. Mazzotta is absolutely fantastic. This is exactly the kind of course I came to Yale to take, and I have only the highest praise for it. If you don't take this course, you will be missing something incredibly special. TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "Great course. Mazzotta really digs deep into the intricacies of the text, but it's still accessible for someone who has never studied Dante before. I think it might have been better as a 50 minute course. Mazzotta is always saying interesting things, but sometimes they're not 100% relevant to the material and I found myself waiting for 2:15 to come around. Still a great course to take, and the workload is reasonably light as far as Hu's go.",
    "This class should be Yale's religion: it is the Good News. Everyone should be required to take it. It changed my life.",
    "Great Class!! You learn so so much about the Divine Comedy and it is incredible to see all the ideas and representations behind each of Dante's cantos.",
    "I recommend this class incredibly highly, given one caveat. There is a SIGNIFICANT amount of emphasis on literary comparison with other classical texts...I took this class as a Social Sciences major and really enjoyed it, but at the same time felt like an utter failure as a reader of literature. There's no reason why this should hold you back if you're interested in the course, but the Divine Comedy, by nature, is an incredibly influential text that draws on more or less every significant piece of literature that came before it. It's a humanities major's wet-dream, but a little frustrating for those of us who are a little less well-read.",
    "Take this class. Mazzotta is brilliant, and his interpretations of Dante will change the way you see literature, the world, and even God.",
    "You have to take this course. I have never been impressed so much by a professor than by Mazzotta.",
    "Absolutely. Without a doubt. Take it. Takeeee it.",
    "Great course. Definitely take it. In all seriousness, I think about a lot of things differently now for having read Dante in the fashion that I did this term.",
    "Yes, take this course whether or not you are an Italian major or a literature major. Dante is such a huge part of the literary tradition and everyone should read the Comedy.",
    "Do it.",
    "WORKLOAD: one 10-page essay (there's a pretty fair range of topics--and it's due within a week of the final, so you don't have to worry about it for a while, although it sucks to have to write a paper AND take a final) and weekly reading responses (due before each section, about a half-page in length).TESTS: one mid-term (consisting of ten quote-identification questions and two short essays) and one final (same format as the mid-term, just worth more). The grading is a bit stiff, especially on the identifications (so when you read the books, you kind of have to memorize the context and the speakers).READING: over the course of the semester, you read Vita Nuova, the Divine Comedy, and Monarchy (a philosophy text by Dante). On the mid-term you're only responsible for Inferno, the first half of Purgatorio, and part of Monarchy; on the final, it's the other half of Purgatorio and all of Paradiso. It's not a lot, although it's annoying to have to read Monarchy for discussion every week.Note: If you're a Lit major, this class can count for both the Pre-1800 requirement AND the Poetry requirement (which is pretty convenient).",
    "Absolutely take this class. Whether you're a freshman or a senior, you'll love it. Professor Mazzotta's lectures are not only intellectually robust but incredibly engaging.",
    "This is a \"must-take\" class.",
    "Absolutely fantastic - not much reading, very easy to do well, and Mazotta is the most brilliant professor ever. Dante is so beautiful - everyone should take this class.",
    "Dante with Prof. Mazzotta is an experience you should not miss. You will, in all likelihood, never again get the chance to learn about Dante from someone with such knowledge of and passion for the subject. Nor will you hear many lectures like his: they reveal to you that there is so much more to each canto than you thought was there on a first reading. The lectures can become very rarified and theoretical at times, but he will always explain himself if you ask and is eager for students to connect with what he says. The workload is on the light side: you spend the whole semester on the entire Divine Comedy, plus two other approx. 100-page works of Dante\u0092s; take a midterm and a final; and write a ten-page paper. (Your TA may also require very short reading responses for section.)Just shop the first section. If you\u0092re anything like me, you\u0092ll be hooked.",
    "This class is an opportunity to really engage one of the great works of Western culture through the interpretive lens of a master of the work. Professor Mazzota is a true Dante scholar; he's exactly what a Yale professor should be like, a master of interpretation and scholarship who is nevertheless willing to engage the students and their questions. The lectures are kind of long, but the reading is mostly from the Divine Comedy itself so you can really engage all of the readings without being overworked.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The lectures are beautiful and engaging.",
    "Professor Mazzotta is a fantastic and articulate lecturer (in English, presumably his second language!) and will teach well beyond the Comedy itself. On the other hand, be prepared to spend an entire term focused on this one work. The reading load is lighter than average, allowing you to absorb the poem slowly. The exams are very reasonable, and the essay gives you the option (which I took) of comparing the poem to (more) modern writers like Joyce and Eliot. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend this class. No previous knowledge necessary, and Dante was really fun to read. The cantos were gripping, but make sure you read them for the lectures because otherwise you will not understand a word of Mazzotta's class because he expects everyone to have read the cantos and from there delves into complicated analyses. I really enjoyed reading through Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso, because elements from these books are always quoted, so it was fun to study the works in depth.Not an extremely hard course, and homework is minimal, but once again, do the readings!"
