    "This is a fantastic course with a lot of variety and two excellent professors. The uniqueness of the professors, two stars in the investment world, goes without saying. Having Swensen and Takahashi in the room each week really enhances the material, particularly when the two offer anecdotes from the Yale Investments Office. The individual classes are all different and engaging. I enjoyed most the four guests and the two presentations (in part also because I enjoyed hearing Swensen and Takahashi's reaction to them). On top of that, the other classes really allow the professors to instruct the class and cover an array of basic investment concepts which serve as a strong foundation for anyone interested in the subject. The only thing I wish we did more of was discuss with Swensen andTakahashi some current events and how they saw those events impacting the investment world (particularly with the government taking so much action recently). But that is a small point, and overall, the class was fantastic and I highly recommend it. The workload was manageable and always interesting\/relevant.",
    "Two important things:1. Just because you're an Econ major and you get into this seminar (which is hard), it doesn't mean you should take it and will love it. The material is fairly specific on institutional investing (i.e. for endowments), and if you're not that interested in this, you're probably going to hate this class most of the time. You'll get some exposure to PE, VC, etc., but not THAT much.2. This class is quietly really, really hard. You'll write 30+ pages, have group projects, and near-mandatory participation.Etc.: The guest speakers are cool. Swensen has good stories. Your class will have almost exclusively bankers, traders, and consultants.",
    "If you get in, definitely. The guest speakers are among top investors in their respective fields, Dean and David are really laid back and fun, and you learn just as much from then as from your classmates. Can be a bit intimidating if you have no background in finance, but it's about how you think and not what you know.",
    "Highly recommend.Superb work to reward ratio.Covers broad range of topics.Guest lecturers were a major highlight.Only complaint: some of the lectures about asset classes were a little dry: there was too much call and response type listing of material from the readings onto the board.",
    "Great class. Not too much work but amazing exposure to Swensen\/Takahashi and external investment managers.",
    "It's worth it for the guest speakers alone.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class!",
    "If you get in, take it. It's a no-brainer and probably the best econ seminar.",
    "Definitely recommend. If you can get into the seminar, it's a great opportunity to meet with different managers and see the YIO from the inside.",
    "Amazing speakers, peers, and the opportunity to learn from David Swensen and Dean Takahashi. Take it if you can."
