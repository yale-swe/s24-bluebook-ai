    "To all seniors: you have no choice. Take it.To all juniors majoring in linguistics: Your time will come.To all others: sure, but you can take something else.",
    "This is a good course that will guide you through the process of preparing for your Senior Essay while at the same time introducing you to different aspects of the field of linguistics.",
    "Yes.",
    "Almost everyone who takes this class is a senior linguistics major (though it is open to others). Depending on who it is taught by, the class is made up of three parts (to varying degrees). The class goes over some basics of linguistics research that is applicable to many sub-fields, e.g. ethics, research tools, formulating an experiment, writing an abstract, etc. Claire Bowern also included a class research project on dialects, where we got to put some of the stuff we learned into practice. A large chunk of the class is focused on preparing to write the senior essay: developing a topic, research plan, and outline. The class is pretty enjoyable for a required class, and having other students to bounce ideas off of in addition to your senior essay advisor is really helpful. A great class."
