    "Take it! A wonderful alternative to Kapustin's canonical approach. Professor Sabl is one of the best teachers I've had at Yale, and does a nice job facilitating discussion. I've never had a teacher so quick to understand what you're trying to say. (And keep an eye out for his sense of humor, which is subtle but great.) The syllabus is also fantastic. Highly recommended if you're taking Classics late in your time here, since it will expose you to new authors rather than going back through the same texts you've already read in all your other EP&E classes. It's also very discussion-heavy, which is a lot of fun if you like that sort of thing. As a result, the conversation gravitated toward participants' areas of interest and toward current events, which can be a nice way to see how different theories hold up in the real world. Definitely shop; if it doesn't feel like a good fit (it might not be for everyone), then by all means don't take it, but if you like Professor Sabl and the material then it'll be a really good component of your education.",
    "Fantastic class. An extraordinary alternative to Classics with Professor Kapustin, focused on reading more modern classic works with an eye toward the normative dimensions of modern political institutions. The reading list is stellar and seemed put together very thoughtfully -- every assigned piece was engaging and worthwhile. Professor Sabl is an outstanding teacher. He is extremely bright and very engaging, yet fun, relatable, and a pleasure to spend two hours with every week. Papers for the course are a lot of fun to write, and combine interesting prompts with great flexibility over due dates and topics. Overall, I highly recommend the class. Professor Sabl is a highlight of the Ethics, Politics, and Economics department, and he is definitely worth taking a class from if you get the opportunity.",
    "This was a great class! Section 2 (with Sabl) is perfect for EPE majors who took DS or already have a strong foundation in the great books. Class discussions were always lively and the material was diverse and interesting."
