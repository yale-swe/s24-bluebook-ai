    "An incredible course in theoretical and practical sound design. You will learn amazing skills that not only apply to sound design but to any aspect of design in any field. You'll gain a great foundation in sound design as well as feel empowered to be creative and make your own choices and decisions when it comes to design and execution. SUCH A GREAT CLASS!",
    "This class is wonderful, even if you haven't been exposed to sound design at all before. A little familiarity with Garageband\/Audacity and Qlab will help, but you go over the necessary technical aspects in class, and Nathan was always happy to meet during office hours to explain anything you didn't understand or just to chat about other areas of sound design. The class was fun, the workload not bad at all, and the assignments were usually a real pleasure to work on. Having such a small class where you got to know everybody and their style of work was also another great component of the class.",
    "A wonderful overview of the techniques and strategies used in professional sound design. A perfect mix of theory and application.",
    "THST 401 is a great class that not only teaches the basics of theatrical sound design, but touches on aspects of other theatrical design disciplines as well. The course is structured around a standard amount of readings and 10 design projects and a final paper. The design projects are thoughtful and interesting, and allow you to practice the concepts discussed in the readings and in class. I'm really glad I took this course, and I'd definitely recommend it to others.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I walked in with zero understanding of sound design technology and a minimal grasp of design concepts. The weekly projects have taught me in both areas, and I feel equipped to start designing for my own shows. I'm a director, not a designer; but this class gives you another tool in your storytelling kit, which is priceless. Also, Nathan is one of the most patient instructors I've ever met. He'll go in-depth on each person's project and makes himself very available for help outside of class. It's a truly fantastic course.",
    "Great class for learning more about sound and design in general."
