    "It didn't really teach me about how computer graphics works but only what other people have achieved in this area. She has a lot on her plate and unfortunately it has a negative effect on her class. I would only take it if you want credit for a computer science elective, not if you're interested in computer graphics. Only gets hard the last week when you're trying to compete the final project.",
    "This class was pretty darn bad. Although the premise of studying the field of digital sketching seemed interesting, the class was not taught well. The once-a-week class periods consisted of students summarizing the research papers that we had all been assigned to read. That's it. There was never any actual teaching. Moreover, the professor often didn't release the research papers or problem sets in a timely manner. The group project was interesting because I was working with a good group of people, but there was very little direction given by the professor or TF.",
    "ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!! CPSC 479 is, without a doubt, THE WORST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT YALE and a shameful showing for the cs department, especially given that it is supposedly interdisciplinary and draws non-cs students to it. That being said, it's an easy grade (no assignments, no tests, one project), so you should take it if you think it's worth it to rot away for two hours a week in exchange for an A). Amazingly, every single aspect of this class was poorly managed, with the exception of the group project (which was good because it happened OUTSIDE of class with other students rather than the teaching staff). Professor Dorsey started off the semester by telling us (in person and in the syllabus) that 479 was focused on exploring digital SKETCHING. Yet, throughout the semester, we barely touched on this topic, and it was very clearly NOT an emphasis of the course. In fact, no topic was thoroughly discussed. Part of the reason for this was the terrible way in which class time was used- students were asked to prepare and present current papers on different topics in graphics FOR EVERY LECTURE. This approach is absolutely awful, although it did mean that Professor Dorsey didn't have to prepare lectures (THERE WERE LECTURES WHERE SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR \"NEXT GROUP?\" !!). Because students had no background in graphics, these papers were largely unintelligible, and so we spent two hours every tuesday morning listening to CLUELESS STUDENTS PRESENT TO OTHER CLUELESS STUDENTS. when I presented, I looked out over the audience and saw literally zero pairs of eyes watching me- the students were all on their laptops, and Dorsey was looking away. Not once did Professor Dorsey spend a class teaching us new material. MATERIAL WAS NEVER PUT IN CONTEXT. WE WERE NEVER PROVIDED WITH ANY SORT OF BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER GRAPHICS. I can confidently say I learned absolutely nothing about practical graphics, and the papers we did read required such an extensive background that I never got anything from them, either. There are two (only?!) programming assignments in this course. Both are in JAVASCRIPT (shoot me now). Not only are students NOT EXPECTED TO KNOW PROGRAMMING (the class has no prereqs), but we were provided with NO RESOURCES regarding 1) Javascript or 2) the skeleton code we were working with. There were humanities and architecture students whose grade (apart from the final project) depended their ability to teach themselves to code in an involved html framework. It was nontrivial to find lines of code that were supposed to be edited for me (a cs major) and that much harder for the students with no cs background. The ONE LECTURE WHERE DORSEY or MINGHUI (TA) spent any time presenting to the class was when Minghui attempted to explain this skeleton code to us. Unfortunately, the TA DID NOT SPEAK ADEQUATE ENGLISH to convey her ideas to the students. She also spoke so quietly that I (in the second row) could not hear her. On top of all this, Professor Dorsey gets the little things associated with managing a class wrong. She was CONSISTENTLY LATE TO CLASS. SHE DID NOT RESPOND QUICKLY VIA EMAIL. The few assignments we did in the course were returned with MINIMAL FEEDBACK and, even after prompting, Dorsey was slow to explain her grading mechanism. Although Dorsey reserved 20 iPads that were distributed among the students, WE NEVER USED THE IPADS ASSIGNED TO US AFTER THE FIRST TWO WEEKS. They were never mentioned again. Clearly a fantastic use of resources. CPSC 479 is the largest waste of time I have encountered at Yale. I was excited to learn about graphics, but I learned nothing. Especially given Yale's newfound emphasis on stem and the cs department in particular, I was amazed that this upper level elective was so pitiful. I firmly believe that the cs department would be well served to discontinue this class in the future.",
    "It's a good survey course of digital sketching. I would say the class is mostly focused on reading papers and the final group project. I think this is fine, but I also think it could be a cool idea if students had to implement a tiny part of the papers they read every week for homework. I think making students understand certain aspects of state of the art digital sketching by forcing them to complete actual homework coding assignment that mock papers can be more useful to a student than just reading responses and one final project. Overall, it was a decent class. Very straightforward; light workload; good professor--caring.",
    "This class has a very light workload, however you will not learn much about graphics coming out of this course. The course consists of reading papers about sketch and animation, and coding a final project that can really be as easy or as difficult as you make it. During class you watch student presentations about the papers you read, and no new material is introduced.",
    "Unfortunately not. While the course's general premise seems interesting and like it could make for a good course, the structure of the course was disappointing and the final project was not launched early enough in the semester to truly work.",
    "Terrible class, do not take if with Dorsey under Sketching topic. Did not learn anything. Expected to produce substantial final project without having learnt anything.",
    "My year this was a course on digital emulations and extensions of sketching. The idea is that computers are very precise, but we want to do fuzzier things than, say, CAD, like do preliminary \"ideation\" for a building. I do not find this topic particularly interesting, not nearly as interesting as 3D graphics (which is what the other graphics course is), which is already a point against the class. Unless you really really love developing digital sketching tools, this class is not going to be for you. The readings are not particularly connected by anything, or even particularly enlightening. The assignments, aside from reading responses, are just to expand some skeleton code that does drawing in-browser. The final project is whatever you want it to be. If you want to spend a semester doing reading responses and reading uncorrelated and unenlightening papers, this is the course for you.",
    "I went into this class hoping to learn something. I was sorely disappointed.",
    "It focuses more on theory than practical application. It's mainly reading, presenting and discussing papers. There's a final project, but not a lot of emphasis on it. Not a whole lot of actual coding. Still the topics are pretty cool, and you definitely read some interesting papers. Not a bad class, not too much work.",
    "Probably the worst class I've ever taken at Yale. There is literally no curriculum And no teaching by the professor at all. Students \"teach\" the course by reading information off of Powerpoints they've prepared the night before about some research paper--information which everyone already knows because they ALSO read the paper. If I wanted undergraduates to teach the class I wouldn't be spending tuition to go to YALE. The TWO programming assignments were way too easy and had nothing to do with the class, but I guess that's an unfair statement because it's unclear what the class is even about. Also, no programming experience was necessary to take the class but somehow for our final project we were expected to code an app FROM SCRATCH with NO instruction on JavaScript or html. If someone had handed me a Post-it that said \"read some papers\" and \"code a drawing app from scratch\", it would have been equivalent to taking this class.",
    "It's a trainwreck. Computer graphics is a great field, but the class is underwhelming and disappointing.",
    "I would thoroughly recommend this class to cs major interested in art or UI. Lots of freedom, and really interesting material.",
    "No I wouldn't recommend this course. Every week you have to write reading responses for multiple papers and then listen to student summary presentations in class. The result is that you never really learn anything, but just get exposed to what is out there.",
    "The class is backloaded, so prepare to spend a lot of time on your final project. The week-to-week is very minimal and sometimes a lot of fun (making paintbrushes in JS), but towards the end of the class there is only about a month left to make something and you'll want to do something cool. If that cool thing is something that you don't already know how to do, then it will take you a lot of time. Just be prepared!",
    "I shopped this class because I'm fascinated by computer graphics. I shopped this class because some of the technologies you lucked out in the first few weeks were extremely exciting. Unfortunately I feel that this class did not live up to its potential. After the first few weeks, class consisted of nothing more than reading very dense tactical papers outside of class and listening to presentations on those papers in class. The result was very repetitive and quite frankly boring. I would not recommend this class to another student.",
    "To be honest, this class was somewhat strange. It had an extremely monotonous structure in which the week's material was read once, then written on for a weekly reading response, and then presented upon again in class by a student. Unfortunately, most of these activities were merely summary of the information. Additionally, the survey format of the course didn't allow students to delve into the material (except for final projects, which felt a bit rushed). Overall, it was an interesting course, but unlike many others in the Computer Science department."
