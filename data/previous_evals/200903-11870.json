    "Yes, easy and interesting course",
    "This class is more of a Korean history class than a cinema class. We watched a movie every week, each with a one to two page report and a class discussion.This class is a great humanities credit if you're interested in Korean history.",
    "Very good course if you're interested in Korean culture and history. The movies and readings are all very interesting and inclass discussions helped me gain a greater persepective of Korean cinema.",
    "Take it if you are (a) a student studying Korean who wants to know more about Korean history\/cinema or (b) if you are a Korean heritage speaker looking to learn more about your roots. If you're not really interested in Korea, Korean language,or cinema, it's probably not a class for you. Otherwise, gamble on it - you might be surprised."
