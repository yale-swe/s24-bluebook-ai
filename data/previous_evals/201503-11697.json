   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. My only warning would be that the class meets everyday and a lot of work is expected each night (about 2-3 hours of HW + review + preview), and you really realize how much you learn in one day because it's really hard to catch up if you are absent even once. That being said, all of that work really does pay off, given how much I am able to read, write, say and understand after a semester. The class really focuses on giving you a good foundation for pronunciation. Most of the grammar points, vocabulary and characters are introduced in the homework, so class is spent reviewing those and mostly doing speaking exercises. The weekly individual TA sessions also helped my tones improve. If you are willing to put in the work to become a competent Mandarin speaker, this class is definitely worth taking.",
    "This is very demanding and challenging course. It requires at least 2-3 hours of input everyday outside class hours to perform well.",
    "If you are sure that you want to learn Chinese, this class is a great way to do it. Just be aware that it has a very heavy workload (think 2-3 hours\/day), so only take it if you are truly interested in Chinese.",
    "I really liked the class. It was very tough and if I had not already taken a bit of Chinese I don't know how I would have managed. However the professors are nice and will meet with you if you are struggling.",
    "A lot of work, but definitely worth it.",
    "Very good intro course to learn Chinese.",
    "If you're up for the challenge, take Chinese. It's a ton of work but the payoff is amazing. There will be very few moments where you will feel absolutely clueless because the daily interactions quickly bring you up to speed. I would highly recommend this class especially to those who have no knowledge of East Asian languages.",
    "Highly recommend. However, understand that it is a LOT of work: 2-3 hours a night spent on Chinese alone. And the exams are challenging. However, if you're looking to learn Chinese, Yale is a great place to do it. The entire department is amazing, and all of the instructors are fantastic. The course is a lot of work, very time-consuming, but worth it in the end. You'll be amazed at how much you've learned in just one semester.",
    "Yes it is tough, but otherwise you will not be able to learn a foreign language. Especially becuase Chinese requirs two different skills: writing and speaking, you are really easy to be inbalance. By taking CHNS 110 you will build a firm & well balanced foundation in Chinese study!",
    "The Yale Chinese Department is nothing short of elite. Sometimes, the amount of work required for the class can be daunting. However, it becomes manageable with time. Expect a quiz every single day, long homework, and many assignments which revolve around rote memorization of long dialogues. You must trust, though, that the department knows exactly what it's doing to make you the best that you can be at Chinese. The structure of the class was very appealing to me because the teachers fall on a rotation schedule, so your small section of approximately 7-8 people will experience a slightly different Chinese voice every week. Importantly, the dynamic of the class changes with each new teacher. For example, Peng laoshi teaches in an engaging and fun way, and I never felt pressured during the class time, while Wang laoshi teaches in a way that is intense and commands attention. However, each teacher I thoroughly enjoy. If you have the drive to take Chinese, DO IT. Chinese is a critical language, and you'll be so happy that you used your time here at Yale to study a language that would be very unlikely for you to pick up later in your life. Notably, Shen laoshi is the head of the course.",
    "If you are passionate about Chinese, it is a good course because you will learn a lot and enjoy it. However, be prepared for the high workload and fast pace."
