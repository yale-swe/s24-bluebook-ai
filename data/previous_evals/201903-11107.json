    "I think the greatest benefit was our discussions of about publishing- thinking about what press to choose, how to write the kind of book you want, what to do about title\/ cover, etc.",
    "An overview of contemporary history of medicine books, an understanding of professional requirements, and help with original research.",
    "How to read, analyze, and hopefully write a history of science and history of medicine",
    "I gained much deeper perspectives into the temporal, political, and epistemological dimensions of medicine and public health. This course effectively introduced me to graduate school in the humanities, and I learned about what graduate discussions welcome and look for in readings. It was great to find that students from different programs and even different schools within Yale could add their understandings to the enrichment of other participants.",
    "- Critical thinking - Analyzing historic texts\/textbooks in regard to target audience(s), choice of topics, choice of terminology, among other important aspects - Thinking of history as a continuum with multiple possibilities rather than a fixed narrative"

   "comments": [
    "I would have liked more diversity in subject matter. I felt like a large number of the works that we read focused on modern Southeast Asia. This area was overrepresented.",
    "Strengths: The level of discussion, breadth of the readings, opportunity for one-on-one mentorship on a project with Dr. Warner. Weaknesses: Because there is only one writing assignment, it is difficult to understand one's own position to working in the subfield throughout the semester. However, this is also a strength, because it allowed me to go deeply into my work with far less stress than multiple writing assignments may have caused.",
    "Strengths - Class discussions were very engaging",
    "The seminar atmosphere was laissez-faire to the extent that all informed ideas about readings were welcome, but was still guided enough that students did not get lost. I commend the emphasis on weekly discussions over meticulous book reviews and other assignments, as this made readings yet more fun to read through. Geographic breadth of readings was overall diverse. It was interesting that historical knowledge was self-taught to students via each reading, and that classes really scrutinized the construction of each book, rather than reiterate factual content. This seems to be the norm rather than the exception in grad school, however, and was by no means an explicit weakness of this graduate seminar. I loved it overall."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It was a wonderful course. It was the best course I have taken at Yale for teaching students how to orient themselves professionally towards the field. That is one of its tremendous strengths.",
    "Yes, very helpful for getting a grasp on the field of history of medicine and history of science",
    "Absolutely. The course's transnational offering was an enriching introduction to the history of health practices across different cultures. Its readings even enabled me to approach other humanities courses with a more critical eye; I referenced several of the readings in another course's final paper! The workload was very reasonable and the discussions were approachable. This was a truly interdisciplinary seminar.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The course can enhance the knowledge of students with different backgrounds about the histories of medicine and public health."
