    "Basically if you have any interest in MT performance you should take this class. It perfectly balances the practical and the theoretical and you will leave this class a better performer. You also get the chance to work with some of the top professionals in the business in differing fields. They bring such an eclectic vision to the course and it really bolsters the experience beautifully.",
    "This class paired the previous curricular offering of musical theater song performance with guest-specific master classes. Every two weeks, a guest artist working in a field of musical theater (be it composition, choreography, casting, or musical direction) visited this class to provide a guest lecture or Q&A, followed by a work session and critique of student-prepared pieces.The great strength of the class was in its emphasis on practice. Musical Theater theory and history are enormously important in the preparation of performed pieces, however, this semester Professor Annette Jolles and these guest artists emphasized practical training and performance. Just as acting classes at Yale provide an opportunity for students to train in performance, it is necessary to perform a work of musical theater with aplomb. Annette is an incredible teacher, who pushed each student in the course with clear direction and effective teaching.If you are willing to put in the time and effort to fully prepare for each class meeting, it is absolutely worth it. Take the class!",
    "Take this class if you are a musical theater performer. It is an amazing chance to develop your skills by standing up and using them every other week. This was also an incredible opportunity to hone practical skills and meet professionals working in the field.",
    "You get a lot of performance opportunities, and many times it's pretty stressful. But you will improve SO MUCH, and gain so much confidence. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class to all actor-singers.",
    "Definitely take this course! You get out of it what you put in, and is a really great way to try new material, and experiment\/grow as a musical theater artist!",
    "The most advanced and practically useful class for Musical Theatre performers at Yale. You'll need to audition to get in, but for students with extensive past experience, this class in an excellent opportunity not to be coddled, but to be genuinely and professionally critiqued in a pre-professional environment.Annette is fantastic, so understanding of shared commitments to performing in shows on and off campus. Also, this is an amazing chance to talk and study with serious, respected visiting professionals from around the country.The class can be repeated, and the graduating seniors were all testaments to Yale's Shen Curriculum. So worthwhile, but perfectly viable as a 5th class."
