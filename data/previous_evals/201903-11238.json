    "I have strengthened my mathematic skills overall.",
    "I developed skills in calculus and pre calculus. In addition to learning the theory behind many of the skills and lessons we learned, my teacher stressed the importance of applying these problem solving skills to real life questions and problems.",
    "Basic maths",
    "Basic review of precalculus and differential calculus.",
    "Basic calculus that included derivatives.",
    "Developed critical thinking and real world problem solving skills",
    "I learned how to critically apply problem solving skills to calculus applications.",
    "I am not fit to be a STEM major.",
    "I've developed a strong understanding of linear, quadratic, polynomial, rational, exponential and logarithmic functions, computing derivatives, and limits. It is an excellent introduction to calculus.",
    "I was able to review and develop my pre calculus\/ calculus skills that I was unconfident in before",
    "To really learn how to study on my own.",
    "I developed an understanding of some basic calculus concepts such as derivatives, logarithms, the Intermediate Value Theorem, the Mean Value Theorem, and exponential functions.",
    "Learned how to properly graph functions, derivatives, and inverses. Also solidified skills on logarithms and various other precalculus\/calculus skills.",
    "How to collaborate with my peers",
    "I developed the ability think and solve complex math problems",
    "This course reviews the basic principles of calculus, beginning with pre-calculus and functions.",
    "derivitives",
    "I was able to brush up on my algebra while also learning new parts of calculus, such as finding the derivative of functions and being able to graph them.",
    "From this course I learned a great introduction to calculus along with skills of perseverance. In this class I was forced to work through problems that forced to me think deeper than I have ever thought before which expanded my mind."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are mostly the ways that it teaches you to solve problems. Even though the course is centered on calculus skills, the skills I learned allow me to apply problem solving techniques in a range of my other classes. I did not personally see any weaknesses in the course.",
    "Good teacher",
    "Very well taught, lots of office hours and opportunities to get help. Exams were somewhat difficult and PSETs were harshly graded.",
    "I wish that there was access to some online practice problems that could help one form a better mathematical intuition.",
    "I appreciated the individual attention I was able to receive from this class, but I did not think the weekly workshops or quizzes were necessary, as they just felt like busy work.",
    "Strengths - provided relevant feedback and opportunities for improvement Weakness- low levels of engagement in classroom",
    "A strength is definitely Professor Hall's passion for teaching, for he was extremely clear in his explanations and gave all his efforts for us to understand the material. Additionally, there is a huge amount of support in office hours and specially in the ULA's office hours. The ULAs are all very helpful and nice.",
    "Strengths- ULA office hours, I found it very helpful to have that as a resource to go to when I was struggling with a practice problem Weaknesses- Workshops seemed much longer than they needed to be",
    "My weaknesses were understanding the material during class and my strengths were asking for help.",
    "Strength would definitely include derivatives and graphing functions. I would say I need the most improvement on logarithms and inverse functions.",
    "The teaching process very quick and hard to understand. Professors should be thorough and take their time in explaining the techniques. There should be step by step problem-solving system",
    "There is a lot of support available for the class and it is structured well. Professor Hall is incredibly accessible and dedicated to helping the students in any way. The material progressed at a comfortable pace and the flow of concepts was fluid.",
    "My strengths in this course included having the basic background knowledge of algebraic functions and understanding piece wise functions. I struggled when it came to memorizing the derivative theorems and being able to find critical points on graphs.",
    "A strength of this course was its ability to challenge the students the right amount in order to push each person to levels that many have never been. There is also an unlimited amount of resources for each student to succeed."

    "Yes! Take John Hall! He is the best at teaching and will make sure he is available during office hours. He goes above and beyond for this course!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The teaching and content of the course was straightforward. As long as you complete the problem sees and ask for help when you are confused, you can find help and succeed in the class.",
    "Yes, especially if you want a review of precalculus and a slow paced calculus course.",
    "Absolutely. John Hall is amazing.",
    "If the student has little to no background in math, I would definitely recommend it because there is enough support so that no one feels that they are behind.",
    "No, not for a non STEM major.",
    "I would if they needed to fulfill their quantitative reasoning requirement or for personal enrichment since this course focuses on the foundations of calculus.",
    "Definitely. It is an excellent introduction to calculus, and you will get an amazing and well-supported class experience.",
    "Yes, it is very helpful if you are unsure if you are ready for Math 112 at Yale",
    "No.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another students because it offers the basic calculus skills need for higher math course.",
    "Yes if they are willing to put in the work",
    "In as much as it is a hard class, I would recommend students to take it. I liked the challenge it brought me to speed with.",
    "Yes, this course is great if you need a little extra help with refining your math skills. The course is structured to help you excel and the professors and kind and helpful.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who needs a math credit, due to professor hall being very helpful throughout the semester.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student."
