    "Take it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. The workload is manageable, allowing you to produce something meaningful without backbreaking research or time spent. And Austen's works are perhaps the best literature I've read--comic and profound, easy to read yet jam-packed with meaning\/paradox.",
    "This course is absolutely incredible. Everyone should read the entire Jane Austen oeuvre--it is very manageable and the language is so brilliant. Austen is a true master and Professor Markovits is a phenomenal professor. Men, definitely don't feel nervous about signing up for the course--Austen is for everyone!That said, there is a pretty decent amount of work (mostly in readings), but it is all very manageable.",
    "This is a great course for people interested in gaining a deeper understanding of Austen's works. Professor Markovits is a talented discussion leader. The reading can be heavy, especially towards the end of the semester, and the style can become tiresome. However, having the opportunity to read an author's entire oeuvre is a pretty exciting thing.",
    "I would recommend the class if you like Austen. As someone who had never read Austen prior to this course, I would still say that the course is interesting, but you have to be prepared to keep up with people who have read these novels four or five times.",
    "Great class but it does suck a little to have to read books like Pride and Prejudice in a week with the rest of your classes when they just deserve more to time to digest. And it makes reading these very enjoyable books a little bit of a chore, which is sad.",
    "In this class, you read all the fiction Austen wrote. The course proceeds chronologically, so it takes a bit of time to get to \u0093the good stuff\u0094 (since you start with the juvenilia and early short fictions), but the early works are helpful background for reading the novels. It is really cool to read all of Austen\u0092s fiction\u0097you really get a sense for what changes and what remains constant in her mind over the course of her career, and it\u0092s illuminating to draw connections or contrasts between different works. A lot of the students in the class are already \u0093Janeites\u0094 who have read most or all of the novels, but don\u0092t let that intimidate you; Professor Markovits values the perspectives of students who are encountering Austen for the first time. She\u0092s a great seminar leader, guiding the discussion to make sure we hit all of the important points while also allowing students to talk about what interests them. She\u0092s also readily available to meet outside of class to discuss papers with students, and when she disagrees with you, she helpfully gets you started thinking on the right track. This class has a fair bit of reading, especially if you\u0092re new to the material, but it is a great way to understand the cultural phenomenon that is Jane Austen from a literary and critical perspective.",
    "If you like Jane Austen, this is the class for you. It gives a thorough overview of Jane Austen's work, including the lesser known works. I see no major weaknesses to the course. However, keep in mind that this is A LOT of Jane Austen to read if you're not sure you're going to like her work.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone and everyone. You don't have to have a background in Jane Austen or even 18th or 19th century British novels. I had read a couple of Austen's novels before the course but certainly wasn't an expert. I am now thinking I will write my paper on a topic related to Austen and the literature of her time period.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to Austen fans or anyone looking for a thorough introduction to her works.",
    "Take this class, whether you are an Austenite or an Austen-hater. If you love the books, it will make you truly think about them and show you a depth that you probably did not know was present in the works. If you are apprehensive of Austen's work, it will reveal complexity in her writing that will probably at least give you a newfound respect for her work. Professor Markovits is interesting and incredibly smart, and the books are fun to read and fun to talk about. Just take it."
