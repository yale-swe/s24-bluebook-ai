    "EXCELLENT COURSE!!!! Absolutely awesome exploration of the science of science communication literature. My biggest take away is that there is a lot of poorly designed research out there that gets published - so always think critically about what you read, even in research! I have a completely different perspective about science communication that when I walked through the classroom and it's awesome! The readings and objectives are clearly outlined in each week's reading packets and they are organized in a way to take you down a path of reasoning that starts you where you are likely to agree first and then gently blow that perspective to pieces. By the end, you're perspective has been completely reconstructed. Excellent, excellent class!",
    "greatest strength: the potential of having 4 disciplines in the room, potential for great discussion greatest weakness: microfocus on the same questions each class with minimal allowance for students to stretch the discussion elsewhere, no apparent answering of those same questions",
    "The class covers a variety of interesting topics. However, rather than providing answers\/solutions, it leaves the students with more questions\/uncertainty by the end."

    "Instructor: Dan Kahan \u00a0Absolutely brilliant. He is definitely passionate about his work and it shines through the entire course! And he's got quite a sense of humor too! In the first class, you may feel things are a bit all over the place - but stick with it because you'll catch on quick and be better for it!",
    "Instructor: Dan Kahan \u00a0i've heard of dan being a brilliant researcher, interesting guy, and engaging professor in other classes. this class mostly brought out him being an interesting guy but students were not fully given a chance to engage in conversation in any way other than how he wanted the conversation to go. he stayed microfocused on a couple questions all semester (clearly his area of interest and research) that we didn't seem to answer. he was often disrespectful in discussions (perhaps without realizing it) and didn't do the best job at engaging students from each of the 4 departments that were present. only certain types of \"thinkers\" seemed to be given the floor the most. even guest speakers didn't get their questions answered, and that was the only real opportunity for application the entire semester.",
    "Instructor: Dan Kahan \u00a0Enthusiastic and knowledgeable, but has a tendency to shoot down students who have opinions he believes are wrong\/not correct with a forcefulness that might discourage some of the shyer students.",
    "Instructor: Dan Kahan \u00a0This is one of the worst class experiences I have ever had. I have never actively disliked a class this much before, ever. I am pretty easy going and I like good conversation and philosophical discourse. In the beginning of the class, I really liked our class and looked forward to the sessions. I did all of the reading and responses. But he started getting crazier and crazier and I really became disillusioned by his teaching style and his whole personality. Things I like about him: he is a free thinker, and he is thorough. He really wants to engage in issues. He cares a lot about his ideas and defends them to the death. He is really knowledgeable about a LOT of things. He is committed to truth and empiricism. He has a (kind of) good sense of humor. Unfortunately, he has a lot of bad qualities. This professor regularly cuts off his guests and students. He says the same things over and over. He hardly lets the students talk-- as a student in the class, I actually had a lot I wanted to say but I felt that I couldnt speak up because he would tell me my idea is stupid, and that Im asking all the wrong questions. But when a guest comes in and asks for your opinion, it is just thatwhat you think. It doesn't need to be evidence based. I understand the focus on empiricism, especially as a young scientist. But he needs to find another way to talk to people without being condescending and insulting. Also, he needs to find\/invite guests who actually want to talk about the same things he wants to talk about. The way I see it, the guests just want to hear our ideas about their work, and for us to act somewhat like a focus group, in that we are a diverse collection of students who care about science communication issues. But all he wants to do is have us pitch ideas of studies we could do, which are pretty much the same thing everytime: ask a question, design a study (based upon metrics that he ALWAYS believes are invalid), and then look at the data, which, by the way, are never useful since modeling is always an abstraction from reality. The aims of his lectures and the guests own aims are not aligned, so we end up in what he openly calls out as a \"dissatisfying conversation\". Anytime we make any logical progress, he throws a million limitations in your face that we all already take as given. It is almost as if he wants to remain in a state of confusion, and never solve any of the issues at hand. He refuses to accept his students ideas and constantly disrespects us. He is aggressive and there were so many times I wanted to get up and leave the class from just being fed up from his behavior. I was embarrassed by the way he talked to the guests, cut them off, and didnt give them any space to talk. He was openly antagonistic to several students in the class when he didnt like their ideas and\/or didnt agree with him, which I found to be unprofessional. Those instances really discouraged me from speaking up."
