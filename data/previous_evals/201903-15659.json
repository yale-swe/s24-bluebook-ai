   "comments": [
    "Mark provides extremely detailed lectures, in which he draws upon his vast background in large-data-set analysis. I learned about many Matlab features I had never utilized before, including the curve fitting toolbox, logical indexing, and different function syntaxes. This course was very useful for showing how to take statistical methods which students may or may not have been exposed to before and apply them to real problems (ex: the Sr curve, US climate data, Global Temperature data, etc).",
    "Introductory Matlab skills and statistical concepts.",
    "I learned the basics of coding in Matlab. This class gave me enough of a foundation to start learning more advanced concepts independently. Additionally, I gained a better understanding of statistical techniques and how I can apply them to my own data. This class was a good way for me to rebuild quantitative and coding skills after having been out of school for the past few years. It also helped me better understand statistical methods in the papers I'm reading for my own research."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Extremely knowledgable professor, in-depth homework assignments which require engagement in the statistical content as well as Matlab skills discussed in class, real-world application of material discussed in class, students get a lot of say in the pacing and topics Weaknesses: A bit disorganized, Lectures are 'on the fly' style (not for everybody)",
    "Strengths: Mark is extremely knowledgable and very approachable with all questions\/problems. Weakness: Did not expect so many high level statistical methods. Would have been better to allocate that time to Matlab info or geochemistry info.",
    "The class provided both practical instruction in coding as well as a broad overview of statistical concepts. It was also geared toward a wide array of interests. Homework assignments were helpful in reviewing what we covered in class and helped me better understand how Matlab works. I would have liked a better roadmap of where the class was going, though I understand that since this was the first semester it was offered, the course was very much a work in progress."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in working with large datasets and\/or using robust statistical tools and\/or learning more about the ins and outs of Matlab",
    "If the student wants to learn high level statistical concepts, I would recommend this course to them.",
    "I would recommend this course to a graduate student who already has data to interpret. Since this was my first semester I didnt really have any data to work with, which occasionally made it hard to see the immediate relevance of what I was learning. That said, Im glad I took the class and have a feeling I will be turning back to my notes many more times in the future."
