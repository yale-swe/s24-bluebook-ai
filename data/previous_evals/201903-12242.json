    "I was able to learn about fascinating artists that deal with complex issues of race and its relation to the art world among other, broader sociopolitical concerns. It also made me think more incisively on how I view art in general, seeing it as source material for fruitful, theoretical debates.",
    "I learned so much about both modern and contemporary art movements in the 20th century. I really liked that it encompassed a number of regions not traditionally included. Afro modernism gave a unique lens to both African american history\/theory and art history."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely loved the class and always left the lectures feeling like I learned something new and had something to reflect on. However, the material is very dense and I wish we would try to maybe cover a bit less so that we get a deeper dive into issues and make sure we truly understood them.",
    "So many strengths. Professor Mercer is such a good instructor and the class was so interesting. The only weakness was that there was so much information included in one semester."

    "I definitely would - it makes you think about art more critically. If other art history classes exposed me to different artists and ideas, this class also made me reflect on philosophical and social issues.",
    "Yes! it was wonderful and so important to anyone interested in af am, art history, or just history."
