    "I would recommend taking any class with Prof. Wilson. I learned a lot.",
    "The course focuses on a particular topic in Hebrew bible, and combines considerable reading with discussion and lecturing in the seminar meetings. The readings are vital to get the most out of the class, as you'll have no context for the discussion and material presented in class without them.",
    "RLST 80101 is a seminar style course that went through a wide variety of archaeological, textual, and secondary evidence and literature in order to discern the ares of Israelite religion that we simply don't know much about, usually because of a paucity of evidence.",
    "It's a great class to acquire an overview of Israelite religion and its problems. Dr. Wilson carefully points out many angles that enlighten one."

   "comments": [
    "My research interest align perfectly with thetopic of the course this term, so access to the material and discussion was invaluable. The only limiting factor to the course in my opinion was the fact that the course was made up if mostly first year masters students instead of doctoral students, and thus the discussion was a bit introductory at times in order to make sure the less advanced students knew what was happening. But this was only a minor limiting factor in content.",
    "It helped me learn about the HB, which is what I'm teaching next fall."
