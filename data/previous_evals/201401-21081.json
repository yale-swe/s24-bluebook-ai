    "A fun course for anybody who is interested in the history and development of mathematics, intuition and ontology.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in the subject. If math or philosophy is your thing you will probably really enjoy this. Otherwise it's probably not worth your time. He lets you out late a lot so don't plan a class directly after this one that you have to rich to.",
    "I more or less summarised the class in the box above. I would certainly recommend it, but only as an easy fifth\/sixth class. Also you really don't have to have any background in maths or philosophy to take it, it's very accessible.",
    "This was a course in the history of mathematics. If you are interested in learning actual math or actual philosophy, I would not recommend it.",
    "Philosophy 275 is a great class for anyone interested in Philosophy and Mathematics. The workload is decent, and the information you get out of it is definitely worth the credit.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing. You get to learn about how people have thought about mathematics throughout basically all of time, which is not only super interesting mathematically and philosophically but you also get a general history of western math which I found to be incredibly interesting. Posy is crazy knowledgeable, and sometimes the lectures will go a bit fast but the material is all fascinating and he always goes over the last lecture in the first 15 minutes. My one regret is that I didn't go to office hours enough and realized before the final paper that I was actually misinterpreting an extremely key concept the entire course... If you have the slightest interest in how people think about math and this course is offered again 100% take it.",
    "I recommend if the material sounds interesting to you, otherwise it would probably be boring. Lectures can be a bit long, but if you keep up with the material you'll get a really great philosophical and historical perspective on math (and intuition and ontology). Also not too much work at all - just takehome midterm and final assignments (so, 2 total). I recommend!",
    "While Posy is a good lecturer, I could not stand the fact that the class has no text and almost no readings. Posy organizes the class - even the assignments! you can use no outside references - entirely around the lectures. I found it hard to sustain interest on lectures alone. Posy cares about students and knows his stuff but I would not recommend this class in the current format.",
    "Yes! At first, this will feel like a simple history of math course, but once you tap into the philosophical works, the class becomes mind boggling and eye opening. You'll never look at mathematics (and its development) the same way after this class!",
    "Posy was an entertaining lecturer, although he did a poor job of checking his email and I found it difficult to meet with him during office hours or by appointment (He was late to appointments and was always busy with other students\/meetings during office hours). The assignments were also handled poorly- they were released later than he expected, the due dates were constantly pushed backed, and he took a very long time grading everything. That being said, he definitely is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the topic. I probably wouldn't take another class with him, but I don't regret taking this one. I greatly enjoyed PHIL 275 and thought that it was a really accessible class for both philosophy and math students. The topics seem arcane and even (I shudder to say it) insignificant. All in all, a slightly dysfunctional but highly enjoyable Hu credit.",
    "This was an interesting class, and it straddled Math and Philosophy well, but didn't require you to be an expert in either. Professor Posy was very flexible in terms of his assignments because he allowed you to either write a paper or do a problem set, and at the end you could turn in \"polished class notes.\" He was a great professor, but it was odd that he didn't allow any outside readings or resources other than his lectures throughout the semester.",
    "A wonderful course. If it is offered again, take it. The workload is almost non-existent, but you will learn plenty. A truly fascinating look at some very interesting topics.",
    "Yes, it's a fun class and you learn a lot that is very niche so it's hard to find in other courses"
