    "Straightforward, linear tour-de-force through Apuleius and Ovid's Metamporphoses. Same pace of reading throughout. Make sure you're prepared for class and you will do fine. The quizzes and exams aren't too bad.I only took this because I wanted to finish my language requirement ASAP, but I'm almost tempted to take another semester of Latin if it is this good.",
    "You got through 110 and 120. Now, unlike your non-dead-language-studying brethren, you get to enjoy the luxury of 3 meetings a week! Prof. Kraus is wonderful, and you'll find yourself learning many tidbits of history, literature, and linguistics. Readings are slightly more challenging than those from the second half of 120, but the workload is a lot lighter. We did Apuleius' The Golden Ass and Ovid's Metamorphoses (which isn't prose, haha); apparently, the readings are subject to change between years. Quizzes and exams are easy and graded leniently. Have fun!",
    "I would recommend Latin 131. The workload is fair and not overwhelming. There is also plenty of review throughout if you happen to forget how a grammar topic works.",
    "Latin 131 is a great course for people beginning translation courses or become reacquainted with the language--it is highly recommended.",
    "I was worried having not had the strongest Latin background from high school that I would have some problems, but the tests mostly cover passages gone over in class and you translate stuff that you have translated at home during class. The course material was also very interesting, Apuleius and Ovid.",
    "This was a good transition from grammar and translations of isolated excerpts into reading longer works with commentaries. You'll read part of the first books of Apuleius' and Ovid's Metamorphoses. The homework and exams were very straightforward after reviewing the translations. Definitely take L3 from Dr. Kraus; she gives context to every topic and makes you act out action scenes. It's awesome, even if you're not a Classics major (I'm not).",
    "The amount of work was very reasonable, and Professor Kraus is a great teacher.",
    "Latin 131 is a solid course for intermediate Latin students. After learning the basics of the language in the introductory courses, it was nice to spend a semester reading Latin authors. We started with Apuleius' metamorphoses and then went on to Ovid's metamorphoses. Grading was pretty standard with quizzes and tests.Overall, I would recommend this course as a great way to gain more proficiency in Latin while diving into some interesting Latin literature.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I would recommend Latin 131. I became much more comfortable with translation this semester, and I really liked that at this level of Latin we could talk about more than just straight translation. This was also my first introduction to hexameter, and Christina Kraus explained it well and made sure the class understood why it was important. Plus, the texts were really fun to read.",
    "Take this class to translate some great Latin prose and have fun doing it"
