    "Confidence in front of others",
    "During the four weeks I learned practical skill in effective communication both in various forms.",
    "By taking this course I gained\/refined key communications skills concerning public speaking, presentations, negotiations, panel participation.

The course teaches you how to improve the less discussed communications techniques, receive and incorporate peer feedback, and capture the attention of your audience in both speaking and writing engagements.",
    "Through the course I was able to improve my writing, presenting, and facilitating skills. I obtained different tools during the different class sessions such as recommendations for giving and designing presentations and strategies to write an engaging paper.",

    "Designing effective slide shows. Drafting persuasive speeches.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No weaknesses. This class flew by every week despite being 3 hours and at night. The team is so good at what they do and we are so lucky to have them.",
    "All students should be required to attend every class and complete assignments before classes. Many people in my groups seemed unprepared which was very frustrating.",
    "I think this course should have been longer. The few class periods that we did have were EXCELLENT! I learned a lot about how to improve my public speaking, writing, and negotiation, but I would have liked to have more practice. I also learned about resources I didn't know existed on campus and I found this very helpful.",
    "Getting a safe place to practice, work through weaknesses in a semi-pressured environment. Good mix of peer and expert feedback.",
    "No ways for it to be improved except to extend the class and give us more time to practice and learn more of these important skills!",
    "Strengths - solid diversity of activities\/lessons; quickly cover an array of public speaking categories and receive strong feedback from peers and staff. No serious weaknesses given the short duration of the course. We cover a lot in a short period! Worth the time investment.",
    "This class should expand into a full 2 credit class, the skills are necessary to have, but the structure of the class, didn't allow for enough practice.",
    "The course offered very practical and useful skills for my future development. The small group practice session was very helpful in receiving feedback and building up skills.",
    "The strengths of the course are the hands on training in the art of public speaking, breakout sessions with fantastic public speaking coaches, the interactive activities to obtain and incorporate peer feedback, and overall great guidance from William and his co-teachers. The only weakness to the course were that it lasted only 4 weeks for 3 hours each. The course could be extended to more class sessions and focus more on the written communications side.",
    "Strengths: - The content of the class. Everything I learned in the course has been useful to me. - The style of the professor William is very clear and gives many examples when explaining concepts\/ideas which is very useful to understand them. - The structure of the first classes (my favorites!). It was great to received feedback from communication coaches and our classmates. Weaknesses: - The time of the class. It was difficult not to feel tired and hungry during class, thus, I recommend having this class earlier in the day to take more advantage of it. - The sessions were too long. I recommend having shorter sessions twice a week or making the course longer (i.e. six weeks instead of four).",
    "The strength was that the class size was small so that there was more attention directed towards individuals. The guidance from practitioners really helped and the constructive criticism was provided. The Sage Hall was too big of a class for such a small group of students. It was hard for me to understand the instructor.",
    "I think the negotiation segment was a little forced and did not find it very helpful. It was hard to have a mock negotiation with information and a persona provided only minutes before."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Take it!",
    "Very useful, condensed information",
    "Take it!",
    "I would recommend every FES student take this course before they graduate and to make the most of the short four weeks of the course.",
    "Take it. Extremely helpful for interviews and networking. Even class presentations improved.",
    "Take it!",
    "Take it! You'll learn areas to improve you didn't know you needed to improve.",
    "If you are at all nervous with public speaking, take it.",
    "I would advise students considering this class to lean into it and let your guard down. Your professor, co-teachers, and colleagues will all be providing you with positive feedback and constructive criticism for you to continuously improve your communications skills. Also, you must keep up with the weekly assignments as they are referenced and made part of every course session.",
    "I would recommend every student taking this class to prepare for each session by doing the assignments. It is important to do them because you will use them in class and you will take more advantage of professor Vance's lecture if you actually put in practice what he says. Engage in the exercises and overcome the discomfort of analyzing a recording of you. Bring snacks!",
    "Even if you think you're a strong communicator, take this class. The recordings and self-reflections allow you to improve from whatever level you're at. Take this class.",
    "Extensive preparation before the class will make the course more effective."
