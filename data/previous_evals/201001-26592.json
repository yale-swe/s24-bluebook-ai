   "comments": [
    "I think that this studio lent itself well to incorporating not only the above mentioned disciplines, but others as well. Structure was inherent in a large scale project (250,000 sq feet) and the siting with a park and a location on a plinth with the Miami Art Museum incorporating planning and landscape.",
    "The sequence of assignments produced conceptually clear and interesting projects. However I would have appreciated more time dedicated to the tectonic aspects of the project. Perhaps meeting with a structural engineer or requiring a detailed wall section would help make the project feel more real or grounded. I also wish I would have spent more time analyzing and designing the relationship between the museum and adjacent park (although this is more of a self-critique).",
    "Coordination seemed pretty casual. Seemed like the instructor was very busy with his own firm work."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "The most valuable aspects of a studio for me are always desk crits. Nothing beats one on one in-depth critique. The silent review three weeks before the final was intimidating but ended up being one of the most beneficial yet.",
    "In the first half of the semester, especially the time after the studio trip and before the midterm review, the expectations (number of drawings, models, diagrams etc required each week) and the number of pin-ups we had made it really hard to focus on the project itself. I felt like I was just trying to get something done and wasn't thinking about it as much as I should have.",
    "Sunil had a particular way of teaching that i found very refreshing, constructive, and valuable. Unlike most of the critics I've had who've preferred desk crits, Sunil encouraged having mini pin-ups, usually consisting of three people, and pushed the students to participate in the critiques. I found the clarity of the studio, in both its schedule and goals, very valuable and productive. The trip to Miami was also very informative and enjoyable. There were a few assignments that felt a bit like busy work, namely, the studio trip assignment. Even so, overall, I felt this semester was my best here, and that has a great deal to do with clear way the studio was structured.",
    "The pin-ups in groups of 3 were by far the most valuable aspects of the studio. Not only did I have to frequently explain and justify my decisions to a perpetually different group of my peers, but I also was able to participate in the discussion of other students' projects. This allowed me to think about different approaches to the same problems and inevitably resulted in a stronger attitude to the design of the museum. The silent review was also incredibly useful for establishing graphic clarity.",
    "Most valuable was the freedom Sunil gave us to explore. Least valuable was all the small studies given early in the semester that seemed to have no role at all with the final project."

   "question_text": "Discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of the studio as a pedagogical tool",
   "comments": [
    "There really were no significant weaknesses here. We were on pace the entire semester. I think too much time was spent on production prior to the midterm and I think that it was hard (maybe just for me) having early assignments be only in model form when I find it most invigorating to draw first and use small study models.",
    "I liked the fact that we designed a building because even though it was a rather big one it gave me the opportunity to put my hands on the problem and try to deal with it on different levels. I think it is important to design a functioning building for a studio rather than producing a bunch of colorful diagrams and I am glad that this studio gave me the opportunity to do that.",
    "Sunil's schedule for the studio produced a high level of productivity with a relatively low level of stress. It was definitely good to have a schedule that allowed for us to really focus on our project. Each week built on the previous one so that we were not working on isolated assignments that were unrelated to each other. This said, Sunil also allowed for a great deal of independence and did not hold our hand the whole way. While he provided the structure of the schedule, he kept his distance for us to develop our own visions for the project, guiding us through the conceptual issues of the project, but not telling us what to do.",
    "Pedagogical system seemed vague. Seemed like we could do whatever we wanted to and there was no discouragement. This became a weakness when the drawings were not very developed and the program was forgotten about. Overall, the studio offered freedom but lacked rigor. Seemed like Sunil was busy with his office a lot and not very prepared for studio."

   "comments": [
    "My expectations were merely to grow in my architectural vocabulary and understanding of new design approaches. I sought to rethink the design process for myself and this happened.",
    "I initially expected the studio to be very straightforward. A museum program in an urban area seemed like a familiar brief, however I quickly came to terms with the complexity of the assignment.",
    "I expected a studio that would not be as difficult as many others and that was a correct assumption."

   "comments": [
    "Sunil was a wonderful prof. He was always attentive and available in studio hours and beyond. He really opened my eyes to a new way of thinking of and discussing architecture and pushed me to come out of my comfort zone and diagram and model. He is extremely approachable, knowledgeable and passionate aboutwhat he does and I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to have him this semester.",
    "I thought the studio head was very helpful in the first half of the semester, during the more conceptual phase of the studio. However I have to admit that I would have liked a little more clarity in his critique especially towards the end.",
    "Sunil was a great teacher. He was very good at synthesizing one's ideas and helping clarify one's intentions. He also did not push any formal or ideological direction. The result was nine very different projects that all had very clear ideas.",
    "I think Sunil's strengths and weaknesses overlap. When I was frustrated and paralyzed with specific aspects of the studio project, I wanted direct feedback to quickly get me past whatever issue I was struggling with. However, his imposed distance forced me to address these issues independently. Consequently, I feel more confident as a designer and less intimidated by design problems.",
    "It would have been nice to have an Assistant teacher but there was not one.Sunil was always friendly and fair, though he seemed disorganized and very busy with his personal work. His preparation was sometimes lacking and many of the smaller assignments lacked focus and seemed arbitrary."
