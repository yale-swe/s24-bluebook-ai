    "A class on the quintessential biophysical technique of crystallography mostly, with highlights on other techniques that are used either when crystallography fails, or when extra information is needed. Theoretical treatment, but practical assessment. A good class for taking the techniques you may have heard of or studied and applying them so that you could do so in the future. I'd recommend it.",
    "It's a survey that increased my awareness but did not make me an expert. It was pretty easy.",
    "Biophysics I is an introductory course describing different biophysical techniques. The techniques we used focused on employing x-ray, neutron, and electron sources for molecular imaging. Both theoretical aspects and potential applications are discussed for each method. Finally, selected examples are discussed which demonstrate the power of these methods to unravel shape and function of biological macromolecules."

    "As a biophysical student X-ray crystallography comes up a fair amount. Finally I can read articles and listen to talks that discuss crystallography knowledgeably! While it will likely not apply to my own research, it was a very worthwhile course for my general understanding of my field.",
    "One interest of mine is protein structure and function. This course gave great insight into how protein structures can be solved as well as how a given structure can help elucidate that protein's function. These same techniques can be applied to all biological macromolecules and will be very helpful in future research."
