    "I felt this course introduced many important concepts, especially to students working in optics. A lot of the topics are very relevant to my work and will be very useful.",
    "I gained an understanding of both the details and the broader picture of nonlinear optics and lasers from this very comprehensive course. Prof. Miller also gave us some very helpful advice and feedback about how to prepare research papers and presentation.",
    "This was a nice balance between a regular course and a survey course. We covered a wide array of topics, briefly touching some while going into more depth on others. Specifically, we focused on nonlinear susceptibility, various nonlinear processes, and finally lasers."

  {
   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The main weakness is that the course has both non-linear optics and lasers in one semester. Each of these topics could fill a whole semester with getting into some more details. On the other hand this is also an advantage as a lot of ground was covered, and further reading and studying can be done by students on either or both topics.",
    "This course was very well structured and covered a host of important topics in a relatively short amount of time. Although we covered a great deal of material, it didn't feel rushed or overwhelming, which is a big credit to Prof. Miller's teaching style. The homework assignments were generally very well organized and instructive. Prof. Miller also made himself frequently available to facilitate student's learning.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Miller did an outstanding job of covering a wide array of interesting topics. Every class was highly energetic and engaging. Homework was assigned at a very reasonable pace. It is obvious that great care was taken to crafting the problem sets. Weaknesses: It would be helpful if there was a prescribed reading prior to each class. That way students could familiarize themselves with the material and also know where to refer back for the homework. Finally, because this was the first course of it's kind, there were unfortunately several errors on homeworks. This made it difficult to identify if there as a mistake in one's logic, or simply a typo."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student working in optics, or interested in the field, assuming they have some background. It gives very important tools and that will be very useful in the future.",
    "I would. I learned quite a lot and enjoyed the class.",
    "Absolutely. The material is fascinating and the Prof. Miller is a talented instructor.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Absolutely, however that would be contingent upon their background\/research field, as this is slightly more work than I would recommend to someone who just wanted an overview\/survey course to see what nonlinear optics is about."
