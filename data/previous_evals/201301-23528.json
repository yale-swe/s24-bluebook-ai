    "Question 4: This course seemed geared more toward undergraduates in pace and material covered. It was a great overview of various concepts in sustainable design but I can't say I learned too many new things. That being said, I can see how undergrads would enjoy this course and get a lot out of it because the way we learn to see problems really opens up your thoughts.",
    "This class could have been a lot better-- Paul Anastas is incredible, super smart and a great lecturer. But, he sometimes seemed really distracted and we just covered the very very basics of green engineering, without getting into the specifics of anything. This class has the huge potential to be one of the best classes at FES, but it just went too slow sometimes and we wasted too much time on certain things, e.g.: the in class exercises were pretty pointless",
    "This could be a great class, but because of the way it's set up, it's not. On the first day, more than 50 students packed into Kroon 321. It was announced that all engineering undergrads would be allowed to stay. The class was whittled down to 35 or 40, still pretty big, oftentimes there were not enough seats or desks in the room for everyone. This was way below my expectation for graduate school. I did not come to Yale to work with 19 and 20 year olds who have zero work experience. It was ridiculous. It seems strange to lump together three different schools -- FES, Engineering, and Environmental Engineering -- into one big class, especially when the topic is so popular; there should be two sessions for this, one for grad level and another for undergrad.",
    "Question 2: The final project was very useful in helping me apply the things I learned in the course to a real-life situation, but I found the problem sets to be rote and not helpful at all. I honestly felt like I was doing a high school homework assignment.Question 4: I thought that the course tried to cover a bit too much ground in a semester. I wish it cut out a few topics and dove more deeply into others.Question 13: I really liked the concept of the course and very much enjoyed exploring most of the topics, but the fact that there were so many undergrads made it tough to cater to everyone's knowledge base. Many of the sessions were total repeats of stuff I already knew, while others were entirely new to me. I think if it were limited to masters students only it would be a much better class for those students.",
    "This course did not feel like it should be part of graduate school. The concepts were repetitive and too surface level.I was also very frustrated with the final project. I strongly believe that students in the US should not design products for people in other countries without better understanding the conditions and circumstances in that country. The course taught that ethnography and lengthy observation were key principles for design, but this was not part of the assignment. Also, the insistence on designing something that had never been created or thought of seemed silly, given that so many problems arise because of the way products are implemented, and given that we do not have expertise in these areas."

    "More complexity in the course material. I would have liked spending more time on LCA, life cycle costing, MCDA, etc... the quantitative things that matter in assessing feasibility of a project.",
    "The in class exercises (appropriate technology for the developing world, biomimicry, etc.) were pretty boring and just were too redundant from our reading\/lectures to actually be useful.",
    "maybe try to get into CEID and\/or a real seminar room so it is more of a discussion based class",
    "The design projects could be better organized, and to make things more equitable, all design projects should be more similar. For example, they could all focus on a product to primarily be marketed in North America, so that all groups have equal opportunity to do adequate research, including market research and testing. There was a significant difference with how much research was possible between groups that worked on, for example, the Yale wastewater treatment solution versus the Mexican coffee project.The survey on group members should be done after the final project presentations, because at least 50% of the project work was done in the last 2 weeks, and because the survey was done 2 weeks before the presentations, this was not taken into account. In addition, the types of skillsets involved in the latter tasks of the project were quite different from those required in the first few weeks, and so different teammates had more opportunities to contribute at different times.",
    "Allowing undergrads in is a terrible idea, that should not be allowed. When nearly half the class is undergrad, that's a HUGE problem.It would have been good to get design and charrette support from Paul or some other seasoned veteran (not the TA's) for our final project. We are sort of left high and dry to figure it out, even just some design support to bring the ideas forward by an experienced professional would have been helpful.A one-pager that describes the deliverables for the final project would have helped, a brief that describes in detail what is being asked for each step. The PPT slides were not specific enough, communication was lacking, and we are not god mind readers.",
    "Need advanced textbook",
    "The design challenges were not entirely well matched to the goals of the design project. Allow more flexibility for interpretation of the design challenges.",
    "I don't think it makes sense for this to be an undergrad\/grad mixed class. We didn't choose our own groups and I think I got a lot less out of the course because of the group I was placed in.This course talked a lot about design but had less actual doing of design. I think it would be better if we did a lot more in-depth evaluation of different design cases and more iterative practice actually designing a lot of things. We have scientists and engineers leading the course, but I think it's missing the creativity of a designer.",
    "- The problem sets (see my comments above)- The in-class exercises. A few of them were ok (biomimicry, bottom of the pyramid) but others were a waste of time (the chemistry one)- The course blew through the ideation process way too quickly to do it its proper justice",
    "Maybe have a discussion section about the problem sets. A field trip to the Yale Power Plant or other local facilities woud have been interesting.",

    "Instructor: Amanda Winston Lounsbury \u00a0Amanda was enthusiastic and committed as a TA, but I found her class lecture and general interactions suggested an underlying discomfort and a lack of organization. Perhaps there was not good communication in the teaching team in general and that affected Amanda disproportionately. Or perhaps she needs to put more time into preparation. Whatever the cause, I offer this feedback because I think my impression was shared by others and therefore may be helpful in her development as an academic.",
    "Instructor: Amanda Winston Lounsbury \u00a0This is 2013 and we're in an environmental school. Students shouldn't be forced to submit hard copies of assignments just because the TA is disorganized and doesn't know how to use the track changes function. I'm the surprised the TAs were so inept as to not be able to 'greenly design' a way to go paperless for this class.",
