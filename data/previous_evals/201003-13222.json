    "YES! This is a fascinating seminar - it's not just about property, it's about institutions in general and the roles that they play in politics, the economy, and society. The reading's pretty dense but class discussion more than makes up for it, and the weekly reading responses really make you think critically about a variety of topics. TAKE. THIS. CLASS.",
    "This was a great seminar that dealt with the more interesting ramifications and questions of property rights --why are they not strong in some places, how do property rights affect the political economy of societies, and how can our understanding and beliefs about how property should be organized reflect or affect our ethical views on justice and equality, or economic growth?",
    "I'd recommend this course if you have any interest in the material.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but I would warn them that the topic is very narrow, and that they must be prepared for lots of in class participation. The reason I would recommend it is that it is possible to learn a lot, about something you may not have known anything about, in what is not too difficult of a class."
