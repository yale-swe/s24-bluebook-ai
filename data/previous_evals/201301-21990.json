   "comments": [
    "Great class, Professor Gabriel is great to have for seminar. Interesting texts, not too much writing.",
    "not at all, if gabriel is teaching",
    "I really liked the works that we read and the cultural\/geographic breadth of the works. I've never really been into early world literature, but I've always thought they were incredibly important--telling us things about the human experience and today's societies in really fundamental ways. This class was good because it allowed me to enjoy early world literature and made it accessible to me. The big weakness is that the course was very disorganized this semester. That was largely due to uncontrollable things, as the professor got sick and wasn't able to come to class.",
    "I do recommend this course, while at the same time knowing that this semester is not representative of the way the course usually runs. I selected this course partially based on the raving reviews that OCI had showed from previous semesters. I myself can't provide an accurate picture because the professor was out sick most of the time and class was either cancelled or we had a substitute. Mind you, the substitutes, Professor David Quint (once) and Elizabeth Harper (the rest of the time) were absolutely wonderful. I'm thankful that they stepped in so readily and so enthusiastically. When Professor Gabriel was teaching for the first couple of sessions early on, he was also extremely knowledgeable and a wonderful discussion leader. I do hope he gets better soon. As for the texts, they were quite interesting and probably not ones you'll get the chance to read in many other courses.",
    "This class was a relaxed but interesting literature class, with not too much work but a nice professor!",
    "I would recommend taking this course if Professor Gabriel can teach it full time. He is awesome and really loves the books he is teaching.",
    "An introduction to early world literature through the theme of travel and quests."
