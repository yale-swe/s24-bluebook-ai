    "a good crash course on fluorescence microscopy techniques.take the class, it's not too much work and you learn a lot.",
    "A great class to quickly look at the various advancements in imaging technology. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to get some knowledge on microscopy in a more immersive way.",
    "Yes, I would like to recommend this course to other students who are interested in optics and imaging.",
    "I would recommend it very highly. The lab time for this course was particularly useful.",
    "Yes always. This should be a compulsory course!",
    "The course covers both the practical application and the underlying theory of light microscopy, making it a \u00e2\u0080\u0098must\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for biological experimentalist and an inspiring course for students who work with optics in general. I highly recommend the course."

    "the class was a great review on techniques i knew. and it helped clarify a lot of things i had misunderstood in terms of fluorescence microscopy techniques.it definitely helped with understanding concepts for research.",
    "It helped me understand a lot of new tools that will definitely be helpful for my research.",
    "It's very helpful for me to understand the basic principles of optics and imaging, as well as the essence of different types of microscope, including two-photon, confocal, TIRF and cutting-edge super-resolution techniques. The knowledge I learned from this class would be very helpful for my future research as my research project would largely depend on imaging techniques.",
    "This course gave me insight into imaging techniques that could be useful during my dissertation research",
    "I used three of the presented techniques after taking this course",
    "I found the course very inspiring and thought provoking. The practical experience with light microscopy I have obtained in this course will be very useful in my research."
