   "comments": [
    "I think it was a pretty good look into the kinds of things theoretical researchers in this field of applied math think about. Pretty challenging psets and lectures.",
    "It is one of the courses that you do not want to miss.",
    "Spectral graph theory explores the link between linear algebra and graph theory. Prof. Dan Spielman is a phonomenal lecturer and the first half of the course is also pretty accessible to anyone with background in both linear algebra and graph theory. In the second half and course got a little more involved and algebra a lot more ugly. Dan still manages to get the main ideas across during the lectures, usually resorting to proving weaker versions of theorems and directing us to original papers so that material fits into one lecture. Workload for the course is not bad at all: about one problem set every two weeks, although some of the problems can be quite challenging.",
    "Pretty good course. The topics are very interesting, especially random walks and expander graphs. Those are also very useful ways of thinking about data sets, algorithms, etc. However the bulk of the second half of the course focused on solving linear equations quickly and to good approximation. I'm not particularly interested in those topics so that part of the course was a little dull. Ultimately I think I would have been better off with a course in randomized algorithms.",
    "Spectral graph theory is about graphs (i.e. vertices and edges) and eigenvalues which we can associate with those graphs. It sounds like a cool intersection of ideas, as graphs are discrete and often thought of from a combinatorial perspective, whereas eigenvalues are pretty on the analytical side of things. I think that's certainly true at a really deep level, but from my experience in this class, I felt that it leans much more heavily on the analytical than the combinatorial. Basically, a lot of matrix manipulation, approximation, bounding - with the very occasional combinatorial insight for the extra push \/ intuition. Notes from past runs of the class should be available on Spielman's site, so check those out (especially the later lecture) to get a sense of what sort of stuff will happen on a day-to-day basis. The only assigned work is problem sets, about every 3 weeks or so - they can be a lot of fiddling around with matrices, inequalities, and \"algebra\" (not in the pure math sense) to get the result desired. Looking back, I was actually surprisingly satisfied by what I learned from some of the problem sets, compared to the amount of time I spent bashing my head against a board filled with messy expressions. Developments in spectral graph theory are happening rapidly right now - much of the material was work by Spielman himself in recent years, barely any results that are from before the 1980s. So I think this course is as good as a course can be in a field that is still developing a lot, being taught by one of its leading researchers. At the same time, the field itself may not be as exciting in its specific work as opposed to its big ideas, so keep that in mind when you shop.",
    "Take this class, Dan Spielman is a god in this field and you'll learn a lot about how to deal with large graphs using linear algebra.",
    "Yes I would. If someone is into math and graph theory, take it.",
    "A solid class if you want to learn more advanced linear algebra or graph theory. Be prepared for some tedious algebraic manipulation.",
    "pretty good",
    "The class is called spectral graph theory, but the primary emphasis is on linear algebra proofs. The amount of graph theory knowledge required is relatively small compared to the amount of linear algebra knowledge that is required. Of course the class is very relevant to graph theory, but students should be very comfortable with quite advanced linear algebra in order to take this course.",
    "Excellent course! Dan is a fantastic lecturer. The topics covered are mostly very exciting and provide a comprehensive introduction to the field (studying graphs using algebraic methods). The workload is not too high--5~6 difficult problem sets. If you find a good study group (collaboration was allowed), they are manageable and really help you understand the materials. (Hint: Courant-Fischer will solve a lot of problems for you :)",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. The content is very rich and creative.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "A fast-paced linear algebra course. From a CS perspective, I'd definitely recommend it to any student who has taken a couple theoretical classes and has done well and enjoyed them."

   "comments": [
    "This course surely deepen my knowledge and raise my interest in graph theory. It let me know that many properties of graphs can be explained algebraically. I think it is useful to my research when I study the communication graphs of multi-agent systems.",
    "It was an approach to math that so far I haven't encountered much of until this course - meaning, big results being more about bounds \/ approximations, and a lot of linear algebra. I learned that going heavily in this direction is not what I would enjoy the most, though there are some nice ideas that I'm glad I came upon. I'll certainly be surprised if I seriously run into spectral graph theory later in my academic life, but it would be cool! I'm an undergrad, so not much of a dissertation\/research to speak of.",
    "Helps me express ideas in graph theory canonically. See the connection between graph theory and algebraic topology.",
    "This is a helpful class in exposing me to applied mathematics.",
    "made me rethink everything I know about linear algebra",
    "Highly related"
