   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to people who like to think and talk about literature in depth. The readings are interesting, the essays cover a lot of necessary skills, and Professor Smith is great.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are looking for a chance to read some of the classics of the American canon as well as other authors that you may have never heard of before or may have never thought would be considered within the realm of American literature. The readings never felt like work and the discussions hit on interesting themes and connections. It was also great to have the grade composed of several shorter essays, so that your final grade was able to reflect the progression you made as a writer.",
    "It's an introductory English class focused on American Lit. You read between 70-150 pages for each class. You write three 5 page papers and a longer final paper. You need to do the reading to participate in seminar.",
    "Overall ENGL127 was definitely a great way to delve into the heart of American Literature and I would recommend theclass. As an international student who has only read a select few pieces from the Harlem Renaissance, I found the course to be very useful. I also liked the fact that we did not have a final exam and instead, focusing on revising our papers. Professor Smith also has a very easy-going manner that helped facilitate class discussion without being the least bit overbearing.",
    "A broad overview of American literature considering themes of solidarity, consciousness, and struggle where the assignments are not to heavy but the discussion is quite in-depth.",
    "YES! Take this class. It has a reading list that is quite good for American literature and discussions are always fun. I really enjoyed the readings and the conversations we had in class!",
    "I would recommend this course. Moby Dick isn't as bad as you've always heard; in fact, it's quite an enjoyable read. Caleb Smith is a cool guy and a very fair grader. It'd probably be kind of hard to do badly in this class as long as you actually write the papers.",
    "Take this course! I was looking for a literature-based class, rather than a writing-based one. I also really liked the reading list and wanted to read important works of American literature with some guidance. Class moves through the novels very quickly, so it is important to stay on top of the reading in order to feel comfortable during discussion. Sometimes this made things feel a bit rushed because there were so many parts of the texts we didn't discuss, although I understand time was limited. 3-4 papers and no final. Even though I always did the readings on time, class discussion could sometimes be intimidating. Taking 127 with Caleb Smith was still wonderful- worth it for his voice alone. I liked that we covered such a broad spectrum of works - from Whitman to Melville to Dickson to Ellison to O'Connor to Diaz and more. This class was challenging and not sure of my grade yet, but I loved it and it is definitely worthwhile.",
    "English 127 01 was a good way to begin time studying English at Yale. The course had a good reading list that gave a basic overview of American Literature. The workload was manageable and the class discussions informative. I would recommend this class to anyone looking to improve their writing while reading some good material.",
    "English 127 01 provides a nice introduction to the bizarre and offbeat motifs of American literature. Don't expect to read every great American writer, but do expect to be intrigued by the dynamic and diverse voices heard in the American canon. For that reason, I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially with Prof. Smith. He really takes the time to get to know each student and to offer valuable comments about and recommendations for his or her writing. That said, each instructor of English 127 gets to craft their own slightly different reading list, so definitely look at the syllabi of each section before choosing an instructor.",
    "The syllabus was manageable and interesting; I really enjoyed everything we read. The course was mostly discussion-based with three essays during the term and a final paper at the end which elaborated on a topic of one of the first three prompts. I enjoyed the efforts to engage us outside the classroom. The viewing of Jaws and visit to Beinecke were particularly enjoyable. The archival research essay was challenging and made me aware of all the resources available to us; that is something I will take with me. I took it with Caleb Smith, who is a friendly and capable instructor. I would recommend this course."
