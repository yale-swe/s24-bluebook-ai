    "all students should be required to take this course",
    "With regards to assignments, I think a few more written assignments earlier in the semester might have helped solidify some of that early material in my mind.Also, given that so much of the exams were based on reading \/ interpreting graphs, it might have been helpful to spend more time focusing on breaking those down together in class. It sometimes seemed like we were trying to blow through as much material as possible, rather than doing deeper dives into what the professors considered the core concepts.",
    "Question 1 - - I found the topic lecture readings to be very helpful and useful, but did not do any of the other reading after the first two or so weeks.Question 3 - - I found the carbon lake budget assignment frustrating and felt it didn't add much to my understanding of the class material. The modeling assignment was fun, but it didn't teach me much.Question 6 - - The class really slowed down in the second half of the semester.Question 7 - - I thought Professor Schmitz was fantastic - - engaging, exciting, and a great lecturer. I thought Professor Raymond was less engaging.",

    "It would be better if this class was put into a management perspective earlier in the semester. I think students, including myself, would take more away from the class if it was taught through this lens."

   "comments": [
    "The lectures, especially the ones that Os gave.",
    "I really enjoyed the topic lectures, where we had the chance to think critically about scientific papers with the professors' guidance.",
    "It gives students a general overview of system ecology and basic concepts in ecology with broad topic range.",
    "The topic lectures were really fascinating. Also, having not studied ecology very much, I found the cell to leaf to landscape lectures fascinating. I also found Professor Schmitz' land ethic\/conservation\/footprint big ideas very compelling.",
    "The topic lectures and the lectures in the latter half of the course after we had acquired a foundation and could better engaged with the subjects.",
    "Learning how dynamic ecosystems are and that managing them is never so simple.",
    "I really liked the emphasis on management. Os and Pete did a great job of contextualizing the information in terms of management.I liked the topic lectures, the modeling project (which might have been more useful closer to the beginning of the course), and learning about nutrient flows.",
    "I didn't have any previous knowledge about ecology or ecosystems and the course was a great way to get introduced to the subject. The concepts we covered were interesting, relevant and practically oriented.",
    "Os and Pete were fantastic professors, and between their lectures and their discussion of their own research, class was always really fun.",
    "I thought Os and Pete did a good job lecturing and structuring the course. The modeling projects were at first daunting but overall a good experience and introduction to modeling. I really enjoyed the topic lectures and thought they were a nice alternative to regular discussion sections. Both guest lectures were good as well.",
    "The class assignments and discussions were the most fruitful part of the class.",
    "Os is a great teacher."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "The enthusiasm of the professor.",
    "Again, I sometimes felt overwhelmed by the amount of material we tried to get through in a given lecture -- I might have prepared less breadth and more depth to solidify my knowledge of the key ideas.",
    "It may be helpful to add a field trip or lab sessions.",
    "The two larger assignments could use some improvement. Things really improved when we moved into a smaller room, but before that the class atmosphere felt cold, distant, and impersonal. It was nice when the professors finally started using our names once we moved classrooms.",
    "The integration of lectures and readings. The readings, aside from those for the topic lectures, were really not helpful to students without prior knowledge. It would be very helpful to introduce some sort of textbook into the first half of the course, particularly for students without an ecology background. The co-teaching could also be better integrated - felt a bit disjointed at times. The last project using R was also not well integrated into the course though it was a useful brief introduction to the tool.",
    "I think that the pacing of the lectures sometimes felt like a sprint and since the concepts and information was complex it was hard to process all of the information at the same time that it was being delivered. For people without science backgrounds a lot of the information was over my head and it was hard to follow along.",
    "The first few lectures should be overview or introduction to the subject - to cover basic ideas and terms for people who have never had ecology or environmental science classes.",
    "I thought the first half of the course was very structured but then after the midterm it was a little confusing where everything fit and how the lectures tied together. Readings were also not assigned following the midterm and I think they should be in order to better understand the lecture material. With that said, I thought some of the readings in the first half of the semester were a little overwhelming as far as size\/length.",
    "We needed more guidance concerning the exams."

    "Ok. The TA was very available though it did not often seem that she knew exactly what the expectations of the professors were. The professors were accessible for the lake project in particular though they outside of the project context they could have encouraged us more to come to office hours and engage our own backgrounds in the course.",
    "Very good.Pete's help for the mass balance project was invaluable and I wish that I had known about the quality of the data that he had before I spent so much time trying to find information on my own.",
    "The TA was great! She was very helpful and answered any questions we asked. She was available for questions and overview sessions. She promptly answered e-mails and provided help with assignments. Overall, great job.",
    "Both the instructors and the TA were available whenever I needed help. Tara was especially helpful answering questions by e-mail and hosting workshops.",
    "Both Tara and Os\/Pete were readily available and very welcoming. Pete was very helpful in helping me scope my lake carbon budget. Tara held office hours twice a week and made herself available by appointment for projects and exam prep-she was excellent. I never went to see Os but I know he was always available and willing\/able to help as well.",

    "I am grateful for this background in ecology and want to know more.",

    "The course gave me the introduction to the environmental science aspect of my program.",

Os and Pete do a good job of covering all the bases and all the assignments are relevant and help you practically understanding the material. They also do a good job of tying everything back to management. Out of the three foundation courses I took this semester (Ecosystems and Landscapes, Physical Science, and Economics) this was the best.",
