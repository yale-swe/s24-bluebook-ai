    "I would recommend this class if you want to learn how to hear easy music in your head, or to get better at figuring out the melody \/ chords you're hearing.",
    "Musi 218 with Andrew Chung was a very effective way to do ear training. I feel much more confident in sight-singing, rhythmic and melodic dictation, etc. That said, if you've done some sight-singing and ear-training in the past, I'd recommend biting the bullet and taking 219 - even if you've never dealt with fixed-do before. In 218, the first 70% of the sight-singing examples are in C Major or A Minor; at the end you gradually transition to other keys. Granted, I feel that I have a super solid foundation in sight-singing now, but I do believe I could have survived 219 had I gone there directly. As for the keyboard lab component of this class, beware of high variations in the amount of work between sections (which are sorted by ability level). I'm a pianist so I was put in a more advanced section for keyboard lab with Prof. Stuart Duncan, even though I was absolutely new to reading figured bass. So the pace of the keyboard lab was slightly overwhelming at first. Nonetheless, I survived, and overall I'd say the workload for this course was very manageable. There's only one gripe I have about this class, but it's a major one: the textbook. I bought a hard copy for well over $100, and it was an absolute ripoff. If your instructor allows it (like Andrew did), just buy the Kindle edition and share that with a classmate. At no point in the class did I feel that having a hard copy was necessary or even beneficial. For instance, when we were doing melodic dictations, Andrew had to give us the key\/time signatures, etc, because the book failed to provide that information. The book literally had *blank staff paper* for melodic dictations. Then what's the point of buying the book as opposed to printing out blank staff paper?? Also - the book claims that it unlocks access to great online ear-training tools that you can use at home for practice. In reality, literally none of the tools on the website work (on ANY browser, on ANY computer - I tried!). Moreover, the website didn't require any access code...so even if the website did work, I wouldn't have needed the book to use the online learning tools. TL;DR: I strongly recommend the class for a basic foundation in ear training and figured bass reading. But don't buy the textbook."
