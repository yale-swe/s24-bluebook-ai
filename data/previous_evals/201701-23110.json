    "AdobeAudition, Photoshop, making GIFs\/, HTML, Twine, how to craft a story",
    "I learned a lot about the game-making process, from inception to production. I learned how to most appropriately get reviews on my work, and found the course was an excellent way to work on HTML and CSS.",
    "I think the most important skill I learned from this course is to create something you love but make sure to do so in a way that's realistic with the time you have. I also realized how critical is it to constantly review and double check your work in order to get the best result possible."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course has grown into something very cool as compared to last year but the description needs updating.",
    "Strengths: modules are clear and build upon eachother to teach you skills you will use later, each module adheres to a specialty of one of the professors Weakness: some of the modules didn't really help with the final project and the way they were structured was a little backwards sometimes",
    "It is a very generally good course. I enjoyed attending classes and having workshop time. My only complaint is that I wish I had had a better idea of the scope of the class from the very beginning. It became a serious topic of discussion mostly in the final month of the course, and changed my project's course fairly significantly. All the same, I would say the professors work well together and have a lot to offer their students.",
    "I think this seminar is a great change of pace from the usual Yale classes, and it allows students, like my classmates and I, to improve their creativity and productivity. The course requires you not only to come up with a story, but also how to translate that story in a way that is playable. The feedback and critiques from the teachers are insightful and helpful, which is one the biggest strengths of the course. I do think that the class spent too much time on non-game related features however. The first couple of weeks spending time on the HTML\/author bio pages seemed to be irrelevant compared to what the class is supposedly about; also, there are so many create-your-own websites like Wix that could have replicated the author pages in a much shorter time. Maybe another cool thing to add to the class is a week where the teachers and students dissect a well-known game, like something from Zelda or Mario, and summarize why or why not people enjoy both the story line and the game play. I think some of the students in the class were a bit lost on how to approach their game."

   "comments": [
    "YES! It is a ton of work but it amazing and fantastic. It is much more focused on the creative side of creating video games (i.e storytelling) but it is a very different way of thinking and it will teach you a bunch of small skills you didn't know you wanted or needed until then.",
    "Yes- for those interested in the gaming world, I would say this is an excellent opportunity to learn about the entire game-making process from professionals in the field.",
    "If you love video games and possibly want to become a game developer someday, I definitely recommend taking this seminar. It's not as in depth as I wished it to be, but considering the time we had, I think I learned a great deal from this class. Also, you're among students and teachers who both love the games you do, so it's a pretty fun and relaxing environment."
