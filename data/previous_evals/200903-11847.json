    "If you're taking French 130 or 140, Prof. Koundi is a great guide to the French language!",
    "Day-to-day: going over grammar exercises, discussion reading passages, making presentations on various themes including Francophone countries and the Holocaust vis-a-vis France and French history.Assignments: grammar exercises, literature readings on average every-other-day totaling about 10 pages, occasional presentation, preparation for examsTake this course if you really like French,need to do away with a language requirement, or get to an L5 course.",
    "I would say that it is a lot of work being every day, but it helps with your understanding of French.",
    "It would have been a throw away course if had not fulfilled my languagerequirement. We learned grammar and read texts and two novels. The readingswere interesting -- we read different stories from different french-speakingcountries (Quebec, Senegal, Tunisia, etc.). The second longer book about theGerman Occupation of France during World War II was especially interesting butI feel that rushed through it. No one seemed very engaged in the classes.People often did not do the reading and the professor did not seem to care."
