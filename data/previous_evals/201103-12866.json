    "Absolutely. 20 hours really isn't that much when you're doing a complex research project; you end up spending even more than that and if you like your work and the lab, it becomes one of the best parts of the year.",
    "What you get out of the research courses is what you and your PI expect and put in. That said, my PI is amazing, I love the research I'm doing, and having done full-time research this summer and about ten hours a week last semester, I don't feel like 20 hours a week is a ton. If you have a large courseload, or are taking lectures, it might be hard to find time to come into the lab. That said, if you can manage time, I highly recommend this over 485. You get a lot more substantial progress if you're in lab 20 hours a week.",
    "Take this class if you want to conduct meaningful research here. 20 hours a week is extremely manageable."
