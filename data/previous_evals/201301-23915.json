   "comments": [
    "I had hopes that the studio would be a bit more architectural, but it seemed at the end of the day that the architecture was something of a side-note, or a thing that had to be done, to the research. In a way, the studio might have been more interesting if architecture had not been involved...The studio also seemed to have bitten off a bit more than it could chew with the volume studies. Perhaps integrating the volume studies into the envelopes would have generated more interesting spatial results.",
    "The studio was expected to be an experiment in designing and calibrating the object as well as active form of our projects and these expectations were met quite well. The studio took a critical and rigorous approach to the site of the project and introduced us to problems, contradictions and issues in the downtown Las Vegas and elsewhere.It was structured in the manner of an exploratory thesis studio with a strong design as well as research component and it lived up to those expectations as well. The studio was also successful in working at multiple scales from the design of specific architectural details to working in the urban context of downtown Las Vegas to looking at potential locations and opportunities at a transnational, even global scale.",
