    "Yes.",
    "This course focused on forming and strengthening the skills and techniques of academic writing. Understanding the arguments of other scholars, analyzing the writing techniques of various authors, and creating our own academic arguments were the main focuses. Throughout the semester, the topics of the readings and assignments were all related to one overarching theme: the relationship between globalization and the environment. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially one with any interest in the environment. The course allows students from any background in writing to become experts in academic writing.",
    "ENG 114 really teaches you the skills of academic writing - something that is useful of most fields of study. In that, it is very effective and focused. The structure of the class makes it possible to have group discussions and individual assignments and this is what really stood out for me - Learning in this class was as much a personal effort as a group one. But it is only very useful to take the course if you are interested in the theme of the class and not just for the sake of taking it. All in all, the class was engaging, interesting and it equipped me with several valuable skills - constructive argumentation, close reading and writing a research paper.",
    "Good for anyone trying to write for an academic audience and even a non-academic audience.",
    "This is a must-take class for those who are interested to develop their writing and reading skills. The topics are really interesting and could not be better for those who like environmental issues.",
    "English 114 is a class that uses discussions around certain topics to teach academic writing and argument. I would highly recommend this class to other students.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student- you can improve your writing skills, get a writing credit, and really engage in provocative and meaningful studies of globalization and the environment.",
    "I am a math\/science guy who never liked or was good at writing or English and was just trying to get a writing credit done with, but this class was such a steal! It was such a great class and I am grateful that Yales distribution requirements pushed me to take. The topic of the course is Globalization and the Environment, so the class attracts some passionate environmentalists who are inspiring to be in a small class with. We also read some powerful essays that were both depressing but also motivating. It is easy to find your calling in life while taking this class. The class also will teach you some pretty simple and great writing techniques that make writing an essay feel pretty easy and formulaic. The class is also not that demanding. All of the assignments except the 8-10 page research paper do not take up much of your time. Finally, I think Garcia is a pretty lenient grader too.",
    "I would recommend it to every Yale student. The academic writing techniques learned in class can be used in almost any written assignment and will help any student with future writing assignments at Yale."
