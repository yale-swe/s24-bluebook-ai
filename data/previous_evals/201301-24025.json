    "This course was excellent! The course lectures were extremely well organized and carefully thought out. The lectures followed the recommended text book closely so that the readings really reinforced what we were learning in class. The homework assignments were long, but I greatly appreciated them in that they really helped to apply and synthesize the material we learned in class. This class has helped me make sense of all of the material I had learned in epidemiology and biostatistics courses over the past two years.",

    "Less busy work",

    "Excellent instructor for the course",
    "Excellent",
    "This course is useful and fundamental. Somehow the stuff overlaps partly with categorical data analysis.",
    "Strength: very thorough lecture notes. Weakness: actually lecture is very long and tedious.",
    "Too much work although material is helpful",
    "This course was a great way to be introduced and exposed to modeling concepts.",
    "This course provides a thorough overview of quantitive epidemiological methods. It is fast paced and complements courses like Epi 3. I would recommend PhD students take this course before Advanced Epi.",
    "This is a good course. There is a lot of material packed into a short amount of time, but I did learn a lot. The homework assignments were very long, but often did a good job of allowing me to understand the material. However, sometimes we were required to perform statistical tests by hand and it often consumed a lot of time. I understand the point of this is to understand how the tests are calculated instead of just using SAS to perform the test, but I still think sometimes it was unnecessary.",
    "Very nice overview of epi study design from biostats perspective. Paralleled nicely with other concurrent classes in epi. Great sas tips",
    "It was a good class.I would have liked to spend more time on model building, with more time on unusual or difficult situations and how to handle that, rather than more straightforward examples.",
    "Great course. You gain a solid foundation in epidemiologic methods.",
    "Very applied. Learned a lot.",
    "A useful course.But a little bit overlap with the categorical data analysis course."

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is an excellent professor. She is very familiar with the course material and has a clear, concise, and extremely well thought out and organized manner of conducting lecture. I really appreciated the effort she must have put into the lecture slides and thinking out the trajectory of the course. Maria really makes biostatistics accessible to those of us who don't have a biostats background. She is a wonderful professor and I only wish I had taken more courses with her before having to take the comprehensive exams. Bravo Maria!",

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Professor was great in explaining concepts and notes were thorough.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Extremely knowledgeable and responsive to students. Her presentations are clear and thorough - great slides!",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria's course notes are incredible. I wish every professor could make slides as clear and useful as Maria does. I learned so much. Maria is a good lecturer too, although sometimes I felt like I didn't get any more from going to the class than I would have just reading the class notes on my own.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very accessible",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She did a great job of presenting the material. The slides were awesome.The lectures were not very interactive, but that is the nature of biostatistics lectures.",

    "Good course just for the lecture notes. Not enough SAS experience, although Maria does give SAS code to look at separately. The homework is a little annoying because she wanted us to do everything by hand, rather than use SAS, so each assignment took maybe 7-10 hours.",
    "Too much work",
    "Overall this course is a lot of work, but you will get a lot out of it. I think it is best suited for those with substantial experience with SAS and advanced model building.",
    "This course was a good overview of study designs and methods for analysis of epidemiological data. Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, however, I would warn them that the material can be very similar to the Categorical Data course.",
    "Nice overview of study design with a biostats spin including sas tips",
    "In this class, you learn some statistical methods. I didn't take the first two introductory classes in biostatistics here, but it seemed like it was repeating some of what I thought would be taught in those classes.The material wasn't new to me, but this is a required class, so not much point in recommending it or not. I wouldn't recommend it if you already know the material.",

    "Very applied. Learned a lot.",
