    "I liked the diversity of speakers, not just from within Yale but also from other institutions.",
    "Some of the speakers were very engaging, but many were very dry. They did span a variety of interests, but at times it felt like the seminar series was more for the EMD faculty than the students who were required to be there. The food was great, though!",
    "It might be nice to have a bit more structure\/coherence between lectures if possible, but otherwise interesting series.",
    "Great speakers - I liked the variety in topics",
    "Some topics overlapped from each other, but overall pretty good!",
    "The seminar tried to engage students in the field of epidemiology of microbial diseases, but seemed to center a lot around vector biology and its corresponding infectious diseases. Very few guest speakers discussed infectious diseases such as HIV\/AIDS, C.difficile, etc. A greater variety of speakers would have been much more interesting and engaging.",
    "I love this seminar, as the different speakers give me an comprehensive of the hit topics in the field right now. I hope the food served in seminar could be a little bit diversed... maybe not always pizza?",
    "I like how we were exposed to many different kinds of research that professors are doing but I wished that the course was not mandatory. There were many other seminars that I had more interest in occurring at the same time but I could not make them because this course was mandatory.",
    "There was a mix of lectures; some were more interesting than others.",
    "I would love if there were more faculty from Yale who came and speak at these seminars. It's lovely to have outside faculty come, but this speaker series is a great way to meet faculty here, learn about their work, and set the groundwork for a possible mentor-mentee relationship. I understand that sometimes a really cool speaker comes by, and it is great when they get the speaker to come and talk at the EMD 525 seminar, but I still wish that there was a larger number of faculty members. Maybe it would be nice to provide a set of research questions ahead of time, for each faculty member as well. Along with the papers. I know many students don't have time to more than skim the research papers, so if the faculty member can provide a sheet with the overarching goals of the group and their main research questions (kind of like an outline to the talk) that would really help me (and hopefully other students) engage with the speaker.",
    "This class is fine; just a weekly lunch seminar where you listen to speakers talk about their work.",
    "Very interesting, diverse set of speakers that covered a wide breadth of topics.",
    "I generally enjoyed the seminar topics, and liked that they covered a whole range interests related to EMD. The speakers were often quite good. My only issue was often the lack of space in the classroom (and shortage of food!). Perhaps it would be useful for those not required to attend to submit an RSVP?"

    "Rotating speaker lunch seminars on a variety of infectious disease topics. Sit in to learn about what is going on in the field and get connections, would recommend.",
    "I would hesitantly recommend the course. Hearing about some of the projects and research regarding public health and infectious disease was interesting, but it was missing some variety.",
    "I would recommend this class, as this class give one a comprehensive idea of the field.",
    "It's a great way to start the day. We get a relevant lecture and food.",
    "Great introduction to the work being done by faculty in the EMD department and elsewhere. Almost always a lively discussion.",
    "Necessary course for EMD. It's an interesting class that brings faculty from Yale to talk about their research. The best lecture is the first lecture of the year, when they invite several YSPH faculty to speak broadly about their research for a few minutes so that students can get a sense of what work they do! Don't miss it!",
    "Just a weekly lunch seminar required for the EMD people",
    "It's a seminar course covering a variety of topics related to EMD. I would recommend it for other students, although I think only those required to take the course would actually sign up (since anyone is free to attend)."
