    "The course is well structured.",
    "A strength of this course is it's in-depth focus on reading texts with the lens of self-interest and human motivation. It is also strong in its evaluation of the ethics behind motivating people. A weakness would be that toward the end of the semester, it feels like everything new and interesting about the topic has been exhausted.",
    "I thought that the second half of the course was extremely interesting, and would have loved to hear more about recent work on rational choice and self-interest theory. The early works are necessary, but I can't help but wished they had been compressed into a few weeks fewer."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to another EP&E major. I think this course is the ideal EP&E course, as it really does hit on all three facets of the interdisciplinary major. I really enjoyed the class in that regard. It also felt DS-like in that it's a survey seminar course--just, it focuses on one lens with which to examine texts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone curious about how self-interest is deeply ingrained into society and our everyday lives."
