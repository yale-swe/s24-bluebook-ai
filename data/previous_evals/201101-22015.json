   "comments": [
    "It's awesome! No final! Much better than 205!!",
    "Take this if you have to. Otherwise, it's pretty time-intensive for just a half credit course.",
    "It's fine...probably better than PHYS 165\/166L from what I've heard from other students but the experiments go into a bit more detail.",
    "Physics 206L is a natural next step from Physics 205L. You do a series of experiments that you choose (from an available list of experiments), and after each experiment you write a report on the results of your data.I would absolutely recommend this class to those thinking about physics or engineering majors. You can cover a large number of physics principles, and the labs coincide nicely with Physics 200 which was an additional benefit.",
    "Students choose their own experiments, which are generally more fun than 205 labs. A lab report is required for every lab, which can take anywhere from 3-8 hours depending on how much effort the student wants to put in.",
    "Great course; definitely worth taking. You get to learn so much about the things that YOU are interested in and not just handpicked ones from a professor somewhere.",
    "Actually significantly more work than Phys205L. The lab reports only take one night, but will definitely take up the entire night. Do the x-ray crystallography lab, it's pretty cool and the write-up is not bad.",
    "Take it! I despised 205 and loved 206. Mitchell Underwood was a fantastic TA, so try to get him if he's TAing again.Q\/M - Fun and easy.Millikan - 6 hours of watching oil drops was a little boring, but I'm glad I did it. It's really cool to have seen visual evidence for the quantization of charge.Digital logic - Fun and easy.Op-amp - This is the one circuit lab we did. It was really hard and we only got halfway through.Superconductivity - Fun and easy.Nuclear Scattering- It was neat to see the accelerator in action, but for obvious reasons they don't let you touch the machine. If I did the course again, I might choose two other experiments.Planck's Constant - This was really interesting.",
    "Much different from 205L. The weekly lab write-ups are time- and effort-consuming, but the labs are actually pretty interesting and cool. J3 Nuclear Scattering is something else! We get to play with a 1 MeV particle accelerator, and it's fun with the operator, Larry, and everything. You have the same partner for every lab, so pick well at the beginning! Labs are designed for only one group at a time, so you're all alone in a room, so you don't feel very pressured. Being in lab is actually kind of fun.",
    "It's a class where you get to explore the practical applications of physics. I would definitely recommend it over 205.",
    "The 206 lab is ways better than 205. You are more independent, and the experiments are both more interesting and more educative than those in 205. Some of the better ones, in my opinion were, the Liquid Nitrogen, Digital Logic, and the Oil Drop Experiment. Overall, this is a great class that I recommend to physicists and pre-meds alike.",
    "You have to take it if you're a physics major, so make the best of it.",
    "MUCH better than 205. Just don't make my mistakes and start the lab reports the day before they are do, or you will be up till sunrise.",
    "Phys 206L definitely has many more interesting labs than the 166L. You get to choose the labs you want to do out of a very long list of labs, and many of them are quite interesting. Your experience will vary tremendously depending on what labs you choose - some labs are very interesting, some can be quiteboring, for some the equipment works poorly or is hard to figure out, for some it's a breeze. Talk to people who took the class before to know which to take. Depending on your TA, it is likely that your lab reports will take awhile to write up (6 hours or more per week) and you will need to be quite careful with them.",
    "In Physics 206L, you and your partner choose nine experiments to do from about 20 different options in mechanics and electricity and magnetism. The particle accelerator experiment's cool, and I'd also recommend electron diffraction, electric fields (boring but easy), and Kater's pendulum. Physics 206L is much more independent than 205L, since you're working on your own (although with a partner), and each pair of students does a different experiment each week.",
    "Data analysis for reports can take a loooooooooong time.. Get to know excel well",
    "This course is MUCH better than 205. There is ample time to finish the experiments and most of them do work. I followed a previous reviewer's advice on which labs to do, and found that it was good advice. Look back in the reviews and find that review.",
    "206 is a pretty good lab course - you get to choose the labs you want to do, and there's a pretty diverse and interesting selection. Definitely pick the superconductors and nuclear scattering lab (because they're neat), the digital logic and diffraction labs (because they're easy\/quick write ups), but avoid the Millikan oil drop lab (because it hurts your eyes to stare at a microscope for 8 hours).",
    "You're probably only considering this because it's required for your major. I must say the particle accelerator labs are really cool, though.",
    "Some really cool experiments are available; e.g. superconductivity and using the particle accelerator. The instructor and TAs are really helpful during lab. The grading is pretty chill, and you're pretty much guaranteed at least an A- if you do a thorough job on all the lab reports, but I never did figure out what it takes to get an A. Some of the lab reports are grueling. They take anywhere from 4 to 12 hours, so be sure you know how long the report takes before you start it at the last minute. The digital labs ended up being really frustrating. If you do superconductivity (which you should) be sure to bring the necessary ingredients for ice cream!",
    "not a bad lab if you need the physics lab credit. id recommend it if youre taking the corresponding lecture.",
    "More interesting than 205 although the lab reports are definitely time consuming. It will make you very comfortable with error analysis and cranking out lab reports. The experiments in general are kind of cool, although some are way more frustrating than others, and the equipment doesn't always cooperate. It is pretty cool though how much more freedom you have in terms of managing the experiment (i.e. if it isn't working, manipulate it yourself until you figure out how to compensate, or deviate from the directions if you can figure out a better way) and also writing the lab report (there's no exact formula, organize it depending on what makes sense for the experiment). It'll definitely give you more expertise in how to work in any lab that uses physics equipment.",
    "We did some very interesting experiments and got to play with some cool toys. If this stuff interests you it is a great class.",
    "Take it. The labs are substantially more interesting than 205's and the grading is fair.",
    "Take it if you have to. It doesn't really line up with the lecture at all. Many of the experiments are pretty cool, but often times there's a big gap between the knowledge from lecture and the knowledge required to perform the lab, so I wouldn't really call the classes related. Moreover, the lab handouts are sometimes confusing or outdated. But chances are you have to take this. Stephen Irons is really helpful though, so if you have to take it you'll be ok.",
    "I would not recommend this course, mostly because of the lab reports. They are tedious, unsatisfying busywork. Some of the labs are really neat. If you take the course, be sure to pick labs that interest you. This will mean skimming through the lab handouts ahead of time, which will not be fun, but which will be worth your time. And be ready to waste a lot of time writing lab reports, for which you should definitely get a full credit, not this half-credit nonsense.",
    "We did E1, E3, J3, H4, C1, J1, H1, F1 and they were fine except J3 had some confusing calculations, but you can go in for help from Larry--he is awesome.",
    "I would highly recommend this lab. This is one of the few labs at Yale that is actually worth half a credit, rather than 1.5 credits. Moreover, you get to do many awesome experiments and play with proton beams and liquid nitrogen. You also have 2 bye weeks! However, the lab write-ups can be quite time consuming (Thursdays were known as all-nighter Thursdays for me last semester). Still, the lab is just much shorter and more interesting than 205L. Again, I highly recommend this lab"
