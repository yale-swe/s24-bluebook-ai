   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course. I love Spanish and have enjoyed this course greatly.",
    "There are classes every day, there is homework each night (sometimes a lot more than other nights), and the class goes by fast.",
    "It is a great class. Everyone should take it.",
    "Spanish 130 is hard, but very doable. At the beginning the class is a lot of review and goes quite slow. By the end, the class gets a bit harder and it is expected that one is familiar with the more advanced areas of Spanish, such as pluperfect, imperfect conditional, and so on. On the other hand, professors have lots of office hours and are always available for help. I'd highly recommend this as a change in pace in your Yale schedule. Not as much studying needed as other classes, and no final. There is a final oral but it is quite easy and graded high.",
    "A good class, not too hard but you'll definitely learn. Sonia Valle, in particular, is an amazing professor and I would definitely recommend trying to get into her section!"
