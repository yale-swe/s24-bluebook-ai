   "comments": [
    "I came to Yale illiterate in Chinese. While I was conversationally comfortable with spoken Chinese, unlike the majority of my L3 heritage classmates, I never learned to read or write a single hanzi character or even the pinyin alphabet. I am now leaving first semester with the ability to read hanzi paragraphs and textbook lessons by myself. I can also write increasingly difficult essays with little to no assistance.",
    "We learned an incredible amount of Chinese in the short span of a few months -- roughly 500 characters of writing and many more through recognition. Liu Laoshi was also very good about teaching the usage context of each vocabulary and grammar element she taught so that by the end of the class, I felt like I could use develop my own voice through essay-writing and tell real stories rather than simply answering a prompt. Speaking with my parents, they were very impressed by how fluent and \"Chinese-sounding\" or authentic my essays and speaking skills sounded, which is higher than any compliment I could give the class!",
    "Improved my Chinese reading, writing, and speaking",
    "My speaking, writing, and reading abilities all greatly improved. Going into the class, I had not known how to write\/recognize a single Chinese character besides my name and a few other characters; being in CHNS 132 with Liu Laoshi helped develop all my skills immensely.",
    "Learned a lot of characters and various grammar structures",
    "Strengthened reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills. The material was broken up into manageable pieces, but it was crazy to reflect on how much we learned in the class. I definitely learned how to speak Chinese more naturally and built up confidence in using old and new vocabulary and grammar structures.",
    "I learned so much about Chinese from the language, to the culture and history! And I enriched my personal understanding of the language much more. I'm so grateful I got to take this class with Liu Laoshi (Prof Fan Liu). We learned so many characters but at a pace that felt fair and scaled gradually.",
    "My skills in reading and writing Chinese greatly improved, as well as my knowledge of grammar structures.",
    "Increased my Chinese speaking, reading, and writing fluency",
    "Before taking this class, I wasn't even able to write my own name in Chinese characters. Now I've learned how to write my own name and much, much more. Liu Laoshi's ability to teach and educate the class was significant in learning hundreds of Chinese characters and grammar structures. I am more confident in speaking, reading, and writing, and thanks to this course.",
    "Learned a lot of Chinese characters and grammar structures."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Heritage students come from very different backgrounds and experience with the language. Sometimes this fosters imposter syndrome as it feels like some people are ostensibly excelling beyond you simply because they have certain skills. Just remember that because someone can speak with better tones than you or read faster than you doesn't mean you are not the right fit for this course! Everyone starts from a different place but learns so much and catches up so fast.",
    "The workload at the beginning of the semester was very strenuous, especially for someone who is very unfamiliar with writing, reading, and speaking Chinese. Once I got through the first few weeks of learning basic patterns and adjusting to the pace, it was much easier to get through the daily quizzes and finish the assignments, but I still have a lot of difficulty remembering characters or phrases because of how quickly the class moves. We had many opportunities to formally write and present in Chinese and to speak to our classmates about different cultural issues. However, I found that there wasn't as much time to speak naturally to my classmates in Chinese, as for the most part we were reviewing the text with the instructor or else working on our own pieces outside of class.",
    "Wish class time was more devoted to speaking. I struggle most with speaking and feel that I can learn grammar\/read the text on my own.",
    "strengths: the small class size and the professor greatly contributed to me developing meaning relationships with those around me, while at the same time learning A TON OF chinese weaknesses: the course can feel extremely fast at times, especially if you go into it knowing little to no chinese; this being said, teaching it this way did improve my chinese at a much faster rate",
    "Great course taught at a great speed.",
    "Strengths: a great class, great community, Liu Laoshi is an amazing teacher. The course is also structured really well, with nothing really unpredictable in terms of the schedule. Weaknesses: pace of the class increased dramatically halfway through the semester",
    "Strengths - the class is structured great, the homework is enriching, and the oral presentations are great. The daily quizzes are a ton of work to study for but help you internalize the material. Weaknesses - not much. The multiple choice on the finals\/exams were really hard. It would be nice to have more homework that practices that kind of skill and identification. Also, it's helpful to have the course calendar ahead of time, instead of just 1-2 weeks in advance, for those who like to prepare their studying calendars ahead of time.",
    "A strength of this course is that it really forces students to learn a great amount of Chinese in a very short time frame. A weakness is that sometimes the course workload can be heavy and intimidating (there is a quiz every day, and on Fridays we either have an oral presentation\/essay due, or a midterm).",
    "It was at a fast, challenging pace that is needed for learning Chinese if you really want to work towards becoming fluent and using Chinese. I believe it could focus more on speaking in real life situations, and move away from the demanding writing skills.",
    "Liu laoshi is a great teacher and always brought a positive, enthusiastic attitude to the class everyday. I liked how she went over the lessons using many kinds of examples. The daily quizzes and homework were good to make sure I was keeping up with the content."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Certainly. I want to learn Chinese for communication reasons that are both practical, professional and personal. Yale's Chinese program is thorough and rigorous. It provides incredible opportunities for study abroad if pursued in that manner. Even if not, the heritage community is really one of a kind. The teachers are loving in addition to providers of clear and consistent feedback. Every student has mandated weekly personal tutor sessions to target their individual needs. Yes, yes, yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in quickly increasing their Chinese abilities, but I would warn them of the course's difficult pace. The first few weeks were difficult because we were adjusting to writing and reading in Chinese, in addition to cleaning up basic pinyin, and the latter half of the course was difficult because we were learning all the words in the textbook and quizzing every day. If you're willing to hang in there and put in the extra effort to engage with the language, I would say go for it. The instructor is phenomenal, there's a lot of support between mandatory tutoring sessions and our instructor's openness, and the class comradery made presentations and conversations very memorable.",
    "Yes! Great way to improve your Chinese :)",
    "Take it! I went into the year knowing absolutely no written\/formal Chinese, but now feel as confident as ever to express myself both vocally and on paper. Liu Laoshi is an awesome teacher and the active nature of the class everyday contributed to me interacting and making friends with my classmates.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this to any heritage speaker that wants to build up their knowledge of characters.",
    "This is one of the most challenging, time-consuming courses you'll take (I think) but it was worth it. Take it with Liu Laoshi if you can! She is a true gem, so hilarious in class, so passionate, and also understanding and accommodating. I would have gone through all that exhausting work, again, in a heartbeat.",
    "Yes definitely for anyone who is willing to commit their time to improve their Chinese",
    "If they are interested in working towards learning Chinese, yes",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student who has had a background in Chinese through speaking at home and some knowledge of reading and writing. I came into the course without knowing a single character, and it was very obvious that I was unprepared for the rigor of the course. Anyone who is readily prepared for this course will benefit greatly.",
    "Yes, definitely if you want to improve your Chinese.",
    "Yes! It's well paced and challenging but manageable"
