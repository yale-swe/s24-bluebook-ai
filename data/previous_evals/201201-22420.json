    "I would verymuch recommend this class. It's a small class (around 30 perhaps), which is always refreshing for a student who's used to taking 100+ person science courses here at Yale. It's pretty conceptual, so while you do have to memorize a lot of information, it's not as much as in Cell Biology, for instance. The concepts are what make science so great, so I'm glad the professors in this class pushed for conceptual understanding. If you're struggling, utilize the TAs! Clinton was so helpful! He's TAed this class in the past, so I hope -- for the sake of all you future MCDB 290 students -- that he continues to teach it. He really knows his stuff.",
    "This class covers a lot of fascinating topics and is small enough to be an interactive lecture. Professor Jacobs-Wagner is absolutely outstanding, Professor Bascon-Slack is OK, and the TAs were fabulous. The first midterm was rough, but the second half of the class wasless intense. Take it if you want a fun elective!",
    "It's definitely a class worth taking, even if you're not a bio major. If you think you may be interested in the material, you should check it out. It does get a bit difficult at times, but it's very rewarding!",
    "Yes. Good upper level bio course.",
    "Take it. It's pretty chill and not a lot of work from day to day. The material is interesting and you learn a lot about microbes. Pretty practical stuff too.",
    "Excellent course. No problem sets, just 2 tests + midterm and a few quizzes. Your job is just to learn the material. I found the quizzes actually helped me to study for the midterm. I thought all of the tests were very fair. Both Prof. Bascom-Slack and Prof. Wagner lectured very clearly. The TAs were excellent and very approachable. One of the best science lectures I have ever taken.",
    "Great class, interesting, but not a lot of work. Both professors are great. The curve can be harsh at times because of all the pre-meds but I still enjoyed it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in microbiology.",
    "I would recommend it; it was a solid course. Kind of memorization based but you can't complain about that too much in a biology class I suppose.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student interested in microbio, both teachers were excellent",
    "good bio class not outstanding",
    "Great class. Really interesting if you're interested in medicine or public health. The beginning is all about the basics of bacteria but then you get into specific diseases, what's required for pathogenicity, and the immune system."
