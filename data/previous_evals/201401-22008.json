    "I would recommend this class to an undergraduate only if you are very enthusiastic about Chinese painting of the 17th century and prepared to devote a lot of time in class (expect more than the listed 1 hour and 50 minutes) and lot of time reading the assigned texts every week. Otherwise, I would advise a more basic introductory lecture."
