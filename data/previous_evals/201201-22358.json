    "Incredible. If you are fortunate to get into the class with Jeanine - TAKE IT. I cannot think of a class I've taken at Yale that changed me more. The class is equally about cultivating your own voice as a composer and learning to convey ideas about music honestly and clearly. It can be a lot of work (a song a week) but the great thing about the constant output is that you learn to stop being a perfectionist and write fluently in first drafts. Can't say enough great things about this course. Take it.",
    "Jeanine was an amazing teacher. I left this class having truly felt that my personal voice as a composer was stronger and that I had grown in my strengths.",
    "Take this class if you are serious about composition. It is a huge challenge and time commitment, but it is one of the most useful and special classes you will take at Yale.",
    "MUSI 314 is an advanced level composition seminar for musical theater songwriters. I would absolutely recommend MUSI 314 to another student, but only someone committed to composition as a vocation - not as a hobby - because the course requires a lot of time and commitment, and above all, passion."
