    "TAKE ZULU!!!! Its an unbelievably fun language that very few people in this country have the opportunity to learn. Professor Sanneh is one of the nicest teachers you will have at Yale, and she makes learning Zulu fun and easy.",
    "Great class. Take it and allow yourself to be immersed into the Zulu culture.",
    "Yes definitely.",
    "Doable workload, good pace of class.",
    "A fun way to learn an intimidatingly complex language. Strongly recommend if you're interested in South Africa and\/or looking to try something new; thanks to a dedicated and understanding professor, the course remains relaxed even in its more rigorous and productive moments.",
    "Very cool and different from any class I have ever taken. Take it if you want something new."
