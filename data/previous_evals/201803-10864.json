   "comments": [
    "I learned a basic understanding in many principals in of Microeconomics.",
    "Having never taken any economics, I learned the basics of microeconomics (supply and demand, production and labor, etc...). Nothing mind-blowing, but it was mostly interesting and useful information!",
    "Thought more critically about economic concepts",
    "By taking this course, I developed various skills, such as time management, cooperation with others, people skills, perseverance, and effective study habits.",
    "I developed a lot of new skills in this course. I gained insight into microeconomics and how the supply and demand work within the economy. I learned how to find where resources should be allocated within a market, for individuals, and for firms.",
    "Although most of the learning was done outside of the classroom (ex. reading the textbook, working on the p-set with friends and the help of the TA), I was happy to learn about the underlying structure of the microeconomic concepts instead of merely memorizing how to solve certain problems. That way, I felt far more equipped to understand the multitude of economic firms and situations that arose in the class.",
    "In depth understanding of beginning microeconomics and a greater sense of future direction of studies.",
    "A lot of theory regarding the foundation of Microeconomics and a simplification of some of the more complex ideas in the subject.",
    "Through this course I learned basic economic ideas and applications like supply and demand, consumer theory, costs, etc.",
    "I think i developed study skills and a greater understanding of what concepts affect economic decision making.",
    "I definitely learned a good amount about microeconomics.",
    "We learned about Productions and Costs, Consumer Choice, the different types of business models. It was very math heavy with lots of graphs but very simple math. We learned about how the individual consumer makes decisions, both rational and irrational, and how businesses function.",
    "I learned essential concepts in the foundation of microeconomics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Not enough emphasis placed on working out economics mathematical principals. Problem sets are too challenging. I wish there were more smaller scale assignments\/opportunities to work out the complex mathematics required of this course. It seems that lectures teach concepts behind how math compares to economic models but very little time here is spent physically working through the math which can be confusing!",
    "Strengths: seminar style is biggest strength, easy-to-understand material, minimal workload (but this is also a weakness b\/c if you mess one thing up that weighs a lot) Weaknesses: Prof Simons is not the most interesting lecturer so no one really shows up to class and it's super easy to zone out (I was one of very few who was there every single day). The curve that she grades on also is pretty confusing and unclear.",
    "Main weakness is the curve. Its awful and so talented students dont get grades they deserve. They should have more dicussion, like what should be expected in a seminar.",
    "This course effectively taught the concepts of microeconomics. Rather than relying on rote memorization, this course really emphasized the understanding of concepts. Additionally, the course offered many opportunities to discuss concepts with classmates and engage with them. I think the course can be improved by allowing more opportunities to participate in class.",
    "I really enjoyed the course and thought the P-sets led on well from what we had been studying in class. I also really enjoyed the Buzz group activities that were throughout each class which allowed us to work out problems with other students.",
    "Strengths: The subject matter is important and fascinating (if understood properly). However, it is challenging: if you fall behind one day, it is easy to get swept up and eventually unable to understand future concepts entirely. Weaknesses: The class was taught by basically having the textbook read to us. Having the course be far more problem-solving instead of staring at graphs without proper context would probably enhance the experience.",
    "Strengths: Enough depth to keep things interesting Weakness: Could be paced differently",
    "strengths: psets were helpful weaknesses: didnt feel supported in my learning",
    "I think a strength would be the availability of the professor and graders for help if necessary. A weakness would be the information not covered in class in the textbooks and on exams",
    "The second half of the course moves very fast and there's really too much material. Something needs to be taken out, since we cover something like 10 chapters in 6 weeks.",
    "The smaller class format allowed for us to go at a slower pace and enabled us to be more engaged in general than a large lecture format. The psets were fairly straightforward and office hours were extremely helpful. Professor Simons definitely knows what she is teaching, but lectures were sometimes dry.",
    "The TAs in the course were very helpful and the class was well organized. More detailed slides would have been helpful."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who had already taken and introductory economics course in their high school career. I heard a sentiments expressed the other day, \"don't take Econ. unless you've already taken it in HS since the intro courses are so horrendous here. It's really to bad that the intro classes being so terrible turn off a whole subset of students.\" This is a problem.",
    "Pretty undecided - I loved the seminar style. I took this class just to see if I wanted to major in econ, figured why not check it out, and I'm pretty glad I did, learned the basics. Definitely not the most mind-blowing, riveting class though (not even close!)",
    "No, take the lecture",
    "It depends on how interested you are. Certainly you must take it if you need it for Econ, Global Affairs, etc, and know that ones grade is determined by 8 short problem sets, a midterm, and the final. TA office hours help very much on the problem sets, and getting to them usually wasnt an issue. However, the lecture style was somewhat dry, though it could have been just the subject matter, since the professor made vast efforts to connect to the class. I stopped going to the lectures because I understood the subject matter better from the book than from the book and the lectures, but if youre the type to ask a lot of questions in class, definitely go to class and take the seminar, not the lecture. I also learned a lot about microeconomics and its applications, so if youre interested, take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I can confidently say that I understood concepts, rather than memorized them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it is very engaging and gives you a deeper insight into the economy from a micro point of view. The class is good and allows you to ask questions and engage with other students as well.",
    "It is a great way to see if economics is for you and is necessary for everyone who plans to engage in the field in the future.",
    "Yes I would. This was a great introduction to Econ.",
    "Yes, even if they have placed out of the intro micro sequence.",
    "If you're interested in econ, this is a good class. The seminar is nice because people can ask questions.",
    "The workload is not bad at all, the tests are reasonable, and the smaller class format is definitely much better and more conducive to learning than the larger lecture format I would say. If you're interested in Economics and possibly pursuing it as a major, you might want to take it, but it is not a class for everyone.",
    "Yes. I learned essential concepts in economics.",
    "If you are taking this course you are most likely interested in economics. I would recommend this course mainly because it is required in order to take more advanced economics courses."
