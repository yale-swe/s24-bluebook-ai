    "This is an excellent course that covers a wide range of content and encourages students to engage in in-depth discussions. The readings were comprehensive but often burdensome to complete within a one week time frame when balancing this course with other student responsibilities. I attempted to keep up with all of the readings because I found them interesting and worthwhile to read; however, by the end of the semester, I found myself forced to prioritize the major articles and only skim the rest of the content. A slightly more streamlined reading list throughout the semester may help prevent some of this semester-end burnout. That said, nothing immediately comes to mind in terms of what should be cut out! Everything we discussed was very helpful to me in my current and future work.",
    "This is a truly fantastic course! Though there is a lot of reading, I came out of this class (as I have done with a prior class with Shelley) feeling like I had learned as much as I had from five other classes. In addition to the truly amazing instructor (discussed further on the next question), this class also brought together students from a range of disciplines, which resulted in some extremely interesting discussions.",
    "Absolutely loved this class. Heavy reading.",
    "This class is fantastic and I learned a tremendous amount.",
    "The course was an amazing opportunity to learn about the different facets of health disparities and also discuss with like and differently-minded students, understanding the different manifestations and complications with properly assessing and managing disparities.",
    "There are a lot of readings assigned every week and sometimes it can be difficult to get through all of them. However, they are worthwhile and as a whole very interesting. The final paper was an especially fulfilling experience; I felt the class gave me a strong background that prepared me well and allowed me to approach my project from a new perspective. I also appreciated the diversity of final projects. I felt I learned a lot from my peers during our weeks of final presentations. I wasn't entirely convinced by the student-led discussions every week. Some weeks were more interesting than others (when the students had a particular relevant background to share with the class). Other weeks felt weaker and may have been better if led by Shelley.",
    "Overall, I think two words encapsulate this course: rewarding and demanding. This course was definitely rewarding. I looked forward to every single class because I knew that the discussion was going to be lively, interesting, and thoughtful. I think the success of the class was owed to the fact that: (1) the relatively small class was comprised of thoughtful and diverse students, (2) the content of the class was provocative and relevant, and (3) the class had a fairly loose structure where students could drive the discussion where they thought they needed it to go (which I think also speaks positively to the significant amount of trust that Professor Geballe places in her students as leaders of their own education). However, it's important to note that the course was also quite demanding. Namely, the weekly reading is substantial. While the articles aren't long or especially dense, completing 20-25 different articles per week requires a good amount of time. The sheer volume of articles also made it more challenging to synthesize thoughts and comments in the weekly reading reflections (which I otherwise thought was a really useful way to prepare students for class discussions). The peer review process for the final paper also required a good deal of time. I'd estimate that I spent at least an hour per paper reading my classmates' papers and providing them with feedback. This is a great course and I think it could be strengthened moving forward with two small changes. First, I think the weekly reading could be better streamlined. The weekly topics are on point but I don't think it's necessary to read several articles on the same sub-topic--unless they really are there to provide contrasting points of view. More streamlined weekly reading assignments would help students to dig deeper into the articles, and I think it's likely the case that many of the nuances that would come up in additional assigned articles would instead naturally emerge in those conversations. Second, I think the peer review process for the final paper could be restructured so that students are part of \"peer review groups,\" where they review and receive feedback in small groups organized by topic. In this way, students can continue to get thorough, written feedback from peers but it is both a more useful (because they are getting feedback from others who are also interested in the same topic) and efficient (because they are not having to give feedback to everyone in the class) process. Restructuring the peer review process in this way might also have the added benefit of helping students with similar interests to build long-term connections with each other."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is very knowledgeable and clearly invested in her students. While students are required to lead the weekly class discussions, Shelley provides appropriate guidance and support both during preparation for the class discussion and during the class itself. She allows students to explore their ideas in a safe and open environment, jumping in when necessary to provide additional information or an alternative point of view. She also spends a lot of time supporting students in the final project -- she met with everyone at the start of the semester to discuss their personal interests and potential paper topics. She also provided detailed and helpful feedback on early drafts of the final course paper. She clearly devotes a lot of time and energy towards making this an engaging and thought-provoking course. Students easily perceive this, and devote a lot of energy and commit to the readings\/discussions in exchange.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is one of the most thoughtful, intelligent, and well-connected professors I've ever met. She really enjoys teaching and it shows in her preparations of course material, engagement with students, and feedback on assignments. She demands a lot from her students but she also gives a lot back through her own efforts and that is appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0First, I want to say that I personally cannot think of a more amazing instructor, and I don't think my comments here will begin to do her justice. Shelley cares deeply about the topic of health disparities, and it shows during the class in both the activities she creates and in the comments she makes. Additionally, I don't think I have ever had a professor who seems to put as much work or thought into a class, whether it is preparing handouts, activities, or giving the class books she thinks would be of interest to us. Finally, Shelley cares deeply about her students. Whether it is providing encouragement, reviewing assignments, etc., Shelley will go out of her way to make sure her students succeed. I am so thankful to have had her as a professor!",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0She's wonderful-- so knowledgeable and accomplished, and she cares so much about her students.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is one of the best instructors I have ever had and she is such a gem at YSPH!",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is by far one of the best professors I have had at Yale. It is so clear how deeply she cares about her students and that makes all the difference. I truly appreciate the time and effort she puts forth. I feel extremely fortunate to have been able to take her class!",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0I have never seen an instructor invest more in his or her students, best I have ever had",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is an absolutely fantastic professor - the best one I've had at my time at YSPH. She assigned readings that deepened my understanding of the topic and sparked interesting conversation and discussion in class. Her dedication and passion for this topic is so apparent, and it definitely adds extra motivation to performing well in the class.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is a wonderful professor and is the most dedicated faculty member I have had at Yale. She works just as hard as her students to prepare for class and to ensure that we are reading a wide range of material on each topic. She truly cares about her students and cultivates a wonderful community in the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley was an amazing professor, allowing us to learn in a comfortable environment but also offering up the flexibility enough to allow our opinions, our points of view, and even our own ignorance to come forward and learn from her, the other students, ourselves, and the works we read from.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley did a wonderful job teaching this class. The readings were always well-cultivated and cohesive. She was always very responsive to questions and concerns and gave us wonderful feedback. It was very clear from the first session that she was very invested in the students and the class, making for a more fulfilling experience all around. I felt pushed to do my best work because of the bar she set for us.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Professor Geballe is among the most supportive and dedicated instructors I've met at Yale. What I appreciated most is her genuine interest in students and their academic and personal development. She went out of her way to connect with students both in and out of the classroom, scheduling one-on-one meetings and coordinating class dinners. I also appreciated her ability in fostering a supportive peer learning environment where students trusted each other and relied on one another's expertise. In addition, I appreciated her knowledge and experience in advocacy. She often shared ways in which students could get involved in local issues, which was helpful and affirming given the complexity of issues we were tackling in class."

   "comments": [
    "Be sure to take this class it combines relevant readings with creative class conversation.",
    "This course uses in-depth readings and discussions to provide insight and encourage understanding regarding a wide range of upstream determinants of health. While a heavy workload, I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in health disparities. I feel I have come away from this course with a much richer understanding of health disparities and social determinants of health, and am eager to apply this knowledge to my future work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course (and any other course you can take with Shelley)!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course! The class involved a fair amount of work, in terms of reading and writing, but it is definitely worth it. I also appreciate how much feedback Shelley gives on our draft papers. She takes a lot of time to go through each student's paper and it really helps when writing our final drafts.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! Health disparities, health equity, and upstream social determinants of health are things that every public health professional should have a strong understanding and grasp of. You will not regret it.",
    "This is the best class I have taken at Yale and Shelley is the most passionate professor I've had. There is a lot of reading for the class but most of the material is incredibly interesting. The class is unlike any other I've had at YSPH because it entirely focuses on the root causes of disease and disparity.",
    "The course offers a near-comprehensive look into health disparities from a public health framework. It offers both an informative view as well as an opportunity to discuss and understand through group learning throughout the semester. It was an excellent course and a welcoming environment, fostered and crafted well by a dedicated and caring professor.",
    "This is a survey course on health disparities as well as the social determinants of health. I would highly recommend to another student; even if some of the subject matter seems apparent at first, the readings Shelley chooses are very insightful and you will come away every week with new insights. The final project is also a great opportunity for you to explore in-depth a topic of particular interest to you as well as to get great feedback from Shelley and your classmates.",
    "Overall, I thought that this was a great course and I would recommend it to another student. The course provides a comprehensive overview of the various kinds of health disparities in the U.S. with a lot of different opportunities to engage with the content. Because of the demanding nature of the course, I would recommend that students take the course when they are not also balancing a full schedule (4+ courses)."
