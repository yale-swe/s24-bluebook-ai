    "Its the required thesis seminar. Great overall for building community in the major, but it could use a little more structure so students are not as confused throughout the year.",
    "The colloquium is great because you'll want as much feedback on your thesis as possible. My advice is to really take it seriously and take advantage of everyone in the room so that your thesis is as well-written as possible. It would be a shame not to utilize your peers & professor along the way."
