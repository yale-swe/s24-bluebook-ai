    "I would definitely recommend this class. I have never taken a film class and so have felt nervous to take a class that tests on films, but this was a very good combination of different material and good literature so I learned a lot but students have the option to choose what they write about for the papers so there is flexibility.",
    "I would recommend this to other students. The syllabus is great.",
    "This is a great class. The structure lets you enjoy every reading and Professor Clark is wonderful."
