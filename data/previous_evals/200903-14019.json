   "comments": [
    "Great, a good survey course",
    "Good material, interesting lectures, good assignments. Not too heavy work load",
    "Strengths: variety of topics covered was interestingWeaknesses: too much focus on cancer and not enough on other disease outcomes, need to list Epi I as a prerequisite!",
    "strength: This course was arranged very well and covered a wide range of topics which were under debate in the public. Besides, I do like writing critiques as homeworks\/tests in this course, which benefited me a lot in reading through literatures. Overall, I enjoyed this course a lot.",
    "Good foundation of environmental epidemiology.",
    "Tong's goal for this class is to get you to think critically about environmental epidemiology studies, and he does that effectively. The class is extremely low maintenance - no reading, 5 article critiques (including the midterm and final). With all of the guest lectures, this class sometimes felt like a second EHS seminar. I took the class concurrently with Epi 1 and had no problems with it.",
    "Very great class, Dr. Zheng clarified many epi topics and a understanding way. Focused on many articles and learned how to critically read them.",
    "strengths - covered objectives welli feel like i have a better handle of critically reading scientific papersweaknesses - the guest lecturers were too detailed and i tended to get very bored listening to them (the only exception was the lecture on circadian rhythms)we didn't get a lecture on indoor air pollution like the syllabus said",
    "Great class. I learned a lot, and it actually really helped with the principles of epidemiology class a great deal. I feel like I understand a lot more about environmental epidemiology, and environmental health in general.",
    "Strengths of the course: you examine current environmental epidemiological studies that are interesting and the guest speakers are working on some interesting topics (i.e. cancer registry, benzene exposure)Weaknesses:The beginning of the course reviews basic epidemiology,but the presenation of the information is very disconnected and confusing."
