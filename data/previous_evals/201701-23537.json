    "I think this is a fantastic class. I really appreciated that the professor explained at the end the breakdown of acquired skillsets through the semester: theory, ecological modeling, and excel optimization skills. That said, this is the hardest class I've maybe ever taken. I had taken only a sample of the prerequisites, and I spent a lot of the semester struggling to stay afloat. Problem sets took many days of concerted effort to solve, and the take home tests were pretty brutal. But grades were on a curve, and he maintained a strong motivation to keep pushing and learning. I wish every class pushed me this hard, but I'm also afraid I'd go crazy if every class was this intense. More FES students need this kind of experience, in my opinion, but that's said from someone who takes a profound pleasure in getting his ass kicked in school. Everyone who graduates with an MEM should know this much with Excel, at least."

    "Excel skills, sustainability theory.",
    "The course was very hands on - the problem sets and final group assignment gave us an opportunity to process data and use different softwares (R, Excel, etc.). We thus had a chance to explore what being a researcher in natural resource economics feels like.",
    "This class gave me a great and very applicable understanding of bioeconomic modelling, but it also allowed me to improve my overall intuition regarding models: how they are developed, where they may be making critical assumptions, etc. The models used in fisheries management, for example, have always been somewhat of a black box for me, but this class gave a very thorough explanation for how these models are derived and how biological and economic factors interact when policymakers are making decisions. Out of all my classes this semester, I think this class provided me with the most useful knowledge for my desired career. I feel much more capable working in fisheries, especially on the policy side, after taking Nature as Capital. I'd highly recommend this class to any other students interested in hands-on natural resource management, from timber to fisheries."

    "I think there's a lot more about tying this class to actual policy that could be done - but I appreciate that that would take away from other instruction time, and that's a tradeoff that Eli probably isn't willing to make. Generally I trust his judgement on this.",
    "A bit more structure for the course would help - such as the goal and topic for each class in a clearly-outlined syllabus.",
    "No major improvements to recommend. The course materials were very helpful and the problem sets provided great practice of the equations and processes we learned in class."

   "comments": [
    "I needed way more practice time with excel. I strongly recommend next year that the TA leads a breakout session each week in the computer lab, in addition to normal office hours. That would have made sitting down to approach the problem sets way less painful, and would have driven a different method of learning, which I think would be helpful. Eli is super smart, but he also has a very specific approach to lecturing - communication is done primarily through numbers and equations. There's so many novel ideas and techniques in this class that it would be helpful to break that up with TA time.",

    "This is a crucial class. I'm going to SOM next year and I am put in very good standing with the Excel skills.",
    "The course gives me a good understanding of natural resource economics, one sub-field in environmental economics.",
    "For (the very few) students at FES interested in fisheries management, this class fills an important gap in FES's ocean-focused courses by providing quantitative training in the biological and economic dynamics that structure fisheries. It also describes some of the major tensions in fisheries management between managing for biological sustainability and managing for economic efficiency. For me, Nature as Capital was an excellent complement to other courses I'd taken at FES, like Coastal Governance and Coastal Ecosystems. I'd urge any student interested in fisheries to take this course--I think it's essential for understanding how fisheries are managed in the US."

Nature as Capital seemed like it would offer a more rigorous take on natural resource management. I was also motivated to take this class after taking Applied Math for Environmental Science in the fall, which I really enjoyed."

    "This was harder and more abstract than I thought. But I also ended up liking that the most. At the beginning I thought we were going to get into the policy and practice side of it more, but I found that I didn't miss it by the end.",
    "I learnt many useful skills in terms of software use and data processing. I also learnt the core concepts in natural resource economics.",
    "Absolutely. I learned a ton in this class, and while I'm by no means an expert modeler when it comes to natural resources, I feel like I have a very solid foundation for tackling resource management problems in a professional setting. I also feel like this class prepared me to take more classes focused on bioeconomic in the future."

    "It took a couple of months for me to realize that we needed to be working on the problem sets in groups. The last couple of sets were super hard and I appreciated the emotional support. It also helped me realize that people were in the class for a lot of different reasons.",
    "I learnt a lot from my groupmate and had the opportunity to discuss conceptual questions about class material.",
    "Working on a modelling project in a group forced us to grapple with the difficulties associated with developing models \"from scratch:\" sourcing data, setting parameters, and testing different model frameworks. The examples we worked through in class and in the problem sets were all challenging, but for the most part they were already set up and parameterized--our only task was to make them work properly and articulate our understanding of what they produced. Working on an independent project put the hardest part of the modelling process (developing parameters, weighing various assumptions, and making judgement calls when data is limited) in our hands and forced us to figure it out. Overall the independent group project was a really helpful experience, and a good accompaniment to the work we did in class & in problem sets.",
    "I could not have completed this course without support from my classmates. There was a general consensus that we did our best learning as a group discussing the problem sets."

    "Be prepared to work hard in the course.",
    "Take it! You will be glad you did. The material is super interesting. The problem sets are challenging, but both Eli and the TA are very helpful and make themselves available to students who have questions. Don't underestimate the work you have to put into the course--it's hard to catch back up if you miss class or if you leave a problem set for the last minute. That said, the class is totally worth the hard work and you will absolutely leave with a stronger understanding of optimization, modelling, and (most importantly) a lot of the theory touched on in other FES courses like Environmental Econ.",
    "It is certainly the most challenging course I've taken at FES, but also probably the most rewarding. Find a good group to work on the problem sets together. Be willing to put in the time and get ready for exciting break-throughs."
