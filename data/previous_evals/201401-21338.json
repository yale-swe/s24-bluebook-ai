    "Good class, you probably have to take it anyway. Similar difficulty to intro to naval science, similar workload. You will learn the basics of Navigation and have some fun doing it while disliking all of the assignments and exams.",

    "Navigation. All students who are taking this course will be required to take it, so I highly recommend it.",

    "A hands-on class teaching one to navigate. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the subject.",
