   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend the class to everyone. Although some bits may be challenging, you end up with so much knowledge as well as practice in fiction, poetry and drama. I enjoyed every bit of this class, and the professors are often phenomenal.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I really enjoyed this class--a lot more than I thought I would, as I didn't think I would like poetry or drama. This class is, as almost every other eval says, a good intro into the different types of creative writing. Just by writing a lot, I think I've improved, but Prof. Choi's comments were also really useful. One thing I do wish was that I had workshopped a different piece, but as workshop dates are decided at the beginning of the semester, before anything's actually written, nothing that can be done about that.",
    "If you are interested in creative writing, take this course. It will expose you to the strengths and limitations of three genres (poetry, short story, and drama) and give you the skills needed to confidently attempt each one.",
    "An introduction to the styles and skills present in fiction, poetry, and drama.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with any level of interest in creative writing. It's a great survey of fiction, drama, and poetry. However, each unit does not get much time, so if your interest in one unit far outweighs your interest in the other two, you should find a different class that will dedicate more than a couple weeks to your preferred material.",
    "An amazing class for anyone interested in creative writing. Susan Choi is an absolute joy -- I've never had a professor with such insightful comments on my work. This class will really make you improve your writing: take it!"
