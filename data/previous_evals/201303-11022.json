    "your standard research for credit class",
    "PRofessor Garen seems like a very chill person and runs the course in a very hands-off manner, which is nice because it gives you a lot of freedom but not if you want more guidance. If you want to meet with him you need to seek him out yourself; he doesn't really give much feedback on anything.",
    "This is a great course to take to get first-hand experience at doing research, from performing experiments, to presenting your data, to writing a research paper. It made me realize whether or not research is something I want to do in the future, and that in itself makes the course worth it. The course is structured with a short plan of research statement paragraph during shopping period, a 4-5 page research proposal about a month into the semester, a 12-15 minute presentation in front of your PI and lab groups, and a 12-15 page research paper (at ~3,500 words). It would be interesting to see what other people in the course are doing.Alan Garen is pretty chill. There isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much interaction between the student and the instructor in charge unless you personally reach out to him, which I suggest doing.",
    "Do it! You learn so much more by doing research than in an academic lab class",
    "Pretty standard lab for credit. Pick your lab carefully. You'll spend more than 10 hours a week.",
    "Really depends on the PI of the lab you choose. But overall research for credit is a great learning experience and great way to get credit for doing something that really interests you. Outside of the lab, the only work is really the final paper, but 10 hours a week is a lot of time to contribute.",
    "If you're doing research and can't get paid or need elective credit, this is a pretty low-stress way of getting something you're probably doing anyway.",
    "Perfect if you want to continue research. Probably not enough time to get a whole project done but excellent for following up summer work.",
    "The workload depends entirely on the lab and project you choose. Some students are in lab for ten hours or less. I and others were in lab for 20+ hours a week sometimes. Don't worry about the paper at the end; you will have accumulated enough data (even if it is negative data) to write something informative.",
    "Yes.",
    "It's research for credit! Easy! You just need to write a final paper and give a short presentation--skills you need for becoming a scientist.",
    "Do you like working in your lab and want credit for what you would be doing normally? Yay research for credit. lab lab lab lab, but for credit!",
    "Research. For credit.",
    "If you have the skills to conduct research, do it! The opportunities for discovery open at Yale are awesome.",
    "It's just research in the lab of your choice, so it is what you make it. It's low key and low stress so it's a great class to take.",
    "Research for credit, pretty self-explanatory. Just make sure you know when the deadlines are because they don't really tell you.",
    "If you already have some research experience, then definitely do research for credit.",
    "It's research. if you're going to be doing it anyway, might as well get credit.",
    "The course is exactly as advertised. Make sure you like who you're working with because it's a huge time commitment.",
    "DO RESEARCH. It's the best part of MB&B.",
    "Yes! Definitely depends on your lab and what is expected of you, but try working in a lab for a semester and then doing this course since it will allow you to dive directly into your projects and get results. It's also a benefit to be comfortable with your lab!",
    "If you're considering doing research anyway, take this. It'll give you credit for the work you'd do anyway.Just make sure you actually do the work.",
    "If you have a lab you really like there is no reason not to take this class. You will end up spending way more than 10 hours per week in lab but it is worth it.",
    "Yes, especially if you're interested in research."
