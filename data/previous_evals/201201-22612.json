   "comments": [
    "It's a great class! Professor Basu is engaging and a wonderful person to talk to. The psets are fun and I looked forward to attending class all the time!!! Take This Class!",
    "I would recommend it if a student wanted an SC or QR for non majors, but didn't want to take the easy way out with a lower astro class. If a student wanted to go beyond the surface of surveying many topics, this is a good class to take.",
    "DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Seriously, you will regret it and be miserable forthe entire semester. It's not so much the class itself that's the problem as it is the professor, Sarbani Basu. I'm sure she does good research but she is a TERRIBLE TEACHER: most of her powerpoint are straight notes from the textbook, she is always backpedaling because she makes a lot of mistakes (which she then tries, unsuccessfully, to correct), her style is dry\/disinterested, and most of all, she doesn't give a damn about teaching students the material. She takes off point for the most arbitrary things (and also in really unfair ways, e.g. she will take off full credit for a problem even if you have half a page of work). She's also super difficult to work with and not approachable at all. Honestly, she is one of the worst teachers I've ever had in my entire life. If you are at all interested in astro, do yourself a favor and take Galaxies and Cosmology in the fall - it's a great course, the professor is super smart, and you will actually learn something. This class will make you hate astronomy...and also life.",
    "Great class. Take it. You'll learn a lot about fascinating things.",
    "Astro 210 is definitely a course for someone interested in pursuing astronomy further; it's not interesting enough to take it for its own value. Only take it if you want to take more interesting, higher-level courses.",
    "If you have more than a passing interest in Astronomy, I recommend it. It goes more in-depth than ASTR 120, and the problem sets\/tests are reasonable enough to pull off a good grade.However, if you're a non-astronomy major, I'm not so sure. Sometimes, the lectures would go straight over my head and I found myself stuck, waiting for class to be over. The class is not that difficult, but it's hard to keep interest if you're not legitimately passionate about these topics.",
    "wouldn't recommend it really. better QRs to take.",
    "You learn lots of cool things about space, stars, etc. If you're interested in the material, this is great. Otherwise it might be hard to stay awake through lectures.",
    "Astronomy 210 is appropriate for students who have a good background in physics. As long as you have that, you will do perfectly fine. Keeping up with the problem sets is required, and tests are not as important. I highly recommend this class for someone who would like to get a feel for astronomy.",
    "If you are interested in astronomy and want an easy science credit, this is a good class. Not much work, easy maths. 2 midterms that are easy - final paper is only 10 pages.",
    "I would reccomened this class over one of the basic math courses at Yale if you want to get a QR credit. It is fairly easy, although the problem sets can be tricky. The tests and final paper, however, were not too bad. It can be tedious and a bit uninteresting sometimes, but overall I am glad I took it. Professor Basu was adorable and I know now slightly more than the average person about stars and their evolution (and black holes).",
    "At the begining you might wonder how this class has anything to do with stars and their evolution, until further on you realize you need those earlier topics to fully understand stellar evolution. Overall this was a fantastic class, and I highly recommend to anyone considering majoring in astronomy, but don't want to take a highly work-intensive astronomy class to find out.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who needs a science credit and has not had a strong math\/physics background. Otherwise you will find this class pretty boring.",
    "1 pset every other week. Tests are fair. Paper is on topic you choose. Material is interesting.",
    "It was a good course, and more relevant and interesting than I thought initially, although not too dynamic. The fact that there was no curve was annoying at times too, if you forgot to do an assignment or something. Overall, it was a good deviation from ordinary science classes I was taking for pre-med, and I recommend it. Professor Basu is great, and very enthusiastic about her subject."
