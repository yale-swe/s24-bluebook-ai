    "I learned how to approach critical texts through the para rice of interdisciplinary art. It was unlike any course I have ever taken and I would recommend it to any student in the humanities.",
    "With this course, we developed many valuable skills in our own practice, both practical and personal. Professor Harris made it a point to take advantage of the DMCA for all of its resources, and had many staff members visit our class to show us how to use the studio, the printing room, etc. Additionally, Professor Harris helped develop our practice through a critique-based portion of the class dealing with our own artwork.",
    "Abstracting problem solving around systemic issues that characterize marginalized groups within concepts and constructs such as race or gender. Clear arguments posed for and within groups with practical mediation, empowerment and understanding through artistic and imaginative narrative making and rooted in ideas of personal and historic visual memoir."

   "comments": [
    "Great class. Amazing professor.",
    "Texts and films were engaging. Class projects could have undergone more intense criticism.",
    "The course is long. LONG. A four hour seminar with an addition two hour (or sometimes longer!) Sunday night screening every week is not to be taken lightly. However, Professor Harris is very supportive. It would have been nice if he had been a little more critical of our work, but besides that, it's a wonderful course. I learned so much.",
    "The reading in the class was so important and relevant and I think our level of engagement with non-academic and academic texts and films was incredible. Because we had four hours each time we met, our conversations had no limit. At times, however, four hours seemed like they could have better been spread out through two meeting days a week.",
    "Strengths: Professor Harris is a working artist whose reputation precedes him. His critiques are strong and constructive. He has a gift with being able to support his students and draw one into the assignments in a very personal way. Reading for the class is well thought out. Professor Harris is accessible. Though he could easily hide behind his work, he does not. The course seems to wrap itself around the class conforming to the needs of the group\/individuals in an organic way that doesnt stray from course objectives and maintaining a standard of excellence along the way. Weaknesses: This was a first run for the course. Problems were minimal and are what would be expected with minor logistical issues easily overlooked. The course is demanding. A number of students found that they needed to drop the course as it was more than they could handle. I believe professor Harris was very clear about this. Perhaps it could be made more understood in the syllabus, though I cannot find any fault or discrepancy in it myself."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone serious in pursuing a semester long project they are invested in, and anyone interested in engaging with important texts.",
    "For students interested in the arts this course will help them to locate their voice. Its a risk-taking environment with the necessary support to encourage students to step out. I strongly recommend that it be offered again."
