   "comments": [
    "Yes! Take this course! You do not need a background in anthropology to take it and it is a great course with academic challenges but still practical applications. Also Professor Brotherton is GREAT!",
    "Definitely take this course if you're interested in medicine or anthropology!",
    "Topics in Medical Anthro was an awesome class that I would highly recommend to anthro majors, pre-meds, and anyone interesting in global health. The books are great and the weekly reading load is very manageable. You don't have to be an anthro major or even have taken an anthro class before to succeed in this class.Professor Brotherton is incredible. He is a kind, non-intimidating professor who cares deeply about his students. He always acknowledges what students say in class while at the same time pushing us to dig deeper into the material. He is very approachable and everyone in my class had the same reaction (\"wow he is so cool!\") after meeting with him one-on-one.In sum, TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Topics in Medical Anthropology was a WONDERFUL course! It's a small seminar (for us, there were only 7 students, which was very nice) and we usually go over a book over two weeks with a supplementary reading each week. Everyone gets a chance to present on material once and lead the discussion, and in addition to weekly reading responses there is one final paper which gives you a chance to explore whatever you want. Beyond the pretty ideal course mechanics, though, Professor Brotherton is extremely wonderful-- he's friendly and brilliant, which makes for one of the best seminar environments I've ever experienced. I definitely recommend it!!",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone interested in medical anthropology, it is so helpful and engaging.",
    "I highly recommend the class for anyone seriously interested in Medical Anthropology, or at least the intersection between humanities and science. This class seems very appropriate for any pre-med, humanities or science major. The workload is reasonable and all of the books are very interesting."
