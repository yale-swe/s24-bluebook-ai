   "comments": [
    "Not really, if you have other options. You can read Arendt on your own time and get what you need. I took it because it fit into my schedule and I failed to get into superior seminars, so if you have other options, take them.",
    "Arendt is definitely worth reading, and this class is a well structured overview of her work. Discussion sometimes lagged, but it was primarily because it was a small class with a lot of relatively unmotivated seniors.",
    "A class that overviews most of Arendt's most well known work. I would wholeheartedly recommend.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in Arendt and willing to right a full research paper based primarily on outside sources.",
    "I think that this course needs a few years to mature, but go ahead if you feel as though you can satisfy the written demands of this course.",
    "PLSC 339 provides a rewarding, in-depth investigation into the thought of Hannah Arendt. As someone who is interested in the material and the broader philosophical discourse to which she contributes, I am glad to have had the opportunity to take the course. However, students should be motivated and prepared to spend an entire semester with only one thinker, as the material can become a bit monotonous at times. Nonetheless, it provides an interested student a good opportunity to study the material in-depth."
