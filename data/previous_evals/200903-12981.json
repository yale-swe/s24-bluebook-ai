    "This course is an elective, and I think for international students it shouldbe taken in second year because it concerns lots of readings on environmental and philosophical issues.",
    "This course was not a requirement, but a useful seminar nonetheless.",
    "N\/A \u0096 Elective: This course worked well in compliment with the second year\u0092sfocus on a complete building with critical integration of environmental strategies. It is essential to have a mix of MArch I second and third year students as well as MArch II and MED candidates to incite a mixed high level of discussion. I also appreciated having a sculpture student enrolled and the comments of two forestry student double majors and think this cross-disciplinary seminar should be encouraged.",

   "comments": [
    "The issue is very broadly presented as well as deeply explored. The course kept to its schedule and brought us to a profound stage of its core argument. The assignments, in terms of required readings, are quite hard, but necessary.",
    "The material presented was fantastic - much of it relevant, some of it useless, and some just curiously out of place - which I believe to be wonderful in wading through this topic. I think the course changed focus from an outside look at sustainability (in the FES sense) to more a study of relationships between agents in the environment. I believe it was a well conceived and executed seminar and would be curious about it's next stage of evolution.",
    "This course is desperately needed in the School of Architecture. It allows thinking of the environment in ways and methods that are found in other architecture school but do not have an outlet at Yale.The course was excellently structured - as far as being the testing ground for how a course like this could work. The attempt to have class discussion boards was great, however faulty simply by lack of participation. The readings were excellent as well. Discussions were in-depth and provoking.",
    "I understand and enjoyed that this course was a work in progress. I think that the subject material is of great use to me as an architecture student and I am happy that someone in the faculty at SOA is brave enough to tackle the issues of architectuere theory and the environment in a serious and scholarly manner (with a sprinkling of irony and good humor).",
    "As a new course, the material was in the process of being ironed out. Ariane cultivated a very healthy attitude of student interaction with weekly readings to integrate outside material and information relevant to class discussion. The readings were sometimes difficult to relate to the broader scope of the course. But once the semester was complete I felt, the course offered a broad and useful insight into contemporary theories of environmental discourse.",
    "The course was very well structured overall with an engaging set of readings. We talked in the course about which weeks were less effective. Personally, my top choice would be to eliminate the animal natures segment. I think that these adjustments are right in a pioneering seminar exploring these overlaps. The course fills an understudied role of looking at theories of architecture and the environment.The structure of postings and responses through classes v2 was a very effective idea. This could be pushed further as we now understand this online resource and the opportunities it holds. It allowed for me to understand the reading better after my first pass and start thinking critically in reaction to other people\u0092s questions and responses. This would be an effective tool for the discussion in the required theory courses as well. If used from the start I think all participants should be held to responding on at least one of the articles. Sometimes it was hard to respond to all the writings and focusing toward one that interests you could help in pre-discussion thinking and greater grounding points in the discussion.",
    "I was really impressed with the syllabus and reading list because this is a new course. The theoretical underpinnings Ariane presented as background for a new, contemporary way of looking to \"humanism,\" \"post-humanism\" and the \"environment,\" was very thorough and thought provoking."

   "comments": [
    "My expectations are more technical \"environmental\", but it's been exploring the more fundamental basis of the issue, which is even better than what I expected.",
    "I honestly wasn't sure to expect, but working with Ariane in the past has always been very productive so I knew it would turn out well whatever the course turned out to be.",
    "My expectations were definitely met. Hoping to find material that was both philosophically grounded within and without contemporary architectural theory and projects, I found this course very exciting.",
    "well met. i think the course readings really fell short in the area fo landscape, both familiarity with theory as well as current projects and their relevance for both environmental and architectural discourse.",
    "At the beginning, the course was a bit of a question mark. I believed it to be attempting to address the application and development of sustainable theory. I found some of the course problematic, as could not always understand the relevance of some readings. But in the end I really enjoyed the whole product of the semester.",
    "My expectations were to be challenged in current theoretical discourse and explore intersections between ideas of sustainability and the environment. These were exceeded through very engaging discussions every week in the course which always challenged me too look deeper and critically examine each text given, as well as extend these to outside projects and topics that the profession is currently struggling with.",
    "My expectations for the course were to better understand the thinking about the environment through history but how it applies to today and to design work. My expectations were met."

   "comments": [
    "It's been a great course, it's my first seminar course and it really helped me on thinking systematically about environmental issues.",
    "Some components seem to be incredibly relevant, others a bit less, and others just seem to be elephants in the room. I personally enjoy this when covering material because it allows a base to compare things against (both good and bad).",
    "quite valuable.",
    "I found myself skeptical of much of the courses topics and discussions. Sometimes feeling frustrated and wishing the presented material was more focused on environmental issues or practical duplications of the theory. But in the end, thinking back on the library of information that I have become so interested in, I have realized that the course has been very helpful in formulating my opinions of sustainability and the built environment.",
    "I decided to take this course because of the ability to work, once again, with professor Lourie-Harrison. Her passion for teaching and immense knowledge in a diverse number of subjects is astounding. She is always available to assist with our endeavors, and because of this, I truly believe in her pursuits. The subject matter of this course plays an important pedagogical role in the sequence of our education, as it discovers ways of approaching contemporary discourse in an interesting theoretical manner.",
    "This course aligned with my interests and was very valuable in the development of a personal research agenda critical to the current discourse of sustainability and the developing networked culture.",
    "This course was very valuable to me because the subject is of special interest to me and it seemed to be that to everyone in the seminar. The discussions were always very thought provoking."

   "comments": [
    "Ariane is one of the best instructor I've ever met. She's intelligent, charming, very clear on what she's talking about, and able to manage the topics in an overall integration while keep every parts' subtle and detailed uniqueness. Our TA is also responsible and helpful.",
    "Ariane is one of our best professors at the school and is very committed to the course and to students interests. Occasionally she lost everyone along the path but always has the ability to get everyone back on board. It is always enjoyable taking courses with her, although as always I wish at Yale we had more time to focus on seminars because I think the material developed here is highly important and relevant.",
    "Ariane is an excellent teacher with a breadth of knowledge on this subject. Her excitement about the subject matter comes through in every class and discussion. She is available, encouraging, and engaged with the class.",
    "Ariane presented challenging and diverse topics for investigation. She often admitted that she was experimenting, or after reading an article another time, realized she should have used another. This loose character of the seminar was both good and bad. The positive was that the material was not set. Ariane expected weekly contributions to online discussions. Her gift as a teacher made this feel less like an obligation, and more like opportunity to direct the course in new ways. Although, as a group we were left wanting more conclusion to our deliberations, the course managed to be fulfilling in the end. Ariane is an asset to the school, able to captivate students with a diverse set of expectations of such a course. For two years, I have appreciated this about her teaching style.",
    "The Instructor was very effective in leading the discussions and always posed engaging questions which kept the seminar active.The TA was on time with posting the readings, sending updates, and utilizing classes v2 as a resource. Overall this course was very well run and incredibly valuable.",
    "Ariane presented new projects and connected them to important written works very effectively. She also has an incredible ability to \"diagram\" which really helps in understanding complex theoretical ideas. The TA was always on top of things. Also, I want to add the discussion page on V2 was very useful!"

   "comments": [
    "It's already been very good. I wish this course can be expanded to a lecture class so that more people can take it.",
    "As this course was a first run for Ariane in incorporating these theories into a class structure, I feel like this course could use a refinement of the syllabus' focus. It is evident that it is intended to rethink the master narratives of architecture we inherent in design studios and contemporary theory, but these narratives are never brought to the table. Perhaps they don't need to be, and perhaps there is not enough time to take this on, but this course is intended to help develop operable theories and understanding how the intrenched theories operate might help.Finally, I would have liked further development of the philosophical canons that the theoriest rely upon. I am not sure this could be brought into the class through readings, but perhaps through discussion. It was achieved at times, through Latour, Derrida, and others, but sometimes it felt like the texts were not read as closely as is required.",
    "The course should remain experimental, and peer driven",
    "My main suggestion would be to change the time of this course. The Thursday 11:30 slot always conflicted with studio both in production the night before and final preparations just before. This course deserves a better spot so that it can produce great discussion and development of projects.",
    "I think this is one of those courses that will obviously just get better by having been taught before - it was very exploratory in many ways so the teaching couldn't be \"tried and true.\" I guess my suggestion would be to try and build off of the work we did and maybe try to summarize the discussions on V2 to build from to get further."
