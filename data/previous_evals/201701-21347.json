    "The grading scale made it harder to get an A compared to normal percentage letter conversions, but easier to get a C instead of a D by percentGes, more clarification on what we should change between paper drafts would be appreciated as well, it's frustrating to receive no comments on a particular section of a rough draft and then get marked down for not changing it in the final draft. I liked when we had class outside and daily checkins.",
    "One strength was that we were able to do multiple revisions on our papers so we were able to learn from our mistakes and gain feedback from many people. Another strength was that the small class size enabled us to have good discussions were everyone could contribute. One weakness was that we would start reading articles for the next paper before finishing and turning in the previous paper.",
    "I like that the class size is so small, it gives everyone a chance to speak and learn from one another."

    "Yes",
    "This is a fun class and the readings are interesting. I learned to improve my writing and focus on the details. I also learned how to effectively articulate my thoughts and express them on paper.",
    "Yes, I was able to expand my ideas on beauty and social conceptions and work on my writing skills at the same time."
