    "Really fun, but you must rely on your own self-drive to do well",
    "If you can get in, definitely. This class is great.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Simply because it's so much fun to listen to Lapadula and to read all the great scrips produced by masters and your fellow classmates.",
    "If you can get in that means you're a film studies major or super lucky. Not really worth taking unless you're super serious about writing screenplays. It takes a ton of self-discipline to be constantly working on your screenplay when there are only two due dates ever. If you know you will wait until the last minute, don't even bother taking it--you won't get anything out of it.",
    "If you are interested in Screenwriting take it! It is phenomenal, and intensive. It will either develop you to move on to the next level or convince you that this is not the direction you want to go.",
    "Yes I would recommend screenwriting. It is a great course to understand how to begin.",
    "highly recommended. you learn a lot in a really fun way. even though seminar is 2 hours long, you don't ever get bored.",
    "Its an intro course to writing screenplays.",
    "Take it if you know nothing about screenwriting!",
    "Take this class if you're interested in writing. Pretty simple concept. I can't say that this is a better alternative than a play writing class in terms of becoming a better writer but you will improve regardless. Lapadula is crazy. Not sure if he's the best teacher but he is eccentric.",
