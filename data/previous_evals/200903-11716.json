    "Definitely. Take more if you have an interesting project to work with. Start early. I started in my lab after my freshman year and now I am just continuing working in the lab while getting credit. Always ask questions and for help when you need it though.",
    "This is where you actually get to do what you've been training to, and where the learning really starts! Take it early and often.",
    "Yes if you have an advisor in mind that you think will be fun to work with.",
    "Do it!",
    "For physics majors, this is a requirement, but not one that would should dislike. It provides a good introduction to research in physics if one has not already acquired it elsewhere, and allows one to explore a given topic in much more depth than might be possible otherwise.",
    "Absolutely--everyone should at least try research.",
    "Yes.",
    "Sean Barrett is the man. You have to work in lab but the requirements for the course in terms of writing and presenting is low stress.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in independent research and has time (10 hours a week) to devote to it. I would recommend taking the course when Professor Barrett is running it, because he is very flexible."
