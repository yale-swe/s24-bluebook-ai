   "comments": [
    "I learned quite a lot about Russian culture. My background in Russian history was OK, so I can't say I learned a lot on this front, but the books and articles assigned as readings were all very interesting (I don't think I would have read the text of Khruschev's Secret Speech or Chadaaev's Philosophical Letter otherwise!)",
    "I got a much greater appreciation for the complexity of Russian culture- as someone growing up in the US, much of Russian history was completely passed over in overview courses, so it was great to learn more to be better able to understand the country.",
    "I learned a great deal of modern Russian history in such a detailed and interesting way",
    "tons",
    "I learned a significant amount about Russian history and culture and how they affected one another. I learned how to connect the pieces of history from centuries ago to modern day and I learned how to look at literature in the light of history and how to connect them through that.",
    "I learned a lot about Russia both from a historical and cultural perspective, while also developing skills in cultural analysis.",
    "This course gave me a broad understanding of the history of Russia from the era of Peter the Great in the 1600s to the fall of the USSR. Additionally, it wove in bits of information about Russian music, painting, and film, which was a nice way to gain a different perspective of the historical trends. Overall, the course was a great introduction to Russian history.",
    "The class exposes you thoroughly to Russian history and matches such history with novels, films, and art. Overall, the class seemed more history than culture focused, and you takeaway a great deal about how Russian developed over the centuries.",
    "I developed a much greater understanding of the people and government of both Russia and the other regions that made up the former USSR. It was tremendously helpful in helping to bridge the gap in perception on how the West views Russia and how Russia views the West.",
    "I learned more about how Russia's history and culture have interacted and shaped the progression up until today.",
    "This course provided a great overview to Russian culture and was perfect as a survey course. I really liked how the professors combined the historical and cultural aspects."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's a very good course overall. It balances well culture and history, and at times in even blends the two quite effectively. The readings are great, and the instructors both gave captivating lectures. The major drawback of the course is that, because of its sheer scope, major topics were treated rather superficially. As Professor Bushkovitch said, you can't really explain the revolution or Stalinism in 50 minutes, but what can you do? The instructors did their best given the limitations of a semester-long course on such a heavy topic.",
    "The material was really interesting but sometimes lectures were a little dry. I liked that they switched off from history to culture lectures! I also liked that you could choose between a final exam and a final paper.",
    "This course is exceedingly interesting, and packs a lot of information into a short time, as should be done in an intro course. Although I loved having it joint-taught, I sometimes felt that the two professors did not integrate their lectures particularly well, in that it was not always clear where their contributions fell within a larger picture of the course.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is how interesting it is. The biggest weakness is that it's fairly disorganized. The tag-team style that the two professors did is fun and it works to a certain degree, but it makes it hard to follow things in a linear matter. Also individual lectures often were too fast and tried to pack in too much material.",
    "The first half was a very thorough look at history. The second was mostly cultural exploration. There needs to be a better balance of each",
    "a little dull",
    "This class was really strong and engaging for me and i'm not sure how it could be improved.",
    "The course could go faster at the beginning in order to take more time with the end.",
    "The strengths of this course are twofold: First, I really liked how the history book accompanied the history lectures and served as a strong base for the class. Second, I feel that the different lectures on culture, such as on Russian writers, painters, musicians, and film makers really enhanced my understanding of the broader history. Strengths aside, it would have been helpful to have a handout for each lecture with a list of key names and events. Often, it was very easy to get lost in the professors' lectures because they could become quite scattered with many tangents, which made discussions a bit muddy when it came time for section.",
    "The strengths were great teaching by both professors and the fact that each lecture was very clear in its purpose and content. The only weakness was that I thought it covered 20th century Russia too quickly, especially after Stalin.",
    "Without a doubt the primary strengths of the course was the tremendous knowledge of the subject matter by the professors and the teaching fellow. I felt truly grateful studying under all three, and thought they did an excellent job relating an immense about of information of Russian history and culture to many present day situations. The choice of course reading material to show both the artistic, social, government and military aspects of Russian life worked well to coalesce to give a very well rounded picture of Russian history and culture. Only suggestion I have for improvement would be to offer more courses in Russian history and culture at Yale. This course opened the door to so many other interesting topics that I would enjoy studying in much greater depth. For example, Russian art and history in relation to medium of media propaganda by government both domestically and internationally; or a study of the relationship between Russia and the world from both a historical and present day perspective.",
    "Overall it gave a very good introduction to Russian history and culture since about the 17th century. I liked the format of alternating professors because I felt that it gave us a chance to really explore both sides of the course. Sometimes I felt that the course didn't go deep enough into the topics or didn't provide enough explanation for certain terms\/events, assuming that the students knew more than they did."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It's hard to teach 300 years of Russian history and culture in 12 weeks, but I think that the instructors did their best to give us a glimpse of how Russia has changed in the past centuries and how it has come to be what it is today. The workload is manageable (two fair exams), and the readings are absolutely fascinating.",
    "Yes for sure.",
    "I would highly recommend this course- it is fascinating, and the integration of novels into a history class makes it somewhat more approachable and easier to interact with the material. It is, however, an awful lot of reading, and the course is much improved by completing the reading (as one would assume) so one should approach this course knowing that it will be time consuming even if the physical workload (papers, tests) is not as extreme.",
    "It's a fun class that's not too hard. It's a good Credit\/D\/Fail class.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Bushkovitch is a very good professor",
    "maybe",
    "Yes i would recommend this class to anyone interested in history or Russia or Europe in general.",
    "Absolutely would recommend to anyone interested in Russia.",
    "If you are interested in gaining a broad understanding of Russian history from the era of Peter the Great to the fall of the Soviet Union, this is an excellent course for you. Professor MacKay's lectures wove in a useful dose of culture, specifically about Russian writers, painters, musicians, and film makers. Sometimes he gave out handouts with the names and concepts covered in lecture, which was helpful. However, other times his lectures were a bit hard to follow and he went on many tangents. Professor Bushkovitch's lectures followed along with his Russian history book, and always packed in a lot of info. He is not the most charismatic individual, but he knows his stuff. The grade for the course is broken into section participation, a midterm exams consisting of 1 essay, and, either a 10-12 page final paper or a final exam consisting of 1 essay and 6 IDs. There's a ton of material to study, but, overall, it's manageable.",
    "I would recommend, especially for those interested in the history aspect of the course (and most explicitly pre WW2 history).",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to not only students interested in Russia, but also to any student interested in pursuing a career in international relations. It will be absolutely essential to factor in the response and effects of other major powers, specifically China and Russia in any foreign policy decision within our globalized world. You will ind no better class to improve your understanding of Russia and the former USSR than this one. The professors and course materials are excellent, you will be exposed to mediums of art, political and historical documents, biographies, all of which will work to offer you a very informative and enjoyable learning experience.",
    "Definitely - if you are interested in Russian history and culture, this course provides a great overview without being too basic. I found the readings - especially the novels - very interesting, and the lectures were very interesting.",
    "It's a fabulous course and well taught; it's not easy, but it's worth it.",
    "A great overview and introduction to Russian history and culture. There were not many assignments other than reading so it is important to make sure you take the time to complete the reading assignments."
