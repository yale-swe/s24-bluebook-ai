    "A lot of reading--as in, a LOT of reading. That said, if you do do the reading, you'll get a lot out of the course. Not every text was my favorite--in fact, the reading list is overwhelmingly straight-white-male, which can get a little dull--but still, a good set of works to get exposure to.",
    "Take it! The books are books you should definitely read if you want to be any sort of informed and educated human being. Cornelius is a good teacher you'll participate a lot and never feel too intimidated to speak!",
    "It's an interesting course if you're interested with classical epics",
    "Very good class. A lot of reading, and Ulysses seems rushed, but you should definitely take it if you're interested in a broad overview of literature.",
    "Take it and take it with Cornelius. These texts are \"classics\" for a reason and whether and its just important to read them in your life. Reading is a lot, but well spread so it is totally manageable! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale - Cornelius leads wonderful discussions and is brilliant."
