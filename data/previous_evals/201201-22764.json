    "A distinctly liberal viewpoint on American history during this time - often focusing on labor issues, but also giving a pretty broad background. This is an interesting, and definitely valid point of view, just be open to a biased instruction of this time period.",
    "This class is a great introduction to several different aspects of urban history \u0097 each class takes on a different topic, set in a particular city at a particular time, and the time period changes from the 1850's to the modern day over the course of the semester. So our very first class was about black women in Atlanta during Reconstruction, and our last class was about natural disasters and Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005. Along the way we read about the War on Poverty, the way certain cities boomed during World War II, how the urban geography of the city changed, suburbanization in the 20th century, etc. It's a lot of reading and a lot of writing, and there is a 20-25 page research paper at the end, but it's really rewarding. I would recommend it.",
    "I recommend this class. The reading list is excellent. Second, it is one of the best writing credit classes I have taken because Klein gives very detailed comments on all of the assignments. There is a clear process which makes the term paper more manageable. It is a ton of work. I didn't believe the reviews and took five classes this semester which was a lot. The reading load is a book a week plus closeto 40 pages of writing during the semester. It is worth it, just know what you are getting yourself into.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The readings are excellent. Professor Klein is extremely sharp. You'll learn a lot about the social, political, and economic histories of American cities. Definitely only take it if you're willing to make it your top priority for the semester. You'll want to do all the reading and spend time thinking about and writing the reading responses and final paper.",
    "This is not a class for the light-hearted or the lazy. This class will take up a majority of your semester, and you will have to work hard to keep up with reading, response essays, film screenings, and of course the all-important research paper. However, it is the sort of work that you will emerge from holding a strong final product and a great deal of historical and historiographical knowledge. Take this class if you want to learn, if you want to be a better student and writer of history. I always advise my friends to take classes based more on the professor than on the syllabus. In this case, both are exemplary -- Professor Klein is the kind of professor worth taking a class for. So do it."
