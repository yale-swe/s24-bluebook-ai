    "This is a great language class. Although third semester was much more of a grind than first year, the readings were interesting and honestly you get whatever you put in. If you work hard and memorize vocabulary, your Farsi will get a lot better, if you drift by and only do enough to get along, you can do well, but you will not get any closer to fluency. Not very different from first year in terms of structure and grading.",
