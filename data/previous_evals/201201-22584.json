    "I went into this course thinking that I wouldn't enjoy it. I wasn't sold on the course description, but it's a required class for the major. In the end I feel like I got a lot out of this class and J.D. Connor is a great person to teach it. He keeps things interesting and fast moving and I feel like taking this class has affected the way in which I've approached film in my other classes.",
    "I would never recommend this class unless you have to take it. Which you will probably.",
    "Yes do this if you're interested in film.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. Especially for Film Studies students who wish to graduate.",
    "Please take this course if you want to do justice to the circumstances that create cinema. JD has a lot to teach about film itself, but also about being a salient thinker.",
    "I would recommend this course. While the formal analyses can sometimes be frustrating, especially if you aren't immediately \"sold\" on a particular point of analysis, you come to see just how important they are. It's an indispensable course for deepening your knowledge of film.",
    "Yes, take it absolutely.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're already sure you're interested in films. If you're not, there are definitely better ways to survey film than this class. If you are, this class provides a great toolbox of different ways to think about film analysis.",
    "This course will teach you how to more closely analyze the minutiae of films. I would definitely recommend it, as Professor Connor is a lot of fun to work with and the material is great."
