    "Great course overall but learning curve is a bit steep if you have never been exposed to American literature. Grading is harsh too!",
    "American Novel is a great class to take, with a decent work load that is never overwhelming. The pace of books can be quick, with one book a week, but they tend to be manageable lengths, and longer books are read for a longer time. The work load is primarily the 3 papers, which are spaced across the semester and are all no more than 5-6 pages. As a second semester senior taking this class Credit\/D for a fun extra class, I would highly recommend.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to anyone who likes to read, even if you have yet to take a literature class at Yale. The syllabus consists of truly amazing works, and each of these novels is something you'll want to read. In fact, most weeks I couldn't put my book down and prioritized reading over everything else, because it was so much fun and so interesting. That being said, don't expect lecture to be as engaging throughout the semester as it is during shopping period, and don't expect section discussions to be fully satisfying. You'll get the most out of this class if you enjoy the reading process, put thought into your papers, and get to know your TF through office hours. Of course it is a lot of reading every week, so if you worry about keeping up, take this credit\/D and just have fun reading the books you like most!",
    "American Novel is a great course in which to read all of the great modern works of American literature that you wish you'd already read. Hungerford is a dynamic and engaging lecturer, and the lectures themselves always addressed the themes of the books at a very high level. The reading isn't light, but you'll find that you look forward to readings (almost) all of the works assigned. Definitely recommend if you're looking for an English lectureit's the best one I've taken.",
    "Pretty enjoyable class with a lot of reading, three papers, and a final. The reading list is mostly great (Blood Meridian, Fun Home, Oscar Wao), with a few exceptions (Lost in the Funhouse, The Warrior Woman), and Professor Hungerford delivers lucid, well-planned lectures that really do a great job of laying the groundwork for a understanding of the individual texts as well as the larger arc of the American novel.",
    "Although the class is very interesting and the reading list is great, I would just warn people that it is A LOT of work. A LOT. Although not all necessary work, there is also a final exam (in addition to three papers), which is frankly annoying.",
    "It's fun to have homework that's just reading fun novels to break up your course load, however there is a lot of reading. Only take this course if you think you have time to read a whole novel a week. The class isn't worth it if you don't put in the time needed. You get a lot out of it if you read what you're supposed to have read by the time of lecture, otherwise you really get nothing out of the class. The class was a mixed bag - everyone loves some novels, and hates others. Thus, some lectures are very interesting and some are not so much. Overall though, I'd recommend taking this course for someone who think it would be fun to push themselves to read more fiction.",
    "I chose to take this course because of the amazing reviews but I found that it was rather overrated. It often felt like arguments were forced to fit novels and sometimes unclear. I think we could have gotten more out of Prof. Hungerford's brilliance and the reading list if there had not been a predetermined narrative of \"the american novel since 1945\" that each novel was forced into.",
    "There is a great selection of books in this class, spanning the latter half of the twentieth century and a few from the twenty-first. (That being said, it is very likely there will be one or two you can't stand--but the variety makes up for that.) You'll be reading one each week, writing two medium papers and one non-standard paper at the end of the semester. I'd recommend this class, because there are so many formats\/styles\/backgrounds in the various novels of this course that everyone should get a taste of.",
    "It's a decent amount of reading but I still highly recommend it.",
    "If you enjoy English, take the class!",
    "Amazing class, but take it Credit\/D, especially if you're not an English major!!! I loved the class and how it made me read some amazing books, but the grading on the essays was tough and even when I went in to get feedback from the TA and followed it, I couldn't raise my grade. The final exam was also pretty tough. It's definitely a class worth taking because the lectures are wonderful and you do learn a lot about each book, but it's not worth hurting your GPA over it because the class does nothing to guide your writing or analysis skills if you're a bit rusty in English-style writing.",
    "I wouldn't take this class. Professor Hungerford doesn't bring much to the books. The syllabus is boring at best and pretty clear tokenism at worse. Given the strength of Yale's English Department, I would recommend taking a class with someone else and not AMST 261. The class was one of the weakest humanities classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "If you're looking for an easy last class with awesome books, this works. Having an exam is no fun so take note of that.",
    "This is a great course for English majors and non-majors alike. You read some really good books and Hungerford is an interesting, engaging lecturer.",
    "This was a great overview of important novels. Highly recommended for both English and non-English majors alike.",
    "Take it for the reading list",
    "Excellent course to get you to read classics of the American canon of literature. Amazing lectures by Hungerford - a class about both great novels and also about American history. Great section discussions and beautiful lectures - definitely worth taking.",
    "No. There are too many books to go in depth. Then again, if you're super into \"Englishy\" discussions you'll probably really like this course.",
    "Yes, definitely! Especially those who like reading novels, but perhaps are not so confident in their critical reading abilities.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course! I learned so much about American literature and read a lot of great books in the process.",
    "Take it at the very least for the reading list and for the fact that Hungerford is an excellent lecturer. I truly enjoyed this class, particularly getting to read all the amazing books. You don't have to be an English major (or even a humanities person) to get a lot out of it. And you don't realize how nice it is to just read for homework.",
    "ENGL 291 is a fantastic class as long as you can keep up with the reading. It is much more rewarding when you are up to speed.",
    "I would recommend AMST 261 to another student if you're looking to axe that American literature requirement for the American Studies major and\/or procrastinate on other homework by reading wonderful novels.",
    "Aaaargh I did not like this course as much as I thought I would. For one, it's WAY more work than it should be. Not only do the novels take an extremely long time to do (it's one a week, so I had to put in 1-2 hours a night of reading!), but there are three papers that take a significant amount of time. Secondly, I thought Professor Hungerford was great the first lecture but her classes slowly went downhill. They actually became really difficult to sit through. She has this way of asserting crazy book claims as if they're FACT, and I didn't feel like the class allowed for diverse opinions on the books. Because this course was a lecture course with sections (useless, and merely restated the lecture arguments), I don't feel like I actually learned anything about the books or about how to think. The last thing I will say is that the grading is frustrating and extremely difficult to deal with. For some reason, the TFs in the class feel like they need to be \"extra tough\" graders; maybe they're trying to impress Hungerford with their critical analysis of papers, or maybe they're bitter that Yale students can make intelligent claims without being English majors or grad students. But as a student who has taken many other English classes and written many successful papers, I felt that the grading of these papers was arbitrary and unnecessarily harsh. I feel that I was not in control of my final grade in this class, which is frustrating and unfair on the students who put so much time into this useless course.",
    "A great way to read a newer canon of great books!",
    "I would recommend this course to both english and non-english majors. The literature in this class is fun to read. However, this is certainly not a gut class as it is very time consuming and asks you to think about the literature at a high level.",
    "The American Novel is a fast-paced survey of American literature in its late-Modern and post modern phases. Course teaches analytical tools for evaluating literature and elucidates important historical threads that connect the authors together. There's something in the syllabus for everyone, and I came out with a new favorite author that I am now completely fascinated by and obsessed with. I would recommend to someone looking to improve their knowledge of late 20th century writing and contemporary ideas in literature."
