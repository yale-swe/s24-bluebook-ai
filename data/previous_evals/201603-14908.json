    "I learned how to synthesize information from multiple disparate sources to produce coherent historical arguments.",
    "One of the most valuable skills I learned in this course was how to conduct research using primary sources.",
    "This seminar allowed me to think critically about American history, specifically nineteenth century popular politics. I also appreciated how it thought us to understand American politics from various lenses."

   "comments": [
    "This course was strong in tracing the evolution of the exercise of politics over the 19th century, a particularly tumultuous period in American history, teasing out themes, and tracing their origins and impacts.",
    "Strengths: high-level discussions, interesting readings, fair grading Weaknesses: sometimes we didn't talk about all the reading",
    "I really enjoyed the course overall, but I felt there were several weeks in the middle of the course when I wasn't quite sure why we were looking at certain sources and I couldn't really engage with the discussion. I felt the course dropped off a bit in the middle to later weeks and then became focused again once we talked about the Gilded Age. I felt as if we focused a lot on the Antebellum Period, but without enough specifics of what was occurring in the time period to ground the discussion.",
    "It was an amazing course. Professor Lynn directed very engaging and interesting seminar discussions. I have no suggestions for for improvement."

    "Absolutely. Students were engaged, discussion was fast-paced, readings were instructing, and Professor Lynn was awesome at facilitating discussion.",
    "Yes!",
    "Overall I would recommend the class. It was a very good look at the roots of American politics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. This is an great class through which to understand American politics from various perspectives in terms of race, sexuality, gender, class, and so much more."
