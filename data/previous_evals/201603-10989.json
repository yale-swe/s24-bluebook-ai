   "comments": [
    "Hoo boi. Well, I learned a lot more about Ancient Greek conceptions about the possibility of other worlds (and what \"world\" even means) than I was anticipating. I also finally read a bunch of classic sci-fi novels that I ought to have read a long time ago, so that was good. This was also, somehow, the first class I have ever taken in my life that required me to reflect on the Cold War as a thing that happened and that affected culture and perceptions of science. I honestly don't know how I've dodged it for this long, but I guess it's important to engage in, so good on Ivano for that.",
    "I learned about how the industrial revolution and social darwinism played a role in modern day ideas of extraterrestrials.",
    "I learned about the development of the idea of extraterrestrial life. I had to think critically about the connections between history and extraterrestrials and it was interesting.",
    "Intellectual history in the first half, cultural history in the second.",
    "This is a survey course that considers the different ways that cultures and societies have conceptualized the universe (other \"worlds) the potential of life outside planet Earth, dating from the Babylonians to today.",
    "This course offers a survey of Astronomical history from early history to modern times. It helps to develop skills in reading historical sources and works of fiction with a historical lens.",
    "I gained very interesting perspectives and insights on how attitudes (and conceptions) of aliens have changed over time."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Great readings during the second half, Ivano is absolutely precious and fantastic and very approachable with any issues or questions you might have Weaknesses: Relative inaccessibility of early material (I really was lost with the Ancient Greek stuff), 2 exams and a paper AND section,",
    "I wish the movie nights\/astronomy exhibit would have been earlier in the semester with more class announcements. I would have enjoyed going to them. I think this class could be improved with more assignments disturbing the grades more making each assignment worth less. Having 60% of your grade determined on your final and final paper made it hard to accurately judge how I was doing in the class and if I should ask for help or not.",
    "The course is not structured well. It jumps all over the place and tries to incorporate too many things at the same time. The class needs to be more streamlined so we can understand everything better.",
    "My one problem with this great class was the sheer number of philosophers and their associated dates, ideas, schools of thought, publications, etc. we were expected to memorize for the midterm. The second half of the term was much more manageable.",
    "This course has a rather large rift between the first half, which is very historically oriented and has many details and individuals that were somewhat hard to follow, and the second half, which has more literature and popular culture elements. It also seemed to promise some activities that never came to fruition. I think some lessons could also be rather dry, and could use some spark.",
    "It was a very enjoyable course with generally fun and reasonable amounts of reading. Prof. Dal Prete clearly shines most with the discussion of ET\/science from antiquity to the Enlightenment, but the end-part of the course was fun too--just different.",
    "Great and interesting philosophy in the beginning, but I wish some of those themes had been more present and actively discussed in the second half when we were reading more modern content.",
    "This course could spend a bit more time discussing popular culture conceptualization of extra-terrestrials in the 20th and 21st centuries.",
    "This course was very interesting. The only issue with it was the density of information presented. Lectures presented a great deal of information, and it was sometimes unclear what we were supposed to place emphasis in, especially when exams came around.",
    "Strengths - this was a very interesting subject and way to look at history. Weaknesses - the reading was a bit imbalanced, as there were mainly articles in the first half of the course and novels during the second half. Balancing out the reading would be helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend you take it, but do it Cr\/D. I didn't because I needed it for my major, but I would've been much more able to enjoy it if I hadn't been worrying about the letter grade on assignments.",
    "If you like the topic of aliens, this class is an opportunity for you to spend a semester learning about it. However, the class isn't perfect. The first half of the class is all about ancient conceptions of the possibility of other worlds and philosophical schools of thought. Lectures can seem to go a little off topic and leave you wondering how that point relates to the greater theme. That said, the class did leave me with a different perspective on how to consider the prospects of extraterrestrial life and realize the role of cultural influences on things like UFOs and belief in aliens.",
    "If you can make it through the first half not really about extraterrestrials then take it. I found the second half interesting but I'm not sure I would take it if I didn't need it in my major.",
    "YES - it's very cool and nuanced, and is Ivano's thing, so he's very enthusiastic. If you're looking for something new and are interested in learning about the concept of aliens from antiquity until the present day, TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This course has such a strong divide between the first and second half that it is hard to determine whether to recommend it. The first half focuses on philosophical ideas of aliens from antiquity on to about the 1700s, which was not particularly enjoyable. The second half starts at the Industrial Age, and the readings are novels like War of the Worlds and The Andromeda Strain, which are fun to read. I would recommend the second half, but not the first, so if you are willing to do the first part, you'll be rewarded with the second.",
    "A good, not terribly stressful course. Interesting subject matter. If you don't show up to lecture, it's kind of pointless, though. More of a class to show up to lecture than one to learn from the slides, though the slides are easy enough to understand should you go that route. Take it if you're interested in a not-terribly-stressful ET\/an intro HSHM class.",
    "I would recommend this as a credit d. The professor is clearly very passionate and if you don't have a firm grasp of the history of astronomy then this is an enjoyable class but in terms of sections and graded assignments, the class was disjointed and surprisingly harsh. I wish I had not taken it for a grade.",
    "It's a good course, and not too much work. The final paper has the potential to do something interesting and it provided a pretty easy HU credit in an interesting subject.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in HSHM, history, and astronomy.",
    "I would recommend this course, but with the warning that it is not as easy as it seems. It will present a different view of history than any other history course, and it is very interesting. The midterm was difficult and it covered information that seemed like minutia during lectures. But the readings are really interesting (they're sci-fi novels during the second half) . Take it if you like history and astronomy",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a very interesting topic, though there is a lot of reading."
