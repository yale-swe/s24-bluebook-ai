    "An incredible course -- for a very specific type of student. Basically, the entire semester is a \"Gaddis book club\" -- you read a wide variety of interesting biographies and spend two hours each week discussing them (with the conversation mainly dominated by Gaddis, who is excellent, and the inevitable section assholes, who are not). The assumption is that throughout the semester you'll also be working consistently on the one major assignment for the course: a 30-50 page biography of a person using archival materials (and yes they really end up being 50 pages!). So, if you're very self-motivated, and would love to have the excuse to read a lot of random (very good) books and to do intensive archival research, then this is the course for you. But don't expect to gain any sort of concrete historical knowledge from the semester, other than bits and piece from the biographies that you read and write.",
    "Take this if you get in. Start the paper earlier than I did. Pick a topic you love and you'll be fine. Some terrific readings, well worth putting in the effort.",
    "Amazing books, amazing opportunity to write a biography. So glad I took this class.",
    "Although this class is worthwhile, it is very overrated. Perhaps the best way to understand this class is with an image: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hqOhI.gif",
    "It doesn't matter what major you are - this is the class you've been waiting for. Biography with Gaddis is a class you need to take - if you're lucky enough to get in. There's a long waitlist, and you have to apply in advance through History Major preregistration. Every week you read a biography and discuss it. We go from genre to genre, from Virginia Woolf to historical fiction to nonfiction to autobiography to primers on how to write biography. The reading list changes from year to year, but the subjects always cover a wide range. This year we read people from Augustus to Steve Jobs to Isaiah Berlin to an Emperor of China to an average Yale student to Ben Franklin's sister to God. This is the best class I have taken at Yale - the discussions are profound and Professor Gaddis runs the seminar very very well. There are three assignments - a five page autobiography, an eight to twelve page research prospectus on what your final biography will be about, and a 25-50 (you can go over if you wish) page final biography. You get what you put in. The biography can be extremely rewarding if you take the time to visit the archives and immerse yourself into history and your subject. Your autobiography can turn into a beautiful piece of self-reflection, also if you put the time into it. And it's only 5 pages. Professor Gaddis is the best professor I've had the pleasure of taking a course with during my time at Yale. His ability to spark thought-provoking discussion from classmates and steer the conversation in a certain direction without the students realizing, only for them to stumble upon a discovery that they realized they had discovered on their own, is remarkable. He is one of the most caring professors I've had, dedicating an immense amount of time to meeting with students before and after class, or whenever they need to, to talk about the biographies they've read or the ones they're writing for the class. He has often offered to drive from home to work to meet students if they are unable to meet during any of his Office Hours. At the end of the year, he was kind enough to invite the seminar to dinner at his home, an extremely generous invitation that led to a wonderful event. The best thing about his teaching style, apart from what I've already mentioned, is that every class ends on a profound note. He always leaves you wondering about the meaning or purpose of the biography, or about something relevant to your own life. He starts off every class with relevant images and videos, and sometimes, when he has worked with the author of a biography we're reading, or the subject of the biography, he'll share his collaboration with that person. Overall, a magnificent professor.",
    "Take this class. If you're a humanities person--or even if you aren't, but you're down to write a biography--this class will be the most fun one you'll take at Yale. And I mean fun in the sense that you'll work your butt off but get to just explore fascinating people and ideas and lives. If you can get in don't make the mistake of dropping it.",
    "TAKE THIS SEMINAR if you have the opportunity!!!",
    "I recommend it. If you're looking for a more rigorous and writing-center approach, I would take \"Writing Narrative Nonfiction\" with Edward Ball. It has more writing throughout the semester, workshops, and teacher feedback, and the discussion focusing a lot on the actually text. Gaddis's class, on the other hand, is more like a book club--but it's a worthwhile experience as well.",
    "Amazing reading list, prestigious class and professor, etc. Highlights honestly are the books you read and the research project - the opportunity for original research at the beinecke is incredible.",
    "This class is a wonderful opportunity for intellectual and personal growth. You get exposed to a wide range of subjects and approaches to biography, so naturally some books will be better than others. I cannot speak highly enough of the two assignments, the short autobiography and the long biography. Professor Gaddis is extremely devoted to his students, and he ensures that the discussions are stimulating and that you have the necessary tools and guidance to complete the assignments. If you get in, and you can really commit yourself to doing the readings and making an earnest effort at the assignments, I definitely recommend the class."
