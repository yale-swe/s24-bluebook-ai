   "comments": [
    "I dreaded Econometrics after my 131 with Kortum (DONT TAKE IT). This class however was a complete change. Not the easiest of classes but Noriko is an amazing TA and Kostas is great so take it. One midterm, one final and two projects with weekly psets - pretty heavy workload BUT there is a lot of help available and Noriko was always more than willing to help and explain things whenever I needed her to. Definitely recommend.",
    "A great class. Professor Meghir is a terrific professor who actually cares about teaching (a rarity in this econ department). Definitely take this class. Also don't worry about the grading. The material can be tough but the exams and projects are fairly straightforward. I took it not as an econ major and I found it enormously enriching and useful. If you pay attention in class, you will come out really able to understand a great deal of academic papers in empirical economics.",
    "You should take this course if you really want to do any kind of regression analysis or research 131 doesn't really teach you things. This class is a solid intro, but difficult at times but if you work through you'll be fine.",
    "This class is hard (depending on your statistics\/econometrics background. You do learn about data analysis and the math behind it. In general I would recommend, but know that this won't be your fun, easy class.",
    "Econ 132 is really a class you need to take if you are considering writing a thesis in Economics. I know that it has fundamentally aided my ability to do original research. It was not as difficult as I feared when I started it, as it doesn't require a high level of math at all.",
    "It's the middle ground between 131 and the 135-136 track. Meghir is incredibly kind and helpful, though lectures can be dry.",
    "Grinding with a stingray while a bison stomps on your face. That is the review I read before taking this course: it held true. Take the course for Ph.D-level understanding. Although Dr. Meghir says the course is top-heavy so people won't drop out, beware the course crescendos at its end and has an extraordinarily difficult final. Creative answers are downgraded, but the curve is fair. Dr. Meghir is excellent one-on-one for all his troubles speaking to a large group. His slides are lucidly clear. I skipped Econometrics & DA I, speed-read their textbook over shopping week, and faired fine. Dr. Meghir is far more helpful than the Wooldridge textbook, as econometrics at its end requires professional discretion. Engage him, even if it makes you feel like a snake is slithering up your urine stream.",
    "The course is definitely a useful oneyou learn many new regression concepts and techniques that ECON 131 glosses over or ignores completely, and I can definitely see putting this course's material to use in future social science research. Noriko, the TA for this course, was excellent, among the best I have had in my Yale economics courses thus far. However, there were aspects of the course I hope can be improved. Lectures do not seem to be particularly helpful, and indeed, one can get more out of merely reading the lecture slides, which are fairly helpful. Problem sets are lengthy and quite challenging and do not always sync with the lecture, so it definitely helps to form a study group to do them. There are two projects for the course that use Stata, which were often very lengthy and, like the problem sets, were often very broad and open-ended, making it difficult to gauge expectations for grading, which were often not very clear for the course. The midterm and final were definitely reasonable, however, and the Professor put out study guides that he and Noriko would go over in preparation for the exam. Summarily, 132 is a useful course that has some room for improvement, though in retrospect, I most likely would have taken 135 and 136 instead.",
    "Econ 132 makes you realize that the material in 131 is not the whole story, as there's still a ton of stuff to learn. The workload isn't too bad and the lectures are decent if you can manage to pay attention, but the class was frustrating overall due to lack of clarity in problem sets and some instances of arbitrary grading. Take it if you're serious about wanting to learn econometrics, but don't expect it to be as straightforward or enjoyable as 131 was.",
    "I would thoroughly recommend this class to any Econ majors. The material is a little dry, but you really do learn a lot more about Econometrics that builds really well on the material already presented in ECON 131"
