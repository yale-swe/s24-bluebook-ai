   "comments": [
    "YES, take the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It is an awesome combination of sociology and political science, and the readings are significant in the world of urban studies. Ihad never taken a sociology\/urban studies class before this but I look forward to taking another one now that Urban America has sparked my interest in both of these subjects. Professor Hunter is great and approachable, and I also really appreciated having a take-home midterm and final!",
    "I recommend this course to someone who is interested in how racial inequalities and racially prejudice policies shaped urban america. Class can be a bit repetitive though.",
    "Prof. Hunter is cool, and the class isn't overwhelmingly difficult, but I would only recommend this class to freshmen and sophomores. As an upperclassman, I found the material, format, and pace to be dull and overly introductory.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in how modern cities were formed, how ghettos were created, and the problems that cities face today. It is a pretty easy class, but still very interesting.",
    "Necessary to expose you to the elements of city life and culture that you may not consider on a daily basis.",
    "Not as good as it seems like it would be. Really easy and interesting readings, but not the best class overall.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the the development of post-war urban America and the role that the U.S. government and general racism played. However, if you're looking for solutions to the current problems, this class doesn't offer them. The class is a low workload though, and the lectures are always interesting.",
    "Sociology 183 is a good course to take especially if you are really interested in the material like I was. The course ends up being about racial and class tensions between black people and white people and the consequential inequality which is pretty interesting but can get a bit repetitive. There are weekly reading responses which aren't too much work and keep you on top of the reading in addition to a midterm essay and final essay which are fairly straightforward. Lectures are somehow engaging even though they are mainly just a review of the main points of the reading. Take the class if you are interested in the material or want an easier 5th credit.",
    "Take it - good fun class and some very interesting topics!",
    "This class is both easy and interesting, but you have to do well on the midterms and finals. It does a good job of discussing the origins of modern urban American but then focuses more on growth strategies rather than exploring many more details of the 21st century. Professor Hunter goes out of his way to make lecture engaging, peppering most lectures with an audio clip (song!) or video clip to help spur discussion.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class! The material is extremely interesting and relevant and the lectures are amazing. The midterm and final are take-home essays so it's not stressful. Great class.",
    "Yes, the subject matter is important and the readings aren't that bad.",
    "Urban America is one of those classes where how much you get out of it is truly almost entirely up to you. There are many, many assigned readings--almost all of them interesting and worthwhile--but there are only four books that you need to have a basic understanding of to do well. You can easily do well on the handful of writing assignments you are given without reading very much, and there are even stretches of the class where you can get by without doing any work at all, but if you put in the time and effort to do the extra reading I'm sure you'll be glad you did. If you're interested in learning more about the social ills and politics of cities (mostly relating to their black residents) and you either have no problems with self-motivation or are looking for a light work-load, this is the course for you.",
    "This is a must-take course for all students!...especially for those who find themselves opposed to affirmative action and welfare. This course will help you understand why they exist and why America has such a high level of inequality. Although there are many readings, Professor Hunter always makes sure to clarify sociological jargon for students not in the major. The subject of the course is fascinating and the course itself is easy to manage. The only downside is that your grade is based mostly on just the midterm and the final, which are both take-home.",
    "Great readings, great professor, kind of pointless lectures. The professor basically just puts a bunch of quotes from the readings into a powerpoint, makes us discuss them, and then shows a music video or clip from the Wire. Really didn't get much out of lecture and was pretty disappointed since Professor Hunter is so cool. Most of the readings were pretty good however. Definitely don't take this Credit\/D\/F as the grading is very lenient.",
    "A solid course.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course.",
    "ER&M 283 is a class that I feel would give students a greater understanding of and appreciation for the topics that they see or read in the news. Whether students have grown up within the city or outside it, this course is a great way to see how history has impacted the development of Urban America, how suburban life is linked to it, and how certain cities have established prominence on the national and international stage.I would certainly recommend this course to another student. The course material and lectures are very engaging, and I believe that this will help students begin to reflect on what they can do to help resolve some of the issues and inequalities that exist both within urban society and outside it.",
    "Yes. Absolutely.",
    "Average work load and interesting material. Base your decision to take this class solely on subject material."
