    "Music 806 is an excellent investigation of Vitry and the issues surrounding him whether or not you have prior experience in the Middle Ages. You will get better both at reading medieval notation and at recognizing specious lines of reasoning that attempt to pigeonhole Vitry or the ars nova or the Middle Ages too easily. You may get slightly depressed about music scholarship and having to participate in this field we're in, but not quite enough to want to throw in the towel. Definitely recommended."

   "comments": [
    "This course did a great amount towards deepening my knowledge both of medieval scholarship and of polyphonic medieval music, since both had been serious lacunae in my knowledge base. I am now much more able to talk to medievalists about their work, whether they study music or other medieval subjects, and can listen to an ars nova motet with senses other than bewilderment in my ears. I can also read from and, on a good day, transcribe medieval music manuscripts. And, arguably most importantly, I know more about what sort of arguments to be wary of and not to fall into the traps of. All of these skills will very certainly contribute to my research even though it will probably not be very medieval itself, since the issues are applicable to a wide range of areas of study in some way or other."
