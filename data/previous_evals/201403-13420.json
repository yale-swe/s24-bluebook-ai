   "comments": [
    "If you're interested at all in design, take this class! Worth it. Lots and lots of work though, especially if you want to produce work that you're proud of.",
    "Intro to graphic design is an incredibly fun class if you are interested in learning a different skill",
    "Take it! My best class so far at Yale. Basically everything you see when you're at Yale was designed by someone, and this course gives you some fundamental skills for critically evaluating the world around you. Expect to spend 6-10 hours a week outside of class doing projects (depending on how much of a perfectionist you are). Even if the class is time-consuming, the time spent can be very therapeutic. I'd much rather spend 10 hours hanging out in my common while pasting stuff than spend 5 doing a pset. Henk is an incredible teacher and just an all around intimidatingly cool guy (not actually intimidating himself!). Don't pass up a chance to take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, as long as you understand that it is a lot of work, and that you will not receive grades until after the end of the semester. So if you're willing to Credit\/D and put in the work, then go for it, and if you're willing to put in a lot of effort with a little grade uncertainty, then go for it. I did not mind it much, but I can see that some students may be a little thrown off by the abundance of work and lack of evaluation. That said, if you are ok with the above two things, then absolutely take this class. It was the first art class I've taken, and it was an incredible experience. I loved doing the workit often felt like a break from reading and writing and studying and problem setsand I looked forward to seeing my classmates' art every week. I learned a tremendous amount from Henk, and it is satisfying to be able to look back at the first pieces and last pieces I made and see undeniable progress.",
    "It's a lot of cutting and pasting in your living room, followed by hours of looking at your peers cuttings and pastings. Your graphic design skills may improve.",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in graphic design fundamentals. None of the work is computer-oriented. Most classes are crits, with work done outside the classroom. One larger final project. A field trip into NYC to go to galleries and design spaces was a great way to get to know the professor and classmates. Crits were slow sometimes--as it's an intro class, people's design vocabulary wasn't super strong. I would've like a few more lectures.",
    "Intro to Graphic Design is a great class. My own design ability definitely improved throughout the semester, but I also learned a deeper appreciation for design and illustration in everyday life.",
    "Take it if you can afford to spend at least two full days a week working on your assignments.",
    "Awesome class. Side note though: you don't receive any grades along the semester. Zero idea of what your grade might be, though you do get qualitative feedback."
