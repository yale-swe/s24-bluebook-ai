   "comments": [
    "You should take it only if you are interested in the topic or if you have to.",
    "As a non-science, non-Environmental Studies major (kind of a rare bird in the classroom), I have only good things to say about this course. It is not a gut, but it will not baffle you, and it will leave you with a healthy understanding of planetary climate systems that will feel relevant to daily life, unless you plan to live out your life in a drab, climate-controlled office and shun the light and weather. Even then you would at least understand why indoor pressure equilibrates with the outdoors but indoor temperature does not, and also grasp the mechanisms by which your daily commute in your midlifecrisis-mobile will eventually kill us all. Don't be a fool and miss the lectures; Ron Smith is no hack.",
    "This is a great class that everyone should talk! The lab is a bit of a drag and so I may not recommend it for non-science\/EVST majors who don't have time to take 1.5 credits. However, if you do take this, you won't regret it. If you have any decent math background, or are a G&G major, you should have no problem with the math and physics aspects of the course. Even though math is built into the course, it tends to be really easy, straightforward equations. There is a ton of material, but Professor Smith makes it all very clear and interesting. In the end you'll really understand a lot about the atmospheric and oceanic systems, as well as know a lot more about global warming and climate change.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the scientific explanations for environmental change. Also, because it is a requirement for EVST and G&G, it is good to get out of the way earlier on in your Yale career, because the early time of the course and the weekly problem sets can be a little exhausting.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes. Take it. You won't regret it.",
    "This course takes a very quantitative approach to understanding the dynamics of the atmosphere. The breadth of the course material span everything from topography to pollution, giving students a comprehensive background of the basics of atmospheres, oceans, and climate change.",
    "While the topics are interesting in this course, it is very difficult and requires a large amount of time if you have not taken physics before. I would really only take this course if you have to or are really interested in Earth Science.",
    "Awesome class. Perfect mixture of qualitative Earth Science understanding and quantitative equations. You'll never want to miss lecture. Ron's awesome and the class is intimate enough that you can always ask questions. If you want to know everything abou the world works take this class.",
    "Nice class, hard, only take it if you need it.",
    "If you're an Environmental Studies major, this class is required, so there's not a whole lot you can do about that. Had it not been required, I would not have taken it because I am not particularly interested in the subject matter. If you are interested, however, I think this course would be informative and enjoyable for you. The problem sets are neither too long nor too difficult, and the exams are a little tough but straightforward. Overall, it's a solid class. You won't skate by, but if you put in the work, you'll do fine. Professor Smith is friendly and engaged.",
    "This class is great if you are at all interested in learning about the inner workings of the atmosphere. I genuinely enjoyed it because I found the subject matter extremely interesting. It's always awesome to take a class where the information learned can be applied in everyday life, and G&G 140 was just that. The professor was great and the workload wasn't overwhelming. Although we did cover a lot of information in a short period of time, I feel like it was well-organized. Definitely worth your time!!",
    "WIth the mandatory lab I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to take it, but overall it's not too much work and the unit tests are fair, although the final exam was way harder than expected.",
    "This is definitely a very informative class, especially for any potential EVST or G&G majors. However, it is by no means a gut! Be prepared to pay close attention in lecture if you hope to do well on the challenging exams.",
    "Yes! Take this class. I was neither an environmental studies nor geology major and I found it to be very rewarding.",
    "If you're interested in how the oceans and atmosphere works, and how these processes affect the conditions we see today and have seen historically, with some calculations, definitely take this class! But be prepared for a challenge!",
    "I highly recommend this course, especially with Professor Smith if you're interested in learning things like why the wind blows, what processes produce freezing rain, what is El Nino, and what is the evidence of climate change. It is a good mix of concepts and math. The exams are very quantitative.",
    "A great class! You will learn everything about the atmosphere, the oceans, and climate change \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what clouds precipitate, why the sky looks blue, why glaciers in the North Pole are melting but they are actually growing in the South Pole. Ron Smith is a great teacher and knows more than anyone about the material, The only bummer is that you have to take the lab as well, but for the most part it really complements the course material.",
    "A generally interesting science survey course. Take it if it fills a requirement, take it if you have some specific interest in the material. It won't thrill you, but it is a solid class with relevant material and a reasonable workload. With the course you get a lab, which is not as well executed, but is one of the easiest half-credits you will get at Yale.",
    "As a humanities person, this class was very difficult for me. In this class you will be expected to have a lot of prior scientific knowledge, in chemistry and physics for example. Without it, the course is quite difficult, since the PSETs and exams are usually far more difficult than the example problems presented in class. On the whole, however, I can say that I learned a lot from this class and that spending months learning about the weather was worth it since it led up to a discussion about global warming.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, and feel I have a much better understanding of how the world around me works. You learn a lot of cool information, and the math is not too bad.",
    "If you have to take the class, then you have to take it. There are interesting bits to be learned, however, I found most of the class to be not all that interesting to me.Just a tip: Really dig into the equation sheet given for the tests, so much of what you need for the problem sets and tests is on there!",
    "Take this class. Its a great introductory class and very informative. There are transcripts for this class online which are great to reread for note taking and homework assignments. There are also past exams online that make studying for the present ones easier. Don't overlook this resource.",
    "This course gives you basic knowledge of the workings of our atmosphere, oceans and an intro into the study of environmental change. If you are looking for a class that details solar, wind and other alternative energy sources and talks in depth about problems and solutions, this may not be the course for you. However, it was a good intro class and the work is not outrageous. The lab has the potential to be a pain but the experiments are enjoyable and get you outside and thinking about the world around you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to fellow students, science majors and not. The information taught in the classis incredibly relevant to the world today and Professor Smith is a great professor. The work is not easy enough for the class to be considered a gut class, but I would still definitely recommend it as a science credit. The only downside is that to take the class, you must also take the lab, which is not so good."
