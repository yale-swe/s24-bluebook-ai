   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, you won't find a better senior seminar.",
    "This is a great course for students interested in the effects of economic policies without wanted to engage in heavy math.",
    "Constitutional law class with a bit of economics. You'll read a bunch of court cases each week that dealt with discrimination and talk a lot about the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments and their parts. Interesting for anyone who likes law, but this is most definitely not an economics class. One regression model and occasional economic implications do not make an economics senior seminar.",
    "Yes, it is not too hard and a good class to take a second semester senior.",
    "Yes take it",
    "This class is chill, with a relaxed workload perfect for a senior seminar, and Prof. Jaynes both facilitates discussion well and his own insightful and often colorful perspective. Not very technical whatsoever (though some economic models are covered earlier in the semester, they aren't covered in-depth) -- this class is an overview of the Supreme Court decisions governing the historical progression of racial and other discrimination. I highly recommend this course.",
    "This is a great seminar to take, especially for those interested in law.",
    "Yes, wonderful course. Deals with more law than econ",
    "Great interesting seminar!",
    "Take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was one my favorite economics courses and simply one of the best-run seminars I've taken. Professor Jaynes is hilarious - he always had funny stories from his own life to illustrate the topics we were discussing, but he was also a tough but fair discussion leader. This class was much more heavily based on constitutional law than economics, which I personally really enjoyed. Each week a different pair of students led discussions, and the two hours always seemed to fly by (which I have never experienced in any other of my seminars). The content was great, discussion was always enjoyable and informative, and the workload was very reasonable. We generally had under 50 pages of reading each week, which meant that we could actually analyze the readings (often Supreme Court cases) in depth. Besides weekly class, there was just one 10-15 page paper. Even if you're a non-Econ major, I would definitely try to get into this class!"
