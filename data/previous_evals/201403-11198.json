    "Summary: A reading and discussion-intensive course providing a survey of major topics and themes in the the subfield, drawing on recently published material as well as foundational work in comparative politics. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Reasons above.",
    "The course is a great overview of ideas and methodologies in comparative politics.",
    "PLSC 777 is a survey of comparative politics literature, intended to prepare you for the comprehensive exam. There's a decent amount of reading and you have to write eight reading responses, which means you can only miss a few weeks. There's no midterm or final, but there is a research proposal that requires quite a bit of thought, planning, and revision. Everything is handed in single-spaced, which is sheer madness. Prof. Thachil is fantastic, however, and I highly recommend the class.",
    "This is a great introduction to Comparative Politics that I expect will be useful preparation for the qualifying exam. It is challenging but also accessible to people who do not have a strong background in Comparative Politics.",
    "A good introduction to research in comparative politics."

   "comments": [
    "As indicated above, the course readings gave a fine overview of major topics in comparative politics. The research proposal assignment allowed me to begin exploring new questions in my subfield and linking those both to recent research and some of the foundational texts in comparative politics.",
    "It was very helpful to understanding ideas and methods in comparative politics.",
    "I had a minimal undergraduate knowledge of comparative politics prior to taking this course. I now feel as though I have a poor graduate level understanding of comparative politics. While that doesn't seem like a big improvement, it really is. More importantly, I feel like I have a much better grip on the methods of comparative politics and how research is done in the sub-field, which I think will help me significantly.",
    "This course introduced me to the subfield of Comparative Politics through selected readings from seminal works. The structure (organized by theme, with different methodological approaches each week) was logical and covered a wide range of topics. I expect that it will be helpful preparation for the qualifying exam in Comparative Politics, and it will also help me relate my work in political theory to debates in my secondary subfield."
