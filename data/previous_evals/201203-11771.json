   "comments": [
    "Great class, great professor, very manageable workload. Will show you how to use the physics you have learned in other courses to analyze what's going on with the earth and environment. Very germane. I'm actually enjoying writing my paper. Take it, it's a stellar physics elective.",
    "This Class gives an overview of the physics of many processes and natural phenomenon that most other classes ignore. Professor Lamoreaux is a fantastic and interesting professor who has great stories on nearly every topic. Although a great deal of material is covered (climate model, wave action and tides, radiation pressure and applications to solar cells, meteor deflection and solar system evolution, etc) it is all readily understandable and the class is not overt burdensome. A great class to fill out any schedule",
    "I would only recommend this course to someone very interested in a more mathematical portrayal of environmental sciences. It was a good survey of many environmental phenomena, but failed to describe any of them in-depth.",
    "Gutty gut gut. Take it if you're interested or just want to relax for a semester.",
    "very interesting material, low workload, really smart and funny professor",
    "This class is not difficult or time intensive, but it is interesting and worth a taking if you don't want to work very hard. The class can feel long sometimes, and sometimes the lectures can be hard to follow, but overall, I would recommend as a 5th credit.",
    "Take it. Fun physics elective. Not too bad and SKL is so nice!",
    "Take everything you thought you knew about the term, \"bucket list.\" Forget it all. Now replace it with the following definition: \"YOLO, so take some worthwhile classes. And that goes double for you, ya Global Affairs major!\" Now, take anything that managed to survive from your former bucket list. Strike 'em. That's right, every last one of 'em. Now, finally, populate your newly vacant bucket list with a single item: \"Take advantage of any and every opportunity to learn from Professor Steve Keith Lamoreaux.\" Philosophy majors sometimes ask what it means to have lived a good life. I have just told you, and you are welcome.",
    "I enjoyed this course a lot. It teaches a lot of the real world consequences of physics that you don't really learn in all the other courses required for the physics major. It is definitely a great elective to take for anyone majoring in physics."
