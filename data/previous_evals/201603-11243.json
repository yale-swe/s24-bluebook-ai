   "comments": [
    "Learned math that will be super helpful to me in physics.",
    "I learned multivariable calculus because I spent a lot of time studying math on my own. However, this was mostly due to my own determination rather than the course itself.",
    "Math is really hard",
    "I developed the basic knowledge of multivariable calculus, as well as the skills necessary to think about fundamental calculus concepts in 3 or more dimensions. Learning to apply 2 dimensional calculus to higher dimensions was an insight into the applications of calculus.",
    "I improved my ability to conceptualize seemingly abstract problems and construct an approach to solving math problems. The topics early on are very manageable but its important to become well-practiced in them in order to have a better grasp on the tougher concepts later on in the course.",
    "We learned about vectors, integrating and differentiating vector fields, double and triple integrals, and curl and divergence.",
    "I learned how to do calculus with multiple variables.",
    "Learned how to analyze partial derivatives, multiple integrals, and many properties of these.",
    "I developed the skills outlined in the syllabus. The class follows the syllabus precisely.",
    "I took multivariable previously, but this helped to strengthen my overall understanding of the topics.",
    "I learned the skills of multivariable calculus and its relevance to real world computing.",
    "I developed the ability to perform basic calculus operations using functions and vector fields in multiple dimensions. I also became more comfortable with the basic conceptual basis of calculus.",
    "Basic multicalc class.",
    "I developed stronger critical thinking and logical reasoning skills from taking this course.",
    "Got more comfortable using triple integrals, Stoke's, Green's, and Divergence Theorem."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are that it is organized and fluid and makes sense as you follow along. Weaknesses are that it moves fast -- though that is to be expected. You always know what you need to know and there are many resources to check in on your learning.",
    "This class didn't feel much different than a typical high school math class, at least in the way that it was taught. However, we got through a lot of material in efficient time.",
    "Strengths - well taught class, covered standard material well. Weaknesses - The course was quite formulaic at times.",
    "The textbook is good. Some professors are really good. The tests suck. You can know all the material and practice for hours and hours but then get a bad grade on the test because you made a small mistake in one question and they marked off the whole question wrong. Often times, they even try to trick you on the tests by throwing in cheap things like the domain of a function not being continuous. The math 120 course itself tries to get you to fail by grading the tests very harshly for no reason. That's probably how they get the grades in the class to vary since everyone taking the class is good at math and is used to getting hundreds. By grading harshly, they get one student whose unlucky to get a lower grade than another student even though they both put in the same amount of work and were both evenly smart.",
    "The peer tutor sessions were really crowded",
    "A strength of this course is the material itself. While it is a semester long course, the subject matter builds on itself so that at the end of the course you are able to think about the entire course through a few simple theorems and applications of calculus. A weakness of this course may be the lack of practical applications for a few of the theorems, as these applications would involve upper level physics or applied mathematics beyond the scope of the course.",
    "Some sections got a much better education than others, but we were all scaled the same on tests. It's also a little annoying how different our curve is from the spring semester class, but it's alright. Honestly if everyone could just teach like Miki that would be amazing. I also felt very, very unprepared for the final despite studying, as instructed, extensively. Just to add, I also think the questions on exams that are multiple choice questions in disguise (5-10 points to give an answer without justifying it) are a little ridiculous, given the emphasis on process throughout the rest of the course. It's also annoying that if, on the problem sets, you got the correct answer with an incorrect method, there was nothing marked off, thereby leading me to assume I understood the process, but come the exams you suddenly learnt that you'd been wrong all along. Also the no correct based on error is a brutal grading scheme that doesn't really evaluate what I know if I make an arithmetic mistake at the offset of a problem...",
    "Many of the professors had different approaches to certain concepts. I think a more streamlined syllabus would be helpful.",
    "This course is very well taught and provides you with all the tools you need to succeed. Practice problems, homework, and class time gives you exactly what will be on the exam.",
    "This course had a good curriculum with a great textbook to go with it. The psets complemented the notes and my professor (Michal Tryniecki) was very passionate and helpful when he explained the concepts. The review sessions were very helpful as well.",
    "The class size was small, so any question I had I could ask, and it was overall very engaging.",
    "The strength is a really small class size which makes it possible for students to ask questions promptly in class. This ensures that nothing is left confusing when each class ends.",
    "More frequent midterms, each covering less material",
    "Interesting content but tests are pretty difficult",
    "It's not very involved; a lot of the problem sets found me wondering why the arithmetic was so complicated when it's really the concepts I care about.",
    "This course is extremely fast paced, but doable. The grading is harsh, penalizing students to large degrees for small mistakes. I understand that this is necessary for obtaining the desired grade distribution, yet I cannot help but feel that it prejudices the course against students from under-resourced, largely public, high schools. The class teaches you multivariable calculus, but it also teaches you that education, perhaps especially at a place like Yale, is still far from equitable.",
    "This course had many strengths. The classes were taught in a small classroom setting, which made it easy to ask questions and get help during class time. There were peer tutors who were available many times a week. These tutors had a strong grasp of the material and were always very helpful. The topics were taught in a logical order, and the pacing was fast enough that I was always kept interested but slow enough that I rarely felt lost. There were also many review sessions in the week before each test.",
    "Grades should not be so exam-heavy"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. But honestly this is my second time taking it (took a W in it in the spring) and only because of that do I feel like I'm just grasping the material. Without already being somewhat familiar, I wouldn't have been able to keep up as well.",
    "Only if you are willing to take the risk of a super harsh curve and are good at learning concepts and putting in work yourself",
    "If you want a standard multivariable calculus background, this will provide it. Won't make you an especially creative thinker, but will help you become a more effective problem solver.",
    "Just know that you can still fail even though you may be amazing at math and work hard because they grade unfairly and harshly.",
    "It was painful. But you'll get through it if you need to. Study up and don't make a bunch of dumb mistakes",
    "I took this course with a very experienced and dedicated professor. Michal was absolutely amazing whenever I went to his office hour for help. I would recommend choosing a good professor when it comes to math 120.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as it is a rather neat continuation of calculus 1 classes. While it is challenging, the challenge of the class is intellectually stimulating, rather than simply providing a heavy workload.",
    "You probably have to take it if you're here; if you do, take it with a professor. AVOID TA TEACHERS AT ALL COSTS THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE BUT THEY ARE NOT AS GOOD AS THE PROFESSOR AND YOU WILL BE EXPECtED TO BE AS PROFICIENT AS PEOPLE WHO WERE TAUGHT BETTER THAN YOU!!!",
    "I would recommend this course only if you have a serious interest in pursuing higher level mathematics or if it is necessary for major.",
    "This course was well constructed and the professors were excellent.",
    "I really enjoyed the class, the concepts that we learned. I would recommend this course, even if you don't need to take it as a requirement.",
    "Yes, it is a good way to continue a track of calculus from AP Calculus BC",
    "I recommend taking multivariable calc as your first math class at Yale. It's a wonderful experience if you've got a good professor. It's a small class so a nice transition to college from high school. Prof Tryniecki is the best math teacher I've ever had. He explains the material so well and I appreciate his humor. Take 120 with him and you'll love it!",
    "Definitely take it with Michal! The professor clarifies and explains things very well, and in general I found this course a rather enjoyable learning experience.",
    "Yes, but only if the student is interested in a STEM major.",
    "A very clear speaker and good instructor. The material is often presented quickly, but Tryniecki makes a clear and conscious attempt to have understand the material. The course overall is not easy. The material is disjoint and often very mechanical.",
    "Would recommend",
    "Yes",
    "This course is challenging, but it's effective at efficient learning of multivariable calculus.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student unless it was required as a prerequisite. The grading in this course is sometimes quite harsh, and there really is no curve to help you. You can have a good understanding of the material and still do poorly because of small mistake in your calculations. Additionally, many of the students in this course have already taken multivariable calculus, and this disparity can be extremely frustrating for students who perhaps come from less advantaged educational backgrounds.",
    "Yes. Most people who do well have at least been exposed to multicalc before.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who enjoys math. Even if a student does not feel like math necessarily comes naturally to them, there are many systems in place to help a struggling student improve and develop a strong command of the material.",
    "Good class if they are excellent test takers, otherwise would not recommend."
