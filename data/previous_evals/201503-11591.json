    "Yes take it! Especially if you are a photo major!",
    "Would recommend if you are willing to put in the work in the lab and are willing to be a member of a community, who will encourage and challenge your fellow photographers to subvert into social and artistic consciousness.",
    "I would definitely reccomend the course.",
    "Intermediate photo allows for more freedom of expression than intro in 2 main ways: 1) the subject is open for the student to choose; 2) medium format cameras are used and the student can choose which camera they would like to use. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in photo or in art.",
    "I would definitely recommend Intermediate Black and White Photo! However, I would strongly encourage you to take Intro first; Lisa wont let you take intermediate unless youve taken intro, or at least had some darkroom experience. We used medium format cameras of various types, which was really fun and instructive. Having access to these different types of camera allows you to better understand what kind of photographer you are, and what you value in your practice. Photographing with film is such a wonderful experienceits really nothing like taking photographs digitally."
