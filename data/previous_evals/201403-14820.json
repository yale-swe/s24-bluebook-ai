    "This course represents your opportunity to pursue original mathematics research for Yale credit. If this is an attractive idea to you, sign up; if this is something you wouldn't like, walk on by. Your experience in the course will be determined entirely by your relationship with your advisor and his\/her project, so it is to you to pick a good advisor with a good project. Here, as always I suppose, \"good\" is subjective, and it can mean a lot of things, like, \"intriguing,\" \"fun,\" \"rewarding,\" \"gripping your interest until the wee hours of the morning,\" and so on.",
    "This was a great course, I don't know if it will be taught again, but I think that it could lead to a very productive collaboration between an interested member of the English department and Michael."
