    "Take food writing if you're looking for a fun intro English class! It is so much more interesting than English 114. You will read some amazing food writing and have wonderful discussions with your classmates about food, culture, family traditions, and history. I've learned that food is so much more than just nourishment; the historical cookbook analysis was one of my favorite units this year. You'll also get to go sample food from New Haven restaurants and watch some great food films.",
    "A definite must take while you're at Yale! Assignments aren't difficult but you'll still be learning a lot. Good for a 5th credit. Essays are not too long, 5 pages mostly and you'll get feedback on them! It's a pretty solid class and if you've been interested in food in anyway, it's a fun, easy but engaging class to take. Don't really need to do the readings in depth and you just have to make sure you include a lot of detail into whatever you write. Description and detail are key to the essays in this class!",
    "I don't think I would recommend this course to someone who isn't already a good writer and\/or someone who isn't interested in food. I don't really feel the class improved my writing, and didn't feel like working with Professor Stuart helped me that much. The reading assignments were interesting and brought some interesting conversations. The last two presentations were kind of pointless and felt like a high school project and a time suck--I would rather have written another paper. But overall, the workload is manageable so it's a fine writing credit.",
    "Fun and interesting class. For people who hate traditional English classes. Hard to get an A though. Barbara grades very subjectively and seems to be all over the place. She could comment on your paper, \"Great piece, very engaging, minor mechanical issues\" then take off ten points. Grading on a point based scale in an English class if weird and subjective and since when is a 94 an A-. She claims to have the same grading distributing as others in the English Department but I'm not so sure. Maybe you only get an A if she likes you. She could be telling you great things about your paper as you go to see her during office hours and then in the final grading she'll highlight two comma errors that she never mentioned previously and take off tons of points. If she was going to put so much weight on comma usage we should have done the lesson on commas at the beginning of the semester rather than during the last week of classes after we had turned in ALL of our papers. Four papers (for which you do a rough and final draft for each) and two final presentations during the last two week of school. Stressful trying to coordinate with group members during the last two weeks of classes.",
    "Fun writing credit! Just make sure to ask the professor what she expects out of each essay.",
    "I definitely recommend this class."
