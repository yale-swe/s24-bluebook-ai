    "If you want to be painting, obviously, take it. If you don't, don't go hoping you'll be forcibly inspired.",
    "This is a very good class if you are prepared to be self-motivated and self-directed. It gives you time and a place to work. However, there were not that many crits so you really have to push yourself to constantly be working.",
    "See answer tofirst question.",
    "With Sam this class is very open, there aren't really assignments so you are free to pursue your own projects. If you want to work from the model take it with Sam. Overall the class is not very directed and there aren't very many crits.",
    "If youre a painting concentration in the art major you pretty much have to take it. Sam is not the best person to take it with, but hes not the worst. Make sure you motivate yourself to work because otherwise the end of the year will roll around and you'll have nothing to show for yourself.",
    "Your experience in Painting Studio will entirely depend on the instructor. It could be completely independent study or it could be project based. I do recommend the course, but you will have to motivate yourself.",
    "Painting Studio I is a great course. In a lot of ways it's essentially an independent study, and you get as much out of it as you put in. Sam was really wonderful also."
