    "My answers to questions 1&2 summarize my impressions.I would recommend CHEM 540 to certain types of students. If you are interested in spectroscopy, enjoy solving problems (problem solving constitutes pretty much the entire course), and have the time to devote to one of the most demanding courses I have ever taken, this would be a good course. It is also good (and probably required) if your research entails NMR.Needless to say, I would not recommend the course to anyone who might think that they are without an adequate preparation in physical chemistry. Students should have a candid conversation with the instructor about their background before enrolling in the course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Chem 540 to other students. I should have taken Chem 540 earlier in my graduate career. I think it should be a requirement for all entering graduate students involved with MRI and in vivo NMR spectroscopy at the Yale Medical School, whether they hail from physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, or, as in my case, biomedical engineering. Chem 540 provides essential material that every MR physicist needs to know, but which slips through the cracks of the NMR and MRI courses in the engineering departments and at the med school. Chem 540 is particularly suitableto engineering students because it does not presuppose a tremendous amount of background in quantum mechanics.I took quantum mechanics as an undergraduate, but the course focused almost exclusively on the linear algebra and other mathematical tools used in QM, providing very few examples beyond the electron orbitals of the hydrogen atom. This made for an exceptionally dry course. Chem 540 filled in a lot of the gaps in this course, while explicitly treating a range of basic problems from spectroscopy. In addition to helping students understand spectroscopy, the examples also do a great deal to make the mathematical tools more interesting.",
    "The class that takes up the most time, but is worth the effort for first year pchem grad students. Don't let the first exam fool you, it gets much much harder.The hardest class I have ever taken by a long shot, but very exciting material for those who are into quantum mechanics.",
    "Great class for learning quantum chemistry and spectroscopy. Challenging problem sets and exams.",
    "If a student is interested in physical chemistry, then I highly recommend this class. It covers a wide variety of topics, but at great detail, that pertain to physical chemistry."

   "comments": [
    "The material in Chem 540 does not directly pertain to my dissertation topic per se (spatial encoding in MRI with non-linear gradient shapes). But as I described above, the class shored up my understanding of the fundamentals of magnetic resonance, paving the way for better understanding other open research problems in the future.",
    "I feel as if all my years in study in physics and chemistry were to prepare me for this course. Basically a capstone for all introductory physics and chemistry, and a great intro to more advanced pchem. The kind of course that addresses all of the \"beyond the scope of the course\" from previous courses.This course hardened my resolve to stay with pchem.",
    "It taught me most of the spectroscopy I will need to know as a physical chemist.",
    "This course definitely deepened my knowledge of my discipline and the class notes will be invaluable help during my Ph.D."
