    "Must take if you can.",
    "Fantastic class. Zhou Laoshi is amazing, and you read a ton of current news\/articles that really help your Chinese. No reason not to take it if you are even reading this.",
    "This is a really great class for keeping up your Chinese. Vocab quizzes at the start of nearly every lecture are the basis for most of your work. We had humongous work packets, but for the most part, you just need to pay attention to what is really homework that needs to be turned in, or what in the little textbook is going to be discussed in class. I focused on required vocab and readings (lots of articles to read online!), and then didn't worry too much about the other things in the packets. Before the midterms, we are given review packets about 15 pages long or so with all the material that will be on the midterms. These made for good midterms that everyone could do well on, but also help you realize all the new vocabulary and grammar and written formulas we have learned in class. We also had exciting and engaging discussions and debates in class, and viewpoint essays!",
    "Chinese 166 is a great class. Zhou Laoshi is a very organized teacher and you learn lots of useful vocabulary. It's less speaking than the earlier levels of Chinese, but this is definitely the best of the Chinese elective courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes! plenty of oral practice. if you are prepared to do the work of memorizing (hand-writing) characters, then take it for a letter grade. If not, still do it and credit\/D it and switch it to a letter grade towards the end of the year ( this is what I did)",
    "I'd recommend Chinese Media and Society to an advanced Chinese learner who wants to improve their written Chinese and reading comprehension. You learn a lot about China's current social issues. You also learn to write formally and read articles more effectively.",
    "This class is for people who have reached a high level but want to be able to read and write at a higher (more formal level). Personally, I am a heritage speaker so I struggled with being able to understand newspaper and television formal language, so this class really helped me in that regard. Be prepared for A LOT OF WORK, however - although the tests were very easy, you have to read an average of 3-4 Chinese newspaper articles in between each class as long as learning new characters and preparing for weekly presentations.",
    "A great course if you want to keep your Chinese at a high level. It's gonna be difficult to really make progress now (unless you go to China), but it's a good class to learn more about modern Chinese society and the issues millions of Chinese people face. And it's a must with Zhou laoshi!",
    "CHNS 166 was still trying to figure itself out, but it's one of the best high-level Chinese courses. The material is very interesting, and the class work (presentations, etc.) were also enjoyable and low-stress. The tests were easy, though there was a lot of homework, and the daily quizzes on vocabulary were a little annoying but seemed necessary enough. I would certainly recommend this class to others, so long as your Chinese ability is there.",
    "Having never taken Chinese at Yale before, I thought that CHNS 166 was a great course, but obviously I can't compare it to other L5 classes. It covers very relevant, interesting topics that you'll talk about with many Chinese-speaking people. I think my Chinese definitely improved a lot after the class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone at this level of Chinese who is interested in learning about contemporary Chinese society and media. The course is manageable, but do not expect huge gains in your language ability. Instead, you will have a taste of some pressing current issues and different cultural phenomena in China.",
    "An awesome course that allows for the further exploration of a fun course with a wonderful professor who is truly experienced and knows how to teach Chinese at an advanced level. The homework isn't too bad and can lead to good discussion should you do the reading. The reading can be a little dry once in a while, but overall a fascinating course that teaches more abort social issues in China.",
    "An excellent class for anyone who wants to improve\/keep up their Chinese skills, and especially for anyone who's interested in learning\/discussing important issues and topics in China today. Zhou laoshi and Shen laoshi were both excellent, and we did a lot of interesting things in class like watching a movie, doing a mini-debate, etc. that made it more interesting and engaging than just a normal Chinese class. The workload is not too high either. Definitely recommend."
