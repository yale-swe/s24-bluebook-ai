    "general background on a lot of political and religious topics",
    "This course helped me think of religion and spirituality as coequal considerations alongside economics and politics in understanding the problems of authoritarianism, populism, and the retreat of liberalism we are witnessing today. The course also provided a rich literature review of topics as varied as secularism, nationalism, and gender issues.",
    "Really gained an understanding that the state of political nowadays transcends the socio-economic realm and there are much more insidious influences such as religion that shape a lot of what we are seeing today.",
    "I got to learn more about the global systems that have shaped our world today, like neoliberalism. I also got exposure to some theory, however it was done in an understandable way.",
    "Religious freedom, neoliberalism, and fundamentalism",

   "comments": [
    "class sessions could have been a little more structured but it had great readings (although a little too much reading) and the professor was super nice",
    "Strengths: the professor is incredibly well-read and can both connect the readings assigned to any given class as well as challenge them. The final assignment allows students to apply the concepts in the course in pursuit of a topic of interest to them and their larger research interests. Weaknesses: This course hinges on student participation...and often it felt like a lot of them had not prepared. There was no forcing function apart from participation grades to compensate for this.",
    "Needs more structure during class time. The discussion was a bit aimless and slow.",
    "Relevant material and readings are very informative. Some of the discussion tends to be unstructured which makes it a bit hard to follow for those that are new to these topics.",
    "I think the course was overall fairly strong, although there were some instances in which the thesis of the course was repetitive.",
    "Strengths: reading material, engaging professor, open and accessible professor Weakness: none",
    "The course gives a really broad set of countries\/regions as case studies. Readings need to be more structured to aid weekly studying. Also, some summarized class notes will be helpful"

    "Yes Great teacher, interesting topic",
    "I would, with the important caveat that they must committed to conducting the readings in a deliberate and engaged manner. Failure to do this is ripping off your fellow students and wasting the professor's time.",
    "Yes, if interested in learning about the topics would recommend.",
    "Yes, very interesting class with a fantastic professor.",
    "Yes, a diverse group of students ranging from the college, Divinity School, and Jackson coming from different backgrounds. I enjoyed the class discussions and readings."
