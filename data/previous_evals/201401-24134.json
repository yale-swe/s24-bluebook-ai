   "comments": [
    "A good class, but splitting into discussion sessions at every class can be a little awkward. Also, the instructor always seemed to have specific answers in mind for the take home assignments, in-class discussions, and final, but the questions are vague which makes it hard to know what she is looking for.",
    "It provided a refreshing global outlook to physiology and how dysfunction in the system can have important public health implications.",
    "I liked the lecture\/ discussion format-- really enjoyed hearing other student's perspectives on the topics",
    "-This was my favorite class this semester and one of my favorites at YSPH-provides new ways of thinking about the connection between human biology and public health and helps students recognize physiological vulnerabilities that may result in public health problems-enjoyed the weekly write-ups and homework challenges-liked mixing up the discussion groups so that I was able to get to know more people in the class from other concentrations-assignments graded fairly and returned in timely manner",
    "The lectures are very interesting, and it is nice to have the opportunity to research your own topic sometimes. The workload is not overwhelming. When small group discussions are based on problem-solving, they are interesting and thought-provoking. However, sometimes discussions lag when we talk about our own write-ups.",
    "Useful. But it really takes me a lot of time to figure out the relationship between physiology and public health.",
    "Most of the classmates were from the AP program, and therefore they knew better in Physiology basics than us, most of the time only they were able to answer Dr.Yeckel's questions during the class. However, the lectures were still abundant of contents and I learned a lot across the organs working in the body, which was very different from the basis of epidemiology or biostatistics, and a more medical basis of understanding our health issues.",
    "I really like the idea of incorporating physiology in public health, and think that this course did that very well.",
    "There is a lot of opportunity for out of the box thinking and freedom to apply physiology to your specific public health interests. That being said, I didn't really learn much about physiology and the assignments were very vague and did not add to any learning about physiology. This is something that should be taught like a straight up science course. Like learning, memorizing, multiple choice tests, etc. Application is nice, but all I did was apply what I already knew, didn't learn anything or apply anything I got from that class. I think a good model would be immunology for public health, that class was basic science taught right for public health.",
    "Good class overall even for APMPH students. Strengths-consistently presented how health can be viewed from a global public health perspective. Focused on broad practical physiologic concepts and ways we might intervene to change the public health course of disease. The material was up to date and topics were relevant.",
    "An adaptive, comprehensive learning experience that reasonably as opposed to overwhelmingly ties physiological function and vulnerabilities to the environment in which we live. Interactive. Concepts can be a bit skewed, i.e. in favor of those with medical background but even an individual with only basic biology would not feel alienated.",
    "About the right amount of work with flexibility most weeks to focus on an area of interest.",
    "The PowerPoint lectures are a bit disorganized. They lack information as well.",
    "A great and interesting topic. The lectures provided great insight on physiology applied to public health - important for researchers to know thee basics of what's going on in the body!!the lectures were long and had a lot of information. It was sometimes hard to grasp the core concepts of each lecture. I would recommend a summary slide\/statement for each lecture. Or to state the learning objectives\/road map at the start of the lectures. Otherwise I thought it was easy to get lost",
    "some testing on structural physiology might be helpful",
    "Great Course, learned a great deal.",
    "Excellent look at the body and how different organ systems can be affected by the presence of disease, chronic or infectious. The frontiers discussions were interesting and much appreciated."

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy is a fantastic instructor! Loved loved loved her class. Extremely approachable and energetic--made me excited to come to class every Wednesday",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She is very interesting and clearly knows a lot about physiology. I appreciated the topics she chose to lecture on, and she made them relevant to public health. Her only weakness might be that she talks very fast, and sometimes it is difficult to keep up (for those of us in the class who are not M.D.s!).",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is very responsible and patient. But I think it is better if she can give us more information of how to apply what learnt in the class (physiology) to the public health world because sometimes I feel confused and find hard to link these 2 together.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0This was the second semester that I learned from Dr.Yeckel after environmental health in the fall semester. I felt like common issues became more complex and interesting after discussions with different backgrounds of people. Every time I felt like my perspectives was broadenthrough the group discussion. Dr.Yeckel carefully commented on our weekly assignments and helped us enlarged our vision when addressing specific research topic.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She is always prepared and so excited about the class. She challenges and welcomes students ideas and is available for help",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel is fantastic. Incredibly knowledgable about all physiological systems and also very good at getting us to think about how physiology ties in to public health.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy is great, super sweet, caring, approachable, open, and she honestly gets to know all her students, which is amazing, and she REALLY loves physiology and teaching, you can just see her light up when she lectures. She gets so excited, it's great. BUT, the only problem is... and I feel really awful saying this... no one ever knows what she's talking about. I think she is in her own little world and looking for very specific things, but giving you the bare minimum to work from. She really tries to make assignments fun, but everything being so open ended just makes for frustration and a lot of wondering \"am I doing the right thing, and am I actually even learning anything?\" The answers are maybe and no. Some people are better at guessing what is expected out of the odd assignments than others. However, I do really like Cathy and think she is wonderful and knowledgeable, but maybe not teaching this class in the best way for the most students.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very motivated to teach and responsive to questions. Friendly, approachable and showed respect to all students. She was flexible and allowed an open forum in the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very knowledgeable, passionate, accommodating, mentoring, eager to engage and learn along with students by indulging classic and well as new materials\/ideas relevant to physiology and pathology.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Excellent. Broad knowledge and an enthusiasm for teaching.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Kathy is a great person. Very approachable. However, there were times when the assignments were very vague. Upon receiving feedback from assignments it seems Professor Yeckel was looking for something very specific, and it was almost impossible to give a correct answer to her vague questions.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy is so great - really enthusiastic and knowledgeable and so great to talk to. She is always coming up challenging\/fun with problems for students to solve\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and is really responsive to studentsas with the point above, she talks a little fast during lectures so it's a little hard to follow everything.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy is super helpful her lecture gave us a better understanding how physiology and PH are related.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy is one of the friendliest and most approachable professors at YSPH. It would help if her questions were more clearly articulated, it was easy to be confused by what she was asking on assignments and in class. Otherwise, she is perfect.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Caring, intelligent (knows the subject matter inside and out).",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very friendly, responsive, and willing to take time to listen to the needs of students. Excellent lecturer and extremely knowledgeable. Answering questions and taking part in class exercises can be difficult sometimes since they can sometimes be very focused and thus have answers that can be easily overlooked."

   "comments": [
    "A great course for learning more about physiology from a public health exposure perspective. A strong background in anatomy and physiology is useful, however, because the teacher talks very specifically at times, so it is easy to get lost without a strong background.",
    "It provided a refreshing global outlook to physiology and how dysfunction in the system can have important public health implications. Yes I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Good for anyone interested in the biological mechanisms behind PH issues",
    "Would definitely recommend. Great complement to other YSPH courses",
    "It is a really good overview of many physiology concepts that are central to public health. It also allows you to research topics that are of interest to you. For these reasons, I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Useful! If you really like physiology, you can take it.",
    "People who are interested in perspectives other than descriptive or analytic courses should definitely join this course and learn something from the medical view point.",
    "Yes, especially if you have a background in physiology or interested in a career in medicine.",
    "I would say if there is another course that interests you, take that. This won't help you with anything. Yes it's easy, but it was very annoying. I did appreciate that I was apply to explore and apply my own public health interests to assignments, but I was never sure if I was really supposed to be doing that, which was kind of frustrating, and I learned nothing about physiology. I did take physiology as an undergrad, so maybe that is why I didn't learn anything. But I think teaching this course as learning physiology as though no one has a background, and also applying physiology to public health topics is too much. Just teach the basics or just promote application to those with a previous background. This course needs a lot of work. Physiology is so vital to public health, we really need to understand the underlying mechanisms for the problems we are working on, but this course did not do that for me.",
    "The course covers broad physiologic systems and how they relate to public health. Approximately 1\/2 of the classroom time is didactic and the other 1\/2 is interactive student group sessions given topics or recently written student papers to discuss. The class requires a time committment of 2-3 hours per week in the form of reading material. Great class to help understand the medical\/biological side of public health.",
    "An adaptive, comprehensive learning experience in the midst of a diverse background of people that reasonably (as opposed to overwhelmingly) ties physiological function and vulnerabilities to the environment in which we live.",
    "Very good for those interested in an overview of physiology in public health.",
    "It's okay",
    "Take this course if interested in root cause analysis of public health issues\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.a great fundamentals of physiology course, as related to health",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "This course is an interesting take on the intersection of public health and human physiology. I would recommend this course to anyone that wants to learn more about the human body, as it will inform future study of disease pathophysiology."
