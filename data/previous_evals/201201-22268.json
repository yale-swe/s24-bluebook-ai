   "comments": [
    "If someone is interested in studying basic Western philosophy, then I would suggest this course. The reading load is heavy, and some of the authors that we read were (for me) difficult to understand at first. However, Professor Edgar was very helpful in this respect: he took the time to go through complicated concepts and to make them understandable, even to the people in the class that didn't necessarily have that much of a knack for philosophy.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who wants to do some in depth exploration and have their mind blown.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course to other people because my writing and understanding of philosophy have improved phenomenally.",
    "Philosophy, particularly for me, was the most intimidating part of the Directed Studies curriculum. Professor Edgar, however, was always there to help make sense of the complex argument that filled the second semester and I know that my success in the class is due to his attention to all of his students. I cannot thank him enough for helping me discover a love of philosophy that I never thought possible and I hope he is around to do the same for you.",
    "Even if you are not interested in philosophy, this class is really interesting and fun!",
    "It's DS....so of course do it. I could not envision my freshman course selection any different.",
    "Definitely. Take it! The reading isn't that bad, and you can still follow what's going on with minimal reading (not that I recommend it), especially when you get a professor like Edgar who goes through each arguments slowly and clearly.",
    "I would highly recommend this class--while some of the works can be very dense and some of the reading very heavy, I feel as if I matured a lot having taken this class, and I have acquired a good baseline understanding of modern philosophy.",
    "Unlike the first semester of Philosophy, you'll be reading many authors in the spring with thorough and unique philosophies. Some seem very insightful (like Descartes and Kant) some are fun to read (like Nietzsche) and others you'll find yourself disagreeing with vehemently (like, for me, Mill and Ayers). All are important to an understanding of the strange position philosophy in which philosophy has found itself in the modern world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I loved being a part of class discussion every day. This class helps you learn to think in a new way which enriches your experience far outside the bounds of this one classroom environment",
    "Yes, its a great introduction to philosophy and will expand your mind."
