    "Would not recommend this course at all. What was billedas an imaginative, technically rigorous, profound creative experience fell short of all expectations. Mark was wildly absent, and the class spent most of the semester working on uninspiring and time-consuming poses and receiving almost no feedback. Our final assignment was a single self-directed painting, and no one felt satisfied with their work. For one of the highest level painting classes available to undergraduates, this course felt anemic the worst of AP art junior year of high school. I could not recommend less."

   "comments": [
    "We used models to act out historical paintings, which was interesting in the beginning, but a little tedious later. I wish we had more time to work on our own works.",
    "Access to live models is a strength but I felt there was too much time spent working on one assignment with the models which slowed down the pace too much. Enjoyed visiting the morgue and going out to paint in different locations of our choosing in New Haven to learn to make work out of the studio, I think this could have happened more frequently or been incorporated into the homework. Would have liked to work collaboratively for a project. Independent work could have started sooner.",
    "The course was strong in Mark's philosophy around art. The things he would tell us about work ethic, details about our work in crits, etc. were super helpful. But the overall frame of the course could be improved because we were stuck completing the same assignments for 3 weeks at a time that it became less engaging. We didn't really learn about narrative building or forming\/finding our own stories like the course was premised. We spent so much time on re-creating old paintings off of model poses instead of engaging with each other and creating work that we cared about.",

    "If you're interested in classical painting techniques and old works, then you'll love this class. If you're looking for new ways to develop narrative and story, then maybe not. We spent a lot of time working on the same projects for 3 weeks at a time. Based off of the first day's exercise I was expecting a course where we dug deep into building narratives and thinking about the bones of visual storytelling, but we often did assignments without feedback and any momentum we built around story\/narrative building would fall off with the next assignment. Mark is a cool guy though, you just have to be prepared for the snarky-ness and for a lot of independent work.",
