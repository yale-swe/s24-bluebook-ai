    "I would take it again looking back, but probably earlier in my career at Yale",
    "Totally. Take this class. You learn how to be a better writer, about the research resources at Yale, and also about the discipline of HSHM.",
    "It varies a lot depending on who teaches it. I'm lucky I had it with Prof. Espinosa.",
    "Absolutely. This course made me a better writer and a better researcher, and it introduced me to a whole new academic field.",
    "This is a great class and it is too bad it will not be required anymore. I would highly recommend this class to anyone, especially to people who haven't felt like they've taken full advantage of the resources Yale has to offer.",
    "Great seminar on historical research, and a fun and interesting way to earn a writing credit."
