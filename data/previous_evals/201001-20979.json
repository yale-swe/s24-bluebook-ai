   "comments": [
    "This is a good class for students with some econ background who don't want to push themselves too hard but still want an opportunity to actually learn.",
    "It provides a useful, policy-centered approach to economics. I would highly recommend to other IR students.",
    "International Relations 659 01 is a course on international economic analysis, covering the major themes of macroeconomics. I would recommend this course to the student of international relations who is seeking to supplement his or her study of international affairs with a general grasp of key macroeconomic principles. This course allows its students a better understanding of why states should make certain economic decisions over others.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class. I would recommend that other students enter with a positive mentality. I felt bad for the professor because students were very whiney about the workload sometimes, which was kind of embarassing.",
    "I would recommend this course for another student",
    "I'd recommend this course. It's a very well-organized and presented intro to macroeconomics.",
    "RECOMMENDED ESPECIALLY FOR IR STUDENTS WITH LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN ECONOMICS",
    "Good introductory course, also suitable for some with limited prior exposure. additional in-depth exposure to critical issues provided. would recommend for the practical application of concepts the course emphasizes and facilitates."

   "comments": [
    "It's clearly a course that helps prepare you for a world where you have to understand what is going on in the national and world economies. It's very applicable regardless of how uninterested in economics you are.",
    "This course allowed me the opportunity to improve my knowledge of macroeconomics, and thereby add to my diplomatic toolbox. The research I conducted for my country report was useful in providing me with in-depth knowledge of my particular country. However, I think that thiscourse would have been more beneficial if organized in the ways proposed above.",
    "I am really glad I took this course; it is not one that I would have taken if it were not a requisite IR course, but I am definitely glad I did. I liked the country report\/test\/problem set balance as well.",
    "It's important for me to understand the basic movements and theories of international economic analysis to understand international relations."
