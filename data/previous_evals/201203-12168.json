    "Great course!",
    "Definitely take it to master the language and acquire a grounding in South Asian language and culture.",
    "This is a great class to take. If you have gotten to the L5 level of Hindi, you should definitely take this class. The workload is the same as the other semesters (maybe even a little lighter) and the things we cover are interesting.",
    "Fun people, wonderful professor. But if you really want to know Hindi you'll need to learn in India.",
    "yes if you want to further your hindi reading. writing and speaking skills",
    "Sadly I would not recommend it. It felt very haphazard and I didn't think that in this particular circumstance it was the most fruitful way to learn Hindi. I would recommend Seemaji as a teacher, but not the class itself.",
    "I would recommend Hindi L5 to everyone. Take it even if you do not need to for the distributional requirement.",
    "Yes, take it if you want to keep improving your Hindi. It is a very small class so you'll have a lot of time to practice your speaking and listening skills with Seema-ji and your classmates, and you will also have a fair amount of written assignments to practice writing. Seema-ji designs the class around 'themes,' such as festivals and Indian culture, marriage, and discrimination, so you will learn about India and work on your Hindi as well. This is the best way to keep up with your language skills."
