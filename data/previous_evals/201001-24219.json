   "comments": [
    "so boring. don't take this class. the QR material, which constitutes 50% of the exams and 100% of the homeworks, is not actually taught in class.",
    "No, unless you actually want to learn about astronomy and have some knowledge of it.",
    "This class was taught very badly. Professor Zinn was monotonous and boring in lecture, and could not hold my attention for longer than 20 minutes. At any point in the class, 70% of the class is either talking to each other, on their computers messing around, or simply asleep. You learn from reading the book, the only point of coming to lecture is to know what will be on the exam. If you don't care about learning about this stuff, don't take the class.",
    "It is an ideal introductory astronomy course because it touches all important topics in astronomy without going in too much detail in any. So if you just want to learn some basic astronomy or are looking for a science credit, I would definitely recommend this class.However, is some one is interested in learning in detail about a specific topic in astronomy, or more interested in practical experience such as using telescopes at the observatory, then this is not an appropriate course.",
    "Boring class about planets and stars. its basically a math class. You dont have to go to class just get notes.",
    "I would recommend it. A little boring but it gets much better at the end.",
    "It's a class meant for someone interested in science - namely astronomy - and with basic math skills, but someone who also isn't necessarily focused on becoming a science major. It gives a great knowledge base of many astronomical and some mathematical concepts.",
    "basic physics with big numbers, and a lot of ridiculous memorization for exams that's a real pain",
    "This class is much more work than you would think. Lecture is not very helpful in preparing for homework assignments or for exams. Most of the burden is placed on each student carefully reading the text book and doing the homework, which takes a good amount of time and patience.",
    "It's pretty much just an overview of basic space stuff. I would recommend it as an easier science course for people not necessarily interested in chem or physics. If you're looking for hardcore intellectual stimulation though, this may not be the class for you.",
    "No I do not recommend this class it was awful",
    "I would not recommend it, and for a required QR there are easier classes.",
    "I would recommend this course to one who is uninitiated in the ways of the astronomer but wants to have a taste of astronomy.",
    "I would describe it as a class that basically covers information about the solar system\/stars with a focus on the mathematical calculations.",
    "This course is advertised as an easy QR\/science credit for non-science majors but is actually quite difficult. Be prepared for the course with basic knowledge of physics concepts and you will do much better. The optional sections are helpful for the problem sets but they are not the best way to review for the exams (2 midterms and a final). Zinn can ramble in lecture without concisely explaining the concepts so make sure to read the textbook. I thought the class would be more interesting and cover specific information about the planets but the concentration of the course was basic physics applied to astronomy.",
    "Only take this class if you need a QR\/SC credit or you want a very basic introduction to astronomy. If you are good at science, this probably is not for you. I would reconemnd it in the above case, it is enjoyable and interesting.",
    "It is a simple class that will be often boring and occasionally really cool. The math is easier than high school, and you'll spend time learning things you learned in middle school. But that's good for the non-majors this class is geared towards.",
    "Astro 110 is not about planets and stars. It is about the chemistry and evolution of stars. If you like chemistry and physics and are curious about the make-up of stars and their lives, take it. If not, this is definitely not for you.",
    "NOOOO DONT TAKE IT EVER!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Take this class only if you really need QR or Sc credits.",
    "Well taught. Interesting material.",
    "Good survey class. Do not take senior spring. Can be boring, but is a good SC.",
    "good qr",
    "It's a good course for non-science majors interested in astronomy.",
    "If you need to take a QR or Science take a different course.",
    "A guttiest of guts that is a delightfully tedious way to get a QR credit. At least the pictures are pretty.",
    "This is a really good class if you want a fairly easy course on an interesting subject. The problem sets aren't too difficult, and if you go to the lectures, the exams are pretty straight forward. Good science credit if you're interested in Astronomy.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class to fulfill a QR or a science distributional requirement. The weekly problem sets were often a pain but the class was not overly difficult and I learned some really cool things about the universe.",
    "Good science credit. Not as easy as it sounds. Need to put in a lot of work to do well. A lot of work with a problems set each week and chapters to read.",
    "no",
    "I would recommend Astro 110 to someone who wanted to knock out a QR or science requirement. It wasn't an exceedingly interesting class, but one could do worse trying to satisfy a requirement\/.",
    "Not a bad way to satisfy a science req",
    "DONT EVER TAKE THIS UNLESS YOU ARE AN ASTRO NERD",
    "I took this class solely to fulfill my science requirement, but even for non-science majors I still wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Take this class only if you have taken and have a strong working knowledge of physics and chemistry. I would recommend this class to someone who actually enjoys the material.",
    "Sure - get your sc\/qr, and get out. But I have heard that there are easier classes.",
    "Survey course on the evolution of stars and planets",
    "Only take this class if you absolutely need a SC credit and are not a science person. There are certainly better QR courses. I will probably not take another astronomy course at this school.",
    "It is not a easy science credit. I would have taken something else.",
    "science credit that requires a lot of work, but all easy enough",
    "Astro 110 was certainly a doable science credit, but it was by no means a fly-by class. The weekly problems sets did take time and the tests were not always the easiest.",
    "Astro 110 is a good course for somebody who is looking for an interesting QR or science. I was interested in astronomy in high school. It was a nice course to review my knowledge.",
    "Don't expect this class to be interesting or intellectually fulfilling at all. It's easy if you have a decent background in math and if you're willing to memorize things for tests. Also, don't expect it to significantly improve your math skills\/ knowledge. Overall, it's one more reason why the core curriculum at Yaleoften turns out to be a waste of time.",
    "No - it's a tough class that isn't taught well",
    "This course was terrible. I love astronomy and have taken an astro course before, but this was just poorly taught. Take JEFFREY KENNEY AT ALL COSTS because Michael Faison sucks, too.",
    "DO NOT take this class if you are looking for an intro QR the way it was taught this semester. ASTRO 110 by Professor Zinn is a challenging course for someone who does not have a math or science\/problem-solving background and really SHOULD NOT be a QR for which you don't need prerequisites the way it is taught.The work load is heavy and material covered in problems sets presupposes problem-solving knowledge since Professor Zinn really only went over problems in class (and even then to a very limited degree) after 40% of the class got worse than a C on our second midterm which he said he was not curved. He also made condescending comments about how people did shockingly worse on the problem sets than on the test which I think should have clued him in on the degree to which people were dependent on tutors and the weekly extrahelp sessions to be able to handle the problems and apply course material to them since they were poorly taught.I took CHEM 118 before taking ASTRO 110 and if I hadn't I'm not sure I would have understood the psets\/ been able to do well in the class. maybe it was better than tech world but if you're looking for an intro QR I say avoid this class.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. If you are not a physics buff or an astro major, stay away.",
    "This is a great course if you want an introduction to astronomy and if you have only a little interest in how our universe works, this class will be entertaining and enjoyable. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in science.",
    "Introductory astro course. Definitely not a gut QR, so don't be fooled. Really interesting stuff with some semi-challenging mathematics to go along with it.",
    "A used-to-be-gut class that looks at basic astronomical subjects: figuring distances, evolution of stars, evolution of the universe, etc.",
    "WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. TAKE SOMETHING, ANYTHING ELSE.",
    "Astronomy 110 is an excellenct way to fulfill either a QR or a science credit and doesn't use up too much of your time. Also, the subject matter is great and you'll learn a lot of interesting things about the universe and our solar system that you'll be able to use and impress your relatives. I've also taken ASTR 120 with Professor Kenney in addition to this course, and I think that this course is slightly easier and can be used to gently ease yourself into astronomy before taking the higher level course. Overall, this is a great course and doesn't require too much work!",
    "It was a lot of work, and really boring lectures. I would recommend it to students who are really really interested in astronomy, or who are desperate for a QR requirement.",
    "Take this course if you need a QR\/sci and find astronomy even remotely interesting. It can be annoying, but it gets you the credit and you learn some cool things.",
    "if you're willing to put in a low-moderate amount of work and have any remote interest whatsoever, or just need a science class, this class is pretty good.",
    "i wouldn't recommend this course at all. definitely not a gut. take if you're looking for a science credit and actually like math\/physics. not a good QR credit.",
    "harder than expected. the lectures arent as good as the book but the material is interesting",
    "Homeworks suck every week, get's easier as you go on",
    "I would recommend this class to people interested in learning about astronomy because it is a helpful basic intro class that is not too work-intensive. However, if you have no interest in astronomy, you are in for a very long semester.",
    "!0 Homework assignments, 2 quizzes (Definitions, Short answer, problems) and a final (same format plus multiple choice). The work is do-able and the material is not difficult to understand. The observatory assignment is worth taking the class. You have to study for the tests and the problem sets take several hours. Take it for distributional credit.",
    "I only took it because I needed a QR. If you're into astronomy I guess it will be fun, but it is really hard to attend every lecture and stay tuned during every lecture.",
    "It's really hard, don't take it if you're bad at math, take it if youre intrested in astro",
    "If you're looking for a fun class, this might not be it. The work seemed pretty manageable though.",
    "For a non-science major, this class is perfect -- not too much stress, not a heavy workload, and some fun observing activitiesthrown in.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course--it was fun, and yes, the math was way harder than I expected, but no undoable, and i'll bet it's difficult to find many other relatively straight-forward QR courses. It's really great. Just make sure you do the problem sets so that you keep up with everything, 'cause otherwise you fall wayyy behind.",
    "This class was horrible. DO NOT TAKE IT! It is not easy or enjoyable in any way. The material could be cool, but it is made terrible by Professor Zinn. The problem sets are not too bad but the tests are hard! Class is soooo boring - it is barely bearable. Find something else to fulfill your QR, DO NOT TAKE THIS!",
    "do not take this course. terrible instructor, terrible material.",
    "Dont take this class. Explained to be for \"non-science majors\" well its a terrible class.",
    "dont take",
    "False gut! False gut! take intro to cosmology or whatever it's called...i've heard it's easier",
    "Absolutely not. It was very dull. Prof Zinn, though a nice guy, was not a good lecturer. It's an easy QR, but probably not worth it.",
    "Great class. Is definitely not a gut course though. Expect to be challenged, but you come away feeling like you've really learned and accomplished something new.",
    "Do not take this class. Whatever reputation it has as an easy QR\/Sc credit is not worth the pain of listening to the lectures and struggling through problem sets\/exams for which class leaves you unprepared.",
    "I would not recommend it to another student, unless you need a QR requirement like I did.",
    "boring. hard. useless. dont take it.",
    "I think it is a good class overall. While a little boring at times, ultimately I finished the class and felt like I had a good understanding about planets and stars.",
    "Astronomy 110 is a broad overview of modern astronomy. A basic knowledge of astronomy is worthwhile no matter the subject of interest.",
    "ASTR 110 is pretty neat. The material is really interesting and good to know, just to be more educated. The trip to the observatory was really fun. P-sets and tests are easy, TAs are approachable and nice.",
    "Yes if you need a QR or if you have already taken galaxies. It is tough for people not familiar with astronomy or physics.",
    "It was a fun class. I was hoping it would be easy and interesting, but it wasn't as interesting as I had hoped. Though it was pretty easy, if you are actually willing to do the problem set well once a week.",
    "This class is much more difficult than I anticipated. Keep that in mind.",
    "I would not recommend Planets and Stars to fulfill a distributional requirement because there are easier and more interesting science and quantitative reasoning courses.",
    "Oh my god AWFUL. How do you make black holes boring? Honestly. This is a terrible, terrible course. I took it because I had no other option for the SC requirement this term, and that's the only reason you should take it. If at all possible, take Bailyn's course, he's like...night and day a better lecturer.",
    "As the title of this course suggests, this class supplies a broad conceptual and algebraic overview to astronomy. I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students.",
    "I would recommend this class as a fairly simple QR. However, I think the general consensus was that this class was not as easy as everyone thought it was going to be. The lectures were not good preparation for the problem sets, but luckily, the TAs were very helpful.",
    "-you have to work very hard in this class to get an A. You have to take a huge part of your semester working towards that."
