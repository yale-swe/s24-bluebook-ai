    "Take this class if you are either (1) interested in Vietnam or (2) dont know much about Vietnam or anthropology and would like to learn more. I had never taken anthropology before and found this course to be a great introduction. Professor Harms is so awesome! One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "Comprehensive introduction to Vietnam after 1975 and the way anthropologists have engaged with important issues like economy, gender, memory, art, culture and the state.",
    "Great class, delves deep into all areas of Vietnamese society. Professor Harms is extremely knowledgable and dedicated to teaching. Would recommend to anyone interested in Vietnam and Southeast Asian society."
