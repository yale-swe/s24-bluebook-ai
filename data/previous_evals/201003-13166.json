   "comments": [
    "We covered the major genres of medieval fiction while looking at images from the Bayeux tapestry and illuminated manuscripts that went with them. Good amount of reading, but in translated modern French, and 2 papers. Prof. Bloch is entertaining, it's great to be in a seminar with him.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class; the reading is not too cumbersome and there are only two papers! Also, the professor is phenomenal.",
    "A seminar style course (mine had 5 people in it) where you read medieval French literature. Take it, it's amazing! Truly. Even if your not a French major, Professor Bloch will make you like the class. It's pretty much reading King Arthur tales and imagining Robin Hood-like scenes as you read.",
    "If you are considering taking this class, this by itself means you should probably take it. It's fun. You get to read some fascinating works of literature of the XII and XIII centuries that dispel a good number of myths about the French Middle Ages. The class is small (5 students this year), so you should really come prepared to talk each time. The work is not difficult, but the reading load can be uneven.",
    "The course is a solid survey of medieval literature. The course is terrific for anyone wishing to understand the birth, foundations, and early development of the French canon. Unique exposure to ancien fran\u00e7ais."
