    "I would recommend it if you're willing to actually spend time doing the reading. It is very interesting but I sometimes felt like a book a week was a little too much. Otherwise, the class lectures were fascinating to learn about as well.",
    "Epidemics is all about the implications of epidemic disease throughout Western history, and particularly, how distinctions between diseases led to different social\/political\/etc. outcomes. Very interesting, especially for science majors who want to get a feel for the social impact of certain pathologies. Workload is slightly above average: midterm, final, course paper, and weekly reading responses. There's a good amount of reading, but most of it is very interesting! The reading responses can feel tedious, but I agree with Professor Snowden -- they are valuable in leading you to explore new ideas in the texts.",
    "Such an interesting class, one of my favorites at Yale. A lot of reading though.",
    "The course is a great introduction to 9 of the major epidemics that affect western society for 1600 onwards. It's not really about the biological part of the disease but rather the societal and historical impacts that it brings. If you're at all interested in the way that diseases have affected western society, definitely take this class! The workload isn't awful - there are weekly 500 word reading responses and it's a book a week. The books are interesting though so it makes it easier to get through - though i didn't finish all the readings. Besides that, it's one take home midterm, a final paper and a final - as long as you stay on top of your work, you'll be fine. Professor Snowden is awesome - maybe not the best lecturer but he's so genuinely nice and happy. I definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to almost anyone, regardless of level of interest in history or medicine. It's not very much work--just weekly 1-page reading responses, a take-home midterm, a 7-page final paper, and a final exam--and you learn about a whole bunch of interesting things you might not otherwise get to learn about. The readings were varied and (mostly) entertaining, and lectures were usually pretty fun.",
    "this is a great class. i've taken a bunch of HSHM courses even though its not my major and this is my favorite. interesting topic, great prof. snowden is amazing. so personable and his epidemics breakfasts were so cute. he is really understanding and makes everything really interesting and easy to pay attention to in class. the workload isn't too bad, just weekly reading responses that basically boost your grade, a midterm, final paper, and final. the reading seems a bit heavy (about a book a week), but its not always totally necessary to read every single page",
    "An incredible survey of the history of the major epidemic diseases which I would recommend to a fellow student.",
    "Yooo this ish perfect if you a premed tryna get yo HU credit on. You learn about diseases and get to read some pretty good books in the process. Granted, history is annoying, and you will have to learn dates, but it doable. It's not really a gut, so be prepared to put some work in. Having said that, you don't need to do ALL the reading to get by. Slash if you do,the people in your section probably won't like you. Take it though. You'll like Professor Snowden, even if looking at photos of smallpox pustules at 10am ain't yo thang.",
    "Yes recommend definitely. Not too too much work plus super interesting as long as you're interested by disease.",
    "If you're at all interested in epidemic diseases, take it! It's a lot of reading with 1 book per week, but it is definitely one of the most fantastic courses I've taken at Yale - and so eye opening.",
    "Take it! Take it, you will come out having learned a lot and having experienced a very organized, very well-thought out course. Totally diff perspective on history!",
    "Yes. Please do yourself a favor and take it. Every single lecture will leave a deep impression in your mind.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student! As someone who's background in history isn't very strong, I found this course really accessible, and also a really great way for me to learn history through the study of epidemic diseases.",
    "Take this class! The subject is absolutely fascinating- who doesn't want to learn about devastating diseases and how they have impacted populations? Frank Snowden is a great lecturer, every lecture is really exciting, I was always eager to go to class. The class has been taught many time so its well organized and runs very smoothly. The class is also super chill, it's a great 5th class. There really isn't much work and all the work that you do is incredibly enjoyable.",
    "This was a very interesting and fun course! the lectures are engaging and keep you interested. There's a lot of reading, but the books are very good and it's not painful reading. The reading responses are fairly short and pretty easy.",
    "Take it! Not as a fifth class b\/c it's a lot of reading, but it's a great overall view of epidemics. Grading is pretty fair but you'll want to make sure you're on top of all the readings.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!I was on the fence about taking it...Snowden seemed a little dry in the first couple lectures and I wasn't immediately compelled by the material. BUT I AM SO GLAD THAT I ENDED UP TAKING IT.This class gives an extremely comprehensive overview of the major epidemics in western society, which is pretty vital and interesting information to have, but it also details how the practice of medicine has changed in the past 400 years, which is a lot. It was incredibly enlightening to learn about how our ancestors viewed health and sickness, and how that affected entire cultures and societies. This class changed the way I thought about the world.Snowden's lectures are extremely rehearsed,but they are also extremely good. The readings are heavy and sometimes dense, but also extremely rewarding...you don't have to do all of them, but if you end up taking the class make sure to find time to read \"Journal of the Plague Years\", \"My Own Country\", \"Conquest of Malaria\", \"No Magic Bullet.\" Those are all really good.The tests are really fair, and in the end it isn't too much work.Loved it, so glad I took it, made me want to be a history major.take it.",
    "This class gives a good overview of epidemics and public health responses to them throughout modern history. Most of the readings are really good, and if you don't find one to be particularly interesting you can sort of pick and choose what chapters to read and write about. There is a midterm, a final paper, a final, and weekly reading responses thoughout the semester. If you keep up with the readings and go to lecture, the work is not overwhelming at all.Overall, it is a good and interesting class, especially for someone without a strong history background (a number of pre-meds take this class).",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "Definitely recommend. If you have any interest in the historical\/sociological side of medicine, this is a very worthwhile course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was interesting but not overwhelming. There are weekly reading responses for books and an occasional movie to watch. The material related directly to the lecture and the midterm and final were not bad. This has been one of my favorite classes so far at Yale.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in history, public health, and medicine. It will introduce you to important core concepts and give you the opportunity to learn under a great Yale lecturer.",
    "The class is a study of the history of epidemics and disease in general focusing on about nine specific diseases and several different movements and ideas\/theories.",
    "YESSS! TAKE IT!",
    "Interesting class, stuff you usually don't learn about and liked learning about it in a historical context. Lectures are generally interesting and well organized. They could get pretty boring though.",
    "An excellent survey of the major epidemic diseases that have stricken Western societies since the bubonic plague. The course focuses on the social, political, and economic facets of disease, on how they are constructed inthe public's eye, their sociopolitical implications, etc. The material is incredibly fascinating, and Snowden does a great job tying everything together - if you're interested in how disease has impacted society, TAKE IT, it's absolutely incredible.",
    "I enjoyed this class. Not too much work, and a good opportunity to get a good, general understanding of many epidemics. The readings would theoretically be a lot of work, if you were to actually do them.",
    "It's a lot of work (reading), but you'll learn a lot. Snowden is a great lecturer (and the lectures are also on OYC). Reading responses are a real pain, as is section -- but lecture is good.",
    "Very interesting, as a historical look at how certain diseases affected Western society, and especially how people at the time socially constructed those diseases. A little bit of the science and the disease symptoms were also taught, but not emphasized. There's a lot of reading and a reading response due each week, but it was easy to answer the reading response prompts without doing all of the week's reading. Overall, I think it's a good class to take and I'll actually remember the stuff I learned from it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the field of public health or history of medicine and diseases. The workload is lite, but the knowledge gained is interesting and useful. You hit all of the major diseases in lecture, and then the final project allows you to choose your favorite of the course and read an additional book on that topic. I thoroughly enjoyed the class overall.",
    "TAKE the course. Snowden is amazing, endearing, and interesting. He speaks in a manner that is both informative and intriguing. Don't miss class on Halloween.",
    "Definitely take this class!! I loved it! Snowden is great and the material is very interesting. There is a lot of reading (about a book a week) but they are all really interesting and many take the form of novels whichever them easy to read.Some weeks the requirement is to watch a film instead. The course load is manageable outside of the reading and the class is amazing. Highly recommended",
    "I enjoyed this class and I would definitely recommend it. As a pre-med MCDB major, I think this course really helped fill in a lot of my knowledge gaps about the social experience of disease and the fascinating history of epidemics. The readings and films are generally very interesting.",
    "yes, loved the material.",
    "If you want to work hard and learn a lot about epidemics.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. I found the class especially interesting as a biology major because it but my scientific understanding of disease in context. There's a lot of reading but it's mostly very interesting. If you're interested in disease and or public health I would strongly recommend this class."
