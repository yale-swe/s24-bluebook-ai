   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student-it's very interesting and the workload is very manageable.",
    "The junior colloquium is a fun experience. You get to spend time with the other majors and hear from a lot of professors from diverse fields that are affiliated with the cognitive science department. Obviously it is required but you should look forward to taking it.",
    "Chill required class for Cogsci juniors. You hear someone from the department lecture every week and it's pretty interesting because you get such a wide breadth of research and topics. Really short weekly response",
    "A great survey of the literature going on in different cognitive science disciplines.",
    "Obvi required course so you don't have a choice. If you did, I would not recommend it, but because you have to take it, it is good for a required course.",
    "Great class to learn about different aspects of cog sci.",
    "Overall, it's a perfectly fine class. Necessary for the major, teaches you a lot about the different areas of Cogsci to help you pick out your thesis.",
    "You gotta take it if you're a Cogsci Junior. You meet once a week, listen to professors talk about their current research, and ask questions. Homework is a reading response, and there is a 2 page (double space) paper due at the end of the semester.",
    "Extremely lax. Might be a lot of repeat if you're already up to speed with the cogsci-related research around Yale, but you do get a chance to pick the brains of professors who would typically be giving a guest lecture to ~300 people in an intro psych or intro cogsci class. Work is minimal maybe about a quarter credit's worth.",
    "It's required for Cogsci majors, so you don't have much choice. That being said, it's a series of pretty interesting lectures that give you a good sense of what some cogsci professors are doing. Some of the lectures felt like recaps of modules from Intro Cogsci and thus were less interesting.",
    "You have to take this for the major -- it's relatively easy and some of the lectures are fascinating. It's definitely possible that you might find a thesis advisor among the lecturers. If not, this class does a good job of prompting you to think about your thesis and reach out to potential advisors.",
    "I'd recommend it to someone who's interested in learning a bit about a wide array of things that are going on in Cog Sci. I had already sort of focused in on what I want to study...so I wouldn't recommend it to someone like that. But if you're a cog sci major you have to take it. So enjoy what you can! It's very easy....it just felt like a waste of time."
