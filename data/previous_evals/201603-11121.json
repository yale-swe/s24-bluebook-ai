    "The course was excellently prepared, and I felt like the material was presented in both a logical and engaging way, but I think discussion could have been better serviced had more students had greater ability and familiarity with the formal elements of some of the pieces we discussed. Because many were not art history majors and\/or had not taken art history courses before (myself included) I felt the discussions weren't as dynamic as they could have been.",
    "Strengths: learn a lot, seminar setting which helps discussions Weaknesses: no feedback on writing through the semester, but were blog posts so i guess feedback not needed?"

    "yes! very interesting, especially learning about how Black British art has changed through the decades"
