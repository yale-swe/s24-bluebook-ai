    "Yes! Especially with Annika Rosanowski.",
    "Absolutely fantastic class taught by an absolutely fantastic teacher. Learning a language will never be easy, but Annika made it fun and enjoyable at every step. She is a remarkably good teacher--clear, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable. And she's also just a wonderful person--very kind, friendly, and energetic. I can't recommend taking German from her enough.The class had a very manageable amount of work--not trivial, but definitely not intense (and much less than some language classes at Yale). The tests were straightforward, and it was always clear what they would cover. A few tests were moderately difficult, but never unreasonably so. Personally, I really appreciated the textbook, which had fantastic explanations of the new grammar at the end of every chapter.Overall, if you're interested in learning German (or looking for a new language), I strongly recommend this class. You'll learn an astonishing amount of German in just a semester, and have a great time doing so.One bit of advice: attend cultural events early on. They're fun, very relaxed, and you need only three, but it can be difficult to fit all of them in if you wait until last minute to begin attending them.",
    "German 110 01 is very interactive. We practice a lot of speaking in class which is very helpful. We are required to go to three cultural events, and those help creating chances of exposure for students."
