   "comments": [
    "Best, most time-consuming, and most rewarding class I've taken at Yale. Let me emphasize again that this class is time consuming: I spent about 50% of my time this term learning programming for this class, and it did affect my performance in other classes, so beware. If you've never programmed before, there's going to be a steep learning curve.But Professor Geha is great, and the setup of the class is great. Arecibo was great too. If you're going to be an astro major, take this class sooner rather than later, because programming is essential to all astronomy research.",
    "Leaves much to be desired. Lectures were full of bad science. Problem sets were inconsistent; the midterm was handled even more negligently. The trip to Puerto Rico was great, and the programming assignments could be very cool when they were clear, but this was rare. Very little Python was actually taught, and statistical techniques were sketchy. It would have worked well as a survey course, but doesn't provide the rigorous lab experience it claims to provide. Stay away if possible.",
    "Though the material itself was interesting, I found that the class was very poorly taught. The notes were filled with mistakes, and many concepts were explained unsatisfactorily and with gaping holes in intuition. In particular, the course was unsuitable for teaching astronomy lab techniques. Updates to the problem sets were made very close to the deadline, which was unhelpful and hard to deal with.The instructor seems extremely unprepared to teach this class. The midterm was very long and featured ill-defined problems. The course also advertised itself as a way to learn Python. However, no Python was taught during lecture. I feel like I learned very little throughout the semester. The class field trip was the only high point of this entire course. I would NOT recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "If you know Python, you will be fine. Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend that you learn the language before taking the class. It will make your life much easier. The science we do is great, but I didn't walk into the class with the appropriate skills, which made it difficult to enjoy the content.\" Learning\" is less of a goal in this class than \"doing\" is. We don't really learn how to do science in class; we just learn through many mistakes.",
    "A challenging class--don't be fooled. If you are interested in astronomy or programming, this class could be interesting for you to take. The problem sets, especially towards the end of the course, really will take you a lot of time though. And a lot of the necessary coding skills are not taught in lecture, so if you've never programmed before (and the course says no previous coding experience required) then you will definitely need to work very hard to catch up. We went on a three day trip to the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico though over Fall Break and that was really an awesome experience. But, it may not be worth the struggle if you aren't willing to put in the work.",
    "This class is very useful for people interested in research. We did a lot of programming so I highly suggest taking this course after having some programming experience. The trip to Arecibo was absolutely amazing: it taught me so much about astronomy research and was a lot of fun! But some of the problem sets were extremely frustrating and I didn't feel like I was equipped to handle them.",
    "This class was a good introduction to optical and radio observing and astrophysical data analysis. Watch out for the arduous problem sets, though.",
    "Take it! There's a field trip to Puerto Rico! And it's a worthwhile class beyond that as well. Problem sets can be fairly long and somewhat disorganized and confusing in terms of what you actually have to do. However, you're working with actual data on a lot of them, which makes it more interesting (and frustrating). Professor Geha is great, and really interested in making the class a good experience for the students.",
    "Astrophysical Research Methods is an extremely valuable class, even if your major isn't astronomy. While there is a lot of subject-specific information (how CCDs work, telescope optics, etc.), you don't need to know anything about it beforehand (apart from a very basic, high school understanding of math\/science). More importantly, we got practice writing reports of data collection, which I really enjoyed and which are necessary for anyone interested in scientific research of any sort.While the course doesn't list programming as a prerequisite, I would highly recommend knowing something about it before taking the class. The programs you need to write for some of the problem sets aren't extremely difficult, but if you're new to programming they could take a while.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone majoring in Astronomy, Physics, Computer Science, or Math, or anyone with a strong interest in the intersection of those subjects. This course does not require a very deep computer science or astrophysics background, but you should definitely have coding experience beyond just \"Hello World.\"The first half of the semester was spent powering through everything you need to know to observe with optical and radio telescopes, after which we traveled to Arecibo, Puerto Rico. The trip was incredible (and totally paid for by the astronomy department!), even if our results weren't exactly what we hoped for. For the remainder of the semester we analyzed the data from Arecibo and covered other topics like numerical simulations. The midterm exam was pretty fair, and the final project offered a great deal of freedom to work on something you found interesting throughout the semester. Overall, it was a very enjoyable course.",
    "It's a hard class that anyone who plans to major in astrophysics absolutely needs. So you should take it if you're in that position, but DO NOT take this class if you are a freshman, or have never coded before in your life. I took this class as a freshman with very minimal coding experience and I frequently felt like I was way in over my head. I would recommend taking it after doing some research that includes data analysis, or taking an astro class that involved these methods to a certain extent. You'll save yourself a ton of stress.",
    "Just like astronomy. It's deceptively a lot of work. As long as you like the subject (and aren't taking it for a random physics elective, as I was), you'll learn a lot.",
    "The class wasn't bad. A p-set about each week with both a question and programming part, a midterm, and then a final project. There's also a trip to Arecibo, which I definitely recommend if it's still offered. Being able to learn something, and then actually apply it in a research setting really helped to solidify the material, and you get to see what you're learning is actually applicable in the field. A warning though, this class is not designed to teach you programming, but rather to give you the chance to basically learn it on your own, so if you haveabsolutely no programming experience, expect to be doing a lot of self-learning, though the professor provides some great resources for teaching the basics.",
    "ASTR255 covers a lot of topics, such as coordinate systems, optical and radio astronomy, statistics, and numerical simulations. It teaches you some of the techniques that astronomers use today to analyze scientific data, and includes a free trip to Arecibo (Puerto Rico) during Fall Break. Although the material was interesting and Prof. Geha made an effort to make her lectures engaging (especially at the beginning of the semester, when she did a couple of experiments in class), I would only recommend this course to astronomy majors (the majority of students are sophomores and juniors with a strong physics and math background).The class teaches you almost nothing about Python, so if you have little or no experience with programming, you will spend ridiculous amounts of time trying to understand this language instead of investing your time on the actual problem set. The workload is high and it increases significantly by the end of the semester (there is a midterm after the Arecibo trip, in November, and a final project with a presentation at the end of the course). The problem sets are often very long, especially if you don't know much about Python. Be careful with the Pset associated with the Arecibo trip: you will have to write a program in Python to analyze the data (this will probably take you a lot of time), and you will have to do research to understand the results without any guidance. In my year, there was also a PSet due during Reading Period and another due during the week of final exams, so this was extremely annoying. Another negative aspect of the course is the fact that students come with many different backgrounds. Some are CS geniuses, and others have never programmed before (or just a little). This means that some students had to spend more than ten hours working on a problem set, while others could finish it in less than 30 minutes. The course (or rather Prof. Geha and the TAs) did not take this into account, so it was kind of unfair for those who didn't have significant experience in Python. In conclusion, just take ASTR255 if you need it for your major."
