    "As a potential STEM major, I wasn't too sure about taking a WGSS course, but I absolutely loved it. Maria Trumpler is a fabulous teacher and she is so devoted to her students. If you get in, definitely take this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in the subject and want the forum for exciting in class discussion with other students who are as interested.",
    "Yes, it was a tremendous class even and Ms. Trampler is a fantastic, caring teacher. The work load was manageable and the classes were very interesting and engaging.",
    "Cool readings, meaningful discussions and enjoyable, doable assignments.",
    "Definitely take this class! I would honestly call it life changing - I will never think about sex or sexuality the same way ever again. It's a really interesting mix between theory, science, history, and everything in between - no matter what your interests are you're guaranteed to get something out of this class! The reading is interesting and relevant, and it's also entirely possible to participate and succeed with out doing all of the reading. The workload is incredibly manageable, and all of the assignments are interesting and enjoyable!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You read shit like Freud and Foucault (the real meaty stuff), educate yourself on theories of sexuality, and gain an ability to simultaneously recognize and criticize the \"scientifization\" of sexuality as a social construct. It's amazing. If nothing else is convincing, you get to discuss sex on a higher intellectual level. Pretty cool.",
    "A super great class! I learned so much about how we think about sexuality and studying this subject. Dr. Trumpler was amazing, the readings were interesting, and class discussions always engaging. The papers also had interesting prompts and I didn't feel like they were a huge struggle or a chore. Definitely my favorite class this year!",
    "I would definitely recommend history of sexuality to another student. I genuinely enjoyed going to class every day, the readings were not too difficult, and I was really engaged in the papers. Maria also helps you every step of the way, which I appreciated.",
    "A very interesting class. Some of the readings can be dense and confusing by overall you will learn quite a lot about a subject that's not often very discussed. I would definetly recommend it.",
    "Definitely take it! It is a rare class when you really enjoy working on your assignments (which involves looking at the archives in the Yale Manuscripts and Archives and writing a small research paper, even as a freshman)",
    "Your experience in this class really depends on the mix of people who are taking it with you. Overall though, it's a really chill class with some interesting readings. One thing to keep in mind though is that the emphasis is really on the HISTORY of sexuality. There are a lot of old scientific papers and works of theory, no modern gender studies at all. So be prepared for a lot of cissexism and heteronormativity."
