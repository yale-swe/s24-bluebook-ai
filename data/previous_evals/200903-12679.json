    "Yes! The readings are engaging, there are only 4 short papers for the class, and each is interesting to write. It's also an interesting foray into what mainstream America sees as the \"other side\" and how the Muslim American experience has been affected by 9\/11.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. This is a really relevant and important topic today, and this class is a great way to learn about it.",
    "I recommend this class--readings are interesting (might get a little time consuming if you leave them to the last minute, but if you space everything well, you should be fine), gradings pretty good, and prof Grewal is really open to working with students.",
    "I'd highly recommend this class. I thought it was fascinating."
