   "comments": [
    "I think it was a really valuable way to culminate the bio major.",
    "Eh, you know what you're getting into.",
    "If you need easy, doable research experience to fulfill your major, sure take this course.",
    "I had to take it to finish the major",
    "Absolutely. It is an excellent opportunity to pursue your research and really develop a project you're interested in. I wish I had taken research for credit sooner. It opened up a lot of my schedule for working on my research when it actually matters.",
    "If you're taking this, you probably have to take it, and the range of experience depends on the type of lab you work in. I loved my lab, and would recommend it to anybody.",
    "If you want a BS in biology, take this. But in the end you are basically going into lab, then doing a short write up, a poster that in the end is just for fun and not graded, and attending some presentations that give you a chance to learn from your peers.",
    "Thesis class. You spend 10 hours a week in lab, write a 12-15 page report, attend three research presentations, and present you research during a poster symposium (the last of which I thought was a really fun way to end the semester \/ your biology undergraduate career). It was great to see what my friends have been up to in lab. Also, I would say don't worry if you don't obtain significant results - the purpose of this class is to introduce you to the world of research and science often needs more time that the year you spend on it to give meaningful results",
    "Good senior research class",
    "A good experience, make sure you find a lab with a good PI and mentor! It can make a world of difference.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it for any MCDB major. Standard senior research course. If you don't want to spend 20 hours a week doing research, do this course: it's 10 hours per week and much more manageable unless you're taking like 2 or 3 credits and no extracurriculars. Be prepared for vague instructions on the reports...but to do well on this component make sure to meet with your PI WELL IN ADVANCE of the deadline!! This way you can go over what's expected, so they'll grade you well based on what they like. Good research course though: flexible, manageable, you learn a lot. Most of this is all based on your relationship with your PI, so choose a good one, and get a good mentor. 10 hours per week for research, one final report, one presentation, one symposium.",
    "This class is pretty much just research for credit. You just need to find a lab and start a project with them. At the end of the semester you are required to make a 10 minute oral presentation (if you haven't already), a poster, and a 12-15 senior thesis. Your PI has the final say on your grade so it is pretty relaxed.",
    "Have to take this course because it is required.",
    "The experience that you will have with MCDB 486 is heavily dependent on the lab mentor and lab environment that you will choose to complete the course. In my case, I was lucky enough to be welcomed in an absolutely wonderful lab that allowed me to have an outstanding experience. In general, the more time and energy you invest in conducting your research project, the greater the reward you will get out of it.",
    "Well I think the only reasonable review would be on whether or not to take this or intensive. Absolutely take intensive if you have a lab you enjoy and like research. It will really be not at all that much work because to accomplish anything in research you'll be there for the same amount of time as in intensive, but only getting one credit if you take this course. That being said, I came into 486 with a new lab and I didn't know if I would like my project \/ lab \/ anything, so I took the cautious route, but definitely wished I had taken intensive, because I would've gotten credit for the extra time I voluntarily put in. Really, if you have any passion for research, take intensive instead! If you're looking to simply fulfill the senior requirement, this is chill and fun too."
