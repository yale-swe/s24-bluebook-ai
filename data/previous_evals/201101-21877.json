   "comments": [
    "This course is basically an introduction to immunology. You don't really need to know anything about biology to be in it. It's pretty easy, and if you pay attention in lecture you'll be fine. I would recommend this course if you need an easy science credit.",
    "A really awesome class. Even though this is a class designed for non-science majors, don't think this is a gut course. The problem sets take some time to do and the test is hard. Overall, this is course is a great example of what a science course should be at a liberal arts school: educational, challenging, and manageable.",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "A good science class for non-science majors that's not too condescendingly easy. Would recommend for someone wanting a science credit and more knowledge about the immune system. Anyone who has taken advanced-level might find this abit boring.",
    "Overall an interesting course, if you are okay with memorizing large amounts of information. Not extremely applicable to everyday life, but I would say take it if you are interested in immunology and infectious diseases.",
    "It is a really interesting class about diseases, microorganisms, and the way in which the immune system works. It is really interesting to learn about the processes that are so integral to our daily life but that we rarely think about. The class makes it fun and simple to learn. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "If you are a non-science major and want to take a course that has some applicability to life and is good material to know for life, then take this course.",
    "This is better than average way to get a Sc credit, as the material's vaguely interesting and very relevant, it's not super challenging, and you get to write a short paper rather than do a final. That said, Professor Kavathas is not a good lecturer and will drive you mad and confuse you, although she is a lovely person, so be aware of this factand be ready to be incredibly confused for the first half of the semester. The second half is better, with presenters, discussions and student presentations, and there really isn't that much work, so it really is a decent way to get that pesky Sc credit out of the way.",
    "This is honestly the best class I've taken at Yale thus far. This is what ALL science courses should be like and, if they were, premeds would get so much more of a human perspective on all the biological mechanisms they study. Professor Kavathas' lectures are detailed, thorough, and DIRECTLY relevant to current immunological findings. You get a firm grasp of the immune system and then plunge into the mechanisms of several diseases, which makes you not only extremely knowledgeable--and not in the superficial sense--but also confident that you will understand future advancements in treatments of the diseases. Once you get past the comprehensive midterm, which is kind of like a final about all the immunological mechanisms you learn about for the first few weeks, you work on your own research paper about a specific disease--a fun (I know, yeah right, but really) process that truly makes you the expert on that topic.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it as a science credit. A couple problem sets, one midterm, one short paper (2-3 pg), one normal-sized paper (7-9 pg), one presentation. Also, you can breeeeathe after the midterm, as you won't be tested on anything else from lecture. Basically for the last half of the class, all you have to do is choose an immunology-themed topic independently, write a paper about it, and give a presentation about it. And Professor Kavathas is a very nice, approachable person.",
    "We spent the first six weeks learning how the immunse system worked and then took a midterm on that. Afterward, we just listened to presentations by different professors and then students on various diseases. No final!",
    "Great class. If given the chance take it. A great science credit as its an interesting class and the work load is more than manageable.",
    "Yes, best SC credit ever.No final, very non-sciency (although the first half of the course up to the midterm was very sciency).Not much work after the midterm, especially because there is no final.",
    "This is a great science credit. If you took bio in high school and liked it, then this is the class for you. A bit of memorization and you'll do fine. Be sure to pay attention during lectures, but otherwise it's a great course in studying the body's immune systems and the viruses\/microorganisms that interact with it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a non-science student who is looking to receive an Sc credit and learn more about life-threatening pathogens.",
    "An easy science credit. But you won't get very much out of it.",
    "If you need the science credit, go for it.",
    "Yes! It's an interesting Sc course that goes at a good pace and is WAY better than taking Biology or Chemistry with the pre-meds. The course is really designed for non-majors: you will write an essay on a novel, read National Geographic articles, and even analyze art, things that would NEVER happen in a typical Yale science course. Definitely take this if you can.",
    "Pretty simple except the first half of the term. Go to class the first half. Use your 3 allowed absences for the 2nd half of the term."
