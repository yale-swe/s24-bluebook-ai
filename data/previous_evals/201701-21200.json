    "I learned methods of architectural analysis through various lenses. Lectures were very interesting. I also learned model-building skills with a variety of materials, although this was from practice and not from instruction.",
    "I learned how to handle all kinds of machines and materials. I also figured out how to better allocate money\/time for my models.",
    "This class was very good at teaching me how to analyze a building and translate that analysis into a model.",
    "This course was one of the most challenging courses I took at Yale. I was constantly challenged to make analytic arguments on the same building. However, it has definitely opened my mind to see and question every building I see now.",
    "This class was a remarkable introduction to the various skills required for further studio work in the architecture major.",
    "how to analyze a building from different perspective basic concepts of architecture and useful skills in architectural model-making basic Rhino and Adobe skills some architectural history and theory",
    "I began to learn how to analyze a building and also how to bud models both physically and using Rhino.",
    "Analysis of different aspects of the architectural design, in addition to the software, manufacturing, and materials that go into creating models to describe these aspects.",
    "Through this course I learned how to move an idea about a building from drawings and diagrams to a model. The course was an incredibly effective way to learn different ways of analyzing buildings.",
    "I learned how to analyze buildings through model-making. Though I benefitted from the input and criticism of both teachers and classmates, most of the learning that I did was on my own. There was little direction or teaching of the skills required to make models in this class, so all of the practical skills I gained through this course were developed on my own."

   "comments": [
    "I feel very satisfied with my work in retrospect -- I learned a lot and produced models that I'm proud of. However, the organization of the course makes it extremely stressful, particularly in the beginning. There is no direct instruction for how to use materials and make a model, and there's no standard for expectations in the beginning so there's a lot of pressure to make incredible models without having learned how to do it. I also think that there should be as much emphasis placed on the idea behind the model as the product itself. I found that I spent maybe 10% of time thinking about it and 90% physically building. I would've liked the opportunity to spend more time on the conception of the idea. Additionally, I think desk crits were too close to the due date of a model, so students were often told to redo things and then only had 1.5 days to do it.",
    "This class is a good intro in getting students to think spatially. It was often a bit confusing getting mixed feedback from the TA's and the instructor, but at some point you just had to go for your idea. Additionally, you have some introductory workshops at the beginning of the semester but it's mostly trial and error to learn how to use all the machines. The TAs were accessible\/helpful, so that made the process easier.",
    "This was a really intensive course but I do not think that was the problem since all of us knew the time commitment we were making by taking this class. I think the biggest problem some of us faced was the expectation level of the course. Some of us had experience with the softwares we were expected to learn and be able to use on our projects. I do believe all of us made improvement and we all accomplished things that I wouldn't think we'd be able to in 3 months time but at the beginning the differences in what were expected from us and the things we could deliver were very overwhelming.",
    "The course provided plenty of opportunities for exploring original ideas about buildings, and learning the lexicon that surrounds the architectural field, but little was offered in terms of actual instruction for model making and drawing.",
    "This is a high-workload class, but the workload is not always evenly distributed through the semester. Lectures sometimes did not seem in depth enough, and academic aspects of the course took a backseat to modeling.",
    "It is very strong because it is well organized. We completed four different types of models looking at a single building. I also really appreciated the effort on the part of the professor to include many female and minority architects. The course does require a lot of work, which sometimes felt unmanageable and unreasonable. I do not know if there is a solution to this as we learned so many new skills so quickly. The TAs and Professor definitely checked in with us and encouraged us to stay healthy.",
    "I would have greatly benefited from in-class workshops in order to learn how to use the software and how to construct models. Most of the time spent on my own was learning to do so, and while in-class critiques were helpful, class time could have been used more productively as a teaching time."

   "comments": [
    "This is a crazy class! I know if you are considering the architecture major I will not dissuade you from taking it and checking it out yourself. I can only give a huge huge huge recommendation to start working early. If your models are due on Thursday, start thinking about it on Saturday, work hard on it on Monday and Tuesday, so that you can leave studio by like midnight or 1am. Otherwise, you're looking at only an hour or 2 of sleep, and something you're not that proud of for critique on Thursday.",
    "I do not recommend this class to a non-architecture major. If you want to have some crafting experience go to CEID workshops, do not take this class.",
    "Absolutely, the workload is fairly great, however it is very enjoyable work",
    "If you are taking this course, I assume it is for the architecture major. Otherwise, it is a rather intense time commitment, so be prepared for that.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I am not an architecture major but took this course because I love architecture. It was incredibly fulfilling to learn methods of analyzing buildings, and to pick up so many new skills.",
    "Probably not. The class requires you to put in much more work than you get out, and though I learned some techniques for model-making and more about what it would entail to be a professional architect, I think that the class was too focused on the preprofessional aspect of architecture and less about approaching design from an analytic perspective."
