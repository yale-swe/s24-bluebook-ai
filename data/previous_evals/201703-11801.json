    "The class was quite intense...Overall, I think the intensity could be toned down at times about 1015% without any real consequence. But we learned many things that are applicable to how we approach scholarship, within and outside of music. It's very clear why it's a staple of the curriculum.",
    "Strengths include a good balance between breadth of topics and depth of engagement. I always came away from class meetings with a richer understanding of the material.",
    "I appreciated that we read many texts outside the musical field. I appreciated the challenge of the ideas and topics of the course. The reading list was thorough though at times too demanding. I would skip the Taruskin or do a shorter excerpt."
