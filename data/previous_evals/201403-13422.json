    "Yes. It's a great addition to a schedule because it makes you exercise a muscle you don't use in your normal day to day school work. I started to see the world a little differently. You also learn about all the awesome resources at the DMCA. I just in general feel more literate in photography, editing, photoshop etc. You do have to be willing to spend the time shooting because it's not negligible.",
    "Yes take this, it was fun and teaches some basic ways of seeing and thinking that are applicable to everyone.",
    "You have to take pictures so of course you're going to become a better photographer, but a lot of it is self-instructed learning so the course has room to grow for sure if the professors could view each class as a workshop to teach us different ways to take and edit pictures, rather than just view other famous photographer's work.",
    "Absolutely recommend. It's definitely a time commitment. But the experience of creating art every single week is extremely fulfilling, and the camaraderie of the class is actually a ton of fun. Don't be afraid to get to know the other kids in your section; they're probably awesome.",
    "Fairly good intro class - you do a whirlwind through the technique so that was frustrating. Expect to learn a lot on your own through trial and error. Still I enjoyed the class and learning how to print and to develop your style.",
    "I would -- it was definitely nice to express my creative side after taking several QR courses.",
    "A big EHHHH. A disappointing course and introduction to photography. If you're looking for a section with the lightest workload, then choose this section. If you want to learn anything technical (photoshop, what makes a good photograph), then take this with another professor. Class consisted of almost two hours of watching powerpoint slides of photographs, during which we were hardly able to discuss the merits of the photograph.",
    "Absolutely if you're looking for an art class that will teach you to think critically about photography, the medium, and its history, then take this class. You need to have or make time to shoot, which can be hard (and the reason I put off taking this class for two years), but if you do it's so worth it.",
    "This is a class that you have to be really willing to put the time into outside of class to take a lot of photographs and to spend lots of hours editing and printing. Curran gives you a lot of freedom to take pictures of what you want and to develop your own message. But do not take this class if you want to learn how to take \"pretty\" pictures. This is an art class and not a \"how to use your digital camera\" class. There was a really big focus on learning about photographers and exploring their works. I appreciated the chance to look through tons of photo books in the library, and I was extremely impressed by Curran's knowledge of photographers and his ability to suggest who we individually might find inspiring. Take note that the grading scale in this class is not easy -- so don't expect an A. Not really sure what it takes to get an A in the class. But overall, I really did enjoy the class and the discussions that we had. I also really enjoyed getting to know the rest of the students in the class as we spent hours in the lab printing."
