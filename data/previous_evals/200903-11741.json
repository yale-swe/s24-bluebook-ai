    "French 125 is an intensive introductory immersion course. Only take it if you're prepared to work HARD throughout the semester. It's extremely rewarding though, and you'll become very close with your classmates. I would definitely recommend it to someone who wants to learn to speak French.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if he\/she is interested in mastering the French language and willing to work hard.",
    "OH MY GOD SO MUCH WORK. It's worth 2 credits but honestly, it's WAY more work than even 2 classes combined. test every week, 1 composition a week plus its revisions. then the final project is basically to write, produce, and act in a full-length feature filmbut without a doubt, i would take this class again. it's so rewarding to speak french so quickly and mme sherak is amazing. i guess the ta's are kind of a toss-up but whatevs. also i think the people in our class were just like, more amazing than usual so that was a plus.so yes, i would recommend the class to another student given that you're a) good at languages (really, honestly evaluate yourself on this. everyone says they are but very few actually are. i mean like, how quickly can you learn and apply the present subjunctive? more than one day? too bad, this class moves too quickly) and b) PREPARED TO WORK YOUR ASS OFF.but so, so rewarding.",
    "Yes, but only if you're very much wanting to learn french because it is a lot.",
    "This is an INTENSIVE course. You will learn a lot of French very quickly. It is well-organized and at the end you will be amazed how much you know.I would recommend ONLY if you clearly understand that it is a huge amount of work \u0096 you really cannot a lot of other things along with it! With that caveat, I strongly recommend it.If you are just looking to learn some French but want to do several other things to then I recommend you not take this Intensive version.",
    "it will take over your semester.classes almost2 hours each day.tests every tuesday night. they are like 80% oral\/aural (AKA DIFFICULT).but, on the bright side,its a great experience.you will leave having learned A LOT of french.no final is a plus.",
    "Take this class if you really want to learn French, because if you put in the work you will gain an outstanding foundation for speaking it."
