    "I would recommend this class 100%. Seriously, TAKE IT. It is the best foreign language credit at Yale and also probably one of the best classes of any kind that you will ever take. Not only is Professor Erol (Etem Bey or Hocam, as students call him) the BEST LANGUAGE INSTRUCTOR EVER (incredibly knowledgable, so passionate about Turkish, an amazing teacher, and also just a hilarious, wonderful human being), but you will legitimately learn how to speak Turkish (a very important\/valuable language) without even knowing you're doing it. Professor Erol doesn't assign homework every night, nor does he have test\/quizzes every week or stupid dialogues\/projects or anything like that. He also doesn't refuse to speak English in class, which means you can actually ask questions freely and get answers that are clear\/help you learn. The class is so much fun that you won't even mind having to go every day (actually, you'll look forward to it). And by the end of the semester, you will be amazed at how much you know with seemingly no effort. Also, Ozge is the best TA I've ever had for any class, period. She was so helpful, always available to answer questions, really knew her stuff, and was super creative with lesson plans (when we played Turkish Taboo people were laughing so hard that we had to stop the game a few times). Bottom line: DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you want to actually learn a new language.",
    "Incredibly taught course with many great scholarship opportunities.",
    "Learn a language that is under taught and underrated at Yale. This department will give you fantastic attention, and there is much opportunity available."
