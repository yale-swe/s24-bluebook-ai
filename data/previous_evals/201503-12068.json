   "comments": [
    "Fascinating course. In the end you do not have to do all the reading, but doing so seriously enhances the course. Mme Girard knows seemingly everything about art and literature in Paris during the 19th century.",
    "This course is fairly difficult but very interesting. There is a lot of assigned reading and several lengthy papers to write, so it is not worth taking if you cannot really do the work required. Prof. Girard is a very thoughtful professor and gives her class and students a lot of attention. Her lectures are detailed and interesting, although can be a bit confusing at times. This class is a great way to practice writing in French as well, although you may not get a ton of speaking practice.",
    "Definitely take this if you're interested in art history, Paris, or French painting and literature! Be prepared to write two solid papers and a final paper, but if you show you're interested in the material you should be fine."
