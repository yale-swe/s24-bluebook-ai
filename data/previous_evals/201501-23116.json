   "comments": [
    "If you don't mind writing lab reports, this class is a good way of knocking out an MENG credit and a writing credit in one. Professor Brown is a good lecturer, and the experiments are generally a good way of improving understanding of fluid and thermodynamics.",
    "If you are a mechanical engineering major you should 100% take this class. It would be kind of hard to take without having taken fluids and thermo, but definitely doable.",
    "I thought this lab was very well done. The labs were interesting and Professor Brown provided a lot of guidance. It was clear that the objective was to have the students grasp the material instead of just assigning really long and tedious lab reports. Overall a very interesting, informative, even enjoyable, lab experience.",
    "While this course hasn't had a great reputation in the past, it has improved dramatically, and has been one of my favorite courses in the major so far. The technical reports take a lot of time but are not unreasonably long. The first few were challenging, but eventually, it becomes natural. Additionally, the practical experience was great. I haven't worked in a lab at Yale and felt that this course was much more demanding and interesting than the introductory physics lab courses. You actually get to use wind tunnels and play with engines. I would recommend this class to anyone who would like hands on experience in their engineering education.",
    "This class is a substantial amount of work with 12 labs and a lab report due every week. Fortunately, you can pick your own lab partners. The labs themselves are pretty cool and practical; for example, you use a wind tunnel and demo a turbojet. Overall, the class is reasonable with Brown.",
    "It's not the most interesting, but sort of, and not too bad. It's not a ton of work, though more than most classes. You probably have to take it, but if you're not ABET Mech E, it's probably not worth it.",
    "One of the nicest classes I took at mechanical engineering at Yale. There are weekly lab reports, which can be a bit exhausting, but the labs are awesome! I really enjoyed the experiments, it is a very good class to put into practice lots of fluid mechanics and some thermodynamics. By the way, if you do take this class, you will get tired of seeing Reynolds numbers.",
    "A required course. Find a friend who took it last year to tell you about the grading rubric or else you'll be super frustrated the whole time.",
    "This lab is a crash course in writing technical reports for mechanical engineers that will walk you through the tools needed to analyze basic fluid mechanics, wind tunnel dynamics, calorimetry, engine cycles, and even how to build a basic solar cell. The course was awesome and I would certainly recommend it to mechanical engineers who want to write like an engineer.",
    "I actually kind of liked this class. I felt like I got the opportunity to more fully understand concepts I only sort of undeerstood in classes like fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Tech reports were managable, but it was frustrating that it felt like it did not matter how well you did your analysis, just if you followed the rules in presenting data. The grading from TA to TA also seemed like it may have differed a bit."
