   "comments": [
    "This course makes you more comfortable with the concepts you learn in ECON 131, and gives you a better sense of what empirical economics is really about. I feel like I'm a better Economics major for taking this course. Prof. Meghir is a great guide to the subject: he's a clear lecturer, and was accessible outside of class as well.",
    "Econ 132 covers the theory behind using statistics to analyze data sets of economic interest. It covers the theoretical underpinnings of basic econometric methods, particularly OLS, and develops this with ways to deal with complications in data, such as endogeneity and heteroskedasticity.",
    "It's a good next step to Econ 131. Not the best, nor the worst econ course out there.",
    "This course was a solid followup to ECON 132. We cemented a lot of the fundamentals and delved into further depth, as well as introducing interesting new concepts. There was a decent amount of Stata as well. Take this course if you are interested in continuing with Econometrics, but know that it's going to be a bit of a rough and somewhat dry ride.",
    "Econometrics 2 is a comprehensive review of several statistical models used in data analysis. Material is definitely technical and can be challenging at times (though the class exams weren't particularly difficult provided you learned it), but it is useful especially if you intend to do economics research\/write a senior econ paper. If you have little interest in statistics\/are intimidated by greek letters, this might not be the course for you (as I have discovered for myself), but nevertheless I have found the knowledge to be incredibly useful in reading papers for other economics classes a lot of the data analysis makes more sense after having taken the course. It's not the most interesting course, but it's definitely useful.",
    "Take the course if you think you're interested in Metrics. Don't expect in depth analysis of topics. If you want to do that, take 136. 132 covers a lot of topics but gives a broad overview of all of them. It gets busy sometimes, be prepared to work for submissions. Tests are very reasonable.",
    "Avoid it I'd you can",
    "ECON 132 focuses on regression analysis in the contexts of economics. While proofs are introduced in lecture, they are not covered on exams (which instead test the underlying theory and results). You cover a variety of areas - instrumental variables, panel data, randomized experiments, etc. The topics are often elucidated with real experiments\/studies, many of which were performed by the professor himself. There are weekly problem sets, two projects, a midterm, and a final exam. I would definitely recommend the course if you are interested in statistics. If not, you might not find that much enjoyment in the material.",
    "ECON 132 was unnecessarily stressful and is not worth taking unless you are extremely interested in the subject. I took it thinking it was a requirement for the major, and when I found out it wasn't, I deeply regretted it.",
    "Tough class but definitely gives you a better (very deep) understanding of stats and how to read papers.",
    "I would personally not recommend this course. Professor Meghir is not an amazing lecturer and it seems like he doesn't care about his students.. To be fair, he is EXTREMELY smart, and his sense of humor is pretty great (see: dry). However, I simply did not his lecture style, and the homeworks were such a drag. The material is fun and useful, but the class pretty much turned me off to Econ. All in all, shop it. See if you like it.",
    "I definitely recommend ECON 132. This class has direct applications both to academic work in the quantitative social sciences (not just economics) and to policymaking. The practice with Stata on problem sets and empirical projects will prove valuable for both senior essays and future internships\/jobs. My only small complaint is that a bit more time could have spent on experimental\/research design for people thinking about how to conduct research for senior essays, which I hope will be added to the course next time. Professor Meghir put emphasis on labor economics in all his lectures, which made the course stronger and more engaging (for me at least). So, all in all, I recommend taking it!",
    "Take only if you have very interested in Econometrics. Pros: - Good overall introduction to econometric methods - Good balance of theory and practical application Cons: - Not rigorous enough to be used in a real setting - Expectations of Prof. and TA are unclear for almost any assignment For those obsessed with grades, it's a tough curve.",
    "Worth taking with Meghir. The course is VERY FRONT HEAVY. Work hard in the beginning and it will pay off for the rest of the semester. Hopefully there will be a better TA next time.",
    "It may not be the most interesting class, but you end up learning a lot of useful metrics skills.",
    "Horrible class. Dont'take it. Tons of work, arbitrary grading, a teacher that doesnt'care. I would rather have 10 sting rays stab me in the eyes while a wild buffalo jumps on my stomach than have to take this class ever again."
