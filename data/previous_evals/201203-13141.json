   "comments": [
    "It is really interesting to head about a wide variety of research going on here on campus. It helped expand my knowledge about different science areas other than my interest.",
    "It is a fascinating and enjoyable class; definitely one any potential science major should take if they are interested at all in interdisciplinarity. The workload is almost nonexistent, so it is easy to take along with a work-heavy course schedule.",
    "If you are a freshman who wants to be a science major but doesn't know what kind of science, this is the class for you! The point of the course is to see a wide variety of science and engineering to decide what kind you like, so keep that in mind, because the lectures are hit or miss (as they should be) - the ones you personally find interesting, you should consider pursuing as a career, and the ones you don't, you can cross off the list! The workload is tiny because it only meets once a week.",
    "It gives exposure to many different subjects in science that you definitely would not have investigated otherwise, and helps to broaden your general knowledge of the sciences. If you're not super positive on what you'd like to study in science, I would recommend this course.",
    "Just the discussions were worth it for me, but I heard that our discussion section was exceptionally awesome! If you are interested in other people's research, this is a great course.",
    "Perspectives, in the fall semester at least, is almost no work at all. The lectures every other week are usually very interesting. The discussions, though, run a little bit too long and aren't as lively as they should be. We often don't have the expertise necessary to make interesting arguments, since we've only learned about a topic for one lecture and a few journal articles before we move on to something else. Despite these flaws, I'd still recommend the class. It's a nice way to meet other freshman who are interested in science and engineering, and the research funding next summer should be a huge plus. Besides, I doubt anything else that productive happens on Friday afternoons from 1:30 to 3, so it's a nice way to end the class week.",
    "If you jump with joy when you hear science talks on a variety of topics, take it. Not much work. I definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it, not many people have the opportunity to be in a seminar like this, even if it is on Friday afternoon. The research opportunity and money at the end of the class is what kept me in the class.",
    "Every other week we hear lectures from various distinguished members of the science faculty at Yale. On the intermittent weeks we discuss what we learned and talk about the implications of the latest research. It's a great course!",
    "Science 198 features a very broad overview of the sciences. The workload for the class is very light, and doesn't feel like a real class sometimes. i would recommend the class to another student if he\/she lacks another half credit and wants to explore a small selection of the sciences.",
    "yes if you would like to do research over the summer",
    "I would recommend it for those looking to hear about a bunch of different topics in science. If you have a specific interest in mind to study, this class might just feel like an extra 0.5 credit weight on your schedule. I'm taking this class for the exposure to research.",
    "yes, it exposes you to new fields and potential interests",
    "Yes and no. Yes because you learn a lot. No if you get a \"bad\" section.",
    "Not as great as it sounds, but still worth taking if you're actually interested in research. Lecturers were very engaging and the workload (lecture questions) is low. Discussion sections were generally disappointing though - always felt too long and the differences in background knowledge made the experience frustrating - oftentimes you know too much or too little about the field, so the material is uninteresting or inaccessible. Also, since we don't get the guaranteed stipend anymore and have to apply for the freshman summer research fellowship along with everyone else, it's really not a must-take for the money anymore. Nonetheless, for those with a serious interest in science research, the exposure to some great researchers is worthwhile.",
    "Take it if you love science, want to meet scientists at Yale who are doing research at the frontiers of science, learn about current research projects going on at Yale and an opportunity to get a fund at the end of the year for research. Workload is minimal, just a pset once every two weeks.",
    "Science 198 is a bunch of lectures about really cool,modern research done at Yale. The professors are outgoing, and would love to exchange a few e-mails or talk about their work. In between lectures the class breaks up into discussion sections. The discussions are always interesting and engaging, as everyone in the class is passionate about science. Often, our conversations would digress to conversations about the future when the world is run by robot's, but the majority of the discussion was focused on current issues in the science world (whether about the higg's boson or the importance of science in the US). If you are passionate about science and want to learn about current research, I absolutely recommend this course.",
    "Every other week is a lecture by a Yale staff member, and in the intervening weeks there are discussion sections. The lectures are variable depending on whether the lecturer is interesting or not. Section was really fun for me but I've heard other sections were less exciting. Take PSE if you have a broad interest in many aspects of science and engineering and want a class with a pretty low workload.",
    "PSE is a survey of the different kinds of scientific research being done at Yale today. I think it's a great course for 1. students who are curious about science in general and want to know more about how people go about discovering the things they do and 2. students who want to do research *on campus* but don't know what kind of lab they want to be in. The course will be most interesting to type 1 students, but may help type 2 students find a nice topic on which to do research.It is a low commitment course with fantastic lectures by distinguished faculty. One drawback is its time, which is a Friday afternoon. Sometimes discussion sections can be low-energy. I would also say don't let the first lecture be indicative of what the course will be like over the semester. I found the first lecture to be a bit disengaging but the rest to be fabulous.",
    "Take it if you aren't sure on your major.",
    "Interesting introduction to a variety of different fields in science.",
    "It is a series of lectures then class discussions every Friday covering many topics.",
    "This course provides a great introduction to many areas of science you may have never before considered pursuing a career in. Discussion sections are enjoyable and insightful. Try to actually pay attention during lecture so you learn something.",
    "Really enjoyed the class. Lectures are super interesting if you're interested in the specific topic but can be very boring if you're not because lecturers go very in depth into their research.",
    "This can definitely be a great class! Naturally, lectures will vary in quality and relevance to your personal interests, but on the whole they are excellent and engaging. Discussion sections are student led, and so also depend a lot on your fellow students and the discussion leaders for the week. On the whole, the first semester is non-stressful and enjoyable, and you will likely find yourself learning a lot if you follow up on the lectures and do some background research before discussions.",
    "Take it if you're really into research. The whole point of the class is to introduce you to a variety of disciplines and set-up you up with the connections and confidence to pursue summer research.",
    "PSE was definitely a nice course to take the first semester of my freshman year. It was interesting to hear different professors lecture about their research and then discuss in small groups the week after. I was disappointed by the fact that we are no longer provided with automatic research funding even though this was advertised in the course description, but Professor Segraves made it sound like if we wrote up decent proposals, we could acquire grants. I would definitely recommend it if you are a potential STEM major\/ interested in STEM research!",
    "Great opportunity to interact with and learn from outstanding professors and researchers. The course gives you a better idea of what interests you and provides you special assistance in landing in a lab to do research. If you are motivated and enthusiastic about scientific research and are willing to reach out and seek opportunities, try to get in the program -- you will feel privileged to be in such a talented and fascinating community.",
    "I would recommend this class. It gives a good overview of different research going on at Yale and helps you decide what you want to research. I think that the summer research grant is excellent.",
    "It was a good class that helps expose you to different areas of science. Some of the lectures were fascinating, while others were boring. Some of the homework assignments were actually pretty difficult and assumed we had prior knowledge on some very difficult science topics. However, one homework assignment every other week is pretty relaxed.",
    "PSE is a course based around lectures from different scientists and researchers at Yale. Every other week a different researcher gives a lecture and the following week the students meet in a discussion section to talk about the previous weeks lecture and related topics. The discussions are student led and students prepare for the discussions by doing the readings for the lectures and answering a couple (usually 4 or 5) homework questions about the topic of the lecture. I would recommend this course to another student if they are interested in learning about different areas in science and research at Yale. The course is not terribly interesting or engaging however sometimes the topics of the lectures are pretty cool.",
    "Take it if you want exposure to research at Yale. You'll figure out what you like and what you want nothing to do with. However, if you get a bad discussion section, you may want to ask for a switch or get out, as those can really make or break your experience I feel.",
    "I would suggest taking this class if you are at all thinking about pursuing research at Yale. You get the opportunity to meet other engaged young scientist and are also exposed to the top echelon of researchers at the University. It is truly a unique experience, and I would strongly recommend it.",
    "This class is an incredible opportunity and its very rewarding, take it.",
    "I have only been through the first semester of this class, but so far I would recommend this class to other students. If you like science, you will probably find the lectures and discussions interesting. As someone with no research experience, I am one of the least scientifically experienced students, and both the lectures and the discussions often go over my head. That's not to say don't take the class if you don't have research experience, just be prepared to work hard and be surrounded by very accomplished science students.",
    "This class is only useful for those interested in getting involved in research on campus (with Yale faculty). If you are not, do not take this class.",
    "Yes, if they are particularly confused about field of science interests them, I highly recommend this course because it gives a lot of exposure to real life jobs in a variety of scientific fields.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student because I believe it gives a good overview of the variety of topics in science and engineering.",
    "It's an excellent course if you're interested in multiple fields of science; otherwise, you should reconsider, since not all lectures will be to your interest. However, it's a fairly good survey of the type of modern research that goes on in a variety of fields when coursework and modern research do not always go together.",
    "I would recommend PSE to a student who is thinking about taking it. Some people who take it think it's the best thing to ever happen (primarily for the research grant the following summer). If you're interested, then you should apply, see if you get in, and then shop it for a week or two to see if you like it. After all, there's nothing wrong with finding a different seminar you like more or passing up the research grant.",
    "Take it for good insight into the type of research that goes on at Yale. Very interesting lectures and easy, low-stress homework assignments.",
    "Science 198 01 is a course for students who are interested in the sciences. Even though that statement is rather vague, there is no better way to describe the student who attends the course. The course offers students the opportunity to learn about interesting phenomenons in various science fields by inviting the top researchers at Yale to talk about their respective fields. However, be prepared to sit through some lectures that may or may not cater to your personal scientific interests. I would recommend Science 198 01 to students who are generally interested in the sciences and are not entirely sure what exactly they are interested in. It is fine if they have a particular interest and want to learn about sciences in other fields. However, if the student is simply interested in completing the course for research funding at the end of the year, then they probably should not take Science 198 01 because there are conceivably other opportunities for these students to obtain funding.",
    "Yes because you get to learn about fields you never know existed.",
    "I would recommend Perspectives to someone who is not positive on the area of science they want to study. I am fairly sure I know what I like, but enjoy learnign about the other subjects; however, most people I have talked to who know exactly what they want to study find the lectures and discussions outside of their area of interest boring.",
    "An interesting experience.",
    "PSE is great for students who are interested in all areas of science and enjoy expanding their knowledge on a variety of current science topics. In some cases, the lectures introduced me to new fields of science that I had never heard of before. In some other lectures I already had experience with the topic from high school, and hearing about how they were approaching the research topic at Yale made me want to get more involved with that research department. The P-sets should be taken seriously in this class, as they are your only source of feedback from the instructors for the first semester.",
    "Take it. You'll be amazed to what kind of discussion each scientific topics would lead to.Not too much work, interesting topics, nice classmates.",
    "good",
    "Good idea for a class but not very helpful in understanding what I want to do. It was good to be around such bright peopel though",
    "It's a good class to set up research opportunities for the summer, but other than that it is pretty boring.",
    "The advice on how to get research is helpful. The lectures are pretty nice. It's not a stressful class. My discussion section and the discussion leaders were really nice, although I heard horror stories about the other ones. At the end, one of our discussion leaders brought us on a really cool field trip to the Medical School! It was fun.",
    "Class meets every Friday for 1.5 hours, alternating between a lecture and a discussion with problem sets every other week (due on discussion weeks). It gives a wide overview of many branches of science due to the many lecturers which makes it very interesting.",
    "Perspectives is really great for anyone who wants to learn more about the research being done in the sciences at Yale and how they can get involved. The workload is minimal and the first term is basically pass\/fail. You get to hear about the work of researchers at Yale firsthand and get a feel for what field of science intrigues you most. Discussion sections are student-led and there are some really interesting conversations and debates that result, not just focused on the basic science but also on the implications of what these discoveries and advances will mean in the future. If you think you might be interested in science at Yale or if you want to learn about cutting-edge research or even if you already know what field you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in, then taking Perspectives puts you on the right track for getting involved with the right professors and learning how to get summer research funding.",
    "This course is an overview of science disciplines; for one who takes this course, there is no escaping that fact. The course is not demanding, and the topics are interesting, but it is not a setting in which students will gain or refine skills (at least not in the first term). For anyone who is interested in science but completely unsure which discipline to study, this course could be immensely helpful. For anyone with a goal already in mind, this will not be an engaging class at all. The course structure, based on alternating weekly lectures and small\/mid-size group discussions, is pleasant even if a week's topic is not. Furthermore, the scarcity of homework makes up for the walk up Science Hill.",
    "This is a really cool class. It may not give the most practical knowledge (for instance, I can't imagine it is a prerequisite for anything, but it opens your eyes to different really amazing research and fields that you may have never known even existed or at least did not know much about. I think it has really helped me focus my academic, research, and perhaps even career interests. Make your discussion section good by being innovative if you are leading it and interested if you are participating--you can really gain a lot through them if they are done right. Breaking up into smaller groups for discussion of questions throughout the student discussion section is really helpful. Do the reading--sometimes you can get away without it, but the class is so much better if you read everything.",
    "Fantastic class. Every other week, a prominent science researcher at Yale gives a lecture on their research endeavors. The lecturers are all brilliant, extremely notable, well-spoken, and absolutely fascinating. Among the speakers just last semester were a physics professor on staff at CERN on the team that discovered the Higgs Boson, a biology professor working on growing human organs (such as lungs) from stem cells, an astronomy professor discovering earth-like planets outside of our solar system, and a biology professor using structural colors to investigate the color of dinosaurs.The class is a relatively small time commitment for a substantial reward, both intellectually and financially. The homework assignments are *extremely* easy, and section is typically relaxed, fun, and insightful. If you are even remotely interested in science research, take this class.",
    "If you have a good discussion section, this class is fantastic. If not, at least it doesn't take up too much of your time. I loved discussions; my professors and peers were insightful, humorous, and easy to talk with. My roommate (in a different section) dreaded them and said they were utterly dull. The lectures varied in quality, but on average they were definitely worthwhile."
