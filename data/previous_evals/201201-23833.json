   "comments": [
    "good",
    "interesting topics, but did not really connect with the professors style of teaching.",
    "This was a fantastic overview to the United States health care system, with a few snippets of information on the health care systems of other developed countries. The lectures were not always linear in fashion, and sometimes we went off for long tangents, but as a whole I feel as though I learned a lot about health care financing that I had not known previously.",
    "A nice and broad introduction to health policy and finance. Could have been a little more fact based, less theory. Overall a good course.",
    "Impossible to follow what Dr. Gusmano is talking about",
    "Strengths: important topic that I didn't know anything about, covered a range of issues related to health care finance and deliveryWeaknesses: lectures were VERY unorganized and hard to follow. For a difficult topic like this it made note-taking confusing and if you zone out for 30 seconds you realize you are completely behind (despite your best intentions to stay focused). The slides do not match the speech at all. It would benefit greatly from a more methodical and structured presentation of the material. We also should have started of level 0 in terms of knowledge of the health care system and worked our way up to critical evaluation. I still am not sure I understand all the nuts and bolts of the US system.",
    "The topics covered are interesting and relevant. The take-home final exam was the best assignment. Perhaps instead of 3 article critiques, 1 or 2 of the assignments could be scaled-down versions of the final (couple terms and an essay). Some of the slide presentations were sloppy, but the instructor mostly uses them as a topic guide. It would really help students to have good slides like the Medicare and Medicaid slides to keep as a reference after they finish the class.",
    "I learned a great deal in this class, as it was my first health policy course. That said, it would have been nice if it had been a bit more structured. I would have appreciated more thorough PowerPoint slides.",
    "This is a good class for learning more about how our health care system works. There were not a lot of benefits to doing the assigned readings.",
    "Strengths: the lectures are interestingweakness: i went in to the course with the mindset that i'll learn some basic information about the US health care system. I don't think i learned that. While the lecture material is very interesting, I feel that for people like me it would be nice to get a basic lecture on the fundamentals of the US health care system. After that then delving into the more complex material would make the experience more enjoyable.",
    "It will be much better if the slides are more organized.",
    "A good, user-friendly introduction to health policy",
    "Strengths: From the final I learned in more depth the differences between Medicaid and Medicare ( I knew basic differences). The critiquing of articles is a good assignment to understand how to write a critique.Weaknesses: The assignments for the critiques could be more explicitly stated and the papers should be clearly stated in the syllabus because they were just announced in class. The class was too heavily economics based and the slides were not efficient in relaying the basic information nor were there any clear objectives to the slides.Improvement: A more clear syllabus and outline of the topics. I think the class as an introductory course should provide more basics about the health care system and not discuss economic theory as much. I think it has been \"dumbed\" down, but needs to be more \"dumbed\" down so that everyone has a foundation of how the health care system in the US works.",
    "Overall, this class presented the fundamental of health care delivery in the United States. The readings were well selected but at times the lectures seemed disjointed.",
    "This course was adequate. I think the topics covered were excellent, but the way they were covered could have used some improvement. The lectures were not very structued, and Dr. Gusmano would run off on several tangents that did not make much sense to those without much of a background in policy. The lectures could have used more of a basic introduction\/explanation of the topics before going into them in detail.",
    "Good",
    "it's ok, but i think we need more basic stuff for those without background knowledge",
    "Strength:Practical knowledge, good lectures, opportunities for discussion",
    "My only recommendation would be have it broken down in small groups for better discussions.",
    "Overall, the course provided a good overview of health policy in the United States. It covers many important current issues, from healthcare costs to quality, as well as programs (i.e. Medicare& Medicaid). I especially liked the lecture on health care as a community responsibility and the readings associated with it.Being in a large lecture hall often felt like disruptive to ask questions during class. I think this course would highly benefit from discussion sections with TAs. Although we discussed it throughout the semester, it would have been great to have the Health Reform lecture.",
    "overall this course was good. provided a great overview to the policy side of the us health care system",
    "Eh, could have been much more interesting than it was.",
    "Covered a broad range of topics related to healthcare finance and delivery. Papers assignments were unclear. It would have been more helpful if the assignment was to respond to the assigned reading in the context of another assigned reading, lecture, etc.",
    "This was a decent overview course in health policy. It covered a lot of main issues, but seemed to jump around and lacked structure. I really would have liked a purely nuts and bolts class, similar to what the class was like back when Howie Forman taught it. Dr. Gusmano is a very knowledgeable in health policy, but I think the instructor for this course needs to focus on history&definitions for students to understand how we got to where we are today. Also, this was one of two classes I had this semester that had scheduled a class on health care reform and then cancelled it. I was disappointed that the one thing I was really looking forward to learning about was skipped. Finally, this class was be improved greatly if it was a little smaller and therefore didn't have to be held in Winslow.",
    "Interesting lectures and readings.Powerpoint was sort of random, but helped keep the 2 hours more entertaining.",
    "A great introduction to the US health systems and health finance. Workload is below average.",
    "Interesting at times, not a burdensome course. Not a full overview of the issues.",
    "This was an outstanding course that covers essential health policy material. I strongly believe every HPA student should be required to take this class.",
    "The course introduces basic knowledge of US health system, and this is very helpful.",
    "Lectures seemed like a stream of consciousness--more structure would be good. The best lecture was the guest lecture by Forman.",
    "strengths: very actual: Dr Gusmano and Jared processed healthcare related news as they were happeningvery knowledgeablequite entertainingassignments were very thoughtfully chosen and the feedback on them great!weakness: class so large it was intimidating to engage"

    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very knowledgeable on the subject matter.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano definitely knows the topic material inside and out, and he was a great resource to learn about health care financing. He was helpful to students both inside and outside of class, and encouraged class participation as much as possible. Occasionally it was challenging to follow his train of thought during lectures, but he did give a great overview of the health care system that provided me a strong knowledge basis for future study.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Instructor was a good lecturer, clearly very knowledgeable, but often failed to adequately explain basic concepts and terms, seemed to assume that we already knew them",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very difficult to follow, hardly uses his slides. He makes it very difficult to take anything away from this course because lectures are trains of thought",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0See \"weaknesses\" above. He is clearly very well-versed in and passionate about the subject. But just because he knows the material in and out does not mean he should stand on stage and talk rapidly for an hour and a half without pausing.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I have nothing negative to say about the instructor. Other students felt like he went off-topic too much, but I found everything in lecture to be interesting.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano is a very engaging lecturer, and he was always available to answer questions. His grading process is also very fair, bordering on generous.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano was engaging and made the subject matter very interesting. He is knowledgable and clearly passionate about health care.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Strength: enthusiastic about the material, engages the students into the lectureweakness: sometimes starts talking about complex matters before presenting some basic concepts",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano is knowledgable in the area, but it feels a little bit hard to follow him in class some time.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0The instructor is articulate and engaging",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0As I stated before, although there was a topic to be discussed, his slideshad no clear objective and it felt more like a Tedtalk or seminar speaker instead of a lecturer of a course to people who do not understand policy. There were no clear objectives or take home messages. I don't think I understand policy or the importance of policy any better than before and I am thoroughly confused since I don't have an economics background either.Youtube videos are not a replacement for lecture either.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano was well-versed in each of the topics covered. He was also responsive to emails and questions. At times, I think that the lectures may have been better suited to smaller discussions.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is obviously very intelligent and has done a lot of excellent research, but his lectures are not very coherent or structured and are difficult to follow if you do not have a background in policy. I think the course should be more of an introduction. I felt entirely unprepared for the take home final.",

    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0The instructor is excellent;it is impressive how he can catch your attention for almost 2 hours just talking...",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0It was consistently evident that Professor Gusmano is very knowledgeable about the field of health policy, as evident in his ability to answer student questions thoroughly. I also highlyenjoyed hearing about his research on comparisons of health systems around the world.Because this is one of the required options for HPA requirement and being as many of us had never had a policy or economics class before, it would have also been helpful for the powerpoint slides to be more organized and reference where to look for additional information. Again, I think small-group discussion sections (or maybe an optional discussion session) would have been beneficial.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0very knowledgeable in the area. very passionate. makes it interesting",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Engaging - - although see comment above.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Clearly very knowledgeable but gave somewhat disjunct and confusing lectures. Powerpoint slides were also inconsistent and difficult to understand.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is very passionate about health policy and makes himself very accessible via email to follow-up about class topics or papers. However, I feel like he gave up on theclass in the middle of the semester because everyone was so unresponsive. The class needs to be taken out of Winslow to force students to participate a bit more. Granted, the topics covered in most of the readings are brand new to many students (especially those only taking this course as their one health policy requirement), but I think more discussion would have been better than Dr. Gusmano going on about various topics and jumping around with what sometimes seemed to be a lack of focus. Also, being more on top of posting readings&PowerPoint slides to v2 would have been helpful during a few weeks.",

    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very nice and ready to help.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Sometimes I felt like Professor Gusmano was sort of phoning it in. He seemed more concerned with getting people to laugh at his jokes than in putting together coherent presentations.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano is excellent and truly an asset to YSPH. He presents the material clearly, while highlighting the most important information. He has a great sense of humor, which makes the class more entertaining.",

    "Interesting enough course. Slightly below average work load. Average professor.",
    "It's required!",
    "As someone who came into the class knowing very little about the U.S. health care system, I got a lot from the class. It does have a strong economic bent to it, so it helped to be a bit familiar with some of the economic concepts so they weren't completely new when coming into the course. That said, a lot of the same themes kept emerging throughout the semester, so it was nice to keep coming back to the same points.",
    "I'm an undergrad with very specialized (read: advanced) knowledge on the material covered in the course, so I shan't say anything about this since it'll be very biased.",
    "Lectures have no outline or order. Very difficult to follow",
    "Has the potential to be great - it should be worked on to make it more specific information about the intricacies of the US health care system rather than theoretical discussions.",
    "I would recommend taking this course your first year, especially if you do not have much background in policy or think you might be interested in it.",
    "This course is a great introduction to health policy for those of us who are unfamiliar with the topic. Professor Gusmano is a good lecturer, and the class has a manageable amount of work.",
    "I took it because it fulfilled a requirement. Not a bad class at all.",
    "Overall, a good course but could be better.",
    "It is a useful course to take, but improvements will be appreciated.",
    "A good option to fulfill the health policy core requirement for the MPH program",
    "As one of the 2 options for Policy requirement, I would recommend this course over the fall course but only because you need a course with a lighter load to balance out the heavier classes. Otherwise, I would not recommend it. In general I feel that the policy courses don't reach the \"Aha\" this is why policy is important and how you would go about developing a policy which is the important part in public health and the implications of the policy.",
    "This course is a good introduction to the U.S. health care system. The readings and lectures covered a wide range of topics, and the assignments were straightforward.",
    "This course is fine. I would recommend it over the other core policy course as it does not require a group paper.",
    "Good",
    "it does not cover many basic",
    "Overall good course. Professor Gusmano, although not always on Yale campus, always very responsive to email. Enjoyed the course.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student that is interested in understand health policy and finances in the US, it really teaches you and it makes it interesting.",
    "This course provides an overview of health policy in the United States, with some exposure to how it compares to other health systems globally. I would recommend it for those who are interested in this topic.",
    "good overview of policies in the US health care system",
    "Okay... good background of policy. I wish that it covered more recent health care issues (i.e. current health care reform)",
    "The course likely offers more tangible information about the U.S. healthcare system than the other health policy requirement, but is sometimes difficult to follow and process.",
    "This is a very reasonable class to take, especially to fulfill the health policy requirement. The workload is very manageable: 2-3 readings a week, three 3-page papers responding to selected articles throughout the semester, and an open-book\/note take-home final exam consisting of short definitions and an essay. It is certainly not the most engaging or thrilling class at YSPH and has the potential to improve, but it does the job.",
    "Yes. A great introduction to the US health systems and health finance. Workload is below average.",
    "This course will be very easy to anyone with any policy background. Without some knowledge of poli sci or econ some of the concepts may take some work to grasp. I don't feel like I learned much.",
    "Maybe. This course is very helpful.",
    "while reiterates basic notions reated to healthcare history, for the foreign-born audience it was extremely usefulafter working on the assignments, I feel that I have a good grasp on history and current struggles of healthcare policies and a good idea of the pros and cons of healthcare reform points.",
