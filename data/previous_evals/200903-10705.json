   "comments": [
    "Way too much reading, albeit interesting reading. Boring discussions. Very valuable methodological framework to be gained, if you are willing to endure the often unrewarding seminar experiences.",
    "It is a rigorous, thematic introduction to the study of American material culture--what it is, how scholars have defined it, and how different fields of study approach it, from the perspective of production and from the perspective of consumption. Issues and theories discussed included historical archaeology, structuralism and linguistics, consumerism, conoisseurship, the relationship between objects and identity, the importance of the producer and the materiality of the object in analyzing its many meanings. The approach is theoretical rather than historical--a thematic view, rather than a survey of the history of American material culture.",
    "I would certainly recommend the class and found it helpful, largely for the chance to read and discuss certain texts. Not too taxing, and a nice overview of the various literatures relevant to the study of things.",
    "It's a great class with a really interesting and broad syllabus. It offers a really wide-ranging and theoretically rich introduction to many different aspects of material culture studies and really opened up the field for me. I would definitely recommend it, unless maybe there were a lot of people taking the course in a particular semester. But regardless of enrollment, it is still a very interesting, useful, and well-organized seminar.",
    "I would recommend HSAR 725. Definitely."

   "comments": [
    "Gave a very valuable framework within which to approach objects, materials, craftsmanship and consumerism.",
    "It showed me the many possible ways of establishing\/theorizing the many meanings that an object can embody. As such, it provides an integral part of my historical \"toolbox\"--when encountering an object in my research, I will be able to better analyze what status the object may have had--what role it may have played--in the individual and social context from which it came. While I am unsure what specific road my future research will take, I know that whether I am studying books, furniture, houses, jewelry, etc., I will be able to draw on a set of theoretical and methodological frameworks I have gained knowledge about and insight into from this course.",
    "This course gave me framing methodologies, vocabulary, and the beginnings of a bibliography in the field of American material culture."
