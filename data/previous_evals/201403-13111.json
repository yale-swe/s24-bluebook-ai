   "comments": [
    "ENGL 115 03 is the perfect writing seminar for freshmen seeking an introduction to college-level writing who prefer thought-provoking novels over short stories or articles.",
    "Course readings cover the full spectrum of styles and genres. Something that I really appreciated about the reading syllabus was how it allowed us to interact with perspectives across history and disciplines. All the readings centered thematically on definitions of humanity and the rights inherent with those definitions, so the readings consequently all bore immediate relevance to any human rights issues happening in the present day. The class really fosters a connection to the here and now via its thematic emphasis, not just an exploration of past written works.",
    "This is a great class that helps you engage with literature and helps you solidify your writing.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student because it really trains your writing skills.",
    "Take it! You will be pushed to write well, but the effort's worth it in the end.",
    "ENGL 115 is a great way to improve your critical thinking and writing skills. In ENGL 115 you work closely with your professor and peers to delve deeply into the language of texts related to the human and human rights. There is a huge emphasis on close reading and staying close to the materials at hand. Discussion and writing are the primary ways that this close reading is drawn out of the text. By close reading, you can create a more nuanced, complex interpretation of the texts at hand. Overall you not only improve on your writing skills but also gain insights on life, literature, and language. I would recommend this course primarily to anybody who would like to improve on their writing or anyone who has struggled in the past with college level essays. At the same time, this course would help anyone as we are always improving our writing. I feel like this class shows that everyone would benefit from returning to a close scrutiny of the basics of writing and thinking that we often overlook.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. Its a great course for those who wish to strengthen their writing and analytical skills. The subject of human rights is also fascinating, and the readings in this class bring that topic to light through very interesting means."
