It would be great if we could receive feedback about our synopsis. I actually spent a lot of time in it and regard it as a good chance to improve my writing. Thus I am really looking forward to receiving suggestions about it!",
    "The course was a more successful than the class series in teaching specific concepts and better describing the nuances and applications of the topics taught in class. With different lecturers, each class was different. The more successful ones were those that delved into the papers and the discussions that branched from that. Those that re-lectured material were not as engaging. Additionally, those that felt like they were rushing to go through the material made the class time shorter."
