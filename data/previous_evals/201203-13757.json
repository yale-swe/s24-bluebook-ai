    "Grand Strategy is the study of how to get to an end while understanding how, why, with what, and when you can take each step to get there. The new class is already in so they don't need to be convinced to join.",
    "This is a must-take course. Not only will you meet incredible people each week, but you will learn lessons that you literally cannot study anywhere else to this extent.The combination of intellectual capital formation and practical application that occurs in this course makes it second to none.",
    "I'd highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "I highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it if you have the time and desire to work with these particular professors. The biggest benefit is the networking.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about history, politics and life in a way that is profoundly different, and are willing to commit a great deal of time and effort. Grand strategy takes a top-down, wide-lens approach to understanding the world - with a primary focus on the fields of history and politics, but relevancy to almost everything - that is markedly different from the statistics-driven, bottom-up approach championed by the political sciences. It is old school and completely fascinating. It teaches grand strategic principles through notable texts and historical events (in the first semester), and then pushes students to manipulate and employ these principles in understanding contemporary phenomena and making strategic decisions (through the briefs and simulation of the second semester).Do not take this if (1) you are not ready to commit at least two credits worth of time to the class (it is a lot of work, and you will be able to skirt by without doing all of it, but the class will not be worthwhile if you don't give it your all) and\/or (2) your primary reason for taking the class is the prestige of the name (the appeal of this will wear off and you will be stuck in the class for a year - it will not be worth it)."

   "comments": [
    "This course was foundational in my understanding of the discipline of history, both in terms of crystalized facts and knowledge, but more importantly in terms of my worldview and paradigm for dissecting lessons of historical strategy and leadership.",
    "I thought it was a great historical look at decision making and grand strategy. The readings are great if you have never read them and are willing to devote several hours each week to the course."
