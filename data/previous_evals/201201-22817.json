    "It's a great course that helps you improve as a non-fiction writer.",
    "It's worth taking. Your writing will improve a lot in the course of the semester. Mine definitely did. I wouldn't say that I'm an english student - I enjoy writing, but I intend on majoring in the sciences or social sciences - but I never felt like I was working when I was writing my papers. This class was particularly valuable for me, because the different papers made me delve into my own thoughts and work through my own questions and insecurities. Be aware that sometimes classes can be a bit dry, especially if people aren't in the mood to discuss the texts. It's also tough to get a good grade (or maybe I'm just a bad writer!)",
    "I would highly recommend English 120! I'm a sophomore and I've taken several other English classes at Yale, but English 120 has had the biggest impact on my writing skills and I wish I had taken it at the beginning of freshman year. It's a lot of work, but definitely worth it.",
    "you have to pour in a lot of effort\/time, but soon u get used to having to turn in a draft\/revision each week.this definitely improves your writing though! really helped me develop a voice and style.Also, the essays are fun to write, and usually deal with things u have in interest in, since u write essays on profiling a person, profiling a place, describing an experience, making an argument, etc.I would definitely recommend it, just make sure you will be able to dedicate the right amount of time for it, depending on the rest of your schedule",
    "Professor hopper is great! Although she seems a bit reserved at times, she always means well and wants you to succeed. Make sure you clarify what she means by her comments, because she has a good idea of how she wants your papers to improve even if you cant see that through the comments.",
    "ENGL 120 is creative non-fiction writing, often based on personal experience but not always. It's a great way to learn different style of writing, to hone your voice, and to learn writing techniques that apply to any style of writing. It's really just so much fun, even though it's challenging - it takes practice and getting used to, plus people only get A's on papers if they're \"so good it hurts to stop reading\/publishable.\"If you're looking to get a painless WR credit, don't take this class. But it's honestly so helpful, don't worry about the grade and you'll learn so much and have a great time.",
    "YES!! Take it!!"
