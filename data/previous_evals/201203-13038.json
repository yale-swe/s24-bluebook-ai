    "The class is focused on different questions around justice in an global context, and centered around Pogge's recent book \"World Poverty and Human Rights.\" The class is eye-opening in the sense that it exposes one to a variety of problems and approaches that are much more concrete but also much less covered in other philosophy or EP&E classes. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "It is a political philosophy course that does not lose sight of the reality upon which it is grounded. While called, \"Recent work on Justice,\" it was really a course on \"Global Justice.\" It surveyed topics on this theme and confronted some of the greatest moral challenges that face the world. It proposed interesting solutions to improve the current situation. The class challenged what our obligations were to those who were least fortunate. In many ways, it is a class all Yalies should take and take seriously.Pogge is a delight to learn from, ever helpful, and a very good facilitator of discussion.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student who is interested in political philosophy as it applies to the world stage. Professor Pogge is an expert in the field of global justice, and the chance to take a course with him on the subject is a unique Yale opportunity that should not be missed. Beware, however, that he is a bit distant at times (often literally, with all his jet-setting).",
    "TAKE. It's amazing, and Pogge is amazing. You'll also get great grad students to learn from, and who will treat you equally too. It is a particular type of philosophizing though (Anglo-American tradition of political philosophy) so if that's not your thing it might not work for you. It's a wide survey of global justice issues--poverty, immigration, climate change, etc., so again, if the topic isn't interesting to you--oh well, take it anyway, because that stuff is _important_ and because likely without knowing you're contributing to it."
