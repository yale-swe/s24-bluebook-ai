    "Do take it to get a good grounding of Spanish.",
    "Pretty basic Spanish. Very easy class if you just do the assignments and study a bit before tests.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to any who want to learn a language.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone who has a little background to Spanish.It might be a struggle for people who have no prior background\/aren't very proficient at languages.",
    "Easy and great!",
    "Yea I mean its a great language to know but it is definitely hard",
    "I would recommend this class if one wants to learn how to speak Spanish. This class is a good foundation into the beginning stages of learning how to speak the language.",
    "Spanish 110 05 is a rigorous and sometimes difficult course for language learners (especially new ones). I would take this course with caution and definitely think about the work load for other courses. Find a balance because Spanish 110 requires a lot of work. Make sure you have the time to take this course. Otherwise, the rewards are great for finishing this course in good standing. Learning any language is difficult but when you have a grasp on the basics you will feel a little more fulfilled.",
    "An introduction Spanish course, but it moves at a fast pace."
