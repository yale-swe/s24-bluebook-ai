    "Take it if you can get in! Bloom is fantastic and a legend.",
    "Look, pretty much everything you've heard is true. Bloom is brilliant, but some habits die hard.",
    "Great",
    "The reading for this class is enjoyable, though it has its difficult passages. Bloom helps you through it all, providing brilliant readings and translating the cryptic into pure beauty. If anything, take this class for an experience with Bloom.",
    "An intimate seminar focused on close reading on the part of the students and liberal allusion-tracing on the part of the professor. The reading list is marvelous, but sometimes the questions asked of us are impenetrable. He shouldn't tell us which poems are going to be talked about in class, because everyone, including me, does the exact minimum amount of reading to not look like an idiot.",
    "The Harold Bloom experience. I prefered this to this class on Shakespeare. You won't necessarily learn a ton -- but it's very interesting and he may not be teaching that much longer. If you want to get in, make sure to introduce yourself and\/or jsut ask his research assistant of the year. He's a sweetheart, though, and the poetry is wonderful.",
    "Take this course only if you have some experience reading and thinking about poetry, otherwise you may have trouble engaging the authors, many of whom (especially Crane and Stevens) write dense and difficulty poetry."
