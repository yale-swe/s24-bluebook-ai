    "Overall great class. Guest speakers were a little outside of the focus though.",
    "I know it's a survey course, but I still wish that it was a bit more practical and in-depth. Having assignments that required us to do financial models or analyze legal contracts would have been very useful for me",
    "N\/A",
    "I was auditing the course.",
    "7b- The TAs for this course wereoutstanding.",
    "It was great to have the opportunity to work on a problem of our own choosing, as opposed to having to work on problems not as relevant to our intended career. This makes the work more enjoyable, engaging, and useful. Overall, we covered a great deal of material and I think the course is well tailored for its intended audience of FES students. Students from SOM or YLS might find they know a good proportion of the concepts already, but they can deepen their knowledge in the desired areas.",
    "My only issue with this class is that I can't see the point of going to a class where I can learn everything by reading slides later. It seems more efficient to just stay home and do the reading and read the slides--but it becomes a political thing to make an appearance. This is a problem I have with many FES classes. Homework and class instruction need to each separate value and simply reviewing slides (even while they're great slides!) doesn't do it.",
    "This was a great class that covers the overlap of environmental policy, business, and law that is often overlooked in the curriculum. Professor Gentry presented the material in a very clear manner and provided many examples that resonated with the students, regardless of their interests. The TAs were also helpful in making themselves available and providing guidance on the midterm and final.",
    "Brad is a fantastic professor. He crafts the semester very coherently, his lectures are engaging and relevant, and he chooses excellent guest lecturers. This has been my favorite class at FES."

    "The practical nature of the course. We learned useful tools that will aid in the next steps of my professional career.",
    "Good clear instruction from Professor Gentry.",
    "I really appreciated the fact that the assignments were entirely focused on an issue of importance to us - this made it all seem worthwhile.",
    "The breadth of tools covered, and the clear level of knowledge the professor had about those various tools",
    "Well-structured; systematic; covered a wide range of topics, managed to link different topics in a relevant way; knowledgeable professor; interesting outside lecturers",
    "I was an auditor but enjoyed both the readings and the lectures.",
    "Professor Gentry is an excellent lecturer. The guest speakers were also great and added a nice perspective.",
    "Provided a nice, consolidated summary of the various legal\/investment concepts that were familiar, but I didn't necessarily know the details of. It gave me a reason to really think through in more depth some issues that I had thought about only vaguely before.",
    "The breadth of the concepts covered",
    "Brad Gentry is phenomenal teacher-- perhaps because he has real life experience and isn't a professor bogged down in research. The readings for the class were great, but there was way too much of it. We were assigned an impossible amount of reading for the class each week. I know each reading was useful, but Gentry might want to consider cutting down the amount as it's too daunting to try and keep on top of it.",
    "Ability to work on a self-selected problem, exceptional lecturing skills of faculty, availability of TA's for questions, great guest lecturers that added to the discussion.",
    "Chance to write an interesting paper on a topic of your choice",
    "The material was totally relevant to MEM students. I loved the syllabus and Professor Gentry's approachability was wonderful.",
    "My favorite part of the class was applying all tools we learned in class to a particular problem of interest to each student. It was challenging, but really made me think about the complexities of applying each tool."

   "comments": [
    "I wish the professor was made more accessible to students as a resource. It would have been nice if he had special office hours available to us.I wish that there were more international issues covered in the class.",
    "I think the homework could be improved, to have more regular due dates for assignments. There should be a better way for engaging the students with the reading, and for having more open discussion of how students are applying the concepts to their papers. Presentations of topics would have been interesting\/fun interactive component to add to class.",
    "I think the course might benefit from a case study approach, where we could really dig into why different tools do and don't work in various circumstances",
    "Be more specific on how to apply the tools studied in class; provide more examples of applications",
    "I think sometimes the lectures spent a lot of time covering topics that for me were fairly basic and already familiar (ie, the basics of property transactions). Speeding through those a bit quicker to spend more time on some of the detailed issues relating to environmental topics might help.",
    "Too many powerpoint slides!",
    "The amount of reading-- see above.",
    "Overall great course. The only thing I would add is that the course would benefit from adding perhaps one more (formal) small assignment\/problem like for example the problem that Bryan Garcia shared with the class, or something on that order of simplicity\/complexity. Ideally it could be some short essay or problem set on a real world applied issue, just to drive a given lesson home. I think that would be useful, but I think it should be only a small assignment representing a small part of the grade, so as to not distract from the principal project the student is focusing on.",
    "A way to hold students more accountable for the reading would have been great. Discussion sections or time for more questions in class would have been great.",
    "I don't think the class needs to be improved.",
    "Always hard to teach a survey class - I wanted more on many of the topics and less on some of them. I'm not sure how to offer that, and the lead-up process to the final paper certainly does try. Just something to keep in mind for offering more options for independent study within the class."
