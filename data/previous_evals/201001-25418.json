    "It's a useful course to learn intermediate knowledge of membrane proteins. I would recommend it as it is really informative.",

    "Yes, I would recommend the course to someone that is going to be involved in the biological sciences. It is nice to understand things on a very molecular level.",
    "I would recommend it. I especially enjoyed learning how mutations in single channels could cause diseases like cystic fibrosis etc."
