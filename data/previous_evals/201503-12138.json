   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in how the US and Europe relate to each other today and where that came from, on both military and economic levels, this is the perfect class for you. Lots of participation in discussion is encouraged, but readings are relevant and not too long.",
    "I thought this was a fantastic class. I decided to take it because I had heard good things about Howorth, but didn't expect to be fascinated by the material. I was wrong! We take the transatlantic alliance for granted, but upon looking more closely it is one of the more interesting multilateral relationships I've studied. Howoth was (as promised) awesome, and has an incredible amount of knowledge about the subject. Definitely take!",
    "Much of the class is spent talking about collective defense and security, so if that's your thing you'll really enjoy it and even if it's not, Professor Howorth is so knowledgeable and interesting that you'll probably like it anyway. The workload is very manageable one presentation with a short paper, and one long paper for the final. Be forewarned that your grade is ENTIRELY BASED on the presentation and the two papers, so if you're someone who likes to participates and does the reading but isn't great at paper writing you might want to consider that in taking the class and prepare for the essays accordingly. I would definitely recommend taking this class.",
    "Great class. Be prepared to have no idea of your final grade for most of the class; but it's a great discussion seminar. Two papers and a presentation (presentation is just a review of a reading, and then start the class discussion.) Howorth is a great professor, but the class can get out of hand if you have strong personalities in it. Do the reading, it isn't too much. Worthwhile.",
    "Lots of reading and somewhat difficult if you lack a solid background of European history. Fair workload and interesting survey of topics.",
    "Yes and very relevant course that really let's you focus on the area of the study you are most interested in.",
    "This class is excellent! super interesting material and howorth is the best",
    "Absolutely. Professor Howorth is an incredible teacher, so knowledgeable and a great discussion leader. I learned so much not just about transatlantic relations but also about very important events in American, European, and international history. The assignments are very doable, and often very interesting.",
    "Transatlantic Relations looks at transatlantic and EU functioning in relation to a range of events and issues from 1989 to the present day. While you do not need to have an in-depth knowledge of the events we look at (e.g. Iraq, Afghanistan, Balkans), it definitely helps to be familiar with\/read about these events if you want to contribute to the class discussion. That said, the seminar did not focus on their specifics, more on how the EU and the US responded to them, and how they affected the global order. If you are interested in this overall concept of the future global order (rather than the specific of how the EU works, what the US did in Afghanistan etc. which are not part of the seminar's focus) then I definitely recommend this class.",
    "If you are interested in Europe, and in particular, its relationship to the United States and all the nuances between them take this course. You won't find a Professor more studied or cited in the field. Professor Howorth not only gives you great perspectives on each subject, but also sprinkles the discussion with personal anecdotes from conversations with foreign ministers and other officials at important turning points in EU policy. You won't regret this class, but be warned, students that have more exposure to European history have a great advantage, nevertheless, any student interested can learn a lot."
