   "comments": [
    "Math 370 is one of the better courses I've taken in the math department, second only to 230\/231 (Hadari for life!). We cover the basics of field extensions before moving on the actual Galois theory, look at some cool impossibility theorems (can't duplicate the cube, solve the quintic, etc), and learn some things that every student should know (algebraic closure of finite fields, cyclotomic polynomials, etc). I would recommend this class any day. If you complete the math major without taking this class, you are doing yourself an astounding disservice, or perhaps are lying.",
    "Math 370 is a good class in the math major that should be taken after math 350. The level of difficulty is low. Be warned that the course has serious inner conflicts concerning whether it wants to be a rigorous upper-level course or an easy introductory course.",
    "With regards to Miki's lectures she goes pretty fast and talks in addition to writing stuff on the board. That is, just copying the board isn't sufficient - you need to really be on point listening to write down any things she says verbally too. She's very accommodating with office hours so that was great.She also grades midterms super fast and is on top of stuff in general.Her lectures are more focused on applications\/examples (it seems) than Abstract Algebra as taught by Casson.",
    "It's tough, but worth it. Having taken so much analysis, Galois was a really different side of math, and I learned more over the course of the semester than almost any other math class I've taken. It's a lot of work and the material is tough, but Miki is one of the best math professors at Yale and you should definitely go to office hours.",
    "With Miki at the helm, this is an excellent class. If you want to dip your toes into some \"real\" algebra after 350, this is the class to take.",
    "It's a very tough class but if you're thinking of taking it, you probably know that already. Definitely take it for the math major because it drives home all of the concepts from 350 and goes further with them. Interesting stuff and an awesome teacher. But if you're taking this class, be prepared for a ton of work. Problem sets are not easy.",
    "This is one of the best math classes I have taken at Yale. The weekly problem sets take quite a bit of time to finish -- it takes a while to really grasp the material, and the course moves really fast. But if you put in the work, then you'll discover the beauty that is Galois Theory. The professor teaching the course -- Marketa Havlickova -- is phenomenal. It would be a real pity for a math major to graduate without having taken this course.",
    "If you're interested in math, you have to take this class. The material is fascinating. Galois theory is considered one of the most beautiful pieces of math for a reason, and this course does a great job of showing you why. You prove a bunch of cool stuff, including the theorem that made Gauss decide to be a mathematician. If you can, take it with Miki.",
    "Definitely recommended for the math major\/those who like algebra. It's a tricky class, and while there are elegant moments, it's easy to get bogged down. Havlickova is a wonderful lecturer, and while she can seem a little intimidating, you should definitely take her up on her offers of help, she's sincere about it. You'll need to put in a decent amount of time, but in the end, it's worth it.",
    "Aaaaah, stellar course; best math course I've taken at Yale. Galois theory is one of the most beautiful topics accessible to people who know almost no math. Miki is the best professor I have had at Yale. She is rigorous and demanding, but this is exactly what is necessary to get the most out of the course. She also has a somewhat remarkable ability to make you feel very comfortable and at ease around her, and is very lucid and helpful in her explanations. She's also quite funny in a no-nonsense kind of way. Not really a course you can breeze through unless you have seen this stuff before.",
    "Really good class that builds a lot on math 350. I think this class is one of the harder classes in the math major, but Miki is exceptionally smart and nice and will help you as much as you need to learn the material."
