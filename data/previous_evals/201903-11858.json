    "I learned a lot about Latin American and Spanish vocabulary, culture, and film.",
    "I developed in countless ways as a writer, as a reader and as a thinker. Professor Tortora has become one of my mentors over the past months and I will be forever grateful for all that she has taught me!",
    "I learned a lot about Latin American and Spanish film which I knew next to nothing about before taking the course. I learned about how film and history influenced each other in Latin America and the importance of cinema for that part of the world. I also got better at writing in Spanish.",
    "Developed a knowledge of Latin American film and political history. We watched a lot of contemporary and classic films from the Spanish speaking world.",
    "Better understanding of the Spanish language and culture in film.",
    "I learned about the history of film in Latin American countries and terminology and style related to film. I also learned about specific political movements that influenced these films and the history."

   "comments": [
    "The course material is very interesting and even relevant to current events in Latin America. The breadth of the material covered is excellent. However, the workload for the course does seem a bit excessive, especially when combined with the average workload of other Yale courses. The late grading on course work and confusion about expectations for various assignments led to some confusion near the end of the semester.",
    "I would not change this course in any way -- it is already amazing! LIFFY stands as one of the highlights of my Yale career.",
    "This course was amazing for learning about what it advertised itself as. I really enjoyed watching the films and learning their historical contexts. The only thing that I thought could be improved was more class participation where sometimes it was structured more like a lecture while other times it was more like a discussion. I would like a little more discussion from the class as I felt like my speaking skills got a little rusty because we weren't speaking very much.",
    "Basically every class was a student presentation on a film we had all watched which means that how interesting that class was is completely based on their presentation. The professor would lecture intermittently, but never in a cohesive or deep way where I felt that I was really learning. Its a shame because Latin American history was something I was very excited to dive into.",
    "Strengths: Professor Tortora is amazing. She is so passionate and knowledgable about the content she teaches, she constantly goes above and beyond to make sure students understand everything that is going on and makes herself available for extra help always. The visits from real directors were also a great opportunity to learn more about the films and the filmmaking process and hear different Spanish accents which was a very cool experience for a non-native speaker. Weaknesses: The only thing I can think of was the huge course binder that we had to print in the beginning of the course. In the future I think it would be better to have those text resources available online so that students can have quick and easy access and don't feel pressured to lug the binder back and forth."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to anyone deeply interested in Spanish film and film critiques, as the course has a significant amount of required readings and films. Even though the workload can be intense, the course material is very interesting and covers a variety of films from different Latin American countries.",
    "Yes! Please take this amazing class. It is a truly unforgettable experience and I wish that I could do it again!",
    "I thought this course was super interesting and unusual. It was a good balance to my other reading and writing heavy courses because most of the homework was just watching the films we were studying in class. I really appreciated that about this class that it was such a different style to what I was used to but I felt that I learned so much about film from the hands-on experience of watching so many films. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an L5 language class that's less about the technicalities of the language and more about exploring culture and history through art.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a fairly interesting and easy level 5 Spanish class. There is definitely value if you are already interested in Latin American film, but overall it could be taught much better.",
    "Absolutely! If you have any interest at all in Spanish or film this is a great way to continue studying the language and latin American culture in a different way. The movies selected or very interesting and relevant. You will find that you learn a lot about history and political movements as you watch the films. The course is not difficult to do well in AT ALL if you pay attention in class, watch the movies at home, and take good notes. The tests and assignments were pretty straight forward if you went over those things."
