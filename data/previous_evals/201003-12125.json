   "comments": [
    "I strongly recommend Freshmen to take this seminar (if it is still offered next year)! This is my favorite course in my first term at Yale! The books on the reading list greatly improved my knowledge and understanding of the American domestic society, especially that in the years 1945 - 1960. The writing assignments are very engaging and my writing skill improved a lot in the process. The seminar discussions are very intellectually engaging and challenging. I love my professor and my classmates!",
    "If you enjoy American History, and reading and writing, then I would suggest this class. You go to places outside of the classroom which make it more fun and interesting.",
    "I would recommend it. It was a good beginner course, interesting, and improves your writing. Lots of good books.",
    "It is a good look at the culture of America in the 1950s. I would recommend it to someone if they were willing to to the readings and were interested in recent American history.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you get the chance, especially if Professor Russett is instructing.",
    "HIST 010 is a survey history course examining prominent fictional and nonfictional literary sources from postwar America, covering topics as diverse as McCarthyism, the Civil Rights Movement, the Beat generation, and 1950s suburban housing plans and commodities. I would certainly recommend the course to another student; as a fall term freshman seminar, this class provided a comfortable and smooth transition to the work and graded papers expected in Yale history courses, dealing with material relatively easy for college freshmen to grasp and encouraging class discussion from all students.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely take this course as a freshman seminar. It is a nice size and a nice transition from high school to college. Professor Russett is very easy going and the work is not that bad. With only 3 papers, it was a nice break from the rest of my work loaded classes.",
    "This class covers a great period of history. The topics covered were very interesting, going from World War II to the civil rights movement. It is almost like an English class because of all of the books that you have to read, pretty much one a week, but the books are used in a purely historical manner. For example, we read Jack Kerouac's On The Road, but didn't talk about the plot of the book so much as the history behind the author and the movement which he was a part of, and this was very unusual for me compared to high school history classes.The assigned reading is a lot, but you honestly don't have to do it all. The papers (two 5-page papers) cover only a couple of the readings, and the final research paper is on a topic of your choice. However, class will be much more enjoyable if youactually do the readings and contribute in class.Professor Russett is very nice and is a fairly easy grader.I definitely would recommend this class if you are interested in this period in history want to get a writing credit without doing that much writing.",
    "A course covering the most important topics in American history in the years mentioned. Recommended as a class that is graded forgivingly, but not as one you'll fall in love with.",
    "I'm glad I took Postwar America - good Freshman Seminar. Prof. Russett is totes cool, and the coursework is varied and interesting. The workload isn't too hard."
