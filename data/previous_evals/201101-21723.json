    "Difficult class. If you don't have much background in Roman history or classic literature it will take up a lot of your time to keep up. There is loads of reading so you fall behind quick if you don't do the assignments. The content is great but be weary of the work load.",
    "I think that this was a very weak course. I came in expecting a strong survey of European history through an exciting and untraditional lens, but felt that the class didn't deliver on what it promised. The first couple weeks were strongest, but about five weeks into the class it began to fall apart. It was less clear what the mission really was and how the different readings and subjects came together. It is difficult to tell what extent of this was what I felt was Professor Jewiss's declining interest in the course, and what was inherent in the course as a concept. Professor Jewiss never once seemed to care about the students in the class. I got the sense as the course went on that she was resentful of having to teach us, and did not enjoy what she was doing. Her lack of sympathy made her a less interesting lecturing and bad at fostering and holding a strong class discussion. I would not recommend taking a course with her.",
    "You learn a lot about Rome and it's contribution to the West from a lot of different angles. Not a ton of work and the reading can usually be skimmed (and you've probably already read some of it for other classes). I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "This course was WONDERFUL! Seriously, DO NOT GRADUATE WITHOUT TAKING IT! I learned a huge amount in every single lecture and was constantly fascinated by the material. A very unique course in its combination of history, mythology, religion, art, philosophy, etc...the kind of course the humanities department was created for! There is a ton of reading, but you really don't have to do much of it at all because the lectures give you such a great overview. And other than the reading, there's almost no work (1 short paper, 1 midterm, 1 final). I took it credit\/d, so suffice it to say that I slacked on my reading, but still learned a huge amount and did well with minimal effort. It is really a lecture even though it's supposed to be seminar-esque, but that was a good thing. Professor Jewiss is not very approachable, but is more than knowledgeable and interesting enough to make that unimportant.",
    "This class if fantastic, even without the summer program. The reading is so important, and fun to read. Moreover, Prof. Jewiss is so intelligent and creative that even if you've read the texts before, you'll learn to appreciate them at a whole new level, despite the super fast pace of the course. Our 3 classes on Dante were better than the entire Dante course I took! It's really a lecture course, the workload is significantly reduced in the second half of the course (so don't get intimidated), and there is only one short paper plus fairly simple exams. Prof Jewiss always puts history in perspective, making everything relevant and important (which is also in the nature of the material,Rome) and she knows so much about her topic, both historically and how it fits in the present. I highly recommend this course.",
    "It is an okay course. I took it CR\/D\/Fail. The readings are really, really long and often pretty boring. Jewiss is a pretty decent lecturer, but she tries to make the course a small lecture with seminar components, aka she wants students to talk. This just makes it really awkward--I hated this part of the class.If Jonathan Dach is TFing, don't take the course. He was really awful. TFs like this give TFs a bad rep.Take it if you like Rome or want to go to Rome over the summer.",
    "Great reading! Everyone should read these books before leaving college. I feel like a more accomplished person.",
    "The material really lacks solidity, which has as much to do with the method of the Humanities \"major\" as with anything else. You just read a lot of \"perspectives\" on \"the idea of Rome,\" with the briefest of lecture-given glances at their historical context, which I resent not because I'm a historicist but because it really is impossible to understand what all the books are about without knowing when they were written and what was going down at the time. I regret taking this course. Then again, maybe I was too familiar with too much of the material for it to be worthwhile\u0097definitely not recommended for ex-DSers. (That said, watch \"Roma, citt\u00e0 aperta\" on your own. Marvelous film!)",
    "I would recommend the class, especially if you are going to the follow up program in Rome. The reading can be heavy, but the workload is light otherwise. You just have to do the readings at some point, before the midterm and final.",
    "The City of Rome is a fast-paced overview of the history, literature, religion, politics, art, and architecture of one of the most important cities in the West. Although it may seem narrow in scope (1 city for a semester), you must remember that this city has been in existence for almost 3000 years, and at one time ruled over all of Europe, parts of Asia and Africa, etc. The class is a fascinating mix of lecture that covers the history of the city, and seminar-style discussion of the primary source readings \u0096 Livy, Polybius, Tacitus, Virgil, Dante, Gibbon, Shakespeare, Grand Tourists, Mussolini, to name a few. Professor Jewiss is an excellent instructor; she is extremely knowledgeable as a result of her scholarship and her living in Rome apart from Spring Semester, makes everyone feel welcome to participate in discussions, and is approachable outside of class. The workload is extremely fair \u0096 one 5 page paper, one short reflection after a trip to the YCBA, midterm, final, and class participation. Take this class, and go to Rome when you\u0092re done!",
    "Take it if you're a humanities major; otherwise I wouldn't recommend it. It's a fun and interesting class but there are more interesting classes at Yale.",
    "I would only recommend it if you're planning on going to Rome over the summer. It's not a bad course, but I would say that your time could be better spent elsewhere. You need to take it, however, if you want to spend the 5 weeks in Rome, and in that case, it's well worth it."
