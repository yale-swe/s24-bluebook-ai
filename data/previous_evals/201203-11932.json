   "comments": [
    "Lots of work. It's a tough class, but you do learn French. Ngame is a great choice if your going to take it.",
    "French 110 is a lot of work and goes pretty quickly, but if you stay on top of you homework and participate in class you should be fine. The french department is very organized and you will definitely leave with a good knowledge of french.",
    "If you can have Ngame as a teacher, I would recommend him. He is funny and sweet, and he keeps the class interesting.",
    "It is a difficult course in the sense that there is a lot of busy work each week\/night, but you come out of it speaking a great deal of French after a short period of time. The small class size and wonderful teachers make it a painless, fun experience. I highly recommend it!",
    "Very intensive way to learn French in an applicable way.",
    "Take French only if you know you're very passionate about learning it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to someone who is looking to establish a strong foundation in French in a short time.",
    "If you are like me thinking to do intensive French to finish 4 levels of French in 2 semesters and hoping to do L5 in France, let go of the idea because I can't imagine how intensive the intensive French will be. I mean, L1 itself is already demanding and you'll fall behind if you don't keep up with the daily homework. Prof Ngame is amazing, and I've had experiences with other professors too. Hoffman isn't bad either, but he and the other professors speak too fast for people who just start a new language. So Ngame is perfect.Also, you'll be amazed at how much you know French by the end of the semester. The total immersion method is amazing. Prendre \u00c3\u00a7a!",
    "I woud strongly recommend this course. As an intro language course it takes a lot of work and the weekly Monday quizzes suck but you definitely learn a lot in a very short period of time.",
    "In this course, you will learn French quickly and thoroughly. The workload is not particularly difficult, but it is rather time consuming, averaging two hours a night (every night). All that homework pays off, though, as by the end of the semester you will be at least relatively conversational. Professor Ngame is great - definitely take his section."
