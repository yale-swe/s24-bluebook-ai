   "comments": [
    "More emphasis on discussion topics like historical context, religion, and textual history as opposed to the straight readings would have been welcome. Nonetheless, we covered those topics well.",
    "The main strength of the class is its rigor; we read the entire poem in the original language and translated most of it out loud together in class. The main weakness of the class was that we did not have enough time in class to get through all of the material while also discussing it in depth. This issue would be partly rectified by meeting twice per week, rather than only once."

    "Yes. Though the workload was tough, it was well worth it. Anybody seeking to improve their Old English ought to take this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in Old English literature, especially heroic poetry. It would also be of interest to those interested in philology and linguistics, Germanic myth and conversion-era Christianity. However, I would not recommend it to someone with no experience with Germanic languages, as the learning curve would be very steep."
