    "I would recommend this course to students who are willing to expand their academic perspectives. At first, this course was challenging because the readings were vastly different from high school-level works. However, this is a great introduction to philosophy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale freshman. The class is very engaging, relying heavily on class participation, and every reading is very interesting!I feel that this course has prepared me very well for all of my future classes at Yale.",
    "Yes - this course was one of the best I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would totally recommend the course. I know this is clich, but it really did change the way I think.",
    "A really good class, a time for low-stress, open ended mental exercise. I recommend it."
