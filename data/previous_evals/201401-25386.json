    "This is a required course for the microbiology track. The format is that each week, one student will work with an assigned faculty mentor to choose a paper for the class to read. The student will then present the paper. Other than the one presentation per semester, and the weekly reading, there is no assigned work. Feedback comes in the form of anonymous evaluations from classmates.",
    "This course is a seminar course in which each first year and second year Microbiology student present one or several papers once during the semester. Backgrounds, specific questions answered in the publication(s), methods, results and perspectives need to be explained. And results need to be assessed critically. I would recommend this course to another Microbiology student because it is a good chance to practice presentation."

   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure I learned much from this class, but the opportunity to work on my presentation skills was useful.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of my discipline to a large extent because in this course, I got to know many new approaches that microbes adopted to invade host cells and host cells adopted to defense against pathogen invasions. It is helpful to my research because it gave me a good chance to practice presentation. Also, some paper presented by the class brought me some virology knowledge."
