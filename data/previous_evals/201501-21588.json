    "Its a great 5th class and an opportunity to use the great resources in archaeological remains at the Peabody Museum. Unique, simple, and easy!",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT! Whether you need it for your major or not, not other class will give you such comprehensive background in archeology! And it is presented in a very interesting way! There is quite a bit of writing, but nonetheless pleasurable and most of the time you choose the topic you like or you design an exhibition based on real artifacts - so you gain a taste of curatorial work! This was one of my top 5 classes at Yale!",
    "I would highly recommend this course as a great introduction to ancient civilizations. I particularly enjoyed the weekly lab sessions in place of a normal section. I enjoyed handling artifacts from the Mayan period."
