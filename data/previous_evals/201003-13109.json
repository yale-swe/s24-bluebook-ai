    "If you are interested in Japan and\/or anthropology, TAKE THIS CLASS. It is probably one of the best classes you will find on Japanese society, and you will be amazed by the amount of things you will learn. It does not matter if you know nothing about the country orif you are Japanese yourself - I promise the readings will surprise you.As for the workload: the class is currently available as a writing credit, which means that you will do a fair deal of writing (I count 12 assignments, one being a re-write and another a draft of the final paper; so, 10 separate works in all) - an essay per week (literally; due every Sunday night). About the same as an intensive English class, I will say. Other than that, you will have quite a bit of reading\/movie watching to do, which you will be quizzed on in section (3 questions at most).Seriously, I loved the class and have not met anyone that does not yet. Take it!",
    "This course is fantastic. Karen is a great lecturer and my TA (Tina) was also great. There is a fair amount of work (reading + weekly movie + weekly 2 page paper), but it's always interesting stuff. I came into this class knowing next to nothing about Japan, and I feel like learning about Japan through an anthropological lens was very enlightening. Also, this is a WR where they really want you to become a better writer, and thus give you a lot of good, constructive feedback. Take it!!",
    "ANTH 254 is a deceitful class. While the lectures are entertaining, the workload is ABSURD. In addition to 150-300 pages of reading a week, we had weekly essays that were treated as though they were final papers. We were expected to edit these papers over and over until they were essentially perfect if you wanted to even try to get an A (which was virtually impossible). The readings, as well, were very repetitive and eventually got too long to want to read. They were a large hassle after doing so many of them a week -- I have two 2-inch binders full of paper from all the reading we did. The writing assignments themselves were mainly fictional prompts, which made it difficult to include the weekly readings (which you are expected to do). In conclusion, I would only recommend this class if you are ready to spend a significant amount of time each week reading the articles and writing essays; and you should be interested in the material, otherwise you'll be very unhappy in this course.",
    "yes!! readings, assignments, and lectures were all enjoyable. how often does that happen all at once?",
    "Do you like anthropology? Do you not know anything about anthropology? Are you a weeaboo? Do you have a cultured academic interest in Japan? Do you need an easy WR? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you should take this class.\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\ANTH 254 is an excellent survey of modern Japan from an anthropological perspective, and is also a great way to get a taste for what anthropology is like (though there may be other ANTH classes that are better for that; I wouldn't know). More importantly, if you need a WR, this class has got to be the best class you can take (this class presumes no prior anthropological knowledge, nor does it presume knowledge of the history, language, or culture of Japan, though all of that obviously helps). There are weekly writing assignments (2-3 pages each), as well as two 5-page papers and one 10-page paper. That's pretty darned manageable, if you ask me. The assigned readings are also not too long - you rarely have more than 100 pages of stuff to read per week, and when you do, it's often general-audience prose rather than difficult-to-parse anthropological verbosity.\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\Prof. Nakamura is a quality lecturer, the likes of who I have scarcely seen before. Definitely shop this class if it seems interesting; I suspect you'll like it. In sum, I found this class to be excellent, with about the same amount of work as my other classes on average.",
    "Yes, anyone wishing to know the contemparary Japan should take it. Those who know the language will get more out of it.",
    "i would recommend this course. the essay due every week was time-consuming and downright painful sometimes, but it's a good wr to take. the prompts got kind of vague and repetitive over the course of the semester, and writing editorials lost its novelty. other than that, karen is a funny and engaging lecturer and i had an amazing section. if you have ANY interest in japan whatsoever--and even if you don't, you'll end up learning a lot--TAKE IT.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, but only with serious reservations. Before you take this class, you should know several things. The previous reviews of this class are spot on - Prof. Nakamura can be very disorganized and absent-minded. For example, I introduced myself three times at the beginning of the semester, and not once did she recognize me from anywhere, not even my name. She also loves to ramble on about things that are hardly related to the readings or the graded weekly writing assignments. This made coming to lecture more of a side-gig than a twice-a-week commitment. She also clings to a rather absurd grading technique of a ten-point \"down curve,\" the function or mechanics of which she really didn't make clear until the second-to-las week of class! That all having been said, I felt as though I learned a great deal about Japan and modern Japanese society. The readings were often wonderfully edifying (albeit rather long), and the prescribed audio-visual supplements were always entertaining. In this sense, I loved the class! My TA, Annie, was also very nice and a good section leader. Given everything, I still liked this class, but I firmly believe that several blemishes really tarnished the overall potential of this class, rendering it just \"pretty good\" when it could have been \"wonderful.\"",
    "Great class for anyone who wants to learn more about Japan. Lecture and section were fun, and the material was mostly interesting. Beware though- there is a writing assignment every week and three major papers, so it does end up being a lot of writing.",
    "Really more of a history of Japan in the 1980's with a few odd-ball 90's and early 00's anthropological chunks thrown in than a systematic anthropological review of modern Japan. I didn't find the material dynamite fascinating--but the assignments were creative and brought out the best of some very dry reading.",
    "I would recommend this class. However, beware of the writing requirement! Karen Nakamura is serious about this being a writing class, and your reading responses are supposed to be well thought out 2-page essays (although many are creative). Overall, the subjects are pretty interesting. For me, I would've liked to hear more about all the diverse aspects of Japanese culture, like the \"Cool Japan\" module we did towards the end of the semester (with Pokemon and rap and more!), but such is life. Readings are good. You get to watch movies and interesting films for class.Beware, this class is not a gut (if you're taking it for grade). I spent more time writing my essays (which can be pretty fun, just look at the prompts!) than I spent on some sci\/math graduate classes I took... Also, despite all the writing you do, the focus of the class isn't really on teaching you how to write, if you are one of those people who's looking to improve your writing. Take English instead if that's what you want to do.Overall a good class.",
    "Yes I recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested in modern Japan. You get to explore the interesting quirks of modern Japanese society and figure out the reasons behind the social phenomenon. The readings are mostly very interesting. Workload is not small though, but it is a fun writing course - most of the writing topics are creative and unconventional.",
    "The reading is manageable and is always pretty interesting. If you have any interest in Japan or wold like to understand the forces driving Japan, you should take this course. The professor and TAs are very helpful as well.",
    "Anthropology 254 is a work-intensive class. The material is interesting, but the paper submitting and grade receiving processes can sometimes be frustrating because they are exclusively online. Also, many of the essay prompts lean towards the creative writing side rather than the analytical side, which may not be apparent in the course description."
