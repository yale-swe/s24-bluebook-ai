    "Take it! It's a decent amount of work but if you do it you'll definitely see improvement. It's good to have this knowledge of how drawings are constructed and will give you basic skills.",
    "Even for students with art experience, this class forces you to think creatively about what you know about art. I would recommend this class to another student who would be willing to put in the effort to think about and understand the process and reasoning behind the artistic process.",
    "Really relaxing to take! With Galloway the homework is only about 2 hours a week",
    "I would if you are even the slightest bit interested",
    "Munro is a fantastic instructor and if you can take basic drawing with him you absolutely should try. Crits in his class are always constructive and friendly. He demands a lot of participation, but if you're willing to put in effort and participate in crits you can do well in the class. The workload is very consistent which is especially nice during midterms and finals. I took this class as a second semester senior and enjoyed it very much.",
    "Art 114 is a great class with an easy workload if you're willing to put in the time. I would definitely recommend this class to both students pursuing art and those just interesting in learning more basics of the subject.",
