    "The class provides a comprehensive and detailed assessment of democracy promotion- why democracy is promoted, who promotes it, in what ways it is promoted and the consequences of such efforts. The subject is critical for anyone studying international affairs, particularly development. I would highly recommend the class to another student.",
    "This class is great for those looking to learn more about democracy promotion. The readings are interesting, the seminar discussions are substantive, and the final essay allows you to investigate an aspect of democracy promotion that most interests you.",
    "Well...I now know that I do not want to work in democracy promotion, nor am I convinced of its effectiveness and efficacy."

   "comments": [
    "While I study IR and democracy in Africa, I have never focused specifically on the issue of democracy or democracy promotion. This class was excellent introduction to the subject, particularly with regards to the ways in which democracy (and democratization) support the process of development. The class has challenged my thinking about democracy in the developing world and the role of international community in promoting and facilitating democratization. I cannot overstate how helpful this new insight is to my course of study.",
    "Deepened my understanding about promoting democracy, ameliorated some bias I had before taking the class."
