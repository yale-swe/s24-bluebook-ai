    "Yes - you'll learn stuff you won't learn in other bio classes. very application-based. Definitely take it",
    "This class was not the most challenging that I've taken, but it was really interesting, enjoyable, and helpful.",
    "MCDB 570 examines biotechnology techniques from those that are used everyday in the lab to those that are only used in highly specialized labs. The course begins with descriptions of processes that are widely used and then ends with detailed applications and descriptions of specialized techniques. I would recommend this course to another student because it provides information on techniques that are applicable to many portions of modern biology that are studied.",
    "Yes. It is a good survey of biotechnology.",
    "yes I would- great class",
    "If you are interested in the material then yes. I would recommend having a deeper grasp of genetics and biochem than I did coming in to get the most out the class.",
    "Definitely recommend."

    "Though I was already familiar with some of the topics, I am leaving this class knowing much more about topics I was unfamiliar with. Due to the focus on teaching relevant research ideas and techniques, I am sure that this class will prove to be helpful in the future.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge in regards to my discipline because it went into detail about common biotechnology techniques that may be used in different disciplines of biology. The same can be said for helping my research. My research was improved with the knowledge of various techniques learned through this course.",
