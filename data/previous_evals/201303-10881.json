    "A wonderful class! Weekly reading responses (1-2 pages single-spaced) and a 15ish page paper at the end. Not too hard or intense. You should totally take this class; Prof. Rasmussen is awesome and kind, and the class itself is really thought-provoking. It will make you question a number of your basic assumptions and also show you how the form of a captivity narrative, something I didn't really know existed before, permeates so many facets of our culture!",
    "AWESOME seminar on a really fascinating topic that I had never studied before, but now would like to continue learning about. Diverse set of assignments starting with colonial America and ending with a class screening of Orange is the New Black. Prof. Rasmussen is the sweetest professor I've ever had - she is so approachable and understanding. This class is a winner in every way! Take it if you have interests in anything from the American prison system to Frederick Douglass's slave narrative to Iraq POW narratives.",
    "Yes. If the books sound interesting to you, go for it.",
    "American Captivity Narratives is a medium sized seminar class that gives students a look into the influential texts in this category of American literature. The professor is wonderful and enthusiastic. The biggest factor of whether or not this class is going to be good is the students. If the students in the seminar do the reading and actively participate in discussion, it is going to be a great semester. If not, the class will grow weary and tiresome and simply become a chore. Professor Rasmussen is always willing to meet outside of class and is very accommodating to students. Her obvious enthusiasm for the class and subject matter make the class that much better. I would definitely recommend to any students interested in this category of American literature as well as those students who are looking for an intimate literature\/history seminar with a lighter workload to help supplement some more heavier courses. Be cautious though, some of the work is backloaded. It is helpful to begin planning some of the larger assignments as soon as possible.",
    "Best class ever on captivity as an analytical genre of literature and experience. Not too much work but highly highly rewarding. Do take it.",
    "Take this class! You will learn so much about captivity narratives and it will make you think about this genre in a completely different and critical light. Also, Prof Rasmussen is awesome! She is so helpful and encouraging and a great discussion instigator. It is so great! Also, you read such a wide variety of books and essays it really expands your mind.",
    "Definitely take this class. Great teacher, discussions are really interesting but also pretty laid back, the readings are pretty fascinating, and the workload is not that large. You will definitely find yourself seeing trends in America that you didn't even know existed.",
    "The subject matter proved to be an excellent platform for discussing a myriad of interconnected issues relating to racial injustice and cultural exchange. The class was intimate, the readings subversive and engaging, and it offered a flexibility in research and focus that few others do. She is one of the greatest scholars at Yale. Very personable, relatable, encouraging, and inspiring.",
    "Great course! The readings are always interesting and many times riveting. Although there reading responses due every week, it was never burdensome and there was always plenty of material to write about. The final paper was extremely open ended and I was able to write a more creative piece. Prof Rasmussen is the best and really engaging! If you get in, you should definitely take it!",
    "This class is an interesting examination of captivity narratives over time. The content is interesting and the work load is not that heavy. Class itself was mixed. Professor Rasmussen has a tendency to control the conversation in a way that feels detrimental to the seminar experience. I would shop and decide whether you love it or not, if you don't go with your gut.",
    "Yes!",
    "Definitely recommend. We always had insightful interesting discussions but it was very chill and Professor Birgit is very warm and welcoming (plus approachable for those a little more shy about speaking up in seminars). The texts were pretty engaging and not too long. This class was great also in shaping my critical thinking--Professor Birgit encourages you to analyze anything and everything. I had never given much thought to captivity before but now see examples of it in places I'd never expected!",
    "Yes, take this class. A very interesting seminar with great readings and not too much pressure."
