    "Entirely up to you and your PI how this course goes. 20 hours per week may sound like a lot, but less is not very meaningful, so if you are serious about research, you might as well take this course.",
    "This is an essential course for those looking to gain fundamental understanding of molecular biology beyond the textbook. The ability to work one-on-one with Yale's finest scientists in the field is part of what make Yale's experience so high quality for me. If you are considering graduate school in the biological sciences, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "This course is a great excuse to get course credit for research you should be doing anyway. If you choose your lab well, you get not only course credit, but also practical experience and, in all likelihood, a strong letter of recommendation for grad school. Plus, you get to spend time with friendly and knowledgeable people."
