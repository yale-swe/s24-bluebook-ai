   "comments": [
    "I found this class to be incoherent. Sometime we managed to have a good discussion about human rights and media, but more often it was either human rights or media. If you are a 'human rights' person you might want to take it because it is different from other classes and you look at it from a different angle. But you cannot expect to learn anything new about human rights itself. The final project requires you to be creative so if you like the standard write a paper, pass an exam form, do not take it.",
    "I would recommend this class if you haven't taken a class on human rights issues yet as many of the conversations are quite basic. It is a good overview of various international genocides and crises and the role of the media in them. The readings and assignments are very manageable. Be warned though that the final project requires you to actually have some experience with creating a media project.",
    "I would recommend it to people who consider themselves activists, or people who are okay with spending over 2 hours a week in a room of activists. If you don't identify yourself as an activist, and ineffective activism for the sake of awareness and not change bothers you, then you might leave class frustrated sometimes.",
    "I would say that it is a great introduction to a wide range of human rights violations that impact our world today and ways that media can be used to publicize these atrocities and potentially move people to action. I would recommend this course as it was both informative and just for the opportunity to work with Leora. However, make sure that you look over the syllabus and make sure that the material really interests you. That is the most important thing.",
    "I would summarize this class as an introduction into various human rights violations past and present, in conjunction with how the media affected how we approach these topics. It also introduced effective ways that we can accomplish this in our own community. I would definitely recommend it if someone is interested in learning more about these issues!",
    "Take it if you know very little in global human rights crises'",
    "Human Rights and the Media offers an interesting survey into the world-wide issues of human rights abuses, and how the media has been used in each case. It touches on the media's role in covering human rights violations, and on how it influences public perception across the board.",
    "An examination of various issues--from child soldiers to modern slavery and genocide--with a focus on human rights and the role of the media. A very interesting course for anyone interested in either of those fields -- I had no media background, but found it fascinating, and learned a lot. The workload was heavy because it's taught by an activist, not a professor, so she was unaccustomed to giving assignments that could be balanced with other courses. I would definitely recommend this course. You'll get to interact with some very cool people who work in human rights and media,and people did some pretty amazing things for the final project that could definitely become something big outside of class.",
    "Great class, great professor. I would highly recommend this seminar to anyone interested in gaining a basic understanding of human rights abuses that are occurring all over the world, not just in developing countries but also developed. Workload was a lot but very manageable.",
    "NO. Scattered, unclear objectives, didn't learn anything valuable.",
    "The basic subjects are very interesting and important to learn about, but overall the course was elementary and we didn't delve deeply into any topics. Leora is EXTREMELY disorganized and it was hard to follow what was going on. While most of the students were highly interested in the subject matter, we were also consistently frustrated with useless assignments and little guidance. Easy grading, but if you are already knowledgeable of the subject to any extent, do not take the course.",
    "I really liked this class and looked forward to attending it. Each week, we focused on one human rights issue and had a student led discussion. In general, the readings were very interesting. Leora brings in amazing speakers, e.g. a woman who survived the Rwandan genocide, a guy who organized a photo exhibit of Abu Ghraib torture victims. Leora seems kind of intimidating but she's actually very nice. She's also sort of disorganized and it can be hard to understand what she expects for assignments.",
    "A course in how media addresses human rights issues, and how human rights are portrayed. A good introduction to human rights issues, documents, and case studies."
