    "It's required. Pick an interesting and original topic and don't slack off.",
    "Obviously take this if you need to complete the history major.",
    "Don't wait until the last minute, it hurts.",
    "If you're a history major, you have to take it.",
    "This is the first semester of the required two-semester thesis. In my opinion, the assignments for the thesis are too front-loaded: the prospectus, annotated bibliography, and full outline or first ten pages are all due in the first semester; the second semester is basically \"Here, take a few months to write the paper.\" Although I think the advisors and the history department generally are aware of the fact that seniors tend to not be able to get all of their research done in the first semester, but the way that the requirements are structured still basically assumes that you have. (This is less true if you do the first ten pages of your thesis instead of the full outline, but since the first ten pages normally deal with the secondary literature on the topic, preparing to write those pages means spending less time with the primary sources that make up the meat of your paper.) But despite all this, being forced to write an outline or part of the paper by the end of this semester forces us to focus what research we've done into a coherent argument. Make sure you get a good advisor!",
    "Senior essay-self-explanatory. You gotta do it! But it's a lot of fun especially as the semester progresses and you get more excited about your topic\/become clearer about what your topic actually is. I really have enjoyed doing research on my essay this semester and am looking forward to writing it next semester.",
    "You need it to graduate.",
    "You don't have a choice?",
    "The senior essay is something you must complete prior to graduation. Start early (I would recommend having a topic day one of the fall semester), keep timely with deadlines, and make sure to do a bit of work on a weekly basis through the fall. It is easy to cast this off onto the back burner without second thought. If you do keep on it, your spring will be much more enjoyable as you polish a product you are proud of.",
    "Mandatory. Sometimes a struggle, but try to spend one day a week on it, and it should go pretty smoothly. And remember that a long paper doesn't need an overly broad topic. Learned that one the hard way.",
    "Well, there's no question of recommending it, because you either have to take it or you can't take it. But, that said, it's potentially very useful in the process - as much as you make it, anyway. You can screw around this term and hand your adviser a sales receipt as your \"outline\" in December, with no academic consequences whatsoever, but you'll be shooting yourself in the foot. Do the work. Do the research. Come January, you'll be really happy you had a whole semester of prep before you started to write.",
    "Independent work writing a history thesis.",
    "You have to do a lot of research before you can write. They expect you to have a 10 page draft by the time that you are done the first semester."
