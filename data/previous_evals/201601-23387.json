    "The Panama trip was incredible! Great line-up of speakers and a good assortment of hikes and other activities. It was really busy and tiring at times, but overall I gained a lot from the experience",
    "The best apsect of this course was the hands-on learning of tropical ecology in an actual tropical forest. You get an understanding of what you learned in class and be able then to see and understand the concepts hands-on.",
    "The field trip was amazing - very well organized, covered all of the concepts in the course. The instructor clearly put a lot of time and effort into organizing the field trip and I felt I learned so much more than I could ever have from a text book.",

    "The readings at the beginning of the course could have been more focused on the process of doing an experiment. Or more guiding questions while reading the articles could have helped us dissect the article better. I would have also welcomed a few lectures dedicated to tree\/insect identification specific to BCI\/Gamboa.",

Lots of great exposure and interesting research in Panama that's worth checking out. Liza has a lot of background in the country and some ongoing research projects that add a lot to the course. And if Juan is the TA, that's a bit plus!",
    "Take the spring and fall course. Bring long socks to the field.",
    "Definitely do it if you want a field work experience in a great country, and stay afterwards to travel!"
