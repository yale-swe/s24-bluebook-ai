   "comments": [
    "Chances are you're taking this class to complete a language requirement. Whether you are or are not, however, you can't go wrong with Profesora Reymundi. She sticks right to the material, and is good at answering any questions you might have. She is also slightly less stringent than my past professors about coming to class on time. Granted, you're probably penalizing yourself by missing class material. And that's about all. L3 will require consistent work each night- not just of workbook pages, but almost always something else, whether that's in the course packet or is another reading.",
    "Professor Reymundi is very nice and a fine professor. It would be nice if she had made more of an effort to get us actually speaking spanish in class. Instead we mostly just did simple exercises that helped with grammar or other written skills but didn't do much for speaking skills.",
    "Spanish 130 is a standard intermediate Spanish course, and will improve one's knowledge of grammar and vocabulary. However, the course is poorly organized, and should give greater emphasis to speaking in Spanish.",
    "Take it if you need it. Meeting every day sucks. The homework sucks. The grading is unfair. And Reymundi is a kind woman, but a punitive grader. If you have to take it make the effort to get into better teacher's class.",
    "You know, it isn't a life-changing course. But it's a necessary step if one wants to get to L4 or L5, so in that I guess it was fulfilling. Prof. Reymundi isn't incredibly warm at first impression, but she's a fine professor and it's a fine course.",
    "Yes I would, I think that it is an interesting class and it is quite fun. At the same time you will improve your Spanish quite a lot.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to take more Spanish. I didn't think it built my vocabulary much, but it did give me a chance to practice the grammar from L2 more.",
    "Spanish 130 is very focused on reviewing grammatical concepts essential to understanding the language, beginning with the present tense and progressing through the imperfect subjunctive. I would say that some prior knowledge of the various grammatical concepts is necessary because the pace of the class is fairly fast. I would highly recommend this class to another student because Professor Reymundi makes the class interesting and enjoyable. Additionally, the class incorporates interesting short stories and even music into the grammar exercises."
