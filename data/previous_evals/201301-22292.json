   "comments": [
    "It's a somewhat challenging intro course but important if you want to go into policy. Sometimes seems disjointed but at the end, you see how things come together.",
    "If you are interested in sociology and learning models you should take the class. If you are looking for a dynamic, upbeat course this is not the case.",
    "Please see response to Question 1 above.",
    "Intro to Social Policy had a historical component (New Deal to the present day) and also an analytic component (using models& tools such as blockmodeling to think about data\/theories). We also discussed complex statute and logistics. I definitely would recommend this class to another student. I found that I internalized most of the info, rather than memorizing and forgetting. There is a focus on concepts, themes, and critical thinking.",
    "It is a historical analysis of social public policy since the Great Depression, it covers the historical material but also technical and practical. The second part of the course involves the application of economic and mathematical models to produce or test social policies.",
    "I highly recommend this course for students who like history, but also have an interest in pursuing knowledge in law. There is a lot of reading. While you won't be graded on this reading, it would be hard to follow the class without reading on schedule. It is important that students in this course go outside of the assigned reading and also try to strengthen knowledge in the respective areas taught.",
    "This is one of the best courses a social science major could take. The professor is excellent and he will give a lot of insight from his grand strategy class in the field of policy making with the benefit of this happening in a more open environment that gives him more space to individually interact with students in comparison to the GS class. The content of the course is very interesting and the analysis tools and models that are acquired can be used in multiple fields of studys. I highly recomend it."
