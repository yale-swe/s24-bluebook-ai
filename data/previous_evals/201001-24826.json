   "comments": [
    "This is a great introduction to a huge range of Italian poetry. I highly recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in getting their feet wet in Italian poetry. It is a very manageable workload with only 3 short papers, and David is really helpful with the papers. I never felt overwhelmed by this course, but I still feel like I learned a ton and will retain a lot of it simply because it was so interesting.",
    "It's a very interesting course to read so much poetry from different eras in Italian history, but it can be very difficult to understand what you are reading. Even if you understand what is written in Italian,you don't always get the significance behind it until class. Not a bad course, it just takes patience to get the hang of analyzing poetry in another language.",
    "Wonderful class, but don't take it if you're not interested and willing to put time into readings-- discussions are annoying for you and your classmates when you haven't prepared.",
    "This is a GREAT class and definitely worth taking. The workload is manageable, and Prof. Lummus is wonderful teacher. This class will greatly expand your knowledge of 20-25 of the most important Italian poets ever. The papers are straightforward and fun to write, and you get to pick the poet you're writing about. Don't expect this class to be easy, but you'll get a lot out of it and feel like a much better Italian student by the end.",
    "It is an exploration into the history of the Italian lyric.",
    "It is a survey of poetry from the early medieval to the modern period. You get a good taste of the lyric's development over time. Its a great course for those who love Italian, and those who love poetry."
