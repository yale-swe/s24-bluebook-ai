   "comments": [
    "Lecture was clear and the lecture note made by Maria wasPERFECT!",
    "632 was an excellent course. The material was very relevant to real-world applications of applied biostats in epi analysis.",
    "Nice.",
    "The powerpoint slides and lectures were great. I learned so much! Also, I think the homework and tests were very reflective of what we were expected to learn.",
    "Strengths: Excellent instructor, very useful and practical approach to categorical data analysis. I learned a lot in this course.Weaknesses: A little too quick of a tour through logistic regression. The only reason I had a clue about regression in general was because I had taken Applied Linear Regression with Heping Zhang in the fall. Because this is a half-semester course, there was not sufficient time to dwell on the important theoretical concepts that drive logistic regression. I don't want a PhD level of understanding, but it would have been nice to have more time to process\/really understand the material. Rather than combining this course with Survival Analysis, I would suggest combining it with Categorical Data Analysis and therefore spending an entire semester really thinking about logistic regression.",
    "The instructions and expectations for the first two assignments were unclear. The course started out as seemingly unorganized, but improved in the second half.",
    "It was very well organized and Maria made it very clear what she wanted us to do on the homeworks and what she wanted us to take away from the class.",
    "Useful course!",
    "This is the best biostats course I've taken at Yale. It was the perfect balance of some background theory with emphasis on practical applied analysis. It covers all of the necessary topics and shows how analyses are actually conducted in epi studies.",
    "Great course, should be an entire semester",
    "One of the best courses I\u0092ve taken so far. The material was presented logically and interesting with many examples and SAS code. The lecture notes were sufficient to successfully complete the course. The workload wasn\u0092t too heavy and enough time was given to complete homeworks.",
    "Dr. Ciarleglio provides crystal clear material, her slides are unbelievably beautiful and clearI wish the material would have been more applied and less theroretical though..",
    "The lecture slides and textbook were incredibly helpful and have been used as references for other classes.",
    "good",
    "I enjoyed this class. It is a good class that reinforces epidemiologic principles and theories and apply it to practical analysis using SAS. The lecture notes were very well organized and detailed. However, homework were unnecessarily long.",
    "helpful but a lot of work",
    "Excellent powerpoint slides that summarize the material well.",
    "also a lot of time spent on the homeworkwould provide more feedback on homeworks (ansewr key?)",
    "The course was very interesting, but some of the material seemed a bit too theoretical.",
    "I think it is a good course, but it is too much for a half semester. It would be better if it was a full semester and includes labs (like linear regression). Maybe it should join with categorical analysis.",
    "The course was very well organized and informative. I learned so much about qualitative and quantitative analysis in epidemiology studies.",
    "Very good"

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr. Ciarleglio is an excellent instructor who exceeds all expectations. She is always prepared and serves as an friendly resource for her students. She has an encyclopedic grasp on biostatistics that is truly impressive, and she is capable of tailoring her message to students without a firm statistics background.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very helpful.",

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Excellent instructor. Very smart, approachable, young. Responsive to students questions and suggestions.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Same instructor for Applied Survival Analysis. She makes thorough and organized slides and will always immediately revise and upload updated lessons if there are typos\/mistakes. She tends to teach to the projector screen instead of the class, but it does not distract from the overall course experience.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0This was a very well organized class, my only suggestion is that she might want to try to engage the class a little more. Maybe actually run the SAS samples?",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is a good instructor!",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0I can't say enough wonderful things about Maria. She was very accessible, open to questions, and so kind, but most importantly, she knows her stuff and teaches it well. Her notes are so clear, organized, and well-written with appropriate examples. I will be using these slides for a long time.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is wonderful! One of the best biostats instructors i've ever had. She is available to meet when needed. I will use her slides for years to come. Very clear lectures.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is a great lecturer. She was always well organized and prepared. All notes were distributed ahead of time over the internet. Maria was very approachable, always ready to help and answer any questions about the covered material. She is very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Increadibly smart, with excellent command of the material!My only regret is that she could not engage the class more: needs to make more eye contact with the audience so she can take clues as to when she goes too fast, maybe?very accessible, eager to help, wonderful personality!",

Sometimes, notes were rushed through because of lack of time and were not gone over in great detail. However, I thought she spoke well and was very quick to answer questions raised by the students.",

She was very helpful to students and was always willing to help. She did a good job of making the material understandable. It's hard to think of things to work on, but sometimes she read from the slides. Overall, a great professor.",

    "Definitely Yes!Much helpful than expected",
    "This course is ideal for a student looking to apply what they learned in entry level biostatistics and epidemiology courses. I highly recommend the course to anyone interested in epidemiology or applied biostatistics.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class is the best blend of biostatistics and epidemiology. I think it should be required (maybe even replace Biostats II).",
    "Good course. A must-take if you are biostats or Epi and want to avoid the horrors of Categorical Data Analysis in the fall. Expect to spend a lot of time on homeworks, but they are well-chosen and reinforce the important concepts.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Useful!",
    "A course for ALL biostatistics and epidemiology students to take - it will be the most useful biostats course that I will have taken. For CDE doctoral students, I highly recommend taking this course BEFORE Epi 3 - it will make a world of difference.",
    "Great course! Take it. Learned a lot! Gaps in areas that I had previous are filled durin this class.",
    "One of the best courses I\u0092ve taken so far. The material mostly covers theory but there are many SAS examples. No much background in biostatistics is required to successfully complete this course. The lecture notes were sufficient to successfully complete the course and course workload wasn\u0092t too heavy.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, with the caveat of making sure the people pace themselves with homework",
    "This is a great course for bringing together many of the techniques and concepts learned in other courses at YSPH. The homework is very time-consuming but helps solidify your ability to understand and execute methods of analysis.",
    "Useful.",
    "This was an upper level epidemiology class that reviews the basics and goes into more depth. It is very useful after taking Epi I and II. I would recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "helpful",
    "time consuming",
    "I would recommend this course, but I would tell a fellow student that it was a bit theoretical.",
    "I would summarize it as a good course, but too much material and homework for a half semester. It can become really intense and somewhat frustrating because you won't have enough time to internalize the concepts and practice the analysis. Overall it is worthy, as there is no option for a full semester course.",
    "Yes, I will."
