    "If you're interested in Ancient Near Eastern texts, take this class. Class discussions are very well-conducted by Professor Slanski, who is extraordinarily well-versed in the field, has many stories to tell, and can think of creative lessons to incorporate, such as taking actual artifacts out of Yale's Babylonian collection. Do not expect to stick to the week-by-week reading syllabus, but reset assured that you will cover new ground that interests the class each week. Slanski cares a lot about her students, but struggles to post assignments in a timely manner. Grades are based on two papersone of which is additionally turned in as a draftand weekly reading responses that are not even a full page, and a field trip that is quite fun."
