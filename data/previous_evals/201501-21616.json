    "ABSOLUTELY. The content is amazing and the people in the class come from very different backgrounds and make the discussion worthwhile. The readings are long, must most of them are fascinating. Professor Rogers really helps you understand the material, and guides the discussion very timely and progressively. If you get in, TAKE IT. It was the first seminar where I felt I had learned so much that I could apply to writing my paper, rather than just coming up with random topics and reading a lot on my own. Perhaps my favorite part about the class is that despite being an Econ major I could still contribute a huge amount to the discussion, and get even more out of it. I think this class will change the ways I interact with other topics, and the way I think about the world on a daily basis. Oil is such a multi-dimensional topic (far more than you really expect), and I truly think Profesor Rogers is one of the best professors at Yale. You won't regret it!!!",
    "Take this class! Every seminar conversation was enlightening, and all of the course readings were relevant and fascinating. Oil is one of the most important materials in our lives today, and everyone should learn more about the oil industry and oil's image in the world. The workload is perfectly reasonable: readings every week, an 8-page midterm paper, and a 16-18 page final paper. Professor Rogers is also wonderful and a fantastic seminar leader, the best I've ever encountered at Yale; he knew exactly how to control our discussions. Rogers also works to make sure that the class make-up is diverse, so as a result we all got to interact closely with students from a wide variety of majors and career interests -- I don't think I can say that about any other seminars that I've taken.",
    "ANTH 438 was a great course. Usually the topic of oil is taught through the lens of science or economics so it was refreshing (and interesting) to be taught about it through a cultural lens. Professor Rogers is very adept at leading seminar discussions and is also clearly very passionate about the material which made for a great semester.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone! I did not know anything about the anthropology of natural resources or about oil in general, and I came out learning so much and feeling like the class was fulfilling. If you get into this seminar, you will not regret it!",
    "standard seminar. read a couple hundred pages a week, no reading responses, big final paper that you get to write about whatever you want.... really interesting approach to oil, but NOT an economic\/poly science class so make sure you really want to study the cultural construction of oil and neoliberalism",
    "YES.",
    "I would highly recommend Culture, Power, Oil to another student. This is the kind of class that, while highly specified on a singular topic, provides theories and frameworks that can be applied to all kinds of capital flows. There were students from a wide range of disciplines, some relating only tangentially to oil, but everyone seemed to make connections to their previous coursework.",
    "Culture, Power, and Oil centers around the political, economic, and cultural aspects of oil as a special resource. We covered the perception of oil as a cursed resource, as a geopolitical tool, as the foundation of American social fabric, as the foundation of Nigerian pan-africanism in the 1970's, and as a scientific field tightly linked to economic and political concerns. Prof. Rogers is a great seminar leader, and his 8 years of experience teaching this class make it a mature seminar that students can enjoy with confidence that the learning will be top-notch. Since the class draws the interest of students from so many different fields, the diverse make-up of the seminar was a huge plus. If you're an anthropology student, its a great opportunity to understand many perspectives that illuminate the social relations around such a special commodity. Take this class! It's not too much work to put in, as long as you do the readings which are amazing anyway.",
    "If you are at the stage of reading reviews for this course, you should absolutely take it. It is an exciting, informative, stimulating, discussion-based seminar that considers how the petroleum industry emerged, evolved, and came to affect the most basic definitions of what it means to be human. Professor Rogers is amazing, and your classmates will be, too.",
    "Absolutely take it if you can get in!! This course was phenomenal! The readings were very diverse and interesting, and Prof. Rogers was able to connect them all using the theoretical frameworks that we discovered through course discussions. Prof. Rogers took a unique approach in the course, integrating knowledge from all disciplines chemistry, petroleum engineering, economics, social theory, history, current events, media, and more in order to fully encapsulate the various aspects of oil. I learned so much in this class, and not just about oil. Using oil as a lens for society highlighted broad and pervasive patterns in global society the U.S., parts of Africa, Russia, and South America. The readings were very interesting, and Prof. Rogers artfully guided us through understanding them and building off of them in seminar discussions. It is \"all about oil,\" but you'll find it engaging if you're interested in global affairs, politics, society, or energy infrastructures, among others. I'm a chemical engineering major and I did well in the course and found it to be really eye-opening, as someone going into alternative energy. The best seminar Ive taken at Yale!"
