    "I would definitely recommend this class! I shopped it on a whim and was carried away by Professor Darnell's passion for the subject. It ended up being my favorite class this semester. His excitement for the material is contagious and he has so much much experience in the field. Furthermore, he usually carries a monocle and an Indian Jones hat, reason enough to take the course in my opinion. I came into this class expecting to read some Egyptian mythology, learn about all of the deities, and have a filled-in timeline of the development of the religion. This, however, is not what the class is about. Instead you delve quite deeply into 6 to 10 somewhat unrelated topics that especially interest Professor Darnell. The topics are fascinating and you leave with lots of cool knowledge, if not with the complete picture. The workload is manageable. There's a good deal of reading but its mostly interesting, and if you're really pressed for time you can get away with just reading whats relevant to the papers. The three papers each have you analyze mostly unpublished pieces of religious artwork. Knowledge of Ancient Egypt would probably help you piece together the somewhat scattered topics and understand Darnell's usually unexplained references to deities, dynasties, rulers, architecture, etc. However, this course might be even more fun if you know nothing about Egypt. Being thrust into the almost magical world of Ancient Egypt, a culture completely new to me, was a pretty amazing experience.",
    "I really loved this class. I was fascinated by the material, and Professor Darnell was amazing. He was incredibly understanding and genuinely wanted us to do well. He is amazingly knowledgeable about the subject, and had so many personal stories of his own excavations and explorations in Egypt. There are a lot of readings, and you get much more out of the class if you do them, but the material to study for the quizzes and tests are stated by Professor Darnell beforehand. You don't have to worry about trick questions or pop quizzes on the readings. Overall this was a great experience and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.",
    "Ancient Egypt is explored wonderfully by this class, but it is not a gut. There are a lot of readings and the details can be difficult. Its a bit more work than I thought, but Professor Darnell and magical gems are reason enough to take the class! It is like learning from Indiana Jones himself!"
