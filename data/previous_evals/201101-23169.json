    "This class was REALLY awesome! Ryan Irwin is one of the coolest professors ever. Extraordinarily smart, as well as being hilarious, Ryan made this class how very enjoyable it had been throughout the entire semester. A well-selected, -balanced and -crafted syllabus coupled with an even better chosen group of students, made for an experience of excellent discussion. You didn't feel like you were in class sometimes; everything just felt really natural. Ryan is a great seminar leader that led discussion in an open, but nonetheless engaging and rigorous manner. Major themes were never eclipsed and nor were tiny minutiae of the readings given too much attention. I only wish that in some cases fewer theoretical, thematic readings had been assigned instead of more matter-of-fact historical case studies of decolonization. That said, the thematic background definitely lays a solid foundation for the specific case you choose for your final paper; and, being a course on a global process, rather than a discrete set of countries, the class only inevitably tackle a limited number of cases. This is \"big\" history; take it! Ryan is a diamond in the ruff at Yale; I really think he's gonna get very huge, very quickly! Take his classes while you still can and before everyone else finds out!! Best history seminar at Yale!!",
    "Great class, take it if you are at all interested in empire, particularly intellectual theories and discourses thereof.",
    "It is a brilliant class about one of the most important things that happened in the 20th Century. Take it if you have any interest at all in the world and its history.",
    "Undoubtedly. The course takes a thematic approach to problems of decolonization. Discussions sometimes get more theoretical, and the course could use more of a narrative grounding in the events which the course covers, but at the same time the discussions were some of the most interesting and entertaining that I've had in a course here at Yale. Plus Ryan Irwin is great!",
    "Great class and great professor. Take it.",
    "excellent course. great prof.",
    "Take it if you want a seminar on 20th century global history. But be interested in the subject-- it gets pretty theoretical.",
    "This class is awesome - a survey of social, cultural, economic, and political forces that govern empire and how each of these forces changed or remained in the decolonization struggle. Professor Irwin is great (and really chill, down to earth, and friendly) and chooses some sick readings (from Lenin to Gandhi to Stiglitz) that is both relevant and engaging. Workload is very manageable and the material is interesting and very pertinent to the world today.",
    "I'd just flat out recommend it. It's deeply theoretical, but not in a way that should intimidate anyone. Class discussion gets quite heated and is fast-paced, so if you're not someone who enjoys particpating and debating, then you might not get as much out of this. It's a writing credit, but you wouldn't really be able to tell, so if you're doing it to hone your writing skills - that isn't really the focus of the class.",
    "Yes.. overall really important subject material that is still very relevant today."
