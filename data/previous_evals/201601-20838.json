   "comments": [
    "This course is grammatically focused and has many assignments with various types of media. There are movies, short films, and readings. I would recommend if you want to further your skills in Spanish.",
    "Spanish 140 is hard in that it has homework every night and a lot of it is graded by correctness not participation, but it also really bolstered my mastery of language and was an overall fun class.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you actually want to learn Spanish. If you're just doing it to get the credit, that's fine but the class is a lot of work for just a credit.",
    "Spanish 140 is like a high school class that meets daily and gives homework every night. The class is still very manageable and I would recommend taking this course.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Although it is a step up from 130, is it very manageable and beneficial.",
    "I would recommend to any student trying to learn spanish",
    "Intense but totally worth it.",
    "Definitely take this class for requirements, etc. If you were turned off by Spanish 130, 140 is definitely a lot better (both in terms of how it is taught, difficulty, and interestingness).",
    "L4 is significantly more difficult than L3 but still a good class that will strengthen your grammar and speaking skills. Sonia is an amazing professor so definitely try to get into her section if you can!"
