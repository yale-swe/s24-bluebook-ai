   "comments": [
    "A good introduction to Particle physics (title is misleading-- absolutely no nuclear physics). We used Griffith's text on the subject, which was accessible and explained things well. The subject matter was involved and rather difficult, but all of our midterms and our final was open book and open note, which was nice, since there would have been way too much to memorize otherwise. McKinsey is helpful if you have any questions, though his lectures are mostly from the book in the later part of the course. The class wasn't as mind-blowing as I was expecting it to be. It ended up being a lot more classification and annoying integrals than crazy\/amazing physics (though there still was bit of that). Overall a good survey of the of the Standard Model.",
    "Awesome, awesome class. Probably best physics class I've taken at Yale. Be sure that the topics are hard but also think that you are learning about the way the universe actually works. Also after this class you'll be able to say that you know what is Dirac equation and how it predicsts spin and antiparticles. Hard but great class. Also Professor McKinsey is a very good teacher and class is very well organized. Book is also awesome."
