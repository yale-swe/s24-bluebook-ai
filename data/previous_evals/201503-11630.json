   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in children, then this class is for you! This is by far one of the best classes that I have taken at Yale",
    "Take this class. You learn so much first hand about child development and it gave me much more confidence to work with children in the future.",
    "Definitely take this course! It is a course on child development mostly from a curriculum, psychological and neuroscience standpoint. There are a few lectures that touch on sociology and social factors, but I would say expect more of the psychology language (which is actually very easy to learn and absorb). The practicum also makes the class worthwhile because you get to see what we learn in class in action. My only caveat is that for those students who are placed in Calvin Hill's kindergarten, it is kind of tough to connect the first few lectures to what you see in the classroom because the course starts with more discussion on babies and toddlers than on kindergarten-age children. Otherwise, I highly support and suggest this course for anyone who loves children and wants to understand them more.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, if only to experience what it's like observing at a daycare (really life-changing). The work only consists of two journal submissions and a final paper outside of the observing, which can both add up and sneak up on you, so keep in mind that if you procrastinate, you have to do all the readings and write, and this takes a lot of time. Just don't procrastinate and you'll be fine. Do the readings to get the most out of the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in young children and childhood. This course is a wonderful exploration of the early formative years of children and through the semester you have ample opportunity to apply what you learn and even reflect on your own childhood experiences.",
    "Are you planning to do research involving children? Take this class. Are you planning to treat children in a medical setting? Take this class. Are you planning to teach children? Take this class. Are you planning to go into law? Are you planning to have children? Were you ever a child? TAKE THIS CLASS. Admittedly, it's a serious time commitment, and the daycare center was far away. Even so, utterly worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in children and development.",
    "Yes! Would 100% recommend. It's definitely a time commitment but observing the kids is so fun and a great break from the usual academic responsibilities.",
    "Yes - especially if you like children! Whether or not you already have an academic interest in child development, the course's emphasis on being a participant-observer should deepen your appreciation for the little things in life that may often be overlooked.",
    "We examined a number of issues, questions, and opportunities relevant to the social, emotional, cognitive, and physical development of young children. This class also supplements classroom discussions and lectures with fieldwork at local daycare centers.",
    "Child Development was such a fun and interesting course - take it if you can get in!!!! They give you the freedom to really pursue and study what you're interested in, and the clinical observations portion was just the cherry on top of this course, because who doesn't love children? This course taught me to be more aware of children's behaviors and how they think. Furthermore, it made me rethink my views on how complex children really are at such a young age. The lectures were always interesting and full of cute pictures or videos to entertain us, although it was sometimes difficult to stay awake in such a long seminar after lunch. You essentially have a lecture, and then split up into smaller sections for the last 45 minutes, or vice versa depending on when the lecturer comes. Like I said before, if you like kids or want to learn about good parenting, take this course!",
    "Yes take this class! If you are at all interested in children take the class because it is incredible to work with children and learn about them at the same time I class. This class includes one great lecture a week and an observation session. It is so rewarding and you learn so much about yourself and children.",
    "If you haven't previously been exposed to child development theory, the material can be hard to organize and digest, but I feel like I'll definitely be a better parent because of this course. The observations were the absolute highlight of my semester-- they were absolutely heartwarming as well as being really valuable practical learning experiences."
