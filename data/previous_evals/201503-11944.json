    "Such a fun class! Deming changes the poets every time he teaches the class, but the selection is sure to be interesting. He is also one of the best professors I've had at Yale in terms of steering a conversation and leading the seminar -- it is always a privilege to take a class with him. Being able to combine creative and critical work is also really exciting. Plus, you are bound to have an interesting mix of people in the class!",
    "Take it! For the prof., for the other kids, for the poetry.",
    "Each week you read a book of contemporary poetry (almost all published in 2015) and then discuss the poetry with an eye to the poetics during class. Many of the poets came for a separate two hour conversation with our class which was AMAZING. This class was such a wonderful find, and I consistently looked forward to it.",
    "This class is an intense seminar on contemporary poetry. You read a book of poems a week and then talk in class. The class tends to draw academic heavy-hitters (or at least did for us), so the conversation teetered between fascinating and tedious. Deming is wonderful though! Take this class if you like reading poetry. Don't take it if you're looking for a writing class--there's only one creative assignment.",
    "The chance to hear in depth from contemporary poets about their poetics and their thinking is very valuable and added much to the class.",
    "Take it! You'll read some of the freshest, most original poetry being written today and meet the poets who are doing it. This class made even the most opaque poetry enjoyable (or at least interesting). It's not terribly taxing, although the time at out-of-class required events adds up. Professor Deming does an excellent job facilitating discussion and helping (forcing?) you to articulate a stance towards very difficult questions about language. I often felt like we'd barely even scratched the surface in seminar and left wanting to continue the conversation, to the ire of my friends, but they're really just jealous they didn't take it.",
    "An interesting dive into the thoughts and responses of your peers to contemporary poetry. Professor Deming is a patient and generous seminar leader and he welcomes constructive criticism of the poets and their philosophies. However, check that you will enjoy the majority of the readings over a 13 week period before taking this class and not just a few of them.",
    "This class is a really great chance to get an understanding of what is happening in contemporary poetry and also understanding why poets have a poetics for what they do. It's helpful if you are a writer, because Deming challenges you to think about what you are trying to accomplish with your poetry and wants you to be able to talk about your poetry in a way that highlights your personal poetics. It was really fun to talk to the contemporary poets who came to visit because we could follow up on our classroom debate and hear what the poet has to say for their own work. The reading for the class was really good, and varied. Different people in the class developed different tastes, and I think there was something for everyone to grab onto and really enjoy. It wasn't an easy class, but it was really solid.",
    "This is among the top few classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Deming curated an excellent reading list of contemporary poetry, written by diverse poets, and invited several of these writers to visit campus and discuss their poetics with the class. We read a book of poetry a week, along with poetics essays. Professor Deming moderates discussion very well, and asks follow up questions so that students are pushed to develop their ideas. This is a great opportunity to become a better reader and writer of poetry. Prof Deming gives thorough feedback on written assignments.",
    "An amazing syllabus, and the opportunity to meet some really brilliant poets. BUT, bewarethough Professor Deming is very charming and clearly brilliant in a lot of ways, he proved to be a terrible discussion leader. I left almost every class meeting frustrated, dreaming of what could have been if instead the (really astonishingly smart) students in the class had been left to discuss without his stunting mediation. If you can find a class with a syllabus that excites you as much, but seems like it has more potential for valuable class discussion, go with that. If not, I'm still really proud of the things I wrote for this class, and happy to have read what I did-I don't regret taking it at all... I just think it could have been much better than it was.",
    "Youll read some stuff you like, some stuff you dont like, and some stuff you dont know what to make head or tail of. Before taking this course, Id hardly read any modern poetry because I didnt know where to begin, was anxious about not understanding it, etc. Now I just enjoy it--well, some of it--the way I enjoy reading books and essays. I took this as a senior seminar for the major, which most people didnt do, but I found the extensive work that went into doing a term paper quite rewarding. Deming was always super helpful and knowledgeable and gave great input on assignments.",
    "A phenomenal course. The poetry we read is breathtaking, and Professor Deming is a fantastic seminar leader. The discussions are thoughtful and fascinating, exploring varying contemporary conceptions of what poetry is and what motivates it. The visits from many of the poets we read were a wonderful component of the class.",
    "In Deming's Contemporary Poetry and Poetics, you'll read poems and poets writing at the current moment, discuss the poems in class, and then get to meet with the poets who wrote them. This is an incredible opportunity if you want to learn about the cutting edge of poetry."
