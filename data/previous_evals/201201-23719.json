    "Question 1 - - Many of the readings were fantastic and thought-provoking, however a few (maybe one or two per week) could be weeded out.Question 4 - - This course was a lot of work because of all the reading. However, because it was such a small seminar, the work payed off.Question 7 - - Os and Willis were fantastic and really added a ton to the course. Specifically, I thought they were both good at really facilitating good discussion and pushing us much harder than most professors do in that sort of context.Question 8 - - This was one of the best courses I've ever taken, and definitely one of the best I've taken at FES.Question 10 - - Despite leaving me with more questions than I started, this course was very useful in helping me think about environmentalism and ethics broadly."

    "This course is structured as a seminar, and both Os and Willis are extremely effective at facilitating focused discussion.",
    "Os and Willis' expert facilitationThe mix of FES and Divinity School students - - and the high level of conversation brought by the specific 11 students in the classHow it made me think hard about all my other courses, past and present, in a new light.I really found myself looking forward to this course every week.",
    "From the start, this class had fantastic, rigorous, and illuminating conversations. Everyone was highly engaged- both the professors and all the students. It was a small seminar- 11 students, 2 professors- and something just seemed to click. Students felt free to take risks with their interpretations of the readings and the professors not only listened but responded thoughtfully and respectfully. I loved it.",
    "It started to question many of the assumptions we make in conservation, which is important for those who are dedicating their professional lives based on such assumptions"

   "comments": [
    "More effort needs to be placed on developing the basic knowledge to engage in these high-order discussions. I feel I haven't really come away with a good knowledge of broad ethical approaches, language, concepts",
    "As mentioned above, a few readings could be weeded out to lighten the load slightly and concentrate on the better readings.Though both professors were great facilitators, Willis was definitely better at leading discussions and not letting things stagnate, as they did once in a while under Os' leadership.I would've liked to be able to submit a draft of my paper (had that option, at least) maybe a few weeks or month before it was due for comments from Os and Willis. I know that adds more work, but it seems appropriate given that it is50% of the grade. I felt I pushed myself hard on my paper, but I would've liked to take it even further.",
    "The strange thing about this seminar is that somewhere, we lost the thread. It's like we were all running together, not without effort but fast and strong, but somehow didn't notice that we had run straight off a cliff. I honestly felt like the bottom fell out. Maybe we needed to spend a class, or even two, on pulling together all the avenues of thinking we had pursued? Maybe producing two shorter papers instead of one long one would have kept my thought process intact? I don't know. I did feel that there were way too many readings assigned throughout the semester and that I would have preferred for us to focus on fewer readings and really discuss them in depth as opposed to racing through each of them. I know that each professor has to grapple with this issue but that doesn't necessarily diminish the feeling. I also still feel like I have no handle on ethics, I mean, none whatsoever, and though this wasn't an intro to ethics class, I felt ill equipped for the challenge.",
    "There needs to be more lectures given by the professors that lay some groundwork and provide a vocabulary to the students before discussion begins."

It did not devolve into an unstructured arena for people shooting off their opinions -the discussions remained quite focused throughout the semester.",
