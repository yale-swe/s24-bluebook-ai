    "The course's biggest strength is its instructor, Brenda Cartmel. However, I unfortunately feel that because cancer epi is such a broad topic, I am walking away from the semester with fairly superficial knowledge. It would be great to see this course with a structure perhaps similar to nutrition, where students had a weekly discussion section.",
    "This course provided a wonderful overview of cancer epidemiolgoy. The use of guest lecturers provided perspectives from professionals in different fields, which was very useful. Cancer epidemiology is too broad to be covered in one course alone, but this class did as well as it could to cover the most relevant topics. Absolutely excellent.",
    "Great course. A very good overview to cancer for people unfamiliar with the topic.",
    "This was a good course. I really liked the \"survey\" nature of the course, with many different lecturers\/topics each week of the semester. I think it might be helpful to tie in the guest lectures a little bit so there is more consistency throughout the course - perhaps a standard structure\/template for presentations and\/or having a *brief* weekly homework assignment (1-3 questions) about topics to ensure that students get similar outcomes from each lecture.",
    "I enjoyed this course. There is a lot to be learned about the etiology, diagnosis, risk factors of cancer. Though I have a background in cancer epidemiology, I liked that this class focused on several major risk factors and cancers that are public health concern. I thought he guest lecturers were great and I liked that the professor supplemented each guest lecture with her own. My one dislike is that all the power points are different. Some are hard to look back on and understand what was trying to be conveyed. Also, assignments were lengthy at times and was more work than I thought it would be.",
    "The course covers a lot of material, and packs a lot into the semester. Guest speakers spoke to us about their area of expertise in cancer, and most of them were great.During the afternoon time slot, I find it harder to stay awake, so it would be nice if the instructors involved the class more in their presentations.",
    "the course is very informational, well-organized.",
    "The course gave me an excellent overview of all cancer sites, including pathology, measurement\/definitions, and epidemiology. The course is unique in that most lectures are taught by visiting lecturers. This component is fantastic in that it allows a unique insight into a cancer site by an expert in that specific field. The downside of this is that each lecturer is not equally engaging or informative as a lecturer. Overall, I feel the guest lectures were a positive to the course, and we were very lucky to have them.",
    "The subject material is very interesting, but some of the lectures could have gone a little more in depth."
