   "comments": [
    "I definitely would not recommend this class. Of course it is a major requirement for some of the engineering majors, but that should be the only reason to take it. The information is only going to be useful if you plan on actually implementing these circuits someday. You don't want to take this class just because you want to know how circuits work, but because you want to use them.",
    "DON'T take this class if you are trying to decide to be an EE major. Between the dry nature of the material and the incompetence of Pan as a lecturer, it will turn you off to electronics. The concepts can be interesting, but they need to be painstakingly extracted from the lectures. The only redeeming factor is the lab.",
    "I recommend this course for all future EE majors. It lays the groundwork for future courses and is very important.",
    "This is a terrible class and I would not recommend it to another student unless they had to take it. Then I would hope that they are mentally strong enough to endure it.",
    "I would not recommend EENG 200 to a fellow student unless they are planning on majoring in Electrical Engineering.",
    "DO NOT CONSIDER IT AS AN INTRO course! I recommend students to learn the basics of the topics (transistors, diodes, etc.) before taking the class.",
    "It was a good class. The material at the end is definitely more difficult, but if you put in effort and see the professor when you need help it shouldnt be too bad.The lab is really fun and you end up building a real working robot. its awesome!",
    "The material is okay, but the lectures are rather painful. There's a reason this class lacks a Sc designation - it's not a science class. You do a lot of algebra, but never actually learn how the circuit elements you characterize actually function, or what they actually are. As such it's rather dry, and it's presented poorly as well. No reason to take this unless you have to. Lab is decent, though a bit unfair since the class plus lab is still just one credit.",
    "This class is a bit tough. It's a lot of problem sets, and the labs are kind of annoying until the end. The final project (lab) is pretty fun. I wouldn't really recommend this class to anyone unless they have to take it. It's required for EE and MechE, so go do it, it's not all that bad.",
    "EE200 is unlike other introductory courses. It is a challenging tour through the fundamentals of electrical engineering that assumes an already strong science and math background. I would only recommend it to students who have already taken a year of advanced physics and are already familiar with the basics of circuits and electricity.",
    "This class is probably quite a good litmus test of whether one likes and chooses to major in EE. This class was as expected tough, but what was frustrating was the ineffective administration of the class.Notes should be posted online before a class for more effective learning in class, rather than much after.Problem sets did not comprehensively cover the subject material of the class, were often too difficult and without solutions ultimately, the learning process was further hampered. Moreover, they were not graded and returned regularly. For the midterm and final, practice problems\/past finals would have been useful as a guide, yet were not provided despite requests.The final project was challenging and time-consuming, but the senior engineer Mr Jackson was very helpful and approachable."
