    "YES PLEASE TAKE IT. Please continue Chinese second semester, since it only gets better from here. Even though it gets harder, somehow it seems like less work.",
    "Yes!",
    "A semester of learning beyond conversational Chinese. We learned mostly intellectual Chinese - stuff from Chinese history to Chinese politics to Chinese economics. But all in simplified versions, so don't be scared off.",
    "CHNS 153 is a good continuation to CHNS 152. There is still a ton of daily work, but I definitely found it more manageable than last semester because you figure out how to most efficiently study for the quizzes and exams. There is also more variation in the types of assignments (e.g. presentation in chinese on topic of your choice), which make the semester a bit more interesting and practical. If you are interested in improving your chinese, I recommend continuing with this second semester of chinese. After my experience with CHNS 152 I decided to take CHNS 153 Cr\/D\/F, but it probably wasn't necessary; the tests this semester seemed easier."
