    "If you are interested in changing notions of sovereignty, law, and politics, then this course is a very good choice.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in the fundamental questions related to sovereignty and world politics.",
    "This course is such a broad handling of the topic of sovereignty that it is quite fast paced, but you will feel very comfortable with the topic when you are done. It is practical and deeply philosophical at the same time. A great course. Theorists and empirical pol. scientists should both take this course."

    "This course deepened my knowledge considerably of the political science subfield of contemporary political theory.",
    "This course was key for me, I am working in Political Theory, and so most of the materials are directly on topic with my interests. Those interested in Europe and European thought will find this course to be important."
