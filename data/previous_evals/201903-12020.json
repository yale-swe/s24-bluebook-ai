    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students interested in primatology, human evolution or both. The course is reading-heavy, so it's necessary to make adequate time to engage with the materials!",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to students interested in primates or evolution. This is a key course for students interested in pursuing a career in Biological Anthropology, and if students were interested in gaining a wide breadth of Biological Anthropology, but were not necessarily interested in primates, I would still recommend the course.",
    "Yes. Great weekly topics and interesting readings. Professor Watts is incredibly knowledgeable and has amazing stories."
