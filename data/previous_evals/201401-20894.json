    "Yes",
    "I learned a lot from this class and learning from your classmates is an important part of the course. If I were not an architecture major, I would imagine that Basic Drawing would probably be more helpful to enhancing my drawing skills, though.",
    "A fun class, not as much work as the Analytic Model, except perhaps in the last few weeks. If you don't plan to be in the architecture major, think twice before signing up because the architecture students tend to form a bit of a cult from which you may unfortunately feel excluded, which makes the class a lot more work than reward.",
    "ARCH 154 is a fairly rigorous exploration of not only various conventions in Architectural Drawing but also the associated conceptual implications of those forms of representation. You will find that this course demands a great deal of time and effort but you will find few other courses as rewarding as this one. If it has not been made clear, I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student, but only one who is willing to commit to program fully.",
    "I would highly recommend ARCH 154. It revolutionized the way I approach drawing and I am so grateful that I took the class.",
    "If you are going to be taking this class you know (even if you don't understand) what you are getting in for. Late nights, occasional panic to meet the deadline, and frustration at your inability to draw are all part of the package. Yet, when I look back at it, there was not an assignment I did not enjoy. You also get much better at drawing and thinking about architecture, which is the whole point.",
    "Yes, but probably only if you are planning to major in architecture because it is a lot of work",
    "I would definitely recommend this course--you learn a lot and improve immensely. I also really enjoyed most of the assignments. That being said, it is a lot of time so be prepared.",
    "Drawing Architecture is a great class (also required if you're planning on applying for the Architecture Major). START YOUR DRAWINGS EARLY. THEY TAKE SO MUCH LONGER THAN YOU THINK. Also, take advantage of your TF's. They're so amazing and are so incredibly helpful as long as you reach out to them.",
    "This class was excellent, though I would not recommend if you are not intending to major in architecture. Victor is an incredible professor, but a lot of the learning in the class occurs by working with and learning from the other people in the class. And if you don't commit to the hours necessary to succeed in the class, you won't get much out of it. Despite the work, it is possible to get it done without having to do crazy hour weeks (though many do). If you invest in each project, this will be an amazing class."
