   "comments": [
    "I really liked this course. Many people want to take intro to micro freshman year and I highly recommend taking the seminar. With Tolga Koker you will have a great time, learn the material in a much more interesting and fun way than in the lecture. I had no previous economics background and I did not feel like I was at a disadvantage. The course does not seem to be much more work than the lecture (6 problem sets, 1 midterm, 1 final) and the level of math is actually pretty basic (the word derivative is never actually used so you don't have to worry about the math being too difficult). Try to get Tolga Koker as the other teacher does not seem to be as clear, does not give out supplementary handouts, and does not run good exam preparation sessions.",
    "I'd recommend the course to anyone interested in starting econ.",
    "You get so much out of being a part of the seminar. Definitely worth it despite the curve and extra work.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a good intro class for economics, and Professor Koker is a good teacher. He is a very lively person, however his stories can sometimes distract from the subject at hand.",
    "Econ 110 is great if you're thinking about going into economics or if you love the subject. If you are looking to learn basic concepts for everyday life, the lecture is a better fit.",
    "lots and lots of reading. if you arent going to do the reading, dont take the class because you will be screwed. tolgas lectures are good, but you will be completely lost without the reading",
    "Many prospective econ majors take the seminar, while many students who just want to fufill a QR credit take the lecture. This makes the grading curve for the seminar harsher, but if you keep up with the textbook readings and go to Tolga for help, you will end up with a decent grade (not an easy A for sure). Overall, you learn a lot from the seminar and especially if you want to take upper level econ courses, this class gives you a firm foundation.",
    "I very much enjoyed taking Econ 110 even though I personally struggled with econ more than other classes. Professor Koker is an incredibly effective teacher, and having him as a teacher made class way more fun than I expected it to be. I also enjoyed the more personal atmosphere of econ 110.",
    "Economics 110 is an awesome course. I would recommend it to anyone with limited economics background or with a great passion for economics. Definitely taking this course with Tolga Koker is one of the most memorable things you can do at Yale. He is a wonderful instructor with great credentials toboth inform you and keep you entertained throughout the semester. The course material is not challenging at all, and the work load is very manageable. However, that being said, the tests are graded on very steep curve and the difference between an A and B could be by maybe two questions on the final.",
    "The class is the best intro class you can take at Yale for Econ. Tolga is the best professor on the subject. He hosts great review sessions and is really helpful at office hours when a problem set is due. If you ever need help, he will always make himself available to do so. So if you want to take microecon, take Tolga's class. The grading curve is really not bad, either: 40% get an A and 50% get a B. If you work hard in the class and study efficiently for it, an A is definitely feasible.",
    "You should definitely take this class. Although it is curved and can be really competitive, this class is worth taking.",
    "The Econ seminar is a \"lecture discussion,\" meaning a lecture that students are allowed to interrupt with questions. The first half (before the midterm) was easy enough to follow and keep up with, but after the midterm we started going a lot faster and it became harder to stay on top of the new material. As difficult as the second half was, I would still recommend this course.",
    "Microeconomics is what it is. If you want to learn about individual firms\/producers and consumers and how their decisions affect the market, etc. then take this course. I think everyone should have general knowledge about this stuff, so I would recommend it. Plus if you get into Tolga's seminar it'd be a shame to turn it down.",
    "Because of the seminar setting, you will definitely end up learning more in this class than in the lecture. Also, it is easier to clarify your questions and doubts if you have any. The office hours are really helpful, especially if you want the answers to the problem set questions. The only downside to taking this class is the curve. This class is strictly curved, and since everyone who does this class is committed to learning economics the score variance is low. So if you make a few simple mistakes in the exam your grade could easily drop from an A to an A- or even a B+.",
    "Though Economics 110 serves its purpose well as an introduction to microeconomics, it remains unclear what the seminar has to offer that the lecture, Economics 115, does not. The material covered in 110 is fairly straightforward, and at times it is helpful to be able to study the material in a small setting, but full appreciation of the small setting requires an excellent instructor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for people who are really interested in economics. It's a difficult class so it's not for those people who are casually interested in the subject. But take it with Tolga if you can.",
    "Economics 110 provides an in-depth and comprehensive study of the discipline. I learned a lot and am very pleased that I took the course. Students with whom I've spoken seemed to have a better experience in Econ 110 than in its lecture counterpart, Econ 115. The reason is that Econ 110 allows students to interact with and get to know their professor very well--Tolga has a great personality and sense of humor. With that said, the course is not discussion-based, butone always has the opportunity to ask questions. The keys to success: OFFICE HOURS and READING THE TEXTBOOK. Tolga explains everything clearly during office hours and even gives the answers to problem set questions if asked. The textbook, however, is the greatest help. Doing the examples and exercises as you read reinforces and teaches you the concepts you need to know. The practice problems at the end of each chapter are also very helpful. If you can't get to the reading when it's assigned, that's not a problem. Simply make sure to study along with the textbook (i.e. while doing practice problems from the textbook) before the tests.",
    "It's a very good course, the material isn't too bad if you go over lecture notes and the book after each lecture\/ at the end of each week. I would recommend Econ 110 to another student because of the professor's helpfulness, the size of the class (allows you to interact with the instructor) and it'll give you a taste of how economics is.",
    "Take this class! It is a great intro to microeconomics! Tolga is great!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as long as you're not obsessed with getting an amazing grade. If you're super stressed about the grade you're going to be miserable, while if you just relax and realize that 90% of the class will get a B- or above, you'll feel better. You can get away with not doing the reading for this class and just having to work a lot for problems sets\/when reviewing for the final and midterm, so it's not a huge source of stress most of the time, but then there are periods of intense stress\/work. If you want to take economics, take this course, because you get more attention from the teacher than you do in the large lecture (so I gather) and although it's rigorous and frustrating at times, it's worth it.",
    "This seminar-style approach to an introduction to microeconomics was a great class. We covered a ton of material, learning a lot in a very fast-paced environment. But it wasn't completely overwhelming because the information was taught in a very clear and organized way, and it was incredibly interesting. I would recommend taking this class if you are up for a healthy challenge. Everyone really loved this class, although there is no doubt that it is rather difficult at times. Also, there isn't much work - only 6 problem sets spaced throughout the semester that each take a couple of hours, and a midterm and a final.",
    "Yes I would! I'm not sure how the curve compares to the curve in the lecture class, and I'm pretty sure this class has ruined my GPA, but it's a good class."
