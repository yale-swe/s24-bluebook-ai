    "I do not recommed the class as it is today. I think a few improvements could make it much more instructive.",
    "Yes, the course is a must to have basic understanding of solid state physics.",
    "It has good depth as well as good broadness.",
    "Summary - Solid State is a right of passage; it is a challenge, but survivable.In terms of selecting a course from a list of required courses, I would recommend Solid State as the best available option open to us. But if not required, then no, I would not recommend this course.",
    "Yes, I strongly recommend this course!",
    "Solid State Physics is both an interesting and important field for physicists and engineers alike. Be warned for this course, however, if you plan to master the material, then be prepared to spend a lot of time reading the two textbooks thoroughly on your own as the lectures are not terribly educational.",
    "Introductory Solid State Physics class, covers about a semester and a half of solid state at the undergraduate level. Students should take this class only if they have an interest in solid state physics - otherwise it's a waste of time."

   "comments": [
    "This course being not connected at all with my research (although required by the department), and being hard to follow and to understand, I don't feel like I have learnt helpful stuff.",
    "It provides crucial fundamentals in my research",
    "This course did increase my understanding of the foundations of the semiconductor industry from a different perspective that built upon my previous knowledge. However, it seemed as if the physics-based approach to explaining some basic materials science related concepts was inherently more complicated than necessary at times (although, granted, a physicist may view a materials class in the same light).In terms of research, I do believe this course has provided some insights that will be useful at least in understanding the basic foundations of some of the avenues my research may lead.",
    "The course helped to review some of the topics in solid state physics that I had covered previously, and introduced me (though somewhat superficially) to more advanced topics.",
    "Not much. I had taken two semesters of solid state physics before and almost everything was review for me."
