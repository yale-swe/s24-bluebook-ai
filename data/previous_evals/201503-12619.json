   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you're willing to push your comfort zone. There's quite a bit of writing - four papers - but if you're open minded and interested in the material, you'll get a lot out of the course. Professor Martin is passionate about the subject and very approachable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Martin is a great scholar and discussion leader. Class time flies by. I learned an enormous amount. The reading is quite reasonable (in fact, even light), but there are a lot of writing assignments, and some of them are quite difficult. So if you take this course, be prepared to have to spend a lot of time on the course in several weeks and then be able to put it on the back-burner in most other weeks. Professor Martin has his weaknesses (he is not always open to dissenting views), but overall this is a great class.",
    "I would say that it would be a great class for people interested in learning about who Jesus might have been as a historical figure and for people who are curious about how historians handle studying a person of great religious significance.",
    "If you take Prof. Martin's course, you will become a better student. TAKE THIS COURSE. If you need a WR credit, take this class. You will learn more here than an English course. If you are a RLST major, take this class. You will totally enjoy going to class each day. If you are a HIST major, take this class. You will learn about the historical method applied to some very old records of 1st century life. If you are at all interested in Jesus, take this class. You will learn to think critically about where the stories of Jesus of Nazareth have developed, and you will apply all you learned to your other courses. If you take Prof. Martin's course, you will become a better student. TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. This was probably my favourite class of the semester. You learn of lot of things, not just about Jesus, but also the early Christian community and pre-Rabbinic Judaism. For a writing class, the workload is relatively light (3-4 short papers with no research requirement); but be warned: Prof. Martin is very exacting on writing standards."
