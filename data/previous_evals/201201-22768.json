   "comments": [
    "Yes- Roman Empire is a fascinating period of history.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you are either interested in becoming a classics major or are deeply interested in Roman history and reading ancient authors. If not, the class can become dull, difficult, and unrewarding very quickly. Don't take it just because you can get a writing credit.",
    "I would not recommend this class to a fellow student. I did not come away feeling like it contributed to my education.",
    "As an engineering major, I found this course to be a great writing credit. Two papers, one 8 pager, one 12 pager, and a final. Since there's no homework it can be a challenge to force yourself to keep up with the reading, especially because you don't really need to have done it for the papers. You'll be in trouble for the final though. Overall, a great writing credit that isn't too much work.",
    "I'd heartily recommend this course!!",
    "Yes, the class has a reasonable workload, a midterm (essay if your in WR), a final exam and a final paper. I found the WR component to be reasonable, TAs were easily accessible to provide as much help as you needed, and to this point (I haven't received my final back) everything was graded fairly and reasonably.",
    "I would recommend the class if you take handwritten notes. It's very easy to get distracted in the class, but if you are really interested in the Roman Empire or want a pre-industrial credit, take this course. It's interesting, and the professor is really nice. The midterm, paper, and final were also straightforward and fairly easy compared to some other history classes.",
    "Great overview of the Roman empire - accessible to anyone. Not too much workload either.",
    "I would recommend it only if you love history and have the motivation to push yourself to do all the readings. The class requires a lot of time to get everything out of it.",
    "This course is what it says: An overview of the Roman Empire. It goes into a little more detail than I was expecting, but that is precisely why I enjoyed the course. I took it as a writing credit and it teaches you how to write historical analyses. The two papers were easily manageable (the entire Roman Empire is a vast information vat from which you can easily write a 1000 page book, let alone the 12 page papers). John Matthews lectures in a very story-telling manner, which is great! He is very friendly and approachable, and definitely knowledgeable.",
    "It is an excellent class. The readings seem disjointed at times because it is a classics course, but they are very good. The midterm and final are straightforward: ID's and an essay for the final or ID's for the midterm.The exams are fair and it is easy to do well if you put in the time. Overall, it is a good course and I strongly recommend it.",
    "Good history class, covers 600 years of Roman history. Pretty straightforward and not too much work. It's like storytime if you have any interest in ancient history.",
    "Great class and interesting material. Take it if you need a good history credit.",
    "Ridiculous amount of knowledge packed into this overview course. Interesting, but Prof. Matthews is retiring so I don't know if I would recommend whoever follows.",
    "I would definitely recommend thi course to another student.",
    "Great overview of the Roman Empire. But keep in mind, it is just an overview. The lectures touch upon the themes as to be expected, but I wish there was a little more time invested in the details. The readings are good, especially Suetonius, and the exams are fair. Do take it.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It was a great class for whoever likes history.",
    "Take it. I feel like the Roman Empire is something that everyone should have at least basic knowledge on as it is such a crucial time-period for the human race.",
    "This was a great class! Professor Matthews was engaging and did a great job covering a huge range of material. He covered important people and events, trends within the empire from inflation to the growth of army power to the rise of Christianity and the shift from Rome to Constantinople. If you want an engaging survey of the Roman Empire, this si the class for you. (plus its a WR)."
