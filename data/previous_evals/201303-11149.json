    "Absolutely take this class! It is a great intro language class. Take it to fulfill your language requirement of just for fun. It is fast paced and you will learn quite a bit of German in a semester. Try and get Annika as a instructor. She is really good.",
    "Totally. It's less work than you think.",
    "Intense, fast paced, and immersive approach to German. Really loved the course and introduction to German culture, would totally recommend it if you're genuinely interested in German language and culture.",
    "It's a l1 language class\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 It won't be very intellectually- provoking and you are not going to learn that much cultural stuff at the beginning (though the German songs are really cool). The professor is nice and helpful. I will recommend the class\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but don't expect too much for a L1 language course...",
    "It's a good class for a basic understanding of the German language. Difficult grammar, but very interesting.",
    "If you're looking for a language to take, German is a very good possibility. It's useful and about a third of the words are cognates with English. The sentence structure of German is very interesting and a little mind-bending at times, as it occasionally breaks from the traditional Latin structure of SVP. There is no reason to not take German.",
    "It is very hard. Know that"
