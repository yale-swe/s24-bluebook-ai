    "Lecture: The Lectures for the Lit section are very good. With few exceptions they were interesting, engaging, and made you look at the work in a very different way.Section: Robinson's section is for a very specific type of student, namely one that doesn't want a very student-driven section. Robinson has the tendency to go on long tangents and digressions and often 45-60 minutes of the 75 minute class will be spent with him talking to us. So actual student discussion was...minimal. Now, if you like that sort of thing, go for it, but if you (like me) would prefer a class that would have some sort of debate to it I DO NOT recommend this section. Often I felt like I wasn't really getting anything out of the books I was reading because we literally wouldn't talk about them.Recommendation: Not for me.",
    "If you like literature you'll like it. Yes, to those who are really interested in ancient literature.",
    "Homer, Sophocles, Virgil, Ovid, Dante, etc... If these names appeal to you and\/or you feel (as I did) that reading them is a necessary foundation for your learning, take the class. It's not that hard. Your papers should improve throughout the semester, and you can bullshit in section.",
    "Directed Studies Literature is a great course. The readings are really interesting and never too dense. The lectures also are generally fantastic. The readings follow a very logical course from Ancient Greece with Homer to Ancient Rome with Virgil and ending up with medieval literature with Dante. The readings complement each other well and build off\/refer back to each other in interesting ways. The course is very rewarding and definitely a great branch of DS.",
    "Take DS. The workload isn't nearly as bad as its reputation might suggest, and the works are fantastic. If you're on the fence, do it. You can't go back and do it later.Professor Robinson is a very solid choice for the fall semester-- you probably won't find a nicer, more kind-hearted professor; he's also great with Greek and Latin texts.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS Lit for other students. The material is fantastic and the discussions we had were really great.",
    "I would recommend this class if only for the fantastic works that we read in the first semester. The book list for DS Literature is amazing, and include many books that you should absolutely read before you die (or graduate from college), from Homer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Iliad& Odyssey to Dante\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Divine Comedy.As with other DS classes, the pace at which you move through the syllabus is kept at a quick clip, but I still found the workload to be somewhat manageable, although there were some weeks where I did not finish everything. I certainly did much more reading than most of my friends in other intro Literature\/English classes.",
    "I would describe this section of Directed Studies as a through examination of some of the greatest works of western literature. You read a lot in a short period of time, so discussion may not be as thorough, but you learn a lot from the readings and the incredible lectures. I would absolutely recommend this program because you get a comprehensive view of what shapes western literature in the more recent centuries.",
    "Directed Studies is intense but completely rewarding. DSLit is the opportunity to read and try to learn from some of the most important books in the western canon\u00e2\u0080\u0094I would absolutely recommend it. Tim Robinson is a fantastic scholar with a genuine, infectious, and adorable enthusiasm for his subject; he tended to carry on at length, which was often insightful but at the expense of real discussion.",
    "Class is fine, teacher sucks.",
    "I definitely would recommend it. It has enhanced my understanding of both ancient and modern literature.",
    "Directed Studies literature has an incredible syllabus, and it was a deeply rewarding experience to read these works in chronological order, tracing the evolution of their ideas and artistry. The readings in first-semester DS Lit were never overwhelming, yet when we were just reading excerpts, they were always substantial enough to get a pretty complete sense of the whole work.Professor Robinson is an incredibly nice person, and he puts a lot of effort into commenting on papers and offering support to students. He is also very knowledgeable and passionate about the classics. However, you should be aware that his class is lecture-based, not discussion-based like most other DS sections, and so I often felt I was missing out on a substantial part of the DS lit experience.",
    "The DS Lit syllabus is a juggernaut, in the best sense of the word: Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Dante -- if those names don't inspire the least bit of excitement, then this is not the class for you. And that's before even mentioning the Bible! Literature is the unifying force of the DS curriculum, and, in many ways, Professor Robinson is the great unifier. As a professor in both the Classics and English departments, he is able to draw upon literature, both classical and more contemporary, in a way that inspires a fresh, yet not tone-deaf approach to the texts. He goes to great lengths to make one feel comfortable in the classroom as well, which makes him an ideal professor for one's first semester of freshman year. At times, one wishes that he was not so generous as to extend deadlines and fail to hold people accountable for the reading, but these are necessary trade-offs for the warm classroom environment that the professor so successfully engenders."
