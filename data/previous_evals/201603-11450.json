   "comments": [
    "This course provided a focused examination of the problem of other minds and the possibility of dialogue. The syllabus drew from both the analytical and continental traditions in a way that was very creative and interesting. It was a challenge to learn to read across these traditions and how to compare them. Asaf also raised the question of form-and-content in our discussions when we talked about how to approach these texts.",
    "Although \"Intersubjectivity and Dialogue\" may seem too esoteric for an entire semester, it afforded a more specific lens into the writings of some of the most prominent philosophers of (mostly) the 19th and 20th centuries. I gained a deeper understanding of metaphysics\/ontology, as well as different perspectives for epistemological and even ethical questions.",
    "I was able to engage with a great deal of new thinkers, and improved my ability to come up with wonderful and sarcastic jokes about intersubjectivity and subjectivity.",
    "This course exposed me to phenomenology for the first time. I am interested in further pursuing the questions of consciousness and intersubjectivity after the course. I also appreciate gaining a broader scope of philosophical perspectives by reading such eclectic texts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Readings are great but it was very difficult to proceed with such great speed through so many traditions.",
    "The syllabus for the course was fantastic - and I appreciated that we went through each reading thoroughly and methodologically, while also allowing for discussion of larger issues. (At the same time, we had to cut out an entire section of the syllabus at the end of the semester which I would have liked to have read and discussed)",
    "The course could benefit greatly from more structure and a clearer vision of what the objective of the material for the class is. Too often we would get behind in the syllabus because discussion would get bogged down in interpretation of the reading. The material is not well suited for lecture-style presentation, and letting students guide the discussion is not always effective with very dense material. A better approach might be to simply work through the text with guided discussion, where students are allowed to discuss and ask questions, but the professor provides a clear direction and pace for the discussion and makes sure that the major points are covered.",
    "The course was great overall, but could have benefitted from a little bit better organization. The syllabus was quite ambitious, but we kept falling further and further behind (we spend about 1.5 sections on each section of material so we were very far behind by the end)",
    "strengths: gained in-depth understanding of topic, exposes students to new kinds of philosophy, allows for creative thinking weaknesses: sometimes lacked clarity and direction"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. The reading material is fascinating and it's not everyday that the philosophy department will offer courses that cover both analytical and continental philosophers. You will end up liking some, and not liking others, but regardless of that, this course will force you to learn how to get the kernel of the argument out of these very different styles of writing.",
    "I'd only recommend this if you are already deeply interested in the texts and themes of the class. Asaf is great (especially in office hours and in responses to papers) but sometimes let class discussions get diverted from the core questions. Seminar discussion tended to meander. That said, it's an interesting syllabus and approach. If the texts intrigue you, consider taking it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, though I do think that a bit of previous philosophy (especially in metaphysics and epistemology) is necessary. Be prepared to spend the most time working through the texts (many of which are quite difficult); the papers are not too much work.",
    "The material is certainly interesting, but the course is lacking in organization and structure. It was the first time this class was taught, so maybe it will improve with subsequent iterations.",
    "I would recommend this course, however I would recommend this mostly for students that have a substantial background in philosophy. It does not require all that much, but I think the amount of ground we cover requires that students be prepared to and familiar with approaching new thinkers.",
    "yes! take"
