    "Psych110 was a comprehensive introduction to psychology, very interesting and with a reasonable workload. I would recommend it without a doubt, especially because of Paul Bloom who was truly the highlight of my week!",
    "Great if you want to learn the basics of psychology!",
    "Like Outback Steakhouse's bloomin' onion, Paul Bloom is everything a student could ever want -- layered, crispy, and well-seasoned. Every lecture, his raw but soothing voice caresses my auditory system as I soak in the wealth of knowledge that this legend of a man has to offer. For example, I learned that due to the concept of cognitive dissonance, my parents have manipulated me into believing I love them by not ever paying me for doing household chores. Those swindlers!! But yeah, this is a pretty good class. too bad i only went to 30% of the lectures",
    "Great introductory course! Perfect for learning all those random statistics that you can bring up at dinner with your friends to impress them. Learned a lot of interesting things and watched some great movie clips. This class inspired me to watch Momento (part of studying for the midterm--very valid method) and it's a great movie. You also get to learn from a critically acclaimed professor and that's part of the reason we all go to Yale right?! Take it!",
    "Go for it. Keep up with readings and work, but good class.",
    "PSYC 110 is an amazing introductory class for anyone, regardless of you are a psych major or not. Paul Bloom is great, and the material is very interesting and relevant.",
    "Take it if you're willing to work hard for a good grade. Even if you CR\/D\/Fail the course, you have a lot of requirements to worry about, including weekly reading responses, study credit, a lengthy book review, and two exams. That said, Bloom is fantastic and I looked forward to his lectures every week.",
    "PSYC 110 is a great overview of all things psychology. I would recommend PSYC 110 to anyone interested in acquiring a basic understanding of psychological concepts.",
    "Classic introductory psychology class: not too hard but you learn stuff that either blows your mind or you've read before. There's no section, and the lectures are usually entertaining to attend. The reading constitutes the majority of the homework load, but it is all very easy reading, interesting but not overly dense.",
    "If you are interested in psychology or understanding why humans behave the way they do, this is a very good class for you. I want to be a psych major, so I'm really glad I took this class, but most of the people taking it didn't want to be psych majors, and they also loved the class. It's really a great way to better understand why we function the way we do and which factors in our lives are in our control and beyond our control. The content is honestly just fascinating. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Psychology 110 is a class I would recommend to anyone. Every lecture left me awe-inspired. I can't wait to take more psychology, thanks to this class. Best class I've every taken.",
    "This is a really good course! Honestly, it's super interesting and does an incredibly job of giving you an introduction to psychology. If you're at all interested, and have the space in your schedule, I would highly recommend that you take it. Professor Bloom does an incredibly job with the course, and it was a not too time-consuming course that does a great job balancing out any schedule.",
    "Interesting psychology course with the stereotypical Yale workload - readings, reading responses, and two exams. Lectures are engaging, and the curve is not bad at all if you actually do the readings as they are assigned. That said, some students were freshmen who probably weren't yet used to college lecture courses.",
    "The class is huge and sometimes you feel pretty anonymous, but it's a great way to introduce yourself to college-level psychology. Be prepared for a quite a bit of reading, but the reading responses and general workload are quite manageable.",
    "An entertaining survey course that is worth taking for its own sake.",
    "Low workload; intuitive material that is fascinating and easy to learn. Bloom is a friendly, joking professor who is very good at teaching psychology to anyone.",
    "I would recommend Psych 110 to all students, as I think that it really is a pretty valuable introductory course to have taken. The class shallowly explores nearly all of the topics of psychology, which relate widely to many other disciplines. The class is very interesting, enjoyable, and not terribly difficult.",
    "A gestalt of the more interesting aspects of psychology, and an invitation to pursue more courses in the department. Or, a great way to get a glimpse of the main principles of psychological theory.",
    "Everyone should be required to take PSYC 110. It is a phenomenal course and really teaches you about your own mind. It was truly eye-opening, and Paul Bloom is the greatest!",
    "It was the most interesting class I had and seriously made me consider majoring in Psychology.",
    "A truly great class with Paul Bloom. Interesting subject matter taught by an engaging professor!",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 110! Paul Bloom was great and it wasn't too much work and the topics discussed were very interesting. I felt like I learned a lot of information that's been coming in handy in my daily life and in other courses. The class is definitely not a gut, though - there's a significant amount of reading and if you don't do it, it comes back and punches you in the face the night before the midterm. If you just want to chill, I'd suggest Credit\/D-ing it because the class is legitimately so interesting and that way you wouldn't need to be stressed about the readings or weekly writing assignments.",
    "Lots of interesting material in the lectures, but a lot of cramming before the test.",
    "PSYC 110 is a pre-med requirement, so obviously my recommendation wouldn't matter much in that regard, but if I had the option I would not have taken it. It was too stressful for an intro level course.",
    "This course, especially when taught by Paul Bloom, is amazing. It is more work than expected; although there is not much homework, when assigned, the readings are always very long. However, the subject matter is very interesting and taught in an accessible and engaging manner; and Paul Bloom's work is just so fascinating! We're lucky to have him as a researcher AND a teacher here at Yale.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to all Yale students!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!! It MADE my first semester at Yale and I actually looked forward to Mondays because I had Psych that day!!! Seriously, take this class (especially with Paul Bloom).",
    "PSYC 110 is very hard but also very fun.",
    "This course crams multiple topics into 12 weeks. It's intense, but I loved it. I would definitely recommend this course. Take it with Professor Bloom!",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 110 to another student. It is a great introductory course that is interesting and useful. However, I might recommend an AP Psych student looking for a more challenging psychology course to skip it.",
    "Take it. Paul Bloom is amazing.",
    "If you take any large lecture course at Yale, this should be it. Take it! Paul Bloom is amazing, the ideas are fascinating and have wonderful applicability in real life (you'll be learning about mental illness and how to be happy the week before finals, which is wonderfully sensitive of the course), and it is definitely a manageable courseload with very reasonable expectations. Going to lecture was often the highlight of my day.",
    "A great class! No matter what major you are considering, would highly recommend this for everyone.",
    "Definitely take this class, but keep in mind you do have to put in some work.",
    "I must-take at Yale! It will leave you questioning what you thought you know about ethics, human relations, and even babies.",
    "Psyc 110 is an essential class. I would DEFINITELY recommend it to another student. I took this class in my freshman fall with Paul Bloom, and it was often the highlight of my week!",
    "Great course. Professor Bloom is a phenomenal lecturer, and the course is well designed to give you an introduction to several topics in psychology. The material is very interesting, as are the assigned readings. Be warned however: the course is a fair amount of work. Weekly reading responses, a 12 page book review, and 2 tests that can be tricky. However, if you are willing to put in the work, you will get a lot out of it. The book review in particular will expose you to an exciting new idea in psych, and supplements what you learn in lecture. Highlights were the guest lectures by President Salovey and Dean Tamar Gendler: both amazing!",
    "A fun class that isn't too stressful and covers very interesting and relatable material. I definitely would recommend it to another student, because I personally find psychology very interesting and the professor is amazing.",
    "This class is a great class for anyone with the slightest interest in psychology. You learn about so many interesting things. Everyone should take this class with Bloom before they graduate.",
    "Awesome, engaging topics + Paul Bloom make for one of the most memorable courses you will take! Not a gut: lots of reading, weekly reading responses, 3000 word book review, and tricky exams, but definitely worth it. Great social science credit for non-majors.",
    "This class is a lot of reading and class attendance is important, but it is worthwhile and fun. There is very little covered that isn't relevant and interesting to the daily life of a college student, I would absolutely recommend it. The wide scope of the course also makes it a strong class for MCAT preparation.",
    "I took Intro Psych because it was one of those classes that everyone says you should take before you graduate Yale, and Im really glad I did! Dont let anyone tell you differently, it is a lot of work, as you are held more or less accountable for all of the many readings on the test, if you want a high grade. Paul Bloom was a great professor, and I highly recommend taking this class with him. The lectures are all very interesting, and the assignments and tests are fair. The guest lectures were a highlight of the course as well! You learn a lot of basic psychology, and it is actually very relevant to day-to-day life. I agree with everyone else that this is a class you should take before graduating.",
    "Good class, but don't take it if you already took AP Psych. Unless you're looking for an easy A. But don't be fooled--the A is only easy IF you keep up with your work.",
    "Pretty good class, although I don't really understand why there's so much hype around it. I think I would've enjoyed it much more as a freshman. As a sophomore, the high school structure of the class annoyed me, and I've certainly taken more interesting classes at Yale. Also, everyone says you MUST take psychology at some point in your life in order to understand people, but frankly most of what we learned is obvious. Much of the class consisted of putting a name on a phenomenon I already knew existed. That said, Paul Bloom is a great lecturer, and being in class was honestly really fun. I just don't think this class is the \"must-take\" that everyone makes it out to be.",
    "Definitely take this class, if only credit\/D. It's honestly one of the coolest classes I've ever taken.",
    "Take it. Good course, perfect for Credit\/D",
    "I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "Lectures are fun. Take it Cr\/D to learn some cool stuff and not stress about the grade.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in psychology who has a lot of patience and self-discipline. The class is very unstructured and the grading is frustrating, but the lectures make it worth it. Also, the textbook can be entertaining because of the jokes that Daniel Gilbert throws in. If you choose to take the class, do it with someone you know or try to get to know someone in the class so that you can help each other \/ empathize over the frustrations.",
    "Definitely very interesting, but too much work for what it's worth.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The lectures were interesting, the workload was about average, and both Professor Bloom and Chun and amazing lecturers.",
    "Do not take it if you have taken AP Psych before, unless you did not get a 5 on the AP test and have to take it for your major. The content was too repetitive to add anything to my previous knowledge of intro psychology and I should have taken something else in place of this course. The amount of work required for this course is not worth taking it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS BEFORE YOU LEAVE YALE! This class is an absolute must-take! The things you learn will be information you will remember and use for the rest of your life!",
    "A very fun lecture! But I'm glad I took it Credit D because it was a lot of work for an intro class. Exams were too hard and the weekly responses were annoying. I think the amount of work we had to do took away from the fun of the class. Such a shame.",
    "Intro Psych is a good, engaging survey course. You won't go into depth about most things, and it sometimes feels kind of like a series of popular psych fun facts, but that is kind of the nature of introductory survey courses. Professor Bloom is engaging, and the class is rarely boring.",
    "This is a solid intro psych course, covering a wide range of subjects. I certainly recommend it to anyone interested in psychology, as it provides a solid grounding and jumping off point. It's not too hard, and is generally pretty interesting.",
    "Highly recommended course to introduce psychology.",
    "This class is awesome, and I think everyone at Yale should try to fit it in their schedule if they can, even if they are not majoring in psychology.",
    "Intro Psych was extremely interesting, and I'm very glad I took it with Paul Bloom. While I do not intend on being a psychology major, the class was broad enough to give me basic insight into the general workings of the human mind, which will be invaluable no matter what career I choose.",
    "I highly recommend this class! You gain a great base knowledge for psych and you get to enjoy listening to Professor Bloom lecture. The work is manageable and the reading supplements the class nicely.",
    "I loved Psychology 110, and will recommend it to everyone I speak to. After Psychology I feel like I am a walking dictionary in fun facts about humans and how we relate to each other. Professor Bloom made going to class exciting and fun, you never knew what quote-worthy sayings would come out next. The readings were pretty light until the mental illness reading, but this is assigned over Thanksgiving Break so it was quite doable. The guest lecturers were really interesting, especially President Peter Salovey's lecture on Love and Attraction. Psychology changed my view on the world. I think about this class almost every day. It is highly applicable to the real world, which is why no matter what interests you may have, you MUST take this course before you leave Yale.",
    "I highly recommend this class. The material is so interesting and Paul Bloom is a great professor. For the most part, the workload is reasonable and only really piles up around major assessments (two fairly difficult tests and a long book review). Overall, the class is really worth it - you'll learn a lot and get a unique perspective on the world.",
    "Yes. I think it's a great way to fill a distributional requirement, get started on a major, or just try something new and different. The class is not too painful (only one big paper and a few smaller reading responses) and the lectures are very engaging and worth attending.",
    "You'll look forward to this lecture very week, and the workload is pretty light. Really a Yale classic - take it before you graduate.",
    "This is a very interesting class, regardless of your major. Bloom is a great lecturer and includes many fun stories and videos in the class that relate to the material, which keeps the class interesting. This class covers a wide range of topics and requires no prior knowledge of psychology, making it easy and enjoyable to follow in class. However, there is a decent amount of reading to keep up with that is not tested on until the midterms, making it easy to fall behind and be forced to catch up at the end.",
    "It is a fair bit of work, but most of it you don't really have to do on time since it's a lecture without discussion sections. Very interesting course, since most everything you can see at work in life. I recommend.",
    "Take the class! It's a rather typical large lecture, but Bloom is a fantastic lecturer. You won't regret showing up to class at all (even though midterms mostly cover what's in the book). I think a lot of people went into this class thinking it would be a sort of gut class, but between the book review (mine ended up being around 12 pages long), and the two midterms, it wasn't that easy of a class. It was really interesting, and it definitely wasn't that hard if you paid attention\/took notes\/read the textbook. I think everyone regardless of major should take and would enjoy taking this class.",
    "I would recommend the class. For me, adjusting to the lecture-style teaching without any more personable sections was difficult, but I really liked the material we covered.",
    "Definitely take it. It's a great intro class, the work its manageable, and it's interesting.",
    "Considering the purpose and content of this class, it's a classic college class to take. So yes, take it, but don't expect to get too into detail for any one topic. You'll have fun, and if psychology is for you, you'll take more courses, if not, this course should satisfy your curiosity.",
    "As someone who has excelled in most other courses at Yale, I do not understand how one would get a good grade in Psychology given the grading of these tests. Having a good grasp of the course material does not translate to a good grade in this class. I would highly recommend taking this class Cr\/D\/Fail.",
    "Take is with Marvin Chung if you like more biological and science-based material and Paul Bloom if you like more moral and philosophical reasoning.",
    "Great class. Definitely take it. Bloom is an incredible lecturer. He makes the material interesting and clear. Keep up with the readings because you will get tested on them.",
    "The class is a lot of work, and if you want to do well in the class (on the exams) you actually have to do all of the readings. Even then, the exams are not easy, so good luck. Taking the class credit\/d was the best decision I made as a Junior taking the class. Also, I did not find the lectures to be super interesting or as enticing as people say.",
    "Do take it! Being an intro class it did a good job of covering a wide range of topics in Psychology. However, I would have desired more depth in each of the topics and given students more opportunities to pursue in-depth the topics in which they are personally involved \/ invested in. Overall, a great introduction to Yale and some influential ideas in Psychology.",
    "I think this course is a good one to take to get a good basic understanding of the key concepts of psychology. It will also give the student a good understanding if psychology is necessarily the path they want to follow. I have also found that many of the concepts I learned about in this course can be applied to other classes and other parts of my life.",
    "Psych 110 is an intense, yet very intriguing course that focuses on certain areas of psychology such as mental illnesses, emotions, the brain, and personality. There are weekly reading responses, reading from the textbook, and two exams. The final exam is before reading period, which makes finals much easier. There is also a lab experiment requirement which requires about five hours of participation and a book review assignment which is a ten page paper on a chosen psychology book.",
    "Very good class overall. Take credit\/D if you can since there can be a lot of reading",
    "Great class, expect to work hard but it's worth it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course.",
    "This is a really good course depending on who is teaching it. Paul Bloom is one of the best lecturers I have ever had. Actually, on second thought, he is the best lecturer I've ever had. The workload isn't light but it isn't overbearing, either. This includes weekly reading responses (400-600 words), a ~3000 word book review, and two exams. Be wary that the exams are highly detail-oriented, so you have to really do the readings in order to perform well. Still, I'm really glad I took the class and would recommend it to anyone!",
    "Very good course, everyone should take it at some point regardless of major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's not a lot of work and it was the most enjoyable class i took first semester.",
    "This class is a lot of fun and the lectures are really enjoyable. Definitely worth taking.",
    "A summary of the main ideas of psychology up to our times.",
    "A great class. I'd never taken psychology before, and as a junior I'm really happy that I got the opportunity. It feels like Professor Bloom is giving a TED talk during every lecture, which makes each one uniquely fascinating, and the guest lecturers were also very refreshing. The tests are EXTREMELY specific -- read and take notes from the book and understand the important slides from lecture.",
    "Psych 110 is an introduction to psychology. It covers a wide range of topics from mental health to cognitive capacities. I think that if a student knows that they have an interest in psychology, but don't know exactly what they want to study, this course could be really beneficial. I think that I started enjoying the course a lot more when I started looking for the things in the readings and in class I was interested in. Know that the course is really a broad overview of the field, and that each of the chapters we cover could be something one studies their entire lifetime. Lectures were enjoyable, and made better when the reading was done ahead of time.",
    "I highly recommend this course, particularly if it is the first Psychology course a student plans on taking. It offers a general overview of many topics in Psychology.",
    "A course about the human mind that instills a foundation while still being almost too cool. A must take class at Yale.",
    "something that everyone should be required to take",
    "Really cool course. I highly recommend it - just don't think that it is going to be easy. This course is A LOT of work. And the exams require a lot of memorization. So if you want to do well, get ready to work hard.",
    "Fantastic class! Bloom is great and teaches really well. Make sure you do the readings and make sure you go to every lecture. Sometimes going through slides isn't enough to make up for missing a lecture. Overall fantastic and super interesting. Would recommend it to anyone",
    "Psych 110 is a introduction to the core topics in Psychology. There are a lot of terms to memorize, but they all seem to have practical applications and are useful concepts to know.",
    "Psych 110 is a good class. It's hard and definitely a lot of work. If you're interested in psych, I'd take the class. I didn't find the material particularly interesting, which is probably why I didn't enjoy the class that much.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 110 to another student. It is a great course to take (especially as a freshman), as it will give you a good idea as to whether or not psychology is something you would like to pursue, and it gives you a good idea of what it's like to sit in a big lecture. The class is fast paced and covers a lot of information, but the work is definitely manageable and the information is fascinating.",
    "Prof Bloom is an entertaining and informative lecturer, and the guest lecturers (Profs Salovey, Gendler, among others) were amazing as well. Workload is determined by your learning style- skim or read the chapters as you want; the reading response each week is graded out of 2 points. The two midterms (no final) were eh. Be prepared for some midterm questions based on that one time Bloom mentions something in class and never brings it up again, or that one moment in that one Ted talk- as in, hard to study for, but if you pay attention you won't forget it. The class is curved, and probably the closest thing to a normal distribution I've seen at Yale. Overall: quintessential college course, a must-take!",
    "Intro Psych is a pretty good class. Professor Bloom is a great lecturer. He explained concepts clearly and through interesting ways. Even though we didn't get to know him personally, it was clear how much he cared about his students, which I really valued and appreciated. This class doesn't involve that much tough work. The readings, although long, were manageable and enjoyable. I also enjoyed the psychology experiment requirements because they gave us a good feel for what higher level psychology really involves. I thought the weakness of this class was the work students were assigned for it. I felt like the work we did for this class wasn't particularly inspiring or engaging, which contrasted greatly with Professor Bloom's lectures. You submit one reading response a week, which I thought were often a little silly and just to see if we had done the readings, without really making us think about the material. I also thought the term paper was a little silly, since it involved little deep thought on the material. If you want to get an overview of psychology just to say you know a little bit, I would recommend this class, but don't expect anything life-changing.",
    "Yes! If you have never taken a psych class this would be great. If you have, maybe take an upper level course.",
    "Into to Psych is a class that encompasses pretty much everything in the field of psychology. In this way, we talk about a lot but don't really go very in depth into much. The paper and exams were challenging, but the class was very interesting. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Fun lectures, boring readings... and grading isn't Too lenient, since it's an intro course.",
    "This class is not a gut, but a good huge lecture without too much work during the course. I would recommend if you want an easier 5th class. Yet, you should not expect an easy A.",
    "Pretty interesting course, but very much a shallow overview of every psych topic. Bloom gave us 2 non-cumulative midterms (no final), weekly reading responses that were pretty painless, and a 12-15 page \"book review\" that was unnecessarily long and definitely should be started a month in advance, but was overall worthwhile because it allowed for exploration into one topic you found interesting (ended up being one of my favorite parts of the course). There are no discussion sections, which is great schedule-wise, but also means you have little\/no interaction with your TFs. The exams were all very specific questions from the reading and lectures, so you had to go to lecture and read the textbook or else there was no way you would know any of the questions on the exams.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all of my friends.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 110 a fellow student as the class is well thought and it highly transforms the way you think. As a person who has never taken psychology before, I was very amazed how vast psychology was and now I am interested in taking even more courses in psychology.",
    "This is a good class to take and to have knowledge of. It is difficult and you really need to review all of the information to be able to do well on the final. I would suggest to take it credit D Fail to anyone who doesn't want to apply it to anything. The class itself is really fun but it is stressful for the amount of material it covers.",
    "It was a really great class and I recommend it to anyone with even the slightest interest in psychology. It did involve plenty of reading and one 10 page paper, but it didn't feel like a lot of work.",
    "This is a broad intro to many topics in psych that covers a lot of material quickly. I would recommend it because the lectures are interesting and Professor Bloom is a great teacher, just know that it requires a lot of studying since there is so much information.",
    "Highly recommend, you will learn a lot, and the basics of psychology can be applied to many different parts of life",
    "I would say the class is worth taking, but be prepared to put in the effort and do all the work.",
    "A good intro level class to take at Yale, especially if you have never studied psychology before.",
    "I would definitely reccomend the course, even to students not interested in study psychology. It is a great course and I think a lot of the material is just useful to know.",
    "Great class! Bloom's lectures are very enjoyable, and while the class covers a lot of material, I found each topic to be interesting.",
    "I would NOT recommend PSYC110 to my fellow students who are potentially thinking of majoring in PSYC.",
    "I'd recommend it for someone who already has some knowledge of psychology, such as a high school psych class or something. It was a lot to take in for a single semester with no background in psych.",
    "This was an interesting introduction course that I would recommend to anyone, even if it didn't serve their majors.",
    "PSYC 110 is a fantastic course (I think), especially if Professor Bloom is teaching it. The material is interesting and relevant to daily life, and the lectures were entertaining. Also, the workload is not too bad and the tests aren't too difficult if you closely study the textbook reading (rather than just the lecture notes).",
    "Good and broad introduction to psychology. Covers a wide range of topics and lectures are interesting.",
    "A great, interesting course with an intermediate amount of work and great professors.",
    "PSYC 110 is a good intro level psychology course that has helped me understand basic psychology.",
    "Great overall of psychology. Hard course but came out with a good understanding",
    "You cant go wrong with this course. Take it and you will get a great intro to the ocean that is Psych.",
    "Absolutely would recommend. Topics are relevant and interesting, course work is challenging but fair, lectures are consistently entertaining and engaging. Definitely made me want to take more classes in this department.",
    "You must take this course. And Paul Bloom is excellent.",
    "I would absolutely recommend PSYC 110 to another student, especially if it is taught by Paul Bloom! I always looked forward to interesting lectures and readings. There are weekly reading responses that require some thought and are often in response to articles that draw from multiple areas of psychology. Exams are more conceptual, and can be tricky. Overall, this was a rewarding experience and I would recommend this course to all students at Yale. It is a must-take and Bloom makes every topic fascinating and entertaining. He is also a very accessible professor and loves to discuss topics with students. In addition, the TFs are extremely helpful in providing tips to improve in the course and for exam preparation.",
    "PSYC 110 is an introductory psych course that covers a broad range of important topics in a lot of depth, with interesting lectures and many fascinating and esteemed guest speakers. I would absolutely recommend this course to any student regardless of their major or field of interest, because I think it covers material that is applicable knowledge for anyone who has a brain and interacts with other people who do.",
    "TAKE. THIS. COURSE. Incredibly interesting, Paul Bloom is one of the best professors I've ever had, and the topics covered are actually very useful in understanding the world around you. I actively use some of the concepts I learned in this course in my everyday life, whether it's social interactions with others or understanding my emotions. If you're even remotely interested in the world around you, TAKE THIS COURSE. That being said, IT'S NOT A GUT. There is a lot of reading involved and a lot of memorization. I took this class Crd\/D and after the first midterm decided to just leave it Cr\/D (oops). You will put a lot of effort into studying for the tests and the final paper, so don't expect this class to be a breeze.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone curious about psychology. Even if you do not intend to major in the subject, Paul Bloom is a legend at Yale and a renowned scholar in the field of developmental psychology. It's worth taking the class just for the experience.",
    "I did not personally enjoy he material but as a class it was worthwhile.",
    "PSYC 110 provides a broad introduction to psychology, so it's difficult in the sense that the material covers a lot of areas of psychology so there's a lot to remember for tests. The tests, then, are the hardest part. However, I found this class really interesting and would recommend it. There is a lot of reading to do, but the textbook isn't dry; lectures are a highlight.",
    "PSYC 110 is an opportunity to learn about the fundamental field of psychology in an interesting way. It covers a lot of material, but you leave the class with a better understanding of the field. It shows you if you are interested in psychology and gives you basic knowledge about human nature.",
    "An excellent intro to psychology. Amazing professor(s) (they switch out once in a while, but they're all great, especially Bloom and Chun), knowledgeable and helpful TAs, reasonable workload (readings, reading responses, and one 10 page essay at the end), and overall fascinating material. Take this class even if you're not majoring in psych or cogsci, as the course content is both very interesting and immediately applicable to everyday life. The human brain is an amazing machine, and this class gives you a taste of what it's like to study this very relevant field.",
    "Great introductory course, and is a pre requisite for a lot of super interesting classes. worth taking",
    "Strongly recommend even to non-psych majors.",
    "Great introductory psychology class.",
    "This class is your typical college class. You have a lot of dense reading and weekly reading responses. The tests aren't impossible but you will definitely need to study. Take only if you like pure memorization.",
    "Good class, really interesting lectures and guest speakers. There was lots of reading material and memorization. Assignments were not too bad, planning in advance particularly is helpful in this class.",
    "Good overview and introduction.",
    "A really good class to take, but there is a lot of work involved.",
    "This intro psych class covers a very ride range of psychology material. The class is mostly reading out of the textbook in addition to one project and participating in experiments. I would definitely recommend this class. It was very engaging and easy to apply to real life. I think the knowledge from this class is very useful in everyday life.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 110 to another student because it was a great class taught by a great professor. The class was very enjoyable and I learned a lot.",
    "Incredible but be prepared for the rollercoaster of work ahead.",
    "Psych 110 is one of these few courses you will keep on referring throughout your life. Need an anecdote about the misattribution of arousal ? Psych 110 has your back. Not only is the material mind-blowing, it is also very useful to understand our brains and our interactions on a daily basis.",
    "Take this course at some point. It has something in it for everyone, it's very rarely boring, and it will broaden your perspective on what makes humans special.",
    "The class was extremely engaging and i would recommend it to others.",
    "Yes! See my responses to Questions 1 and 2.",
    "This is an interesting class. I would recommend it highly, but be ready to put in some effort.",
    "Not a credit\/d class, too much work",
    "I believe PSYC 110 01 to be a great and thouroghly interesting class, but one that also covers and brushes over a wide range of topics. A word of caution that this is a wide range of topics.",
    "Definitely take this class! A lot of material, but it's all fun and interesting and Bloom is amazing.",
    "Yes! Psyc 110 was an outstanding course. Very interesting and relevant."
