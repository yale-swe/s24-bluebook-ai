    "I learned a lot about Martial and Juvenal as authors and Satire as a genre. I learned to develop broader considerations about genre and to think about connections with the previous literary tradition and the importance of those connection. I honed my close-reading abilities and I engaged in an always meaningful debate."

    "Strengths: * focus on close-reading * focus on genre and related issues * attention to the historical context, both in its cultural and socio-political dimensions Weaknesses: * incoherence between each others weekly presentations. I would have rather work as a group around the same idea or set of texts and have everyone presents one part."

    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in exploring Martial and Juvenal, in understanding satire as a literary genre, in thinking about the socio.political context through text (with all the problems that this entails). I would also recommend this course to someone interested in improving his\/hers close-reading skills, as professor Freudenburg offered not only an excellent example of 'how to do close-reading', but was also extremely detailed in giving feedback on how to improve.",
    "It was an excellent course with interesting readings, thoughtful discussion, and a helpful instructor. I think that succinctly summarizes a class one should want to take."
