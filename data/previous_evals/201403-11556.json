    "The subject matter is too theoretical and big picture. I know that's what the course syllabus says it will be, so it's my error for taking it. If you wanted to go on a PhD, this would be a great course. If you want to enter the working world, I just don't think it is all that relevant. I love Prof. Grubler. ESA was my favorite class at FES. But this wasn't ESA 2.0, which is what I'd hoped and assumed it would be.",
    "This course is a seminar, but I think students could gain more from the class if some adjustments are made. The online forum could be improved. Although a student provides a summary and directs the discussion, reading the entire article is sometimes necessary to get the context and a deeper understanding. Instead, submitting a written synthesis and assessment could be more beneficial. Also writing a number of policy memos could make this class an even stronger learning opportunity. Class discussions should also be more centered on the reading materials which normally form the foundation of knowledge on the issue.",
    "Some of of the lectures and readings were outdated and\/or dull.",
    "There was not enough debrief of the on-line debates during the seminar. A comment by the professor or the TA could help clarify some of the doubts raised or the discussions happening in the blog."

   "comments": [
    "The relationship was effective, but could be improved as mentioned above",
    "The LSM transition analysis instructions need to be re-written. They confused every single person in our class, and our questions were never clarified adequately. We cannot learn how to use a model if we're not taught how to use it. The model's manual uses examples that are far too basic to be helpful. The TA needs to help us much more with this assignment. Contrary to his beliefs, lots of people - yes, even intelligent ones - need some form a of instruction to get them going. \"Figuring things out on our own\" doesn't work for everyone. If it did, no form of institutional education would be necessary. Some pedagogical training would go a long way to prove that instruction if invaluable and actually leads to more learning on one's own."

It does not cover much knowledge that I would consider practical or relevant for most FES energy students. I enjoyed being with Prof. Grubler and the class at times because he is brilliant and the class was full of energy kids. But I mostly did not get much from the course and would have not taken it, had I had the chance to do it all over again.",
