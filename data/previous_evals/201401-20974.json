    "MB&B 490 is the senior requirement for the MB&B major. It is a pretty laid-back class. You get the opportunity to write a 20-ish page paper about any topic in biochemistry that you find interesting, working with a faculty advisor along the way. You then give an oral presentation at the end of the semester.",
    "Obviously this is required for the major. That being said, it was great! There is just the thesis and the presentation of the thesis. It's a pretty low commitment, but I still learned a lot.",
    "You write a senior essay. It's not a \"thesis\" nor is it a real \"review\" but it's something. It takes a bit of time (15-20 pages), but if you like your topic, it's fine. The presentations are interesting at the end.",
    "This is a nice way to end the major, with a general overview of a topic of your choosing. It is not too strenuous and is as interesting as you make it. I am glad the MB&B major has this senior requirement.",
    "As far as workload goes, the MB&B senior requirement is really light compared to other majors. Some people say it's a joke, but I actually think doing a literature review for the senior requirement is a cool idea. Most of us do research already, and for me it was a good opportunity to read more about my field and develop some interesting new ideas. If you're going into science, you'll develop some useful skills for your future career while not stressing yourself out with a massive thesis.",
    "It's an easy senior spring credit that you'll have to take. If you pick a topic that is interesting to you, it's not bad at all.",
    "Awesome. Write a 15 pg paper and present it",
    "Prof. Simon was an absolutely brilliant mentor. He was assigned to me out of the blue, which I did not appreciate, but I am sooooo glad I got him. He is very young and hip; very knowledgable about huge swaths of biology and overall a great guy. I think he will make an excellent contribution to the MB&B department and I genuinely and truly hope he sees the importance of other forms of undergraduate instruction and teaches a class of his own in addition to the senior project. I know science professors think that grants and publications are the be-all end-all of the universe (and it should tell them something about how they've treated us that we think of them this way) but I think Prof. Simon could make amazing contribution to the Yale undergraduate MB&B program and I hope he does so. This course gives you NO INFORMATION AT ALL other than an email during reading week and an organizational meeting that happens a week later at a single set time (hope you don't have a conflict). Your advisor is assigned out of the (for us) two and you meet eventually and pick a topic from a list you prepare in advance. After that, the MB&B department does what it does best: nothing. It leaves you to your own devices and then your COMPLETE draft is due after spring break. Your assigned advisor will then take forever to read and return comments on it to you because he has been given far too much work to do well in a reasonable amount of time and there should be more professors if the course is going to be as big as it is. They also seemed utterly surprised at the number of us there were which speaks further to the paradox of how MB&B can be an amazing undergraduate experience in terms of a biology education while simultaneously leaving you feeling completely ignored by the larger departmental structure. tl;dr it's really chill but pick something you don't mind reading a TON about and then writing on with minimal help. You also give a presentation at the end to 5 other MB&B students you've never met because you've only taken lecture courses with them for 4 years and the department likes to pretend its undergrads don't exist for the most part.",
    "Welcome to MB&B Senior Thesis! The chillest senior requirement! Enjoy it!",

    "A painless but still educational capstone to your major. Simon provided amazing feedback on drafts so be sure to turn in something he can work with!",
    "Surprisingly less work than you would expect. I wish I had gotten more substantial feedback on my draft. Most of the comments were just grammatical things. It might be useful if we were each assigned a reader that was familiar with our topic.",
    "You need it to graduate. It's not hard. Do something that interests you or you'll be annoyed.",
    "You gotta do it. Make it fun, don't stress too much. Consider picking a topic you know very little about--it's a good opportunity to learn about something new, and since it's not the most intense thesis, you don't need to stress about being an expert."
