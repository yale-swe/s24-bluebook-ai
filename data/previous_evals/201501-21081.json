   "comments": [
    "Really excellent and interesting reading list, but there is more on Western and Central Europe than one would expect.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student, particularly those who have a history in studying western Europe, as I did. The course is eye-opening in terms of the gaps in 'European' history that remain today, and was a rapid lesson in quite how much eastern European history has to teach us about the study of the rest of the continent. Anyone interested in minority studies or nationalism would particularly benefit from the course.",
    "If you have a specific interest in Eastern Europe or a desire to supplement other historical interests with a deeper knowledge of this region, you should consider this course. It is excellently taught and full of interesting material."

   "comments": [
    "The assignments were well-suited to preparation for graduate school requirements and job preparation for academic channels. Although this is not a path I am necessarily pursuing in the future, I appreciated the exercising of skill sets involved in job talks, presentation skills and the variety of writing styles required for the two different reviews. Furthermore, Professor Snyder has a lot to teach about the realities of life as a writer, teacher and intellectual. Graduate students stand to learn a lot from him.",
    "Professor Snyder provided frequent advice on history as a profession, designing several of the course assignments with the aim of preparing us for a wide variety of future professional responsibilities. The course also offered an interesting insight into how the discipline of Eastern European history has evolved throughout the years. Finally, a deeper knowledge of Eastern Europe in general is vital to understanding my specific dissertation research."
