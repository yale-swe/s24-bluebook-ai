   "comments": [
    "A lot of reading about art, history of art, history of abstraction. Also a lot of exploring your own relationship to art.",
    "This class taught me so so much about abstraction, both the history and how to begin approaching it myself. I learned how to begin to speak about abstract art, how to look deeply and critically, and how to begin to incorporate what I've learned into my own practice.",
    "Deeper knowledge of Modernism and its malcontents, philosophical as well as artistic enquiry into the nature of interpretation and making meaning, amazing classmates and teacher. Good times.",
    "Learnt something about modern art and abstraction. Tried oil painting for the first time. Found the jargons of modern and contemporary art and art criticism to be confusing and frustrating. Found out that I might not be a super visual person and I do not derive much pleasure from making stuff... Partly has to with the way the course is structured (it's supposed to be focused on art making, but the teacher wants it to be theoretical and deep too, but she's not that good at explaining the theory).",
    "I gained a profound appreciation for not just abstract and Modernist art but also for a depth of artistic process that I had never encountered before. Molly made the class the most impactful one I have taken at Yale yet. The constant interaction with MFA students also made the experience uniquely enriching.",
    "To think in new and unexpected ways, to consider everything, to connect everything, and to look more to artists that have come before",
    "A massive increase in courage, a sudden awareness of the vastness of materials available to even the amateur artist, an understanding of the complexity of oil paint, a suspicion that all art is sad, a deep suspicion that high fashion is evil, the beginnings of a comprehension of abstraction qua modernity, the beginnings of a distinction between modernity and modernism, and probably most of all a connection made between abstraction and the political history of the late 19th and early 20th century. Well, that's not strictly true, most of all I developed compositional techniques in collage. But I learnt more theory and history in this class than I would have in an art history class.",
    "I found new ways of working and new ways of thinking about my work. Molly pushes us to make and to write and to read all in conjunction in order to begin to understand what we're trying to do. I understand gesture now better than I ever had before, and understand how to begin to sit with and talk about and tear apart and take less seriously my work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really liked how the class responded to the students; that being said, I think perhaps a bit more structure could be useful, in terms of history lessons and such. I think the readings were great at providing background, and I wish there were a bit more of that.",
    "This is one of the best classes at Yale. If you are at all interested in taking an art class here, this is the one to take.",
    "The teacher obviously cares about students and art a lot, and she is an accomplished artist. But the emphasis on theoretical understanding is not very well integrated with the practice of art making. The discussions were disorganised and confusing.",
    "This class made me think critically about so many things outside of and including art in a way that no other class has.",
    "The strengths of this class are that it functions as a space definitively unlike any other Yale class. Yes, it is a studio class so there are no seats, but it is also unlike all other studio classes. I will attempt feebly to ekphrasise what makes Space and Abstraction so unique: -Each student picks their own 'space'. It occupies however many square feet the student feels they need, and this amount is negotiated with other nearby students. Mine was something of a cave, which was inspired by Thomas Hirschhorn, an artist who Molly personally recommended to me, having intuited from my style that I would like him. -Every class begins with a poem, selected and read by a different student each time. -Regularly we make trips to the art gallery wherein we get to hear Molly, genius unparalleled and poet unlimited, deconstruct works of art for us. She is eager to foster group discussion and collective response to the paintings we see, but she is such a genius that I for one would rather remain in silence and continue to take notes on her analyses. -Molly meanders around the room as we paint, the perfect degree of present, checking in with, challenging, questioning, combating, rescuing, the work that we are making. -Something about the atmosphere of the room feels halcyonic. As if only here could we make the work that we made, work that surprised us all."

   "comments": [
    "It's the most unique art class I've taken at Yale. Molly, the instructor, will make you think about all sorts of things that you've never really thought about. Without much background in art history, sometimes it was challenging to follow the class readings, but I absorbed so much just by being present in class everyday. This class took away some of the lightheartedness and fun out of art though. It's a class for people who are serious about art.",
    "If you are invested in learning about abstract art, absolutely.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in intellectual and artistic discourse and pursuit. There is a strong focus on making -- so be prepared not only to grow as a reader and a thinker, but primarily as a maker.",
    "I'd recommend the course only if you are familiar with the theoretical jargon of art making and criticism, and are super excited about making paintings and have more than enough time in your hand to invest in making art, and don't mind being mired in confusing theory and interpretation of art.",
    "Take this course with Molly (or actually probably any course with her) if you are ready and willing to open up your mind to a new kind of relationship with art. You'll understand about half of what she says, but you'll know it's all pure genius. Don't expect an organized, methodical classroom and curriculum. Do expect to have to think extremely deeply about art. If you put a lot into this class, you'll get a ton back out.",
    "YES--Molly is an amazing professor who has broadened my own ways of thinking in a way like nothing else has.",
    "On a rather dramatic note I must say that I have two friends who took this class at a time of dire personal crisis: one said their life was changed, the other said their life was saved. My life was certainly changed, and very likely saved. This is the class at Yale in which you can be most creative, in which you can make any work of art that you are capable of making (many of us had moved toward sculpture, writing, poetry, and performance in our final critiques), in which you are in no way bound. You also have the chance to study under Molly Zuckerman-Hartung so why would you pass that up.",
    "Take this course (with Molly) if you care at all about finding different ways of thinking and being within a structure that presents us with only one way. Take it if you're an experienced artist; take it if you've never painted in your life. Take it if you really want to challenge yourself. Do not come thinking you can half-ass this. Come ready to give everything. Molly certainly does."
