   "comments": [
    "I would definitely encourage other fellow students to take this course. It's essential and having Prof. Dunning as a teacher was a true privilege!",
    "I would (and already have) strongly recommend that anyone interested in critically applying quantitative methods take this course. I have taken statistics courses in multiple other departments and the focus is either on technique or proofs\/derivations; Professor Dunning instead places the emphasis on the role of assumptions of statistical methods in practical applications. His message has taken some of the mystique out of learning more and more technical wizardry to extract causation from data that cannot support causal claims.",
    "Take it. A good knowledge of statistics is invaluable in this day and age.",
    "Take it if you want to go into academia, not if you want to become competent at Stata or data analysis only.",
    "Yes, essential to anyone studying social sciences and probably anyone taking comprehensive exams in quantitatively dominated sub-fields.",
    "I would not recommend it for a person who needs an organized foundation in methods. As someone with little experience in STATA and working with large datasets, this was a very confusing class for me. I would recommend the sociology course.",
    "It's the second part of the empirical methods sequence in political science. The focus was on the potential outcomes, which underlies much of state-of-the-art research in our discipline. A must for anyone who wants to do empirical research in our department.",
    "I would recommend it, as long as they are interested mainly in experimental design."

   "comments": [
    "This course was absolutely essential for my preparation. I will continue with the statistics sequence and what I learned this semester is of utmost value for my coursework and future research. I will also be taking the comprehensive exam in statistics, which makes this course all the more important.",
    "I am not in the political science department, but I have spent much time reflecting on how the approach to causal inference taught in this class compares to the approach in my field. After this course, I understand better why experimental or natural experimental approaches are critical forcausal inference, and may try to pursue this approach in my dissertation if I can.",
    "Gave me a much better understanding of statistical methods and the assumptions that underlie them.",
    "Yes, this course really helped my knowledge of political science and academia.",
    "The class focused on the potential outcomes model, which is not yet totally established in our discipline. It might have been biased because we barely covered other topics -- such as time-series. However, I felt like I was part of a movement -- advancing causal inference in political science -- which was great.",
    "It provided a useful grounding in experimental methods and some exposure to other approaches. Personally, I would have spent more time on the mechanics of other methods and less on just experimental design."
