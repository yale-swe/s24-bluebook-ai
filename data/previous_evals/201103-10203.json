   "comments": [
    "It's a brilliant course, useful whether you're a \"Caribbeanist\" or not -- and it just might make you one! I'd recommend it to anyone.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it for anyone who wanted their readings broadening, and who wanted a challenging course.",
    "The course offers a window into matters pertaining to the Caribbean diaspora, but the issues it raises extend beyond this field. I recommend the course to anyone researching the politics of migration and transculturalism, broadly. And to students interested in contributing to the elevation of artistic practice within the academy, and the case for literature as its own form of theorizing, with its own form of action and impact in the world.",
    "Caribbean Diasporic Intellectuals was an outstanding course that confronts a number of questions central to understanding the Caribbean's central role in the formation and evolutions of the Modern World, with a particular focus on the relationships between diaspora and those understandings.",
    "I think it would be hard to summarize- an interesting course that engages black intellectuals of the Caribbean- accepting a broad definition of both \"intellectuals\" and the \"Caribbean.\" I would recommend this class to a friend- it can be whatever you make of it, a flexible course."

   "comments": [
    "This course was extremely useful and a great preparation for further research in my field.",
    "Great for thinking beyond the U.S. as AFAM\/AMST, great for contemplating the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, and \"nation\"\/\"citizenship.\" I do sort of wish we'd hit a few more of the \"classics\" of Caribbean Studies\/Intellectuals. Not being a Caribbeanist, I sort of thought at first that this course would include people like Sylvia Wynter, Cesaire, etc. But I guess it was geared more for people who already had that background.",
    "N\/A",
    "This course covered many issues directly related to mywork, and even as it helped me deepen my knowledge of my specific research interests, it also helped me broaden my understanding of key topics, themes and works with which I need to be familiar to do my work well."
