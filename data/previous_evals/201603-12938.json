    "I think the two main things I will remember a few months from now are the agnostic approach to statistics and being modest about what statistics can tell us about the world, and the R skills. Both are very useful.",
    "I learned the basics of probability, estimation, and programming in R.",
    "I learned the coding program R, statistics\/econometrics.",
    "A understanding of basic statistical concepts, such as probability theory and regression, and an ability to perform basic tasks in R.",
    "Gained a huge amount of knowledge in this class. R skills, stats concepts. the works.",
    "I developed a fundamental and intuitive understanding of the foundations of probability and its connection to statistics. I had learned some of these methods previously but now I understand (to the best I can) why we do these the way we do.",
    "Outside of the key objectives for this course I learned about creating professionalized intellectual products using tools like R and was introduced to the philosophy of agnostic statistics which avoids strict causal claims. Both of these insights were particularly important to me. Being that this was my first time taking quantitative coursework in many years, I appreciated being exposed to proofs, as they helped me connect the dots to key concepts that we were learning Learning about measurement validity and reliability were also helpful for thinking about research design",
    "I learned some R (which seemed like a foreign language at the beginning of the course) and understand the program in relation to statistical concepts.",
    "I learned an immense amount about coding in R as well as basic statistical theory. I learned far more than anticipated.",
    "Learned how to use R and get a good intro to statistics.",
    "I had already been familiar with statistics but Professor Coppock placed a huge amount of time on the programming language R. I feel pretty confident with R now, which I find very useful for my own research, and Alex and the TAs were incredible teachers!",
    "Alex's energy and teaching skill made learning statistics fun and intuitive.",
    "Basic introduction to statistics including topics such as bivariate and multivariate regression for future use in political science research.",
    "This course helped me strengthen my knowledge of fundamentals of statistics including probability theory, estimation theory and regression analysis. The emphasis on \"agnostic statistics\", rather than a parametric approach was new to me and I learnt a lot. After this course, a key skill that I am now equipped with is to use R to carry out basic statistical analysis. I am also less fearful of statistical packages now!",
    "I learned the fundamentals of probability theory; how statistical science can be basically wielded; how coding can really help with that; and all to use all of these to better understand the world, all in taking such conclusions with a necessary grain of salt.",
    "Understanding agnostic statistics and basic coding skills."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought a strength was the problem sets, which were well-designed to teach us about the substance of what we were working on at the time, allowed us to occasionally engage with data of our own choosing, and are just super useful in terms of learning how to code and visualize data in general. Feedback on the problem sets sometimes took a while to get, though, which meant that I might make the same mistake 2-3 weeks in a row before getting feedback on the original code. An aspect that could be improved was the lectures; occasionally I could get lost in the derivations and math, because we jumped into those before discussing what conceptually we were talking about and why\/in what contexts it is important.",
    "I think this course could be more organized in the lectures. While each class had specific objectives, the actual instruction for each objective was often difficult to follow. I think lecture slides would be particularly useful to this end. I also felt like there was too much focus on programming (despite it being useful in how we learned to implement the statistical concepts) at the expense of understanding the underlying theory.",
    "The weekly problem sets were time consuming but taught skills related to R. However, at times it was not always clear the connection to concepts or theories from the course. We learned the proofs and a lot of the basics of statistics. Additionally resources that rephrased the concepts in different words would have been appreciated. At times, it was unclear whether we needed to know the proof just to know the proof and never use it again.",
    "The class certainly succeeded in teaching me some basic statistical and coding concepts, as I felt fairly confident on the final exam. However, getting there was pretty difficult. I struggled often to understand the lectures as they were often very heavy on proofs without an adequate explanation of what these things were we were learning about and why we were learning about them. It's obviously a tough balance, as there are people in the class who want to be quantitative methodologists and others who simply want to be informed consumers of quantitative social science. While I think more thought should go into balancing these competing interests (and I'm not sure I have an answer to this dilemma), I would strongly suggest an increased stressing of concepts (especially in class and less so in sections).",
    "We sort of sped through a lot of concepts without gaining a proper understanding near the end. I think that the course lost a lot of \"arc\" near the end. We couldn't really understand how different things fit together in the lectures.",
    "The strength of this course is the instructors and TAs, who were great at explaining the concepts and providing support for confusing parts. The weakness was perhaps the large variance of skill within the class, which could have slowed down those who were more skilled and made things go too quickly for those who were not as familiar with the material.",
    "Strengths - I enjoyed learning R simultaneous the math. It helped me build resilience around solving problems that I historically have been less patient about - The problem sets in the second half of the course were more step-by-step, which were helpful for breaking down and practicing key concepts, both in terms of the math and the code - Alex and the TAs were very available and open to assisting students, even outside of designated office hours. I can only imagine how time-consuming this is in such a big course, so I really appreciated it Weaknesses There was not a lot of opportunity in class for students to practice concepts, nor were there any checks for understanding deliberately included in class. There were times where I knew I was not grasping a key concept, but because we would move on so quickly, I didn't even have time to put a finger on the source of my confusion. Because section was geared toward learning R, there were very limited opportunities outside of asking peers for help or clarification (particularly asking those who already had a lot of experiences with the content). I think finding opportunity for students practice or at least pause and synthesize what they know or have questions about could improve the course. Lastly, neither of the textbooks were very conceptual and because the class was structured entirely off of Aronow and Miller, the course really offered few opportunities to consider key skills in reference to core concepts in political science. The problem sets helped, but sometimes I was so focused on getting the right output in R, that conceptualizing these skills came secondary.",
    "The strength of the course lay in the commitment of our mentors through it - Alex and both the TAs went out of their way to prepare and evaluate course material, and were always available, even outside of Office Hours, for help and encouragement. The strongest weaknesses were a) the speed at which everything was taught, despite a clear understanding that many students lacked confidence or skill in the basics. b) an inordinate focus on programming over concepts",
    "Strengths: The professor and TAs were quite engaging and quick to respond to any questions I had about material we were covering or anything on the problem sets. The problem sets were immensely challenging, which I found to be the best way to learn as it required sustained, deep engagement with the course material. Weaknesses: It would have been nice if the syllabus had included a few bullet points outlining the specific concepts\/material being covered for each class. This would have helped me in preparing for lectures. It may have helped to have very brief quizzes in-class on a regular basis ensuring that we comprehend basic concepts. There were a couple of ad hoc quizzes, but these could have been integrated into the course on a more regular basis.",
    "I really enjoyed learning how to code and do stats in R. The readings at times were hard to understand even with lectures.",
    "The course material was conveyed in a very abstract way, using mathematical proofs much more than applied examples, which I don't think matched the preferred learning styles of the students sitting it. Each time some learning was demonstrated by 45 minutes of advanced algebra that started and ended at the same point it was less illuminating and more disorienting, to the point of crushing self-confidence. The insistence on learning and using R as well as statistical theory also meant it felt like a double course. The problem sets took far longer than any other assignment for any course, and their challenge was generally more trying to wrestle a command-driven language to do whatever it was that had been set as a task than testing the underlying knowledge.",
    "I loved our course! I especially appreciated to see all the concepts we learned applied in R - we saw WHY they were useful and HOW we can directly apply them.",
    "Statistics are hard, but Alex did a great job making it as painless as possible.",
    "Although this is a course for political science graduate students, there was almost no mention of the application of what we were taught. For those who prefer content to be contextualized, this was a challenge. It was also unclear why the agnostic approach was adopted for the course when it has little practical relevance. The professor, while well meaning, was not very effective as a teacher. Problem sets were very challenging, well beyond the scope of what was covered in lecture. Assignments seemed to emphasize complex R-coding and aesthetics over actual statistics. Teaching assistants were helpful and supportive. No feedback was offered for the mid-term.",
    "The strengths of the course were as follows: 1. It introduced students to the fundamentals of statistics primarily through the \"agnostic\" approach, where no assumptions are made. 2. In addition to conceptual knowledge, the focus of the course was on learning R. This, I believe, will be a useful skill for the future. 3. I thought the instructor, Alexander Coppock, and the TFs - all were very committed and enthusiastic in teaching the course. 4. The problem sets were well-designed and helped me learn various data analysis skills in R. The weaknesses of the course were as follows: 1. The course was a bit too fast in the last few weeks - possibly racing past concepts (although I realize there was time pressure to complete the syllabus). It may have been better to concentrate on fewer number of concepts in the final weeks. 2. If I recall correctly, at the start of the course, we were told that the problem sets would take about 10 hours every week - but many of them took much longer. Although they were time-consuming, I enjoyed doing the problem sets and I definitely learnt a lot from them. 3. Some key concepts such as p-value, confidence intervals, bootstrapping, became well understood by most of us only during the review sessions before exams. Instead, if they could have been explained with greater clarity during the lectures\/ sections, it would have been very helpful and would have facilitated learning.",
    "Strengths: The professor was engaging, unfailingly enthusiastic about the material and consistently available for one-on-one help. The math was always embedded within larger theoretical discussions and its actual use in the social sciences to give a wide idea of its potentials and limitations. The students were very well cared for by the TAs, and even when I felt like I was lost with the material I never felt like I was stuck at sea without someone to rope me back in. They were both accommodating and available and helpful without making things too easy on us. Improvements: More review and examples of key concepts in class. More focus on explaining, especially at the outset, why we are learning certain concepts, how they fit in with the others\/the larger picture. (Maybe put math more in the context of actual examples of its utilization?) Less anxiety-inducing problem sets. It would have been more efficient for my learning to attack new concepts with smaller bites and building up to being able to tackle more gnarly problems.",
    "Alex worked very hard to meet every student on their level. He cared about professionalizing all of us and helping us to be able to engage in any methodological discussion. After the midterm, the course went so fast it was hard to keep up."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great introduction to the statistical concepts and methods that get used in social science research. You are also forced to learn to program in R, which is an investment with great payoffs later on.",
    "Yes, i'd recommend.",
    "I probably would, but with some reservations (explained in my other answers).",
    "Yes. It's a good, seminar-style venue for learning techniques that'll take you far.",
    "Yes, absolutely, especially any incoming political science PhD student.",
    "I think that teaching a course for the first time is always difficult, and inevitably students feel the consequences of the inevitably challenging first go around. So, I would recommend this course to future students because I think that Alex has great promise as an instructor. I also imagine he will take feedback to heart and implement it his second time around.",
    "This course is a great basic course, looking back I did learn a lot. However, previous statistical knowledge is clearly helpful because of the lack of emphasis on concepts themselves.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The course covers a substantial amount of material and is beneficial even for those who do not have a background in statistics.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, especially if you're thinking of doing the sequence!",
    "No.",
    "Yes, I would definitely taking the course, especially with Professor Coppock.You will not only learn statistics but also applied programming, and that is incredibly useful today.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course to other students insofar as it is necessary for the quantitative sequence for political science graduate students. However, the professor was not a particularly good instructor.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course. It is useful for at least three things: learning the fundamentals of statistics and ways in which quantitative data can be analysed; familiarizing with R and getting equipped with basic skills for it; understanding how basic concepts such as p-values, standard errors and confidence intervals are used (and often misused) in scholarly papers\/ talks.",
    "A great introduction to statistics that was useful no matter what level of mathematical knowledge one came in with.",
    "Yes if they want to be able to engage in statistics for social science research."
