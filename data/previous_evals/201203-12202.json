   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend Econ 116, especially if Ray Fair is the professor. Even if you did poorly or didn't line Econ 115, this class is much more intuitive, less math based and really ties to the real world.",
    "Absolutely not, unless you're an econ major.",
    "Even if you aren't an econ major, I would recommend it. The knowledge is useful, and you will get a better understanding of what all the talking heads on tv are talking about.",
    "i would recommend it. it certainly gives you an idea of how the fed\/economy works",
    "REALLY BAD.DO NOT TAKE IT unless 1) you're an econ major, or 2) you want to have better understanding of how the world works in terms of $.Even if you want to take it because of 2), take it for the content and not for the lecture experience.Content: Just as the title of the course suggests. It can be interesting. It will help you understand a lot of macro news better.Lectures: Prof Ray Fair is TERRIBLE. His pronunciation is very unclear, and it's often hard to make out what he is saying. His way of presenting the material is extremely boring. He hand-writes the lecture slides, and often it's very hard to understand. Looks really disorganized. He doesn't seem to put too much effort into lectures because he already wrote the textbook. It may even be safe to read the textbook than attending lectures. Every lecture, SSS114 turns into a battlefield where you fight against drowsiness.Section: FIND A GOOD TA. During shopping period, go to as many TA's sections as possible to find the best TA. I do not recommend Rosina.Overall, ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.",
    "Econ 116 is a good intro course appropriate for anyone looking to gain a basic understanding of macroeconomics. The workload was very manageable, and the lectures were well taught.",
    "Intro Macro is a fine course. Take it if you have to, or if you're interested in learning more about the macroeconomy. The book is wonderful, but lecture can be quite dry.",
    "This is a basic overview of macroeconomics and focuses more on broad themes and concepts rather than math (which is good or bad depending on the type of student you are). Expect to learn everything on your own if you have not previously taken any macroeconomics course.",
    "Take this class if you have to for your major. The subject material is interesting, but lectures are drawn out and often confusing. The book is very helpful and covers all of the material.",
    "interesting class. not too engaging",
    "Yes, a nice intro of the macro economy.",
    "I recommend it, just not with Fair.",
    "Hard, a lot of material. Not unless its for your major",
    "perhaps. i would if one wants to major in economics.",
    "Professor Fair is very interesting if you're actually interested in economics, has interesting areas of research, but goes on tangents. Lecture material, reading, and exams do not necessarily line up.",
    "I love economics. I hated this course. Aside from the occasional stirring of life, lectures were mostly a struggle to stay awake (most people stopped coming to them by the middle of the semester). Take this class if you need to. If not, go look somewhere else for an interesting class.",
    "Uninspiring. Take it if you're in the major. Fair is apparently better than Tony Smith but is still pretty monotonous.",
    "I would recommend to take it with Ray Fair if you want to pass the Macro requirement. It takes effort to focus on class but you will come out learning at least something about the economy on a national and international scale. The TAs are helpful. Psets are not that hard. Exams are fair even though the final is more difficult than expected.",
    "You know why you're taking this -- you have to. Ray Fair sucks big time. You won't learn anything from him. He asks ambiguous questions on exams that you can get wrong simply by misinterpreting his poorly written questions. I assure you you will gain nothing from lecture. Learn from Khan Academy or get a good TA, that's your only hope in surviving this God awful, soul mutilating class.",
    "This course is a good way to learn about things like the Federal Reserve, fiscal and monetary policy for dealing with recessions and inflation, and some about international trade effects on the economy. It will directly be applied to understanding current events in the economy, which is both interesting and useful. I recommend the class if you want to better understand these things.",
    "A basic macro course. It's fine, but not a life-changing course.",
    "It was a good survey of Macro issues. A lot more conceptual than Micro. Professor Fair is a super nice guy, but he just talks in his lectures and there is not a ton of structure. You just feel like he's having a conversation the whole time, and it's up to you to pick up the important points. Definitely read the book for the exams.",
    "Take it if you have to for your major, or if you REALLY want to learn about the macroeconomy. If you're just curious about the macroeconomy, I suggest you just read a textbook instead.",
    "1. Don't major in Econ2. Don't expect much from this class",
    "The material of econ 116 is fine, but the organization of this class is the absolute WORST. Do NOT trust what ray fair tells you about the final date - always check on sis to be sure - because he lazily copy and pasted the syllabus from last year for this year's, he didn't change the date of the final, and only remembered ONE WEEK before the actual final to tell us that there had been a \"typo\" and that the final was now three days earlier than expected. Absolutely typical of his couldn't-care-less attitude toward the entire course. You could also work his laziness to your advantage, though, because the psets NEVER change, so just search for the solutions to the psets from previous years (it'll turn up on google search even though it's not listed on his website), midterms, finals etc. Final questions haven't changed for EIGHT years; that's how recycled all this material is. TAs are also lazy and don't care about the students; they cancel sections\/change timings\/change locations whenever they feel like it, and don't bother to give advance notice. If you want to take this course, know that you're entirely on your own, and that you're taught by people who just want you to go away and leave them alone. Have fun.",
    "I think this was a pretty solid course. The lectures and concepts were well explained and easy to understand. I don't have any complaints. I also like the ties to current events. It helped me understand better what was going on, which seems especially important given all the talk of \"the economy!\" lately. It's not very exciting, but it's interesting in the sense that it's relevant and you will learn something useful. The problem sets are straightforward and not very hard, and there's only one a week.",
    "If Fair is teaching it, you would be BEST if you didn't take it, unless you have previously taken econ courses at Yale\/in high school. If you have basic economic intuition about trends in the markets, like how firms would react if the dollar suddenly appreciated, then you would breeeeze through this class, no lecture required. And quite frankly, the lectures really don't help. It's hard enough staying awake to his dull, monotonous tone of voice.",
    "Take this only if necessary for your major (which is why I took it). I agree that having a sense of macroeconomics is important for life, regardless of profession\/major\/etc., but you'd honestly be better off learning from Wikipedia or reading a textbook than actually taking this class.If you do make the terrible decision to take this class, prepare for never-ending rants, over-reliance on Yahoo! Finance, and a sickening sense that your time, money, and brainpower has been wasted.In other words, I would not recommend Economics 116 to another student.",
    "Ya, why not? It's not awesome or exhilarating and you won't be wow-ed off your feet, but you'll learn what the syllabus says you will.",
    "Good introduction to Macroeconomics. You get a thorough explanation of the macroeconomic model. Section helps more than lecture, because Professor Fair tends to be pretty sloppy with his slides.",
    "Take it only if necessary.",
    "Take if you must, but be prepared to pay attention.",
    "Professor Fair has a great lecture style--engaging and easy to understand. I feel like this class lifted a curtain between me and things on the news about economics. I learned SO MUCH in this class.",
    "Yes. I think it is a necessary course to take at Yale. You should know something about the Economic world around you.",
    "Yes. It's not a very difficult class, although it may take you a while to get used to the specific way that macroeconomics makes you use your brain. The workload isn't very heavy, and you can get a lot out of the class if you keep up with textbook readings and lectures. Some people say that you can get by with just reading the textbook or just going to lecture, but I think both are important if you want to get a full picture of macroeconomics.The midterm is fair, definitely more difficult than the final. You will know exactly what to expect from the previous tests that Professor Fair posts online.",
    "It's an intro course. You get a good, broad exposure to the introductory material of macroeconomics. It's not the most exciting thing ever, but it's still a good (required) class for ECON majors.",
    "Obviously it's a requirement for Econ majors but I think it's worth taking even if you don't want to major in Econ. It has a lot more practical applications than intro macro and you will be able to understand current events and why the government changes monetary and fiscal policy. Professor Fair can be a dry lecturer but he does crack a few jokes now and then. The most interesting parts of his lectures are when he digresses from the required topics and talks about his research or his intuition behind current events.",
    "I think this should be a required class for all undergrads. You learn a lot about how different events and government actions affect the economy, and I think that knowledge is essential to being an informed citizen. I really enjoyed the class, and would certainly recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "Econ 116 is a necessary class for the Econ major, but it isn't as bad as people make it out to be and is well taught by Ray Fair. If you take it and have the opportunity, make sure you get Greg Phelan as a TA. He is incredibly helpful. OH and the textbook is amazing.",
    "I recommend it. It helped me understand how the world works. Much more interesting and applicable to everyday life than micro",
    "The material of the course is interesting. But don't take it with Ray Fair unless you are willing to work your but off.",
    "I absolutely do not recommend this class with this professor\/this class size to anyone, ever. If you are a freshman, try to get into a seminar if you care about econ at all. That all being said, if you must take this class, I would focus my attentions on the book.",
    "take it if you have to, the book is really good, the lectures aren't",
    "Intro macro. Try to take it with a professor that's not Ray Fair; he's not particularly exciting.",
    "Professor Fair is a great professor who likes to interact with his students and does a good job of it. He can be a little dry at times, but really knows what he's talking about and is engaging most of the time. The online lecture notes, however, are not the most useful for studying - so make sure you take your own good notes in class.",
    "A summary of major macro concepts with very little math. I guess I'd recommend it if you want to learn some about the macroeconomy but be warned, Fair is terrible and the class is very, very boring. I only learned anything from studying on my own and working with the TAs, who were all great. If at all possible, don't take it with Fair.",
    "Oh god. Never take this class with Ray Fair. Ever. Econ 116 turned into my hour and fifteen minutes to catch up on sleep. Fair is attached to the misguided idea that having 2-3 slides per lecture, and cramming way too much writing on each slide, is how you structure a good lecture. IT'S NOT. Not only are his slides unhelpful, but the lecture will put you to sleep because his voice is completely monotone. The book is helpful and interesting, so just read that if you have to take this class.",
    "I would indeed recommend this course, as I thought it was very applicable to modern life.",
    "Ray Fair has an astounding ability to take a fascinating subject and make it incomprehensible and boring.",
    "Take it only if you have to.",
    "Yes, because you want t o be able to understand the news on economics.",
    "Don't take it. Brutal to get through with Ray Fair.",
    "I would not recommend Econ 116 to a fellow student unless you absolutely have to take it as a requirement. Even then, heavily consider taking the seminar instead. When you take this class, expect monotone lectures and mostly learning yourself by reading the textbook.",
    "It will give you some basic understandings of economic concepts that you should probably know about. It's not that hard, but Professor Fair's lectures are boring and frustrating. It's not too painful, go to section and you'll be fine, but this isn't a very good class.",
    "Good intro to macro",
    "Only take it if you have to. Ray Fair is okay but kind of a jerk, and the midterm and final are a bit of a crapshoot unless you're really good at\/interested in econ. Do NOT take this class just for the SO credit. There are many more easy and interesting ones to choose from.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone wanting a basic understanding of economics but for non-econ majors it is probably not the best class to take.",
    "This is a class I would recommend if you are interested in the way the economy works, and in a general way how our modern world works. Do take this class if you are thinking about majoring in Economics or are not sure, or simply if you want to be able to hold a good conversation with anyone on current economic issues in the US or in the world. There is not a lot of work and the psets are definitely doable, but if you really want to enjoy this class, go talk to the Professor after the class and sit in the front (you might not be able to hear him\/her if you sit in the back).",
    "Basics of macro economics. Take it if you need to, otherwise, still has good use and important info",
    "If you want to take an econ class, there really isn't much choice; this is a prereq. That being said, it's a solid intro course. Ray Fair can be hard to pay attention to, but if you do pay attention, you do learn a lot. He places a lot of emphasis on real world stuff, which makes it really interesting, but it's also frustrating in that you can't really find it in the textbook. If you hated microecon, give macro a try before you give up on econ entirely. I hated microecon, too, but I'm glad I took macro. It was much more interesting because it's applicable to real life, and even if you don't major in it, it's stuff you should know.",
    "Yuck. Only if you need it for Econ\/EPE",
    "This is a course that everyone should take, since the material is really interesting and relevant to the real world. The workload is very manageable, with short problem sets and not too much reading, but exams are quite hard. The textbook is very good because it is written by the professor and, thus, includes almost everything you have to know for the course. The only bad thing about the class is that lectures can get really boring sometimes.",
    "The course is very strong. Econ 116 is a basic introduction to the ASAD model with a little bit of Open Economy Macro. Conceptually the course is a little fast paced. If you are like me, and didn't take any Econ in high school, then expect to do some reading each week for this class.",
    "i would recommend this class for sure. If you want to have a basic understanding of nomenclature and basic theory of monetary\/fiscal policy...this is an important class to take",
    "It's intro macro. It's not thrilling. The textbook is great, lecture wasn't fun at all because the professor was disorganized and not very good at explaining his own material, but it's not rocket science. You'll probably be able to get by okay if you do the psets and study hard.",
    "Really boring, and the exam questions are super dependent on what Fair thinks of the economy. The exams aren't exactly fair because they are looking for specific answers, but the questions are extremely open-ended so that you have no idea what they're looking for. And then when you ask your TA why you got so many points off on one question (because your answer is just about the same as the one given on a solution set), he'll tell you that he doesn't know, he would have given you almost full credit. Alas, when you ask for more points back, he says, nope, the professor says no regrading.",
    "SO DRY. Really difficult to pay attention in class.",
    "It was less than great. I like the content, but that has no bearing on the class experience, which was lacking. Yes, Ray Fair is an economics genius, but he's a dry speaker and cannot relate to the fact that this material, which he's been using and teaching for decades, is completely new to us and needs explaining with an awareness that we don't already get it. I think he's so competent with it that he can't understand not understanding it and therefore doesn't know how to teach to audiences like intro class students. He doesn't present information in a very organized fashion and could do for more structure to his lectures and lecture notes, some organization to make it more understandable for students. He's fine, just not too interesting and not detailed enough to be a good professor. Take the class if you like econ or need to take it, but don't expect it to be riveting. The content is a lot more interesting than micro, though, and the textbook is actually fantastic and clear and very helpful, so read it. Also if Greg is a TA, GO TO HIS SECTION AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT.",
    "Read the textbook, it'll be your best friend. Reading the chapters before the class makes the material in lecture make a lot more sense although it's a hassle. Not the worst econ class.",
    "Great for getting down the basics of the macro economy.",
    "Yes I learnt something about the economy and no because it was difficult and not fun.",
    "Yes! Take it, read the textbook, struggle through the problem sets (not the night before!) and become a more informed global citizen. A must take for anyone who wants to understand what's going on in the world around them.",
    "Its good info to know but not that enjoyable.",
    "Horrible course. Ray Fair is the worst professor I have experienced at Yale. He has no desire to teach and help his students succeed. Lectures are dull and disorganized. A disgrace.",
    "Necessary class, and much better than micro, but still not great.",
    "Do not take it with Ray Fair. His teachings are designed for someone with more experience then is needed for \"intro\" Macro.",
    "Basics of Macro, taught with a great book and bad lectures.",
    "I enjoyed Econ 116--it's a pretty gentle introduction to the ideas of macroeconomics. I'm excited to get into more math-y stuff, but this was very concept-based, which helped cement the concepts before I move onto more math. Read the textbook--it helps a lot!",
    "Good as an intro class if you want the major or just want to better understand how taxes and interest rates affect us in a general sense.",
    "Yes.",
    "Macroeconomics can be an interesting field of study; I certainly went in with pretty much no knowledge of how the macroeconomy works, and now I have a much better understanding of it. I would recommend the class for those interested in how the macroeconomy works. The lectures can be somewhat soporific but the things you learn (either through attending and staying awake in lecture or reading the text on your own) are very interesting.",
    "ECON 116 is a very important class to take. I only now feel comfortable talking about the current state of the economy, the Eurozone Crisis, the fiscal cliff, etc. after taking this class. That being said, the lectures are very dry, and you may find it hard to stay focused. But, the course is not too difficult and the material is essential to understanding the way our economy works.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It gives you a basis for understanding fiscal and monetary policy, which is important even if you don't pursue the study of economics further.",
    "Yes, it is very interesting and applicable if you want to have a fundamental understanding of the economy, how it works, and what the issues are. You will definitely come out of the course feeling that you learned a lot.",
    "Good introductory econ course. Not a lot of work. A course that every Yalie should take.",
    "Covers a lot of important economic concepts, however is taught dreadfully. Try to avoid taking this with Ray Fair",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the news.",
    "116 is a large introductory lecture that is only enhanced by Professor Fair's idiosyncrasies and dry sense of humor, but is otherwise not the most enjoyable course. It deterred me from majoring in economics, but it by no means is a lot of work- there are weekly problem sets that are reasonable checkpoints in understanding and graded on a check\/ check minus scale. The midterm and final are difficult because they require application of the concepts, but there are many resources if you look for them- ie, Fair WROTE the textbook, old copies of exams, many review sessions. I would recommend the course for students who have to take it, because it is not the most engaging or inspiring. If you just want to learn more about the economy, it definitely serves its purpose, but I'm sure there are other ways than a large lecture course.",
    "It's rough. Paying attention in lecture (or even attending lecture...) is quite the struggle. Ray Fair is a perfectly nice guy and a brilliant economist, but (in what seems to be a recurring characteristic in intro economics professors at Yale) cannot teach. Unless you need to take it, don't. Don't take it because you think you need to know more about economics, you can read Freakonomics or something and learn much more that is applicable to the real world.",
    "This class is a solid introductory economics course that will teach you the fundamentals of the macro economy. Although lectures can sometimes be a bit dull, the workload is very manageable, and the material is pretty interesting as well. I'm glad I took the course, and found the material very relevant and useful.",
    "Overall good intro macro course. Lectures (Fair's) are not really helpful at all, but the book covered pretty much everything he went over in a pretty straightforward way (he wrote it, so their was a good correlation) and all the TAs are great. Basically reading the book and going to section will get you through this class.",
    "Good course, learned the basics to macroeconomics well. I only recommend it if you need it for your major.",
    "Interesting class, I felt like I got a good introduction to macroeconomics and the model."
