   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "As the course was designed for first-year PhD students, I think it definitely reaches its goal. I do not recommend the book Write to the Top because it in some ways adds some unnecessary stress to the understanding of the profession. I would think a more constructive way of addressing the problem of time allocated for writing is that we discuss our time management strategies and share our confusions.",
    "I really liked this course and it was a great opportunity to meet Professors in the Political Science Department. My only suggestion would be the following: I believe the most beneficial part of this course for students was receiving career advice from Professors. Therefore, instead of asking questions about the assigned readings, maybe the course format could allow for students to formulate specific questions they have about the program or about academia more generally.",
    "The course is generally interesting because the material is always fresh, as are the faces. The one instance of a presentation related to the assigned paper was a fun change of pace and facilitated more discussion. While I don't think faculty members should necessarily be summarizing their readings, a brief presentation format might help the group ease into discussion.",
    "It is not a productive course in terms of stimulating intellectual thinking, but it is useful for understanding how to start a career in political science.",
    "It's always a good idea to discuss good research. However, I thought that the discussion format was awkward -- as students, we were relegated to asking questions (instead of commenting), and as a result, good discussions were unfortunately rare."

   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't recommend it, because it's the required introductory course. I would tell incoming students to look forward to it and to use it as the time and place to ask potentially embarrassing questions about what it means to be a political scientist.",
    "I think it is interesting to get to know the faculty -- however, I would appreciate a more student-driven format. The focus on career matters was interesting the first time, but after a while, career advice becomes boring and repetitive. I would recommend to keep the course on the curriculum, but to put greater emphasis on discussing and critically reviewing research. In addition, the instructor could organise one or two workshops on specific career- or research-related issues, such as human subjects research ethics or career development."
