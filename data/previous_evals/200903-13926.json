   "comments": [
    "a good course for someone who doesn't know C++ and is looking for an introduction to object oriented design - those who are looking for an advanced OOP class focused more on design and design patterns probably won't find the first half of the course too challenging but there are many good things to take away from the course",
    "Yes. It helps you to have better programming style.",
    "I summarize it as a great C++ course. There are general object-oriented programming concepts that are involved, but you must be interested in a lot of C++ programming to take this course.",
    "Superb introduction, simultaneously, to OO programming principles, the C++ language, and software engineering concepts, all woven together in a way that makes good sense. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "This course is most helpful to students with some basic programming skills in C, Java or the languages. The most knowledge learned during the course is not by instruction, but by practicing and thinking object-oriented while programming."

   "comments": [
    "it taught me some practical parts of C++ of which i didn't have prior experience",
    "It helps me lay a solid foundation for c++ programming. Also, it tells me what is good programming style andshapes me into good habit. It helps with my research in the future.",
    "Improved a lot my programming skills in C++. I also learned a little more about object-oriented programming in a general sense, and about appropriate design of solutions and applications.",
    "This course introduced me to design patterns and other important OO design principles, which are used widely both in the software industry and in CS research. I also learned a lot more about C++ than I had known before, which will probably be quite useful for my dissertation project and related research projects. The simulator exercises also reinforced concepts I had learned about networks and distributed systems that will be crucial in my research."
