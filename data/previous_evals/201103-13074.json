   "comments": [
    "I would say that this course is very challenging and should not be taken lightly. The only focus is grammar so there is very little room to cushion your grade with speaking or participation. If you are truly interested in improving your speaking and writing or are a Spanish major, take this course. If not, there are more fun, slightly easier L5 Spanish courses you can take. But with that said, I loved the course and I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to others. Rosamaria was an awesome professor. Take the class if you're willing to do the work and you'll learn a ton. If you don't have the time or the motivation to keep up, however, the course will be very difficult and painful.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who has taken very grammar based spanish classes before, and who is perhaps not very strong in conversation. This class is geared towards those who are stronger on paper. If a student is good at speaking and wants to improve his or her grammar, i would recommend taking this course credit D.",
    "Spanish 243 is a course you should take if you really want to improve your written Spanish (as opposed to conversational). As a whole, the course was good in examining the subtleties in grammatical concepts that were learned before in past Spanish courses. However, this often resulted in us becoming more confused or misguided. However, with Profesora Le\u00f3n, it was not that bad. She was extremely helpful and very encouraging. Whenever we had a question, she answered it to the best of her abilities and also commiserated with us over the large amount of work in the course. And be warned, there is a LARGE amount of work in the course. Make sure you have time to devote to it during your semester because the \"Carpetas\" can definitely become monotonous, time-consuming, and feel like busy work.",
    "Advanced Spanish Grammar is easy if you already know Spanish grammar and very difficult if you don't. It definitely requires a lot of busywork, but again, if you already understand the material you're covering, it's not painful. That said, there are no oral assessments, so if you need an L5 credit and speaking isn't your strong point, definitely consider it.",
    "If you are looking to just fulfill your L5 requirement and be done with Spanish, don't take Spanish 243. If you truly want to improve your writing and grammar (while doing a lot of work), take this class and you will see vast improvement.",
    "Be ready for a lot of homework, but it will improve your Spanish."
