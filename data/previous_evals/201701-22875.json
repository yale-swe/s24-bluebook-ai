   "comments": [
    "For a graduate student, the course is extremely in detail and fairly clinical. Perhaps it would be best to describe processes that apply better to graduate school courses.",
    "Teach things that are relevant to scientists, not to clinicians. For example, there was a question on the final about the first thing a clinician should do when a patient enters their office, which was neither part of our curriculum nor related to the brain. A lot of time was spent on the brainstem. Most of the relevant content from this course was repeated from neurobio in first semester, and also in the neuroscience courses we all took in undergrad. This is not to say that I did not learn anything of value from the course, but most of the time I spent studying was wasted on minute details that matter to doctors and spinal cord researchers, not to a typical neuroscientist. Thalamus\/hypothalamus was useful. Sensory systems were useful. The last half of the labs were useful. However, most critically, please don't reschedule exams. It is extremely disrespectful. In both cases this semester my research was negatively disrupted.",
    "I thought that the labs were well organized, and that Alvaro, Angela, and Charlie did an OUTSTANDING JOB. Can't emphasize that more. They were amazing. Lectures were good - but were mostly a repetition of a good chunk of neurobiology. The main issue is that we already took a neurobiology survey course, so they should deemphasize that same material for graduate students. I would rather the lectures be focused solely on neuroanatomy if we're going to colloquially call the class a \"neuroanatomy\" course. Huge weakness that graduate students experienced - we often felt like we didn't exist. For example, instructors would mention things like \"when you become physicians...\" or \"when you practice medicine...\" These comments made it seem like the graduate students didn't matter even though we made up a good chunk of the lecture audience. Instructors should make an effort to acknowledge the presence of the graduate students in the audience. Also, we didn't know exactly of what our grade consisted. This should be listed clearly on the syllabus.",
    "It gives a good overview of the neuroscience and a little bit of neuroanatomy. Learned much more about the actually neuroanatomy during neuroanatomy lab. Weakness is that it is extremely medical student oriented since it was designed for the medical students. Medical students probably think that the graduate students are piggybacking their course and we as graduate students feel that the department did not care much for us that they never bothered to design a neuroanatomy course for the scientists. Littlest thing such as the fact that all lab manuals and course webs are designed for Apple products which graduate students may or may not have (incidentally all medical students have an iPad), to many incidents where the instructors had to whisper something like \"well.. (speaking more quietly while putting up a hand to one's mouth as if what one is about to say is forbidden or something shameful) for the graduate students here it is not strictly true. There are many more branching but for you guys, you can just think simply that the connection is 1:1 and it is straightforward.\" Every class, except for Dr. Greer's lectures, the instructor always addressed the audience as medical students. Their focus was aligned to the interests of the medical student. This is not really the problem of unfair treatment. It is a fact that the course is for the medical student. It is also true that graduate students were entirely neglected from the tiniest minutiae to the entire design of the course. The real question is why were graduate students ever invited to take this course and why did the department not think that this was a bad idea.",
    "I understand why the medical aspect of it would be valuable, but I felt like it was a distraction and it was unclear what information the emphasis of the class was supposed to be on for graduate students. The labs were the most useful, yet the lab practicals didn't count in our final grades where as knowledge of the damage caused by strokes in certain regions don't seem to be as useful for neuroscience graduate school, yet it was more influential on our final grade. There were practice tests but only some of the information on them was stuff that graduate students needed to know, which made them more confusing than helpful.",
    "I wished the lab sections were the same in terms of what materials we got. It seemed like some lab sections were much better and provided better review materials."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would. Despite its weaknesses the course provided a thorough understanding of the anatomy, structure and organization of the brain.",
    "No, not at all. This is clearly directed to medical students, not to graduate students. It is organized on a whim (the schedule was not sent out until days before the start of the class) to fit the convenience of medical students.",
    "Yeah, I would recommend it... but I would hope that my suggestions are taken into account because I think it would improve the graduate student experience.",
    "Not really.",
    "No",
    "I don't think it's the best fit for neuro graduate school. the inclusion of some classes seemed incredibly random and the information we were ultimately tested on seemed too medical for students who are decidedly not in med school.",
    "Yes because it gives a general overview of neuroanatomy even for students with no prior background."
