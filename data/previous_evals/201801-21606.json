    "1. I really hope this course can be more like RIP talks in other department, to get more postdocs and PIs involved. Some other departments choose the hour before the happy hour every week, and not make it mandatory to graduate students, but still the room is always full of people. (I know it's hard to coordinate as several labs are on west campus, but Friday morning is only good for a class time but not for a RIP talk) 2. This course is well-organized, and the feedback form is helpful for evaluation. Josien and David invest a lot in this course and they always pay attention to your talk and take notes, this is really sweet.",
    "NA",
    "This class MASSIVELY improved over last year. Managing the class was significantly more friendly, welcoming, and supportive than previous years."
