    "Yes, if you are interested in a class of similar difficulty to differential equations but are looking for a more \"elective\" type course that has interesting applications.",
    "Interesting, heard it's much better than the CS version. Good times, good people",
    "The class has a lot of promise. It has a English-speaking, funny, high-energy professor teaching a fairly unconventional branch of math. For one reason or another, it gets fairly hard and really boring. You probably shouldn't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Please take it if you're even slightly interested in the material, if you're a computer science major (this class is so much better than CS 202 if Kaplan's teaching it), or if you want to discover a love for mathematics. This class was the most fun and rewarding experience I've had albeit the struggles with difficult psets, and I was this close to switch to the math major just because of it.",
    "This class was hard as hell. The class was full of people who have done competition math before, so they destroyed the first half of the course, combinatorics. Then there's me: I didn't know what a combination or permutation was.The first few weeks are rough, so I think the teacher needs to somehow help explain intuition for these things in class. Teach counting in terms of the penny problem, gift problem, generating functions, the 4 tabled-chart, poker-like problems, ninja-like problems, and table-like problems. You have to try to be more instructive and rule-based with the answers to counting problems. Not everyone has an intuition for \"how many?' problems, and yet there's a right answer. So there is a formula somewhere. Teach the general cases, then give a lot of examples.The homework's consistently took 15 hours, and without the help of the TA, at least 10 people in the class, and google, they would be impossible.The midterm was easy and the final was ridiculous. If he wanted to make a harder final because he wanted more of a curve compared to the midterm, tell the students. Those questions were just as hard as problem set questions. Also he said the final would be 65% graph theory and yet it was mostly combinatorics AND every graph theory problem was disguised as combinatorics. So be warned to now your stuff.Then graph theory is taught very well.Overall he's a good teacher, but it's a hard class. Take it cause its awesome, and extremely cool to learn, but be prepared to work your ass off and maybe still have a shitty grade because at the end of the day the tests don't test your knowledge of the material, they test your logic skills and quick thinking trickery.",
    "Not a cakewalk, but not terribly difficult. A rigorous introduction (but still an introduction) to Discrete Math. Expect to write a lot of proofs! Kaplan is charismatic and explains things well.",
    "You'll learn a lot in this class, not only with material (combinatorics and graph theory), but with proof techniques and problem solving. Definitely take this if you appreciate and like to think about math.",
    "Rigorous and interesting class. Must-take if CS or math.",
    "A solid overview of combinatorics and graph theory. The course material was well taught and interesting. The problem sets were challenging, but usually only took a couple of hours to complete (go to the problem sessions, they really help!). There is a midterm and a final. The midterm was fairly easy but the final was extremely long - many people didn't get to finish. Overall, I had a good time in the course andI would recommend taking it.",
    "If choosing between this and CPSC 202 - While I did hear that 202 was an easier class overall, I am happy I took this one because it was a manageable proof-based class that was interesting as well. Plus a truly awesome professor in Kaplan.",
    "MATH244 is a proof-based introduction to Discrete Mathematics that will teach you a lot about graph theory and combinatorics. It's a great course!",
    "For someone who wants to gain a great introduction to one of the most promising frontiers in modern mathematics, MATH 244 is a great option. I had a choice between the easier CPSC 202 and this class to satisfy my major requirements. And although my GPA may disagree, I am very happy that I took this in the end. Nathan was a great professor: young, energetic, clear, and approachable. And the material of the course--though challenging--proved to be very enjoyable (and useful for today's world), especially the unit on graph theory (such a cool field!). Definitely recommend this course, especially under Nathan, but I would consider Cr\/D\/F, since it is very challenging.",
    "This class goes really in-depth into combinatorics and graph theory. It's a good course if you're really interested in those subjects and are prepared to do a lot of work for it. You definitely learn a lot, but it is significantly more work than CPSC 202, so if you aren't really interested in learning the material and are just trying to fill a requirement of the CPSC major, then go with the other class instead.",
    "This class was fantastic. I can't speak to other teachers, but if Nathan Kaplan is teaching it then you should absolutely take it. He is dynamic and exciting, and you will come out of the class not only with a better understanding of the material, but also a better appreciation of mathematics in general. Also, his class is really fun -- I enjoyed coming to lecture every week and even (when they weren't too long) doing the problem sets, which were always fascinating and encouraged you to think creatively about problem-solving. You will also learn how to write proofs, which is great!Though calculus is not a prerequisite and Professor Kaplan does not use any in his class, I think it helps to have at least that level of \"mathematical maturity,\" so to speak.",
    "I would recommend it, definitely. It's a bit hard, but nothing you can't handle.",
    "Awesome class! As a non-math major who takes lots of math classes, I really enjoyed coming to these lectures and learning this material. Some of the problem sets were a bit more difficult than I had anticipated, but overall I was extremely satisfied taking this course. Also, Prof. Kaplan is fantastic.",
    "Again great introduction to combinatorics and graph theory, and thinking about proof based math.",
    "Discrete Math is more a way of thinking and problem solving than any heavy equation solving, and is a fascinating topic. Definitely recommended!",
    "This is not an easy class. Beware that combinatorics will be a lot more familiar to people who have done contest math in high school, so don't get discouraged. Really, it's going to be full of people who have had exposure, so don't let that get you down if you feel that you're not as up to speed as other people.",
    "Definitely take this course with Professor Kaplan. He is an incredibly smart guy and incredibly passionate about what he does. He's really young and connects well with college students, and he is very kind.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially if Professor Kaplan is teaching it. It was definitely tough--the problem sets took 15-20 hours almost every single week, especially during the combinatorics portion of the course. But those same problem sets never felt like busy work--we were learning both the material and how to write and think about proofs. From what I heard, this was much harder than CPSC 202, but we actually learned in depth and well. On the other hand, Professor Kaplan is amazing, really amazing. I hope he teaches more courses. He is friendly, accessible, engaging, passionate about the material, and a wonderful and funny lecturer. Also, while the material sometimes felt slightly disjointed, it was almost always presented very well and it was very interesting.",
    "Math 244 is a great course. Professor Kaplan makes the material interesting, and problem sets are never dull or redundant. However be warned that psets can take 6-8 hours, and some problems are very difficult. I went in to problem solving sessions probably one out of every two weeks in order to talk through questions with other students. Great course, great professor, be ready to put in the time, though.",
    "With professor Kaplan this year, this class was a lot harder and a lot more work than it ever was before. Homeworks are really challenging (especially in the combinatorics part of the course; they get a lot easier in graph theory) but make you develop stronger reasoning abilities in combinatorics\/graph theory. The professor is a good lecture and is very engaging, and easy on the eyes ;) The only thing I can warn people thinking about taking the class is that this kind of math is really hard to just 'learn' and then be good at. In many other math classes, including even analysis, algebra and other seemingly high level classes, you can always learn the material, practice the theorems and techniques you have learned in class or in homework, and the guarantee your success through hard work. This is a lot harder to do in this class since solving a combinatorics problem often involves using some clever trick or seeing a shortcut to a neat solution. That being said you will learn the ability to see these tricks in many situations, but unfortunately not all. The only disappointing part of this class was the final exam which was unreasonably difficult (everyone after the exam was in disbelief; people asked the professor if we could have an extra few hours after the 3.5 hours!) Beware the final if you're taking this (or perhaps not since the professor will learn from what happened this year and scale it down a bit next year) and also your grade in the course might not be that great even if you're usually an amazing math student.",
    "Great course, covering mostly combinatorics and graph theory. Kaplan is an exceptional professor, especially for the math department. He knows how to make the material exciting and at the same time delivers it in a clear and fairly rigorous way. Problems sets are often long, and this class might keep you up into the early morning hours on some days of the week. But the problems are usually pretty fun, and with enough effort and some teamwork, they're quite doable.",
    "AWESOME class - if you can, definitely take it with Nathan. You can just hear the excitement when he talks and he makes it so cool! The topics are also great - the main parts of the class are combinatorics (before fall break) and graph theory (after fall break). It's really cool stuff and also something I'd never seen before, apart from normal combination and permutation. It's a nice change from all the calculus I'd been learning from high school and first yearof college and also makes you realize how many different topics math covers. It's also a good intro class for people who have no idea of how to write proofs. This was my first class where we had to do any sort of writing along with our numbers, but Nathan makes it much simpler and teaches you a lot of good ways to go about writing them. The class has a really wide range of students, from those who have taken only Math 115 to people who had taken most of the math major requirements already. This makes it a little hard to teach to, but it's really not too bad and Nathan deals with it well. It's also interesting for people who have way more experience to take this class. I took this class with some friends and we had almost the whole range of math backgrounds but it was good for all of us to work together and I didn't feel TOO far behind those who had a lot more background in other areas of math.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wants to learn a new field of math that is rarely taught in high school. Discrete math introduces you to the world of proofs and intensive problem solving, giving you an invaluable mathematical toolkit that you most likely would not have learned otherwise. If you have any interest in math and are willing to put the time into learning it, take this class.",
    "Discrete math (as taught by Nathan Kaplan) was a solid course for people both with and without a math background. Kaplan is a great lecturer, and is very good at fielding questions and gauging the level of class comprehension and adjusting to it. He also made the problem sets interesting even for people who have done a decent amount of math already, while also making it possible for people without a lot of proof experience to catch up.If you haven't done any proof-based math before, and are vaguely interested in trying it out, absolutely take this course. If you are a math dork and you think combinatorics and graph theory sound cool then it's worth trying as well.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. I thought the material was very interesting.",
    "This is a great class for anybody interested in mathematics -- but you MUST be willing to put in a lot of work. I wrote more in this class than I did in the class I took for a writing credit over the course of an entire semester (I'm not even joking) and this class wasn't even a writing credit. The problem sets were long and challenging, often requiring visits to office hours and often taking hours of collaboration with friends. The midterm was fair, the final was absurdly long and quite difficult, but the professor probably scaled the grades accordingly. Professor Kaplan is really cool. Very knowledgable, very charismatic, and very humorous. He structures his class well and clearly plans his lessons ahead. He did get stuck a few times in class (probably due to a bit of inexperience), but he always made sure to send out emails clarifying things that were ambiguous in class. He was also really good about replying to emails. I learned a lot in this class, and I think this has a lot to do with how good he was. Also, I'm pretty sure a large portion of the class was attracted by his good looks :P The class teaches you how to think rigorously, and how to put your thoughts down on paper unambiguously. It also deals with some of the more fun aspects of mathematics -- those that give you the \"wow\" response (like omg the prime number theorem is pretty amazing). It's also a great introduction to young areas of mathematics research -- many questions are unanswered here, many of which are answerable without knowing the exceptionally complicated apparatus of advanced analysis and algebra knowledge, and anybody interested in math research should take this course to get a taste of what they can research in areas of discrete mathematics. tl;dr take this course if you like math and don't mind spending a lot of timeon problem sets.",
    "If ProfessorKaplan is teaching this class, take it! Not just because it's a prerequisite for lots of other cool things, but because it is a legitimately good class. You will cover a ton of combinatorics as well as some graph theory and other assorted topics, and get the chance to prove many interesting theorems for yourself.Doing well in discrete math takes a good amount of effort and insight, and homework assignments vary in difficulty, but on the whole it's not something you should be intimidated by. I definitely recommend it.",
    "A pretty good class. Kaplan was a good teacher, and very sweet. Homeworks were difficult but fair. The final was miserable.",
    "It's an extremely difficult course. The PSets will require a lot of time and make up 40% of the grade. Lots of informal proofs are required. The exams were fair, except the final was way too long. The professor is great though.",
    "If you had a good time with 120 or other introductary classes and want to try some kind of more challenging math, Math 244 with Kaplan is perfect for you.",
    "This course really fortified a lot of material that I've sort of had some idea of what it is, but not really had a firm grasp on. In that way, it was good. I feel more confident about combinatorics and graph theory than I did going in.That being said, the material got tedious at times. This was true especially with the graph theory part of the course. The proofs felt unnecessarily long and tedious sometimes, so that proving the theorems was somewhat unsatisfying.Nathan Kaplan is cool though! I like his enthusiasm, and he's a clear lecturer. I'll definitely look into taking classes with him in the future.",
    "Math 244 was an superb overview of combinatorics and graph theory. The professor is very good at explaining things and he is very open to feedback. Office hours are a fantastic resource if you want him to go over material from lecture that you might have not gotten the first time around. Finding friends in class to work through problem sets is helpful, as they can take a long time alone. The problem sets for the course were obscenely long in the beginning, but they became more manageable later in the semester. The final was quite lengthy and difficult.",
    "Absolutely, great professor, interesting problems sets.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who likes math. Unlike many other math professors, Prof. Kaplan has a very lively lecture style. The class covers combinatorics and graph theory, and he certainly made the topics fascinating to learn. However, since it was his first time teaching the class, the problem sets were often poorly worded, and they required further clarification emails sometimes sent only one or two days before they were due. That was just a minor problem and I'm sure it will improve. For me, the second half on Graph Theory was considerably easier than the counting problems, but the final exam was somehow a lot more difficult than the midterm.",
    "YES,TAKE IT! Kaplan is an amazing Professor. He is very charismatic and his lecturers are quite entertaining. There were days when I felt very tired, but still decided to go to class just because it was that good. I admit that some classes felt a little bit all over the place, but I learned so much this semester that I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even complain about it. For those of you who are computer science majors, you have no idea how applicable this class is! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be put off by the proofs in the class, first few weeks will require more work, but it is work that pays off. I had friends who switched to CPSC 202 and they deeply regretted by the end of the semester.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is useful, very interesting to learn and has a lot of fun.",
    "Take this class."
