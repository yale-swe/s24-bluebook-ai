   "comments": [
    "This class is a must, especially if you have only taken an undergraduate treatment of Probability Theory. Useful for any signal processing\/statistics person. The workload is heavy, with weekly problem sets, but are very useful and beneficial. Well worth taking this course for credit.",
    "demanding.",
    "I will say ENAS 501 is a wonderful course if you have the very basic statistical knowledge and you want to know more about stochastic process. It is a difficult but useful course.I will recommend this class to another student. The material covered in this class is very useful in a lot of areas. And the professor is a great help. It is nice to have somebody teach you things related to markov random process because it is really hard to learn all by yourself.",
    "Its a stoc proc class. Like I said maybe a proofy at times and light an application\/example. I would recommend it to another student. Most engineers need this stuff",
    "Very useful",
    "Yes, they will use it later for sure."

   "comments": [
    "Markov Processes and techniques surrounding Markov Processes are prevalent in so many areas that this is difficult to say. This course gave me a deeper foundational understanding that will certainly lead to a better grasp of methods applicable to my own research.",
    "Need better text book.",
    "The course helped me understand stochastic process much deeper. After this I am able to formulate problems in real world and research in a stochastic process frame. This is a great help because it opens another window for me when I seek for solutions to some problems.",
    "Very useful",
    "I think I will use MCMC in my research. Now at least I know something about it, which is good."
