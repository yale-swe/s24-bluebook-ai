   "comments": [
    "Great intro to the constitution, something that is very important and poorly understood by basically everybody",
    "Learned so much about the constitution and politics and our country!! Great way to put current events into perspective.",
    "I learned about how to utilize constitutional reasoning and arguing.",
    "Basically learn the tenets of Con Law, as seen through the eyes of a great constitutional scholar in Akhil Amar.",
    "I am a graduate student with an undergraduate degree in Religion from Princeton. Something I felt I missed out on in undergraduate was the ability to take more law-oriented classes. Pre-law classes were not on my radar in undergraduate, but I knew that I wanted to take a class here in that field. I very strongly feel that this course has helped me to refine my argument skills, and to become more familiar with constitutional law issues that are particularly relevant in today's political climate. I feel far more educated in how to think about these concepts than I did previously, and it has seriously made me consider pursuing a night degree in law (despite the fact that it would likely be a little useless to my career).",
    "A really compelling introduction to both constitutional law as a subject and the legal field in general.",
    "I learned a LOT about the US Constitution!! It really changed the way I think and look at texts, and it taught me how to skimmmmmm readings.",
    "I absolutely loved the new perspective on U.S. issues that Con Law brought. By the end, I was much more able to separate legal arguments from ethical\/prudential arguments that has impacted my understanding of modern politics.",
    "I didn't realize how little I knew about the US government before I took this course. I found it fascinating to understand the way the government functions and also how it acts to protect (or not) our rights. Besides just the content, I learned what it really means to make a good argument.",
    "Format of exams is very helpful in teaching how to apply case law to current issues greatly enjoyed and was challenged by the legal analysis involved.",
    "I developed a deep insight into American identity through the lens of American legal and political history. I deepened my understanding of the Constitution and the direct impact of Supreme Court rulings.",
    "I learned how to analyze complicated texts, how to understand and develop arguments, how to brief cases, and how constitutional decision-making works. My critical thinking skills definitely improved and I gained an enormous amount of knowledge about the law and the constitution.",
    "A comprehensive introduction to American case law in the last century. A consistent exercise for using modes of constitutional argumentation. It is largely what you make of it.",
    "Constitutional Law was the kind of intellectual experience every student should have in college. The course helped me draw connections between the text of the constitution and a wide variety of cases, enabling me to understand both the interconnectedness of individual cases and the larger themes of U.S. legal history. The entire course helped me improve my critical thinking and ability to synthesize information.",
    "I learned how to read Supreme Court opinions, and how to make constitutional arguments. Overall, I learned how to be a more informed U.S. citizen.",
    "Walked away with a stronger understanding of the Constitution, knowledge of U.S. legal history, and an appreciation for in-depth reading skills.",
    "General understanding of what constitutional law is and how to \"do it\", what the role of the Constitution is in the process of law-making, what role it played in certain hallmark cases, how to make good constitutional arguments",
    "The history and trajectory of Constitutional law in America.",
    "I learned the principles and practice of constitutional law, how law courses work in general, how to read legal cases and pick out the main arguments and ideas, and learned a lot about American history too.",
    "I became a better and more confident reader. I learned to read court cases carefully, picking up small details. I learned how to do law, and what law really is. I learned many amazing facts about America's history and government.",
    "I learned a great deal about the process of constitutional decision making (as the title of the main text implies) and a better sense of how the structures of government and certain elements of rights jurisprudence developed over time. The course gave me a good sense of how to make constitutional arguments and how the various subplots of the American constitution developed.",
    "I know so much more about my country's constitution now! I think I learned more in this class than any other class at Yale. It also made me think about how the law works.",
    "I knew nothing about con law. Now I know a lot about con law.",
    "Conlaw was one of the best classes I've taken in my Yale career thus far. Not only does the course teach you how to analyze text from a strict, legal perspective, but it provides you with a foundational basis to understand the Constitution, and founding documents of the U.S. It provides a unique framework and system to understand U.S. history, and allows you to see key events in the U.S. history timeline in a different, more critical perspective.",
    "This was a great course because it not only taught us about the constitution from a historical perspective, but also got us to apply the constitution to issues in today's world. It was a good introduction to what a law school class is like.",
    "I honestly didn't realize how little I knew about the Constitution until I took this class. I learned how to read and brief cases, which is a skill you don't get in other Yale classes.",
    "How to do Constitutional Law, how to read\/analyze constitutional arguments and how to make them on my own.",
    "You learn how to make a constitutional argument in this class.",
    "I learned the nuances of constitutional law and additionally gained a better understanding for the processes of law as a whole. This class helped to further develop my analysis skills and to think critically and approach problems from different angles not always considered.",
    "I learned how to make constitutional arguments from text, structure, precedent, prudence, history and ethos.",
    "I learned how to think like a lawyer, how to spot issues, and how to analyze legal texts. I also learned a lot about the structure and history of the US government.",
    "I know immensely more about constitutional law, I feel that my understanding of politics and history in America is much greater. I also think my writing improved.",
    "Know some more about the state of the law, but more importantly have a better understanding of how courts decide cases. Six modalities for interpreting the Constitution.",
    "This class was a survey of American constitutional history and jurisprudence conducted at a breakneck pace. I learned, as Professor Amar calls it, \"how to do constitutional law,\" and how to think about pressing current event issues critically and in a different light than I ever had before. Above all, this class taught me that straightforward, easy questions frequently aren't, and that every issue deserves detailed attention and care.",
    "I developed new ways of thinking about the law, interpreting it and analyzing it. The course allowed me to hone my analytical skills learned in other Yale college law classes forcing me to look at the text of the law at a new level of specificity.",
    "Con Law teaches you how to think in a new way - I loved the way that exams got you to think about constitutional decisionmaking\/arguments from the perspectives of court precedent, ethos, and history.",
    "I learned a lot about the basis for all the governments powers, about the (more interesting than I realized) separation of powers in the government, the role of branches other than the judicial branch in constitutional interpretation, and the process of doctrine forming and precedent following. Actually very relevant stuff with Trump as president, and I'm glad I learned it.",
    "Before taking this course I had never read a court case and the last time I had read the Constitution had been in 8th grade. As such, it is hard to describe just how much this course changed my perspective. I learned dozens of cases, how to really read the Constitution with intent, and how to apply all of this to current Constitutional questions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great lecture, lots of reading, but can do however much you want",
    "Amar is brilliant, the greatest strength of the course (though I hear the TFs are great--I just didn't take a section so I don't personally know). Really applicable to everything that's happened\/happening in our world.",
    "Lectures could be better organized. A list of each of the larger constitutional issues with the relevant cases would be helpful. Oftentimes the necessary background on cases was not given during lecture, and instead Amar spent twenty minutes discussion where he was in the syllabus. I actually think that this should be a 50 minute lecture--it would make the lectures more focused and improve the course.",
    "I felt this course was very strong across the board. I do wish the syllabus has more specifically set up what the due dates and exam dates were further in advance. As a graduate student with a partner in New York, I need to plan weeks to months in advance around due dates.",
    "It needs more structure + focus.",
    "Prof. Amar's course is AMAZING. It does a fantastic job at giving us a thorough overview of major constitutional topics. I very much appreciated Prof. Amar's emphasis on the historical background of the texts that we read. I wish that this emphasis did not somewhat compromise his covering of the cases. It sometimes felt like the readings and the lectures were two different things that we had to be on top of, and that was a lot. The section on Federalism felt particularly intense as a result, for instance. It would be helpful if Prof. Amar told us exactly which cases we should be on top of by the next lecture.",
    "Course is incredibly compelling and interesting, but lectures were, on ocassion, hard to follow.",
    "I can't really think of any weaknesses; the lectures were great!!! the sections were great!!! Professor Amar and all the TAs were very engaging and understanding!!!",
    "The course was really strong, engaging, but I would love to have more engagement with different perspectives from Professor Amar's. He makes compelling arguments, but doesn't present alternative interpretations, so I tended to feel like I was missing the full picture of constitutional interpretation. For instance, everything that we read in the course was written or edited by Amar. Many of the readings outside of the casebook were largely irrelevant to the case material, so I would have liked to substitute some of those readings with readings from competing theories on how the events unfolded. The class was a really great way to engage with issues from race to executive abuse of power in an analytical way. It is fun to do constitutional analysis because it seems to be much more easily resolvable than the policy questions involved. It is sometimes nice to separate the questions of \"Is this constitutionally permissible?\" and \"Is this a good policy idea?\" and just focus on the first one.",
    "Con Law is as hard as you want it to be. Because of that, it's easy to skate through, especially if you're Credit\/D-ing but you can make it super rigorous and intense.",
    "This course was fantastic. There was a lot of reading, but it was all really worth doing. The weekly lunches definitely added to the course, as did the sections.",
    "The lectures are amazing and very informative. Section was great. Papers were helpful and not very burdensome.",
    "Wonderful balance between lectures and section. I do not have any particular complaints about the course.",
    "Thought the course syllabus could be much leaner without detracting from substantive content",
    "The course is obviously taught by an incredible expert in the field and that, in a way, is its main strength. Professor Amar's depth of knowledge and incredible passion of the subject make it a worthwhile class - though definitely Credit\/D it, if you can. Another strength is what Amar referred to as \"ripped from the headlines\" -- many of the issues we discussed in class, especially now in the era of Trump's America, were incredibly relevant and vital to understand. Its main weakness is how many tangents Amar goes on sometimes that distract from the point of a certain lecture or an important takeaway which would make the final and the midterm so much more accessible.",
    "The greatest strengths are the inherently interesting nature of the subject and the TAs. The course's greatest weakness was the inaccessibility of the lecture.",
    "I think the structure of the course is great -- it allows students of all levels (of experience and motivation\/investment in the course) an opportunity to learn about a very important part of our democracy. Amar has a really great thing going here, and I wouldn't change it.",
    "The strengths of this course lies in the tremendous amount of ground that is covered throughout the semester. That being said, I think the class might benefit from a bit of a redistribution of the workload. I think it would help to begin the Rights section of the course a week earlier. I found that the material after the midterm was rushed and crammed into too few weeks. The reading, which had been manageable before the midterm, was absolutely too much to handle afterwards. I think the grade percentage of this course should also be recalibrated to give credit to those who have been in a section. I would make the final 50% and section participation 10%.",
    "The course really does a great job of teaching you many subtleties of the American government and Constitution. It provides you a good basis for understanding how to conduct Constitutional Law.",
    "The syllabus is fairly good, although the fact that we covered no 1st amendment cases was rather glaring. I think the syllabus was fairly good in terms of reading many of the major cases in U.S. legal history, and the atmosphere surrounding the T.A.'s was good. Furthermore, the evaluation system was very generous (although still demanding) and removed much of the annoying and useless nuisances of normal exam taking (such as writing in bluebooks on cramped WLH desks). Professor Amar's lectures were not always as well organized as they could have been, and it felt like he just harped on certain issues over and over again. I also think that pairing the syllabus more tightly with the lectures would have helped. Having a two week chunk of readings lumped together made it difficult to determine how much to read for each class.",
    "I liked both lecture and section together. My TF was amazing and she really cemented and clarified the material we learned in class. It was a lot of reading, but it is probably all necessary.",
    "It's a lecture and the professor moves pretty fast. Nothing you can do about that. All in all I wouldn't change anything.",
    "I loved that this course was broken into two: the first half of the course focused on the structure of the Constitution--it went through the three branches of government, and under each branch were a set of cases that pertained to powers of each branch, as well as overreach of the branches. The second half of the course focused on the Bill of Rights, and cases related to civil rights. Furthermore, I appreciated that this course was built in two ways: a relaxed frame to make the workload easier for students taking the class CreditD, and a more rigid frame for those taking the class for a grade, and who want to get the most out of the course. However, one weakness of the course is that there just isn't enough time to cover everything on the syllabus in one semester. Especially in the latter half of the course, there are sometimes up to 10 different cases assigned for the week engaging in civil rights. While this is material that I find extremely interesting, there just wasn't enough time to properly engage outside of class, and in class and in section.",
    "Professor Amar was a fantastic lecturer and the sections were well taught. the grading was fair, and even though the exam style was a little unorthodox I felt it worked for the course.",
    "Amar is great and it's cool to hear what he has to say a few hours before he says it on CNN or NPR. The TAs are all top notch. I would say the main weakness is that Amar is way more excited about the first half of the course than he is about the second. I felt like our discussion of the rights cases was really rushed.",
    "Strengths: A passionate instructor, fascinating material, assessments that were quite relevant to politics of today, great discussions in section. Weaknesses: Way too much irrelevant reading assigned, a desultory syllabus",
    "This class is great. Amar is a great professor. He's very accessible and a fantastic lecturer. Obviously, there's way more constitutional law than can be covered in a semester, but Amar says up front that he wants to teach you how to make constitutional arguments, and you definitely walk away with at least a basic level of that skill. That being said, you definitely get constitutional law a la Amar, but that's probably going to be true with anyone you take it with.",
    "I wish Professor Amor would structure his lectures a little better. It was hard to focus when he would lecture seemingly without notes or slides.",
    "This course is very engaging and interesting. The teaching assistants and professor keep the students enthralled and interested about learning more. They are very passionate about their teaching and it really shows in the classroom.",
    "The course really allows you to get out what you put in. As a student who put in a lot of work, the only improvement I can think of is to make this a seminar so I could be even more engaged with the course. However, I am aware that is not realistic. I appreciate Professor Amar summarizing the previous lecture at the start of every class but sometimes this synopsis would go to long and we would end up rushing through that day's material.",
    "The course is taught extremely well, and the exam structure (with 8- and 24-hour options) was nice. It could, however, be improved by making section and lecture sync up a bit more.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing , I loved lectures and sections and feel that I learned so much from both. The only thing I would change is the amount of reading, which was very difficult to keep up with and often times I had to read case summaries instead of the book because of time.",
    "Engaging professor and great TAs. One weakness is that there is so much reading that I didn't even attempt to do it all -- I gave up immediately. Another strength\/weakness (not sure which) is that the take-home options for the midterm and final made it easy to not study very hard and rely on being able to use the book during the extended test to do well.",
    "The amount of reading for this course is simply too much. It's hundreds of pages a week, and I simply could not do even a fraction of it. That being said, if you are taking the class Cr\/D\/Fail, you can essentially view the readings as optional supplementary material--Professor Amar's lectures and section were enough for me to get a good, basic grasp of the material. Again--too much reading!",
    "Professor Amar's lectures were absolutely gripping. It is tough to NOT be engaged in this class. Very very fast paced (be warned). The course structure is somewhat flexible in that section is not required and the midterm and final exam can be taken in either a shorter period of time or longer period of time. If you want to get anything out of the course, however, the reading really is essential.",
    "Strengths: phenomenal TA team, interesting set of cases, engaging exams\/lectures Weaknesses: lots of reading!",
    "A strength was in the balance between lecture and section. Lecture was very interesting (if you could follow along, which was not an easy task) and worth attending, but in the cases where lecture goes over your head or you're just not understanding something, section is where it all gets explained very well. Also, I liked that there weren't many assignments at all (because otherwise it could've been a very stressful course).",
    "This is a typical lecture course: its strength is a brilliant and passionate lecturer, excellent teaching fellows, and a well designed curriculum. The 9 hour midterm and 24 hour final are absolutely fantastic because they gave me the time to really sink my teeth into the texts and my analysis without stress and each exam was a really great learning opportunity as a result. Course has no weaknesses.",
    "Great material and an engaging teacher, but the lectures could benefit from more structure that would allow the students to follow along from point to point more easily and anticipate upcoming information."

   "comments": [
    "I recommend it, either credit D or for a grade. Everyone who says it's a waste to credit D because you won't do the reading, its true that you wont do the reading, but lectures are still great and you learn a lot without doing any work. Which is the point of a credit D, so highly recommend",
    "Yes! Not very hard and if you put away your computer and just listen to lecture you'll learn a lot. I took it Cr\/D and that was the best decision. Great class!",
    "Yes, I would (and have) recommend it to another student. The Constitution is an extremely relevant and important thing to understand and you won't find a better way to learn than with Professor Amor.",
    "I'd recommend if you are going to Credit D and want to take an interesting class without a lot of stress, or if you are genuinely interested in Constitutional Law and are going to read all of the cases. If you are taking this class for a grade and don't do most of the reading, you will be screwed. I personally found a lot of the lectures boring, and thought that the few cases I did read were really difficult to get through. Unless you are really going to devote time and effort to this class, Credit D it or don't take it at all. Amar is funny, interesting, and very smart, but he can be difficult to follow and learn from if you aren't in love with the material. He also plays favorites and will devote his time to students who brown-nose him rather than the quieter ones who are actually smart. This class gets the most interesting when Amar becomes a historian rather than a con law scholar.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this to both undergraduates and graduates who are looking to improve upon their legal argument skills.",
    "Constitutional Law was disappointingespecially because I had heard such fantastic things about it. In fact, it was one of my least favorite courses at Yale. Professor Amar's lectures were scattered and sometimes repetitive. They lacked cohesion. This is not the kind of course in which students feel invested. If you are interested in government\/ Constitutional structures, there are surely better classes to take.",
    "Con Law is an AMAZING course. It gives a thorough overview of major constitutional questions and doctrines (separation of powers in its most intricate details, racial discrimination, gender-based discrimination, privacy, federalism and the commerce clause, etc.). The course takes a lot of time (SO many cases to go through) but it is worth it. The exams are open book so you won't be slowed down by silly memorization. Prof. Amar is an expert in the field, so every lecture is filled with very insightful comments on the issues that we consider. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale!",
    "Yes! A super important course to further your intellectual prowess and develop a new framework of thinking on America and our political system.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, particularly as a Credit\/D. I think the Credit\/D option allows you to engage with the (super interesting) material at your own pace and not feel as pressured about the exams. You are sure to get a lot out of it.",
    "YES EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Especially in light of the most recent election.",
    "Amar is a pretty scattered lecturer; you'll either pay great attention and learn the most or spend the entire class period on Twitter.",
    "Con Law is a must-take for understanding modern policy considerations through the Constitution. As a freshman, it made me start to consider Law School as something that would be enjoyable.",
    "I think every student should take this course regardless of major (if this is not your main \"thing\" I would definitely take it credit\/d to remove stress). It's absolutely fascinating, and Amar is an incredible lecturer. Section was great for seminar-style discussion.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, American and international. I think understanding the Constitution is a key component of being a good citizen, which makes our country stronger and smarter. I think that understanding the Constitution is also a key element of understanding our national thought process from the outside and how we engage with the rest of the world.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, especially those interested in law.",
    "You MUST take this before graduating!!",
    "Yes! Excellent course with a thoughtful and kind professor who is committed to helping students learn. You will have missed a great intellectual opportunity if you do not take this course! I would advise to Credit\/D Con Law, because there are thousands of pages of material to absorb, and if you do not have an extensive amount of time to dedicate to the class, then you may find yourself struggling from a grade standpoint. However, you ABSOLUTELY should take the course Credit\/D! This is the kind of experience that college is for!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. All students should take this course at some point, as it prepares you to understand many important issues in America and gives you a foundation for discussing constitutional issues.",
    "Yes but only as a credit\/d option. The 8 hour midterm option and the 24 hour final option are absolutely brutal and I recommend taking the shorter versions, so reducing your grade stakes here is crucial. Take it for the material, not the grade because it's very hard to actually succeed in this course and get a hold of all the tiny details required to make a good legal argument, especially if you do not have any background in law or a good handle on American history. Sometimes the course gets incredible confusing, so take advantage of TAs and of Professor Amar who makes himself very accessible through office hours and lunches.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely -- take it CR\/D if you're afraid of the workload, although I started it this way and moved it to a letter grade. Even doing it for a letter grade is very doable once you realize that not all of the reading is strictly necessary.",
    "Absolutely. Everyone should take this course if you want to understand the basic pillars of our constitutional democracy and its history.",
    "Yes, Constitutional Law is something any student would want to know about and understand. I'm a CS major, but I feel like I've gained some true insight from this course.",
    "This is a good course if you want to be forced to systematically read a selection of important cases in Con law. However, I did not find the lectures particularly informative, and the overlap between Amar's books and lectures was massive. I stopped reading his books, especially since they are far more ideological (and often unconvincingly so) than the casebook, which is much better. All in all, a rather good way to do a lot of legal reading along with some hit or miss lectures, really good TA's, and a very accommodating examination structure.",
    "I would recommend it... but with reservations. I took it as a second-semester senior Credit\/D as a \"fun\" fifth class and I don't regret it. It is light on assignments but HEAVY on readings. Yet if you don't do the readings (as I later didn't) you won't get very much out of the lectures. But looking at American history through the lens of the constitution and Amar is interesting enough to take the class, I think. However, the quality of his lectures (along with my will to learn, probably) really goes down near the middle of the semester and it makes it really hard to pay attention in class. But I have to say that Amar really cares about undergraduates. You should go to his weekly lunches if you can. I only went to the very last one and I regret not going earlier.",
    "Students should take this class whether they want to be lawyers or not. I learned so much about the Constitution and the law that allow me to understand so much better what's happening in the news. Also it's really interesting!",
    "There's a whole boat load of reading. Three boatloads even. It's a lot. You don't have to do all of it though. I'd say if you go to class and section, actually pay attention and take notes and then read like 1\/8 of what was assigned, you'll be okay. I'd say that's more than fair for a class. Professor Amar is super inspiring. You'll leave class wanting to run into politics to change the world. I mean, not really because Trump and all that trash, but a little.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, regardless of whether or not they think they'd be interested in going to law school. This course is for students who are interested in U.S. history, and would like another perspective when examining timeline events from the creation of our country to present day. This class examines the foundational documents of our nation, and analyzing key Constitutional cases from the early 1800s to now helps to contextualize the values of this country, as well as the politics of the times. Furthermore, you'll learn that ConLaw never fades, as there are many many parallels that can be drawn from cases in the 1800s, to what is happening right now, in present-day under the Trump administration, and Professor Amar makes that clear.",
    "This is a must take course for any student who is interested in the law or legal analysis.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are thinking about law school, or just want to understand the constitution better. The reading load is really heavy, so you have to be strategic. Both of the tests have a take-home option and are pretty manageable. I would definitely recommend taking the section -- my TA was great and going to section really solidified my understanding of the cases. Definitely a good class to take Credit\/D.",
    "Con-Law is a Yale classic and definitely worth taking. There are some drawbacks such as the high reading load (and you can never tell which readings are necessary) and a syllabus that jumps from century to century with not much rationalization, but Professor Amar is one of Yale's finest and this material is incredibly important. His passion will blow you away and will make you excited about constitutional law in a way you didn't think possible.",
    "Absolutely. If you want to be an informed citizen, which you should, you should definitely take this course. You'll just understand the world you're living in better.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Most students take it Credit D\/Fail and I actually recommend this to start. However, it is possible to switch over once you have become more comfortable with the material and feel that you will be able to do well and handle the material, which is possible as long as you stay on top of it. The teaching is excellent and the class is so insightful and connects issues from the past with issues today and vice versa, depending on the situation.",
    "Yes this class is great. Lecture is interesting and the workload is not that bad if you credit\/D. If you want to put your heart and soul into the class you can.",
    "You should take this course before you graduate. Also, go to the lunches Prof. Amar holds.",
    "Definitely. This course was fascinating in its connection between historic and modern constitutional questions. I learned so much and feel that I understand politics so much more.",
    "Absolutely. If you have never studied the Constitution and the Supreme Court, you will learn SO MUCH. If you have extensively studied the Constitution and the Supreme Court, you *can* learn a lot, but you'll need to put in extra effort above what is required by the class and section. Sometimes it was difficult to decide what to write down from lectures -- in the 75 minutes he would hit a few big points (write those down, duh), but there were not clear secondary points, just a lot of interesting things he said. AKHIL REED AMAR teaches this class. Take advantage of that. Go to office hours as much as you can, go to his lunches, absorb his prodigious knowledge like you're a freaking sponge.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as it offers a great introduction to legal thinking. However, I personally regret taking it credit\/d because the class is designed such that its very easy to pass without doing any of the reading--and I think I could have gained a lot more from it if I took it for a grade and actually committed myself to understanding each topic. So, if you really want to gain a strong understanding of the law from this course, I would recommend taking it for a grade.",
    "This class is a Yale classic, up there with Snyder's classes and Gaddis's classes. Take it if at all possible--you won't regret it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student ready to put in a TON of work and and ready for addictively engaging lectures. The exams are very intense but doable if youve done the 1,300+ pages of reading. Every American should be intimately familiar with the document that provides for our remarkable liberties and freedoms. For foreign students, there is equal value in studying this extraordinary text.",
    "Most certainly! Loved this class.",
    "Hard yes. Even if it seems really random, take it. It's cool stuff and I'm glad I learned what I learned.",
    "Take it if you can. Understanding the American Constitutional Experiment is obviously of paramount importance for any liberal arts education especially today. There are two ways you can take Con. Law. You can take it Credit\/D like I did and only do a minimum of the readings to understand what is going on, just have fun going to lecture, and have fun on the exams. This is perfect as a 5th or 6th credit and you still learn so much (every dinner conversation I have now devolves into me talking about executive review or the 14th amendment). You can also throw yourself into it completely and read the whole casebook and all of Professor Amar's books. Either one works. Whichever you do, go to lecture, section, and the lunches Amar hosts. Amar's high reputation as an intellect and a lecturer is well earned."
