   "comments": [
    "One strong aspect of the course was the amount of reading we had to do. Each week we had to read difficult material and respond to it. For me that was one of the most enjoyable features of this course. All of the discussions were student led, which was nice in some ways but I wish that the professor had contributed more of her own ideas, as it was always really interesting the few times that she did.",
    "This course provided me with a strong overview of the culture of London, however there is not much structure to the course. The three papers we were required to write were completely open, which was both a blessing and a curse in that it allowed us to pursue whatever avenues interested us, but there was also not very much direction.",
    "This course is mainly reading and discussions on the readings which allows the course to be engaging without being too intense. There are 3 papers that are all fun to write because you choose your own topic .",
    "I really liked this course and there wasn't always a lot of work associated with it but I still felt like I learned a lot."

    "I would recommend this course.",

    "Great 5th course and great freshman seminar if you like writing and reading but aren't too intense about it.",
    "Yes, because it fulfilled a writing requirement but was also very interesting."
