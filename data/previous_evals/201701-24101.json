   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about the history of reproductive health in the U.S. I learned how to write a book review, too. I learned how to read vast amounts of reading in a short amount of time, pulling out the most important details.",
    "Extremely thorough help on writing and the research process. Engaging discussions. Dynamic instruction on presentation style and how to best engage a topic with an audience.",
    "I learned so much new knowledge, historical facts, and concepts\/insights. I learned so much from the in class discussions, hearing others' insights from the reproductive health readings. Truly amazing class that teaches really useful ways to live your own life and question your own thinking as well.",
    "I learned so much from this class: where even to begin?! The origins of OBGYN, medicalization of childbirth, birth control and contraception, sterilization and eugenics, abortion, American gender roles and how they have changed the past two centuries, the feminist movement...the list goes on. Needless to say, I left this class with a lot more information in my brain. I look forward to using it as I continue to navigate this world as a woman, as an intellectual, and as a feminist.",
    "Amazing course! This course was one of the best classes I've had the opportunity to take in my time at Yale-- Professor Eisenberg acutely and effectively employs Socratic methods to facilitate the interrogation of complex issues relating to the history of reproductive health in America. Further, these historical trends and facts inform modern events, and force students to reevaluate their perceptions of reproductive health and gender in modern America in light of related history and its overarching trends, historically utilized discursive tactics, and the corresponding (and persisting) underlying ideologies. I would recommend this course, and any course taught by Professor Eisenberg, to any undergraduate students interested in history, expanding their understanding of reproductive health, or examining contemporary ethical and ideological dilemmas. Professor Eisenberg is an amazing Professor who is committed to his students and to his course material-- his curriculum is nuanced and thoughtful, and forced me to rethink beliefs based upon historical continuities and their underlying ideology. I loved writing the final paper for the course, and learned more doing research for the paper-- based upon the course's themes-- than most other research I've written at Yale.",
    "Before this course, I had never written a lengthy historical research paper or taken a history seminar before. The seminar honed my ability to trace shifts and continuities in the readings, while upending many of the misconceptions regarding women's reproductive rights\/control before the late 20th century that I believed before taking the course. I also gained experience and confidence in using Yale's historical archives and library resources while writing the paper. The course does a brilliant job of going over some of the major themes, developments, and trends in women's reproductive health and rights, covering a wide range of topics such as midwifery, medicalization, birth control, eugenics, abortion, reproductive technologies, and more.",
    "This course gave me a really well-rounded understanding of the history of reproductive health, while also allowing me to use the past to inform my current understanding of women's movements, rights, and reproductive health policies. This class helped me be willing to question things I knew and ask big questions and do the work to try to answer them as best I could, even when the topics were emotional and provocative.",
    "I learned SO SO much about the history of reproductive health, different issues that women have faced throughout history as they work to secure their reproductive rights, and the power dynamics that are always at play in cases of reproduction, sex, and relationships.",
    "I learned so much about a history that we don't usually talk about.",
    "This course provides a historical overview of major issues in (women's) reproductive health from the late nineteenth century to the present. It does an excellent job of revealing women's agency and resourcefulness even under the confines of oppressive systems and regulations.",
    "This class really challenged the way I thought about the issues covered."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The big weakness I saw with the course was that our class discussions never seemed very two sided. It kind of felt like a lot of the same conversation and not a lot of different opinions. I don't think that that was a fault of the class, but the people in it.",
    "This course was driven by the students' comments. Every woman in the class was so passionate and knowledgeable about the topic. I loved learning from my classmates. The professor's questions often felt tangential\/irrelevant sometimes. I wish the class had been more geared toward free discussion. The first day of the seminar was really strange--we didn't really talk to each other about the issues; instead, we watched videos of women giving birth.",
    "Manageable workload. Research project was alot of work but entirely worthwhile. Professor was terrific. Engaged and challenged each and every one of us, and left us thinking about the topic well after seminar.",
    "Strengths include the topics and the discussions! The topics every week and readings were super interesting, while the discussions afterward revealed insights that you might have not thought about. Weaknesses include the lack of clarity about grading.",
    "This class has many strengths. The reading and writing assignments were excellent; the films that Ziv had us watch both inside and outside class were engaging; and I really enjoyed the student presentations. Discussion was always incredibly rich--difficult, yes, but in a constructive and formative way. The main weakness identify is that there were no men enrolled in the class! Women absolutely need to learn about reproductive health, gender, and power in the United States. But men do, too. Everyone needs to! I hope that the classroom can be more diverse in future semesters.",

    "One thing that I thought was well-done with the course was the inclusion of student presentations. Each student\/pair had the freedom to choose something from their week's readings that interested them the most, which always made class discussions more lively and engaging.",
    "A great course with well-curated readings. I loved how much discussion there was in this course!",
    "This was truly one of my favorite classes at Yale. I loved the other girls in the class and they all brought such wonderful insights to discussion. I truly felt comfortable in the class even when we discussed very difficult topics. The subject matter covered in this class is so so important and I really hope that this course is offered in a main academic department. The readings were all very manageable and very interesting however I feel as if we never had enough time to discuss them. The presentations were usually too long and took up a huge chunk of time and we would commonly spend huge sections of the class watching videos. These videos were always very applicable and interesting but they took SO much time away from discussing, so I think that they should be included in the assignment for the week so that we can dive right into the discussion. I loved the material and when the class finished I felt that it was in many ways very unfinished as we did not have the time to fully discuss.",
    "Weaknesses: The class was very reading-heavy, and often it felt superfluous since we could not discuss all of it in section. I preferred the weeks where we read a series of shorter (~30 page) articles to the ones where we were assigned several chapters from a book, as I felt the information was much more condensed and useful. While I appreciated bringing in other media, especially for the presentations, I thought some of of the movies were unnecessary and took a long time to get through. Professor Eisenberg was clearly very knowledgable about the topic and always had helpful things to add, but especially in the beginning of the course he would try to guide the discussion too much to answer certain questions that he'd come up with instead of letting it unfold more naturally. Strengths: I really loved the topic of the class and loved getting the opportunity to learn about reproductive health in an academic setting. I thought the seminar format was great because it felt much more personal and I loved hearing what everyone else had to say each week. I really liked that Prof. Eisenberg started off each class with a short presentation to give us background and establish timelines, which was helpful since a lot of the timelines of all of the different aspects of reproductive health were bouncing around. I thought the class was really well organized by theme, so we got to learn about anesthesia, FAS, abortion, the pill, etc. one at a time. I really liked the presentation assignment (to find video clips on the week's topic and present them) because it gave a much better sense of the time period than just reading a bunch of numbers. I also loved writing the final paper because we were allowed to write about anything we wanted that fell under the umbrella of the class, so every person got to write about something they were incredibly excited about, which was perfect in a class like this that everyone was taking purely for personal interest. I appreciated all of the check-ins on the paper, so it was impossible to completely leave for the last minute.",
    "Excellent course. I hope it will be taught annually, and that more courses like it -- examining gender and reproductive health with a sensitivity to intersectionality -- be introduced to Yale's program of study as soon as possible. If I recall correctly, there were over a hundred students who attempted to preregister for this course -- a clear indication of a current deficit in Yale's course offerings and a demand for more classes centering women and women's health. (Marcia Inhorn's class on women's health and intersectionality is notoriously difficult to get into, with upwards of one hundred students shopping hers as well.) In spite of taking many public health courses at Yale, this is the only one that has taken a more historical perspective and attended carefully to issues of gender, race, and class.",
    "This class is incredible. I don't see how it could be improved. Maybe more snacks?"

    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "Definitely! As a feminist, someone interested in health, or just as any living breathing thinking Yalie a must take! Best class I have taken so far at Yale!",
    "Yes, yes, yes! I would recommend this class to every single person at Yale. It is just so interesting and the things you learn about United States history and reproductive health\/power dynamics are unforgettable. You learn things in this class that make you wonder why everything in this course isn't taught to all people as common knowledge because it's so important! The discussions facilitated by the professor are very engaging, and although this seminar was two hours every week no one was fidgeting to get out or getting bored at all. The environment of the class was wonderful - our class seems to have an unspoken connection when we see each other outside. It is exciting and engaging from the moment you step into the classroom to the moment you leave. The lessons you learn in this class will make you form new beliefs and challenge many of your former beliefs.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone hoping to learn more about women's health in America and willing to grapple with some really tough issues.",

    "I would definitely recommend the course! You need to put in the work to do the readings each week and complete the writing assignments, but the course is so interesting and rewarding that it is definitely worth it.",
    "An absolutely phenomenal course! I learned so much. Definitely take this class if you're interested in the material. It certainly attracts a certain type of student, but everyone in my class was so enthusiastic about the subject matter and it made seminar very enjoyable and interesting. Take the class if you're willing to put in the work and do the readings -- it's very rewarding!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for any student, regardless of whether history is students are history majors or not. The course helped us learn about an important and unceasingly relevant topic in current life, and gave us the tools to approach and consider difficult questions.",
    "YES!! Such an amazing course, one of my favorites at Yale, and there truly has never been a more important time to take a course like this. It takes a unique male professor to teach this class to a class full of women, but Ziv was fantastic and we always had such interesting and stimulating conversations.",
    "Very yes.",
    "Take this class!!! Professor Eisenberg is wonderful and so helpful, and you couldn't ask for a more interesting seminar if you're at all interested in reproductive health. You'll learn about so many things you'd never even thought about (the history of the condom in the American Navy?) and you'll get actual historical knowledge of things that are on our minds a lot today (the history of the abortion debate, surrogacy). It is a great seminar on a great topic, I would so highly recommend.",
    "Excellent course. This year it was an all-women classroom (except for Prof. Eisenberg) which was a really exciting experience and energizing environment in which to learn. Please taken this class only if you care deeply about these issues -- the conversations and readings are high stakes, and it would be a shame for the discussions to be reduced to \"just to play devil's advocate.\" Readings were very interesting and fairly diverse. Fairly good attention to race and class in addition to gender.",
    "Absolutely. I'm a second semester junior and it's one of the best classes I've taken at Yale."
