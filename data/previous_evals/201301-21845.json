    "Don't take this if you actually want to learn French; I'd advise a little French before even though it's advertised as 'no French knowledge necessary' because you're going to have to struggle a lot by yourself otherwise.",
    "Take it if you're looking to see if French is a good language for you. Low time commitment, but you definitely get more out of the class if you put more time into it. It's not an easy class, so consider Credit\/D, but again, the more time you put into the class...I do feel like I have some intuition about the French language coming out of the class that I didn't expect. I am also disappointed that we didn't learn more French speaking skills, even though I should have known better.",
    "If you need to learn how to read French, this is a good class.",
    "I felt that this class should have a different number besides French 109. Only one other student and I were at the novice level in this language while everyone else had experience with it which was very unfortunate.This is basically a translation class where you do a LOT of French reading. I actually wish it had met twice a week instead of once because as a complete novice to the language, I needed far more exposure than once a week.",
    "This is a great class for learning the reading and grammatical aspects of French. You will not learn any speaking and pronunciation you will only pick up by paying attention, so if you want to learn French for communication purposes, another class is best. However, if you want to have French available for a secondary tool for research, this gets you on your feet amazingly fast. I would not recommend the class to most undergraduates but would highly recommend it to other grad students."
