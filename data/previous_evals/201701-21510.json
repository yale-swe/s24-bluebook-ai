    "I learned different levels of species counterpoint. My understanding of music theory improved with a more in depth look at different kinds chord progressions and a refresher on roman numeral analysis. My composition skill improved through the two composition assignments and I gained a slightly better understanding of musical history and its connection to theory through our examination of minuets by famous composers, as well as other pieces of music.",
    "This class taught me how to recognize chords and different forms of music. It gave me new skills on how to analyze classical music.",
    "I learned more than I ever new about music theory, even after playing classical and jazz piano for 15 years. The theory I learned in this class have already influenced my approach to playing both jazz and classical. I learned skills such as Roman numeral analysis (which I never really understood), the process of composition (it can be much simpler than I thought0, and general history about the form of music of the classical and Baroque periods."

   "comments": [
    "The course was great and I learned a lot. Particular strengths were the composition-based assignments, from the counterpoint to the midterm project to the final, which allowed me to experiment and get feedback on my work. I felt that the pace at which we covered new material was a bit slow. I think that in-class time might be better used on new and different topics in music theory, rather than the focus on analyzing minuets in class, which could have easily been homework. We didn't have homework on many days, and while in a sense that was nice, consistent homework assignments would have further solidified my understanding and would have allowed us to cover more ground during the course. I love music theory, and I only wish I learned a little more about it in this class.",
    "I learned a lot, but didn't get to practice all of it all that much. Some more small assignments to practice what was taught in class would be useful.",
    "The strength of this class is that it really gives you a better understanding and better practice of analyzing chords and answering the question of why the notes are written in that way. By looking at many examples, it helps develop the skills required for composition. A weakness is that it moves fast so people from basic music theory might have trouble keeping up. Also, the class is heavily concentrated towards classical music so it might be a little boring for people who aren't as interested in that music genre.",
    "Strengths include a fairly light workload on a day-to-day basis to allow you to really focus on and absorb the course material, Professor Adam's amazing depth of knowledge, and"

   "comments": [
    "If someone were interested in either theory or composition, with only a moderate background in theory, I would recommend this course. I wasn't very difficult so it could fit well as a lighter course in a heavier schedule, as it was for me.",
    "***Take 210 with Professor Adam!! He is absolutely amazing and you will be so happy that you did!! 11\/10 reccomend.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student that has music theory background and is interested in learning how to compose and analyze classical music. If not, this class might seem a little boring but you learn a lot.",
    "Absolutely take this course with Adam if you can, if you would like to learn more about music theory but feel shaky about your previous knowledge. This particular class was filled with students who have been playing instruments for years, thus placing out of MUSI 110, but had limited knowledge or familiarity with topics such as Roman numeral analysis. We all had a great time and the coursework was completely manageable. Also, Professor Adam is extremely available and helpful if you need extra support."
