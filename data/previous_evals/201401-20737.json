   "comments": [
    "Great course, really changed the way I think about research and the way I approach any scientific articles I read.",
    "It's a decent class. You read some really cool papers (just focus on the figures). Occasionally we think about what improvements could have been made etc. The lectures can feel a bit long on Mondays. The only grades are a midterm paper News and Views style, then a poorly organized, last minute presentation on the last day of classes and a review article on an enormous topic like LTP or neural stem cells. Since you only have one grade going into the last week of classes and it's only worth 20%, it can be a bit stressful. Also, the final review article is ridiculous. The topic is way too broad and it's due the last day of reading period so you're bound too be in crunch time. It's impossible to read enough primary articles, yet alone think critically and originally about them and draft a decent review.",
    "If you like the idea of reading scientific papers on a range of neurobio topics, take it. Especially helpful if you see yourself going into research later.",
    "This course is very useful in that it teaches you to critically read papers and know how to read\/criticize them while gathering the main points. I would have liked more brain plasticity in the course and less focus on development, which ends up taking most of the semester, but overall I would recommend this course to anyone who thinks that reading science papers isn't their thing\/who aren't really sure how to go about doing it",
    "Yes, I would heartily recommend this to another student. The assessments include two papers: one at midterm (critiquing a journal article), one during finals (writing a review on a subject area in BD&P), and a final group presentation (on two papers that address the same question, with opposite conclusions). There are lectures on Monday that provide background on the the weekly assigned papers up for discussion on Wednesday. The work was all very satisfying to me (as someone who hopes to continue in Neuro research). Of course, to get the most out of the class, you must engage in it. You have to want to be able to think \"out of the box\" and you have to want to answer the questions posed in class. You have to read the papers, and you really have to participate. This is a very hands-on class, which made it great!",
    "It's a fascinating topic, you'll learn a fair amount, and there's not that much work. The first class of the week is a lecture during which a specific topic is presented, and the second class is a discussion on that topic for which you'll have to read about two papers. There's also a midterm paper and a final paper. Don't believe Professor Zhong if he says he'll give you an extension on the final paper - he won't when you formally request one. Overall, it's a good class.",
    "A very different look at neurobiology, focused on the \"how\" of the scientific process rather than on simple facts. Dr. Zhong's style takes some getting used to, but this class was a refreshing look at neurobiology.",
    "A great class. Do take it. You have to stick with it in the beginning, but it is well worth it at the end."
