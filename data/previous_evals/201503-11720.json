    "yes, I would recommend chns154 to another student. It's a great course, and a good way to keep up your chinese and learn more conversational skills. Definitely not as much work or as hard as the earlier chinese classes.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend. It is challenging, but usually fair.",
    "Highly Recommended.",
    "Easier than 150 or 151. More writing assignments but very manageable. Zhou Laoshi is great. Would recommend.",
    "Chinese 154 is the first class in the track that meets only three times a week, and it is definitely a different type of class. Of course you still have the classic memorizing 30-50 characters per meeting, but the course is centered around more real texts. It involves reading texts dealing with current issues in China, rather than talking about David and Helen (like CHNS 130-140). There is also no wasted time in class memorizing passages for no reason. Instead, the teachers and class have real conversations together and practice exactly what the students need to improve their speaking and comprehension. The gains you make in character writing are entirely dependent on your own effort. You could possibly cram for the daily quizzes and still get by okay.",
    "continuation of the sequence-- less demanding than 150\/151, but still a lot of work with quizzes",
    "It's like the first year of L5 but a lot more relaxed. You still learn a lot, but you don't go through boring drills every day in class. Instead it's more conversation based. It's very much a class where you get out what you put in.",
    "If a student is looking to continue using their Chinese I would recommend this class-- it is the easiest of the Chinese classes I have taken at Yale and yet is interesting and helpful.",
    "It is a course that has a high time commitment, but if you dedicate the time then it is very worthwhile.",
    "CHNS154 is a great course to take after CHNS151. I was a little apprehensive to take this class, as I had no exposure to Chinese during the whole summer. However, both Zhou Laoshi and Peng Laoshi are sensitive to the fact that all of the students were coming in with very different language skills. Zhou Laoshi and Peng Laoshi are both fantastic teachers. They are both very caring, approachable, and extremely engaging to students. I really appreciated the course structure. If you're terrified of the heavy workload characteristic of previous chinese classes -- don't be. I felt that the course workload was very manageable and appropriate for a non-intensive language class. I also appreciated the fact that the course material allowed us to have conversations about cultural, economic, and political issues in China. I felt that this class really helped me maintain and improve my Chinese listening and reading skills. Although the course overall is very organized, there were a few instances where we had surprise class projects\/skits that weren't on the syllabus. One improvement might be to list all class projects on the syllabus, just so students can allot the proper time to prepare beforehand. Overall, CHNS154 is a great class that I would recommend to other students."
