   "comments": [
    "Take it writing intensive. It's the easiest route to go.",
    "Good course, important material, invested professor, too many guest lectures.",
    "I would recommend this class only if it is taken writing intensive.",
    "Very interesting course.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS COURSE! Every single lecture and reading contains information that is relevant to life in America in the 21st century. Professor Hacker is incredible and every lecture is well-organized, informative and engaging. The assignments are fair and thought-provoking and not difficult as long as you keep up with readings and use your TA as a resource. I would suggest it to anybody, whether they have an interest in Political Science or not. Guest lectures are awesome- you get the opportunity to hear from really exciting people, often who have come to give a Master's Tea or another prestigious talk here at Yale. Overall one of my favorite courses I've taken so far in my 3 years here!",
    "Every Yalie that wants to go into policy or politics needs to take this class.",
    "Harder class than I thought for the midterm grading. For the take home, be very through in your answers and clarify with the TA on what the prompt asks for. Include counterarguments, your answers need to be more sophisticated than your usual exam.",
    "It's a good course and an important subject. I'd recommend it to anyone, not just poli sci majors, because of the interesting subject material and the accessibility of the subject material.",
    "I would recommend this course. Good for those who are interested in the ethical questions of PLSC. I did the CBL option and it was well worth the work! I made great contacts in the community and thoroughly enjoyed the process.",
    "Class is alright. Professor is whatever. But the material is really cool. If interested in the topic, go for it.",
    "It's a pretty good course. Not too hard but the material is interesting.",
    "Prof Hacker is a really intelligent guy and a star in the field. (Look up his Wikipedia page). But his fame hasn't gone to his head. He's personable and interested in what students have to say. I really enjoyed his lecture style too. He has a billion slides of empirical and often cross-national data to prove any point he makes. Instead of preaching that inequality is bad from a purely philosophical standpoint, he tried to think about *why* inequality might be bad. This class is 100% worth shopping. If you're interested at all, make sure to go to at least one lecture. This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in the problems with our current political system. This class will cover why the rich are getting richer and the poor are staying poor, why it isn't yet fixed, and what we can do to fix it. You'll learn a lot about how and why the income gap emerges and stays, the influence of money in politics, and the ins and outs of different social safety net programs. Professor Hacker is a good lecturer. While sometimes he tends to go very quickly through complex material, he is also very clear and explains tough concepts well. He's engaging, funny, well-prepared, and accessible. Section was pretty useless but I heard that people with different TFs really enjoyed theirs, so I guess the lesson here is shop TFs. Two caveats: -If you are not very interested in politics\/policy, you will probably be bored. There is some pretty meaty material, and Professor Hacker tends to be a fast-paced lecturer. -If you are conservative, you will probably be frustrated. However, Prof. Hacker does a good job of presenting facts rather than opinions.",
    "I would recommend it, as it is a wonderful introduction to inequality and the policies and social constructs surrounding it.",
    "I'm not sure I'd necessarily recommend the course. It was more work than it was worth. But Hacker was great so I'd suggesting trying to take a course with him in a seminar setting.",
    "This course will get you thinking about large issues stemming from Inequality, but you should not expect to relate to the lecture content on a personal level, as any emotional involvement will be lost in the data.",
    "This was one of the best courses I've ever taken at yale. The material gets a little repetitive in the last 3 weeks, but professor hacker keeps students engaged with discussions during lectures as well as guest lecturers who are very well informed on topics such as healthcare and prison reform. If you enjoy politics, this is a must take course.",
    "Great class, with interesting, valuable readings. I'd definitely recommend this class if you want to get a grounding in a whole variety of barriers to social policy reform -- from the criminal justice system to healthcare to taxation systems to political polarization. The only thing is that the lectures are so short that we barely scratched the surface each class, which became frustrating at times. But overall a good class with a really great professor."
