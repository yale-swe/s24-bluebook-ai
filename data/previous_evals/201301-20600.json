   "comments": [
    "The course is designed to show how individual cells can work together to create complex tissue behavior.I would not recommend it to another student because I felt like since it was so instructor dependent it would have been more time efficient for me to just read several reviews on the topic.",
    "Yes because it was a good review of things I had been introduced to in a previous course but at the same time it went into deeper detail on those same topics but in a more research-based focus, as opposed to a textbook-style course that only tells the facts or discoveries instead of how the information was discovered scientifically.",
    "The class offers a survey of the major organs\/systems of the human body from the cellular level, and in most cases provides information on recent work in the field. I would recommend the class. Even though each topic could not be covered in a great amount of detail, I found the class very useful and interesting.",
    "A class that touched on every system of the physiological system, very good structured and well organized lectures.",
    "It's a course on human physiology that approaches from the cellular level. If that's a subject relevant to one's research, or even just an area that one ought to brush up on, I would certainly recommend the course.",
    "yes",
    "if you are interested in histology, you may choose the course.",
    "A useful introduction to cellular structure and function in different organ systems. I would recommend this class.",
    "A great refresher of the basic organ systems with an clinical perspective and introduction to the molecular mechanisms involved in normal and abnormal functioning. The histology component is a great partner to the lectures.",
    "Loved this class. Would recommend."

    "Had researchers from my specific field speak and helped me think of things to consider for my research project, gave me a better idea of the larger picture and what point in the field my research fits in.",
    "Yes, very helpful for understanding disease mechanisms and pathology.",
    "It gave me a broader understanding of the cellular networks that contribute to proper function of the human body. Vascular topics were relevant to my research.",
