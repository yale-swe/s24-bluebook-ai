   "comments": [
    "If you're looking to fill a QR and have some sense of logic then take this class. Its fun and Adam Marcus is hilarious. The best part of this class was him making fun of people who took his class too seriously. If you don't plan on going to class however, you'll be really lost. Actually going to class doesn't exactly help that much either, but at least when he does assign a problem set (we only had 4 the entire semester) he'll take the time to meet with you and breakdown concepts for your understanding. Definitely take this class if you're not interested in an econ. lecture or a calculus class.",
    "THIS IS AWESOME!! Take this class! For all my fellow QR-phobes, this is by far the most interesting and least taxing QR Yale currently offers. Adam Marcus is awesome and hilarious and takes really cool concepts and makes them work in really easily-digestible ways. This course is a course in mathematical literacy and focuses much more on the process of your thinking rather than the end result itself. It doesn't matter what the answer is - problem sets (of which there are not many), final; it's your ways of approaching problems that count.",
    "Easy QR and is the only math class that I have taken that has any real value. Only a handful of problem sets, a paper, and a final exam that is worth very little. Class is fun and casual.",
    "Whimsical approach to numbers. Good for non-math students, as the grading is based mostly on effort. Recommended for anyone with an open mind. A little far-fetched at first, but once you get into the rhythm, you find yourself thinking differently about complex math issues. Lots of abstract thinking. problem sets are difficult but there are only four and you are encouraged to work together to complete them.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if they are looking for a QR. Many times the problem sets can be fun to solve.",
    "I answered this above",
    "YES! BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN, BEST TEACHER I HAVE EVER HAD",
    "If you like knowing what's going to happen next week, next class, or in the next 10 minutes, then this is probably not the class for you. But if you like puzzles, mathematical apocrypha, and twist endings to both, then you're probably going to love this class as much as I did. Adam is a \"whatever I feel like talking about today\" kind of teacher, but there's passion behind the spontaneity, and whatever you're discussing is guaranteed to be thought-provoking and masterfully and humorously explained.",
    "good if you're looking for a way to fulfill a qr requirement, which is what i was doing. it's unclear if it's an easy grade or nor b\/c participation counts as 60 percent (i know, right?) and that makes it sort of arbitrary...",
    "You won't have any idea what's going on, but it's a great way to get the QR out of the way. Probably one of the best QR classes there is; small workload and the fact that it's a small lecture\/big seminar setting is good because you don't feel pressurized to talk, but it's not too intimidating either",
    "It's a fun class that focuses on problem solving. Not a lot of work at all and Adam is always available to help you if you get stuck. The problem sets could be challenging, but the point is to get you to think, and the grading is very very fair (you get points for effort and showing work, not correct answers). If you enjoy problem solving, I'd definitely recommend it as a fun, easy, QR",
    "This is a course on abstract mathematics. You learn problem solving skills and how to think conceptually about math. Remember in middle and high school when you had those math contests with seemingly impossible problems that only the geniuses in class could solve? Well basically, you learn how to solve such problems in this class. The material isn't necessarily easy but it is definitely easy to do well in the course. The midterm and final are each worth only 10% of the grade and the midterm is actually a paper where you have the chance to learn more about an advanced math topic of your choosing (sounds lame but it's actually an enjoyable assignment, and believe me when I say this because I never find any assignment particularly enjoyable). 60% of the grade is comprised of participation which basically means you show up to class, ask questions (which you will have a lot of, and this is not a bad thing), and go to the professor's office hours. Speaking of the the professor, you will love Adam Marcus. He has a great sense of humor, is often sarcastic, very knowledgeable, and extremely approachable. If you want to take a thought-provoking class for your QR credit, I would absolutely recommend this one.",
    "If Adam is teaching this course again, I strongly recommend taking this course. Even if he isn't, the things you will learn in this course are skills that will help you in life. In a history class, you may learn facts that you later forget. In this course, you learn how to solve problems. There is no way you can forget that; I have found the problem solving strategies I learned in this class to be infinitely useful.",
    "This is not a gut class. It is a mind-bending experiment into group theory, set logic, and other arcane concepts, albeit brought down to an understandable level. I took calculus and stat in high school and didn't want to take more of the same here; for better or for worse, my knowledge of these subjects was of no help in this class. There isn't much work: you have a few problem sets, a paper, and a final, but you shouldn't bother taking the class unless you know you'll come to lecture. Between Adam's sarcastic but effective teaching and the concepts themselves, it is in your interest to show up. This is the second instance of my needing to fulfill a QR requirement resulting in a favorite class (the first being CS 112, Intro Programming): I really enjoyed the class and would recommend it to another student willing to invest significant mental energy in the subject matter.",
    "only take this if you like logic or need a math credit",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who does not want a typical Calculus course. Subjects don't follow a traditional syllabus, and are usually taught using different names so that you can't just copy answers from some book. Don't be turned off by the non-traditional progression, topics are very interesting, especially the logic problems. Though the problems he may pose may seem impossible, when you start to understand them it really feels rewarding. Professor Marcus is always readily available to help students out, and he makes Math seem durable and exciting. I would definitely recommend this course to any student, especially those students looking for a QR class.",
    "Take it. Best decision I've made at Yale. It's not a gut, but it's the most enjoyable way you could possibly knock out your QR.",
    "I would certainly recommend AMTH 110 to a fellow student. The class is perfect for anyone who despises spending countless hours solving textbook math problems."
