   "comments": [
    "I would summarize this course as manuscript study for literature students, which is basically what the course title already is. I think a non-medievalist may struggle somewhat with the course because of the amount of familiarity assumed with Middle English literature, but in general, and certainly for a medievalist, the course was very productive.",
    "I would certainly recommend English 519 01 to a fellow student, Medievalist and non-specialist alike. For Medievalists, it is essential to have at least a cursory knowledge of medieval manuscript culture. For any literary scholar, manuscripts bring to the fore theoretical questions about genre, authorship, and authority that would be beneficial."

   "comments": [
    "This course opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about medieval textual and literary culture, and I am sure I will bring my deepened and expanded understanding to all my future research in this and related fields.",
    "This course helped me very much. I have a lot of book history experience, but less experience with English Literature. It helped me realize where the two can intersect, and very profoundly influenced my quest for a dissertation topic that heavily relied on manuscript study but would be interpretively significant to those outside my immediate field."
