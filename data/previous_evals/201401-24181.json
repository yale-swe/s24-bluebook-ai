    "Jody has a lot to teach! Only thing is she don't have time to teach everything. But she pointed out interesting perspectives and many of which you usually cannot get from reading papers and journals. People have interesting ideas and are inspiring. The TA is great as well.",
    "The course was very interesting. The topics are really interesting and relevant. However, the discussions in class were disorganized and rambling. Though there seemed to be specific concepts that the intructor wanted us to learn, she did not do a good job of clearly explaining them in class. The \"lectures\" were disorganized. Although the class was supposed to be an economics course, there was very little clear explanation and examination of the economic concepts underlying what were were discussion. The discussions also pretty quicky degenerated into students talking about what they have heard or feel about issues, rather than staying with evidence-based findings.",
    "class is more seminar style. the professor is extremely nice and knowledgeable in her field. however, the dynamic of the course (for some reason or another) fell short of expectationas last years reviews say, discussion could have been facilitated to talk beyond readings but instead were very limited (part of that is due to the mixture of undergraduates and graduates) - it is not the intelligence level but maybe the experience difference that may have made it harder to make the discussion more engaging"

    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Jody has knows so many things about substance abuse and sad that she cannot teach them all. Wish the materials discussed in class will have more focus",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0The instructor is very knowledgeable in this area. She is also interesting, very nice, and very accessible. However, she very often appeared quite disorganized. Her lectures were fairly disorganized and she didn't do agood job of clearly explaining the main concepts she wanted us to understand. She also put up too often with the class asking very tangential questions and continuing to make comments that were about how they felt or what they heard about topics, which really took the discussion away from evidence-based information."
