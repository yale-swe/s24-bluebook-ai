    "You can do well in this course if you do what is asked. Although the material is not easy, it is clear cut. I would recommend it for sure. Also, you don't really have to do the reading if you come to class and pay attention.",
    "If you're just looking for an easy QR, don't take this class. It's fairly work-intensive, and some of the concepts can be difficult to grasp. That said, it's immensely rewarding\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have a newfound appreciation for language, and I feel like I've started thinking about words and sentences differently because of this course.",
    "Interesting look at how we draw meaning from words and language. I would recommend it if you are interested in linguistics, are a bit mathematically oriented, and need an SO credit.",
    "Take it if you're willing to do 4-5 hour p-sets every week. The concepts aren't difficult, but executing them properly takes time.",
    "This class was really a great first Semantics class - I learned a lot of interesting things about formalizing meaning, and it really felt like the material built upon itself nicely as we went through the course. Ashwini is really excited about the material and teaches with passion that radiates. Daily handouts basically had all the lecture notes on them and were really helpful (but you need to go to class to understand them) and the homework was manageable and useful (usually at most a few hours each week, and you only had to get 23\/25 to be bumped up to a full score on a pset). Sometimes lecture was hard to follow and people zoned out because things were explained in an overly complex way (towards the end of the course). But mostly, lecture was really interesting if you're interested in learning about how meaning works in language... Watch out, the take-home final was unexpectedly long this semester... very, very long compared to the take-home section of our midterm and compared to any psets we did! This was quite stressful - lots of people got blindsided. Hopefully she changes this but if she doesn't, make sure you're ready to have enough time to work on it (8 hours min, I'd say.. I'm sure some people worked for 10-12+, when we all expected it to take a few hours max).",
    "To start, I am a math major, so I did not take this class for the QR. Instead, I took it for the SO credit and to see an interesting application of logic firsthand. That being said, I don't think that it was a very good course. If you are a quantitative person, the class will definitely be too wishy-washy and non-rigorous for you. Unless you want an easy class with very little work, I would recommend looking elsewhere.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. Even if it's not your area of interest, its a great QR that doesn't entail a lot of scary math, and the material you learn is applicable to your daily life. To understand and easily identify implicature and entailment in language can be incredibly useful because its used so frequently to bias the audience in advertising and political campaigns. Understanding language and how it's formed and what it means is crucial for communication of any kind. If you struggle with the material, there are resources like office hours and section put in place and readily available to help you.",
    "Absolutely. For someone looking for a funky, off-the-beaten-path QR that doesn't involve numbers - DEFINITELY head to Semantics (or maybe anything in the Linguistics department - although I'm not sure what other QRs are offered...). Infinitely better and more interesting than something \"traditionally quantitative.\""
