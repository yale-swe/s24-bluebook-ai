    "This course is a fascinating look into navigation and into the Navy itself. I truly recommend this course even to civilians like myself, though it may seem insane to sign up for this course if you aren't required to. The material is interesting and well presented, and if you sail or have any interest in boats, it may be one of the most instantly applicable courses you will take at Yale.",
    "A really good course for learning the basics of navigation that are used on a daily basis in the US Navy.",
    "If you're taking this class you're probably an NROTC mid, it's better than introduction to naval science, but the wake up time still sucks. You'll have a good time though.",
    "If you are in ROTC, you have to take this course. I wouldn't wake up early to take it otherwise.",
    "Navigation is a phenomenal course for any student who is interested in learning about navigation or seamanship. Anyone interested in maritime pursuits, whether it be in the military or civilian arenas should take this course."
