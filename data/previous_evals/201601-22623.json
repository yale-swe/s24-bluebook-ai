   "comments": [
    "A very interesting course for those seeking to understand the antecedents of the modern 'global order.' I would recommend having some background in global affairs to really get the most out of the discussion and course.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "History of globalization and world order creation. Heavy reading load, but very well worth it. Works that you are likely to revisit.",
    "A refreshing alternative to polisci\/IR theory-driven seminars on global order and globalization; be prepared to cover a fairly vast swath of history in the course of the semester.",
    "I would say it was extremely interesting and eye-opening, but I would recommend it to someone with a background in history or politics.",
    "I would recommend this course to every Global Affairs student, for sure. I also think it could be very useful for anyone in International History. But if you study global affairs, you should 100% take this course!",
    "Making of a Connected World covers an extensive range of material. Different students will struggle with different parts, depending on which time periods they are familiar with. There are quite a number of pages to read each week, but the readings are not dense and provide many different perspectives. I strongly recommend this class. It was one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale. You come away with more knowledge and more questions than you entered the class with.",
    "This is an easy course with an engaging professor. The course is entirely based on readings, roughly 300-400 pages a week, and then class discussion, so if that is your ideal course then by all means take it. I did about half of the readings each week and still contributed to the discussion, he never quizzes you on them. For the final paper - the class grade is made up of 40% participation which seems to come from attendance, not what you actually say, and 60% final paper - he lets you write a research paper or book review or really any scholarly work that you want to do. I did a book review and chose a book I had read before and really liked so I knew I would be motivated to write about it. All in all I would recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "Highly relevant for Global Affairs students. In fact, this would be a superb class to require for Jackson MA students (adapted, of course, based on size). I learned a tremendous amount.",
    "This course was a very effective capstone to my graduate studies which allowed me to integrate and apply many of the learnings with to regard to global order that I had accumulated along the way.",
    "It expanded my knowledge on the field of globalization, and helped me to realize some of the underpinnings of the term and the phenomenon, which is helpful for my research.",
    "The readings were mostly interesting and I felt that I learned quite a bit about the history of diplomacy, empire, nationalism and statecraft in Europe (it focuses mostly on Europe with the U.S., Africa and Asia making guest appearances every so often). I'm not doing dissertation research so that doesn't apply."
