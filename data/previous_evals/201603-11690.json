   "comments": [
    "About spanish language, vocabulary, grammar, and culture",
    "I have gained a great understanding of the elementary aspects of the spanish language. My grammar and vocabulary have strengthened considerably throughout the course. I do believe that I am able to better communicate in this language due to my enrollment in this level of spanish this semester.",
    "I learned more Spanish and became more proficient.",
    "Improved Spanish speaking and writing skills. Lots of good grammar practice.",
    "Taking this course greatly expanded my repertoire of verbs and grammatical structures as well as my vocabulary. We also learned a lot about culture through class presentations. Profesora Asensio gave me a reason to look forward to the following spanish classes apart from completing the language requirement. This class also taught me that confidence is key, since being able to converse without pausing and stumbling is a decent part of your grade in this class. A lot of other language classes focus more on writing and grammar rather than conversing with classmates and the professor, and I think this class did a very good job of balancing the two. Finally, Profesora Asensio showed our class that learning spanish can be a lot of fun. She always kept the conversations interesting, even when the subject of conversation wasn't a chapter from the book or anything about spanish culture. I often caught myself continuing to speak to people in spanish after the bell because of how immersive her class was.",
    "I learned so much in this course. I could really feel myself improving in writing, reading, and speaking Spanish through the duration the course and it was very rewarding for me. I enjoyed the small class size and the workload.",
    "My ability to write and read Spanish fluidly increased greatly and I began to feel more comfortable using the language in conversation"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Teacher was great and tried to make class fun. Yet also this class is limited by that most people taking it are because they have to fulfill a language requirement and perhaps do not have a passion for spanish and thus engagement with the content is limited inherently by lack of interest in the material.",
    "Maria Pilar Asensio-Manrique is a wonderful human and educator and my dislike for the language requirement should in no way reflect on her teaching. I just think it's really, really unfair that different people have to complete different amounts of language. It unfairly disadvantages peole who want to double major, or who want to complete premed or prevet or predental requirements and need to fit in classes. I can see having a language requirement, it's important. But it should be the same number of semesters for everybody. It's not my fault my high school was a poor public school with a weak language program. I shouldn't be punished for my background, and with the current structure I am.",
    "Strengths are emphasis on speaking and role play which helps develop speaking skills. Weaknesses are the emphasis on vocabulary which is more wrote memory than actual knowledge.",
    "This class is a very good spanish class to start with, unless you are not familiar with spanish at all (then maybe go with L1). It does a great job of teaching a variety of vocabulary, grammar, and culture without overwhelming students with work, as some language classes can. However, a lot of the homework is very repetitive and some of the activities assigned as homework are not the best use of time. The grammar questions on tests and quizzes are much harder than some of the homework assignments some of the time, which should not be the case. The weighted distribution of grades definitely isn't proportional to the amount of time spent towards each category (test, quiz, homework, oral exams, etc.) and that should be adjusted to make up for this. The flash cultura homework assignments take a decent amount of time to do (or do well) but don't count for too much gradewise. The movie assignment at the end of the course also took a long time and hardly counted for any grade at all. These complaints are all I could think of, and they're really not that big of a deal. I really enjoyed this course and would take it again pretty much the exact same way it is now (that includes with Profesora Asensio).",
    "It was a very interactive course with a great professor!",
    "I don't really have any complaints or recommendations for the course. Though some assignments\/projects were challenging and not exactly enjoyable, they all benefitted my knowledge of the language."

   "comments": [
    "Fairly good class overall, would recommend if you have to fulfill a language requirement. Interesting activities as well.",
    "Highly recommend. Pilar was an excellent professor and a really kind, fun person. I thoroughly enjoyed the class because I took it with her as the instructor.",
    "Good course if you want to continue improving your Spanish skills. Pretty typical Spanish class. Professor Asensio is good.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend taking this class. Especially if you haven't seen spanish since junior year of high school like me, it really helps clean up your use of the language in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Even though there is homework pretty much every night of the week, it never takes too long and much of it doesn't require too much brainpower. Learning a language is all about seeing the same stuff over and over again until you know it well enough to speak it confidently. This can be boring at times, but Profesora Asensio does a great job of keeping the class interesting (even if you're just trying to get your language requirement out of the way). Profesora Asensio is definitely the professor to have, and she will do whatever it takes to see you succeed in her class as long as you show that you care too. She genuinely cares about your education but definitely isn't looking to make a point by dropping everyone's grades. 10\/10, will come back for more",
    "Yes. If you want to learn how to speak Spanish, this is a fun course that teaches introductory grammar and vocab.",
    "I would recommend this course and this instructor. I enjoyed coming to class everyday and I was very engaged in learning."
