    "If you are not interested in philosophy, I do not recommend this course. If you are looking for an extra course to take just for fun, I would recommend it, but it did fall below my expectations to some degree.",
    "This was a really pleasant and rewarding seminar. It covered a huge range of classical literature, from Aristotle to Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and Holocaust testimonials. It was really interesting to evaluate each reading in relation to the others, naturally comparing the different ideas and using some authors to inform our understanding of the others. Class discussions were lively and engaging; I really felt like I was getting to some deeper truth or understanding through the discussions. The essay topics were guided but left pretty broad, so it was nice to be able to develop an essay topic leisurely as we progressed through the readings and then to explore it more in depth through writing the essay. The Holocaust component at the end is really interesting, like a challenge to explain or understand one of the most extreme examples of inexplicable and broken down and resilient character, using the repertoire of philosophies wed learned. Overall a really cool and fun course, not too much of a workload, and accessible to me as a senior chemical engineering major. Prof. Thompson was a delight.",
    "I would recommend The Making of Character to another student. We read important texts, and it is interesting and rare to find a class that looks at both literature and philosophy together. It felt often as if there was little guiding force in our discussions we got lost in the individual texts and seemed to forget the overriding theme of \"The Making of Character\" in favor of just looking at texts as individual pieces in a general lit or philosophy class. Professor Thompson is lovely, though, and with a group of students who are willing to really engage with the reading, this class could be really exceptional! Lots and lots of reading, but few actual assignments, and the essays are very open-ended and therefore gave us a lot of room to explore what interested us.",
    "An interdisciplinary investigation of an important question: how is character, or the human soul, formed and changed. This is a true Humanities class in that it is highly interdisciplinary and it looks at these questions through a humanistic lens, as opposed to through the sciences of psychology or sociology.",
    "The course is a survey of modes of interpreting character across genres, time periods, and places: it is almost solely about analysis of texts (rather than forming one's own beliefs about character). I would recommend it: the texts are enough reason to take the course, and the instructor has enough anecdotes and insights about the texts to make discussion palatable.",
    "I definitely recommend the class. The syllabus is varied and comes together well with the central question of character formation. This was my first exposure to philosophical texts, and I'm glad I chose this seminar over a fast paced lecture course. The Holocaust material was a great challenge, and motivated some of the most thoughtful, intense, and difficult discussion I've had at Yale. Prof Thompson is great at prompting each student to contribute."
