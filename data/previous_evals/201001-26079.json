    "I would recommend it.",
    "Great course for a beginning student to learn about foundational literature.",
    "The course was generally worth-while. Useful for an early graduate student in ecology, but by no means a can't miss course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend reading the Foundations book to other students. This course, with some slight modifications, is as good of a forum as any to do that.",
    "I'd recommend the course to students who were interested in discussing as much as in reading and synthesizing. It's a useful course as much for the interaction with students working on disparate systems as it is for considering seminal papers in the field.",
    "I think it was a decent course, but would suggest it only if there was more structure in the future, especially if the student desired a broad review of ecological literature and concepts.",
    "The class was a great opportunity to read classic papers in ecology.",
    "I would say, \"We read classical ecology literature that is complemented by a modern paper and discuss the novel, confusing, etc. concepts, diagrams, and methods of data presentation of both papers.\"I would recommend this class only after the themed weeks had been organized and implemented into the syllabus."

    "Gave a good background on the field of ecology. Will aid in my formation of my dissertation.",
    "I read some classic papers that I would not have read otherwise, may be useful in future teaching or discussion of classic topics in ecology.",
    "I think the assignment at the end of the course to write a grant proposal in a NSF DDIG format was a useful exercise and was helpful in my studies\/dissertation work.",
    "This course made me realize how many other spectra of ecology there are, especially those being intensely studied at Yale. It gave me an appreciation of the breath and depth of the field. The course introduced me to important concepts that I will have to resolve in my dissertation research."
