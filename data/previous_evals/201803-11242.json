    "We learned a ton not only about our research topic, but also on how to plan out a long-term research project, work together as a team, and pull together a paper and presentations that sounded cohesive despite being written by 7 different people.",
    "Real world consulting skills, working with clients and working within a team setting to develop recommendations and policy research for the United States Military.",
    "I learned an immense amount about CVE in Southeast Asia, how violence affects women, and what countries are doing to solve these problems. I learned more about how the United States military and other agencies work together and how they are structured. I improved my teamwork skills. I improved my presentation\/public speaking skills.",
    "Learned about the intricacies and difficulties of creating effective military policy; the role of different stakeholders and priorities; U.S. Dept of Defense and U.S. Dept of State's current stance on countering violent extremism and WPS activity as a whole and in S.E. Asia. Also, with the help of Admiral Weigold and our partners at PACOM, learned about the complexities of the military and the different operating units."

   "comments": [
    "I think the strength of our capstone was really the people in it, who all took initiative to do the work necessary to move the capstone along. I think one area that could be improved is in the weekly class meetings - it would have been great if we were asked what sorts of topics or even specific speakers would be helpful at our stage in research. Overall, though, we gleaned a lot of information from the speakers that were phoned in.",
    "The project was fluid which was the strength and weakness of the case; it was good that we had some control, but over the course of the semester, our research focus shifted many times, which was confusing",
    "The strengths are the team aspect, the ability to travel for research, the access to important intellectuals within the military and civil society, the focus on real world skills. I felt that I was doing real work and getting an introduction to life after college. I think the main weakness is that I'm not sure how my work will be implemented by the client. We have handed off our recommendations and I feel that this is the last I'm going to hear about them.",
    "Strengths: trip to Hawaii; ability to interact with professionals both in the military and government (thanks to Adm. Weigold's network); Admiral Weigold's flexibility and availability to chat even on weekends and evenings Weaknesses\/Improvements: (1) I think one of the most resounding weaknesses of this class was the fact that Admiral Weigold did not have direct experience or knowledge on this subject matter (violent extremism in Southeast Asia). Other capstone groups had an advisor who was a subject matter expert, which would have certainly been helpful for this class. However, Admiral Weigold was good about connecting us to folks in the military or government who were experts. It seems like Weigold was chosen due to his connection to the military\/PACOM, not necessarily the subject matter. At times, I felt like our capstone group was used as part of a larger marketing\/development strategy to develop a more robust relationship between Yale University and PACOM. (2) This course was one of the most disorganized I have ever taken, particularly in the middle of the course when the trip to Hawaii was approaching. Initially, in the beginning of the semester, we were all told that we would be going on the client trip to Hawaii since there was sufficient funding from Jackson AND from our client. A few days before the trip, we were told, just kidding our client is not giving us funding after alland only a select few group of students would be allowed on the trip. This caused a lot of avoidable stress, since by this point many of us had NOT made alternative October break plans since we all thought we would be going to the client site. This culminated in a rather chaotic and dramatic evening in WLH when we were trying to figure out exactly whoand how manywould be going on the trip given the budget. This entire situation could have been avoided if there was better communication earlier on regarding the amount of funding available, especially on the client side. Additionally, another point of disorganization for the course was that there was no structure. I understand Admiral Weigold's reasoning of not wanting to provide a syllabus, but too little\/no structure at all is also bad. Many of the times, the speakers that were teleconferenced in weren't necessarily relevant to the project; or just didn't fit in given where we were in the project. (3) There were many, many technical issues throughout the course, related to teleconferencing clients\/guest speakers in; microphone volume in the room; poor connection. I think these could have been avoided through greater technical oversight from Jackson."

    "Obviously the capstone is necessary for Global Affairs majors, but as advice, I would just say to pick a topic you're genuinely interested in and make sure that you have a cohesive team structure in the beginning that'll give everyone an equal amount of work.",
    "Requirement for global",
    "This question does not seem immensely relevant as I imagine it is unlikely this capstone assignment will be available again in this exact iteration. However, I would recommend working for PACOM as it is an incredibly important organization, and your recommendations can have a massive impact on US policy. I also recommend projects related to CVE, as terrorism is a rising threat and extremely interesting to study.",
    "A capstone project is required for Global Affairs major, but I would urge rising seniors to be careful in their rankings. Ask your senior friends which projects or advisors to avoid and which to rank highly. Rank your preferences based on advisors, and ideally the advisor should be a subject expert in that field (a quick Google search can reveal whether this is the case). Perhaps even get coffee or schedule calls with potential project advisors to see if it's a suitable fit."
