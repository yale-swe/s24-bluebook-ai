    "This course covers a tremendous amount of topics, and unless you have already taken AP Physics, it is very difficult to follow. If you actually the type of student this course is designed for---no physics background, algebra background only---this class will be hard, and you will not have the benefit of a generous curve. Most of the other students have taken physics in high school, and the professors have a hard time making the class interesting enough for them while basic enough for everyone else. If you're thinking about taking this, you should just take \"real\" intro physics.That being said, Professors Demers and Golling are very passionate about their subject and their students. They're very nice and accessible, and in that sense, this course is very different from other intro-level courses.",
    "I think this is not a hard physics course.However, I was part of the minority in the class that didn't take physics in high school. Since the majority of the class did, I think the profs just thought we all caught on very fast. Therefore the class moved on from topic to topic quite quickly, and I ended up basically teaching myself the course. However, if you are diligent about the 'optional' readings, and make yourself do more exercises than the p-sets require, do take this course, especially if physics is something you're interested in. And, if you are one of the ones who didn't take physics in high school, don't be scared to do this course, I just recommend getting the textbook from the library and reading the first few chapters during shopping period",
    "Yes, but its not a really easy class.",
    "This is the guttiest class I've ever encountered at Yale. Definitely take it if you want a no-brainer Sc, but if you actually want to learn physics, don't bother.",
    "I thought I hated physics and I thought science was stupid until I took this class. Now I really like physics and I think I finally understand what science is about and what it is for. I was just looking to fill a science requirement, but I feel like my mind and even my world have opened up! I hope this happens to you, but you should definitely take the class (especially if Sarah is teaching it next year, which I think she is, and especially if you think you don't like or are scared of physics).",
    "This course was a little frustrating. The material is very, very interesting, but you cover it on a level that is both too trivial and superficial to make it really worthwhile. The classic physics that you cover (like Newton's laws and momentum) are good things to know, but the math and conceptual understanding you are expected to demonstrate rarely exceeds \"multiply these two numbers together\" or \"do objects fall at the same rate?\". When you get into modern physics, you get no deeper into the material than cocktail party level understanding, and maybe just enough to embarrass yourself at a cocktail party.I am a humanities major with very little math ability, but I would have liked to be challenged a little more by this course. It is hard to sit through a lecture or read a textbook that is painfully simple and makes you feel like you're in 8th grade again. Most of the points I lost on the problem sets were for a lack of elaboration on things that are painfully obvious and too trivial to be worth rehashing in an answer.If the professors make this course a little more challenging, it has a lot of potential as a science course designed for non-science majors. As is, though, even humanities people will find it frustratingly easy. I would recommend a more challenging course that will teach you that same type of material and improve your mathematical\/scientific reasoning a bit more, like The Technological World, which my roommate says is similar but more difficult.",
    "Great sci for non sci majors i recommend it to everyone, even if you're not entirely into physics",
    "Well, this course is hit and miss. So, there were 2 instructors, alternating every few weeks. What this meant was a break in continuity, and distraction. Also, this wasn't a very organized course in terms of structure. We almost never had to use clickers except for a couple of times, and there were no make-up classes for the ones missed (and there were many). Maybe that's because the professors were often doing things for CERN, and not in New Haven.In terms of content, this course pretty much covers it all from Classical Physics to stuff scientists are doing right now. However, the math is really easy, and doable. The psets and stuff in the midterm and final were lifted off the textbook - it was really evident that the instructors weren't really interested in putting in much effort for challenging us.Well, apart from that, Professors Demers and Golling were mostly good, and made interesting powerpoints. However, they were not very available over email (probably because they were traveling). I liked the cloud chamber experiment by Professor Demers, which was pretty cool.If you're looking for a gut science credit, this is the one. If you want something more challenging, look for something else.",
    "I would definitely recommend Physics 110 to a non-science major looking for a science credit. It is an interesting class and you get to learn about serious physics but in a way that is manageable for a non-science major.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this class. If you've taken physics before, you've had all this material before, but I guarantee it was presented in a way that was 1000x more organized. Neither professor was particularly good, although Professor Demers is at least very kind and approachable, but you won't learn much physics, you will get inordinately stressed around exams because you don't know what you're doing, lecture will make you want to shoot yourself, and it's really just a huge waste of life.",
    "This is a good class if you have some knowledge of physics, but not much of modern physics (particle physics, special relativity etc). It is not a good class if you are interested in doing lots of plug-and-chug questions--it focuses mainly on concepts. I feel like I have a much greater appreciation for physics in my everyday life after having taken this course.",
    "Physics 110 is a basic introductory course. The nice thing about the course is it does not require you to be great at math. However, while some of the topics are a little confusing toward the end, the workload is not too bad. If you need a science credit and took high school physics this class will be great.",
    "Great easy science credit if you've taken some physics before. Might be slightly harder if you have not but the book is very clear and helpful explaining the concepts.",
    "You need a science credit and you don't want to seem dumb to science majors. Take this. Not a gut, but you learn something."
