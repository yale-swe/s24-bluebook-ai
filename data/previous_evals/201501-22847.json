    "If you're interested in contemporary theater, or think you MIGHT be, take it!",
    "Theater Now is a seminar that looks at contemporary American and British plays. Get ready for some WEIRD readings- these are plays written in the last year or two, so they're very experimental and \"out there.\" If that's not your scene, you won't enjoy this. Also do not fall under the impression that this is an English class: it is listed as an English junior seminar and cross-listed under the Theater Studies department, but the class is composed of mainly theater studies majors and if you're an English major without any background in theater, you'll probably feel lost. That said, it's a very interesting class and you'll definitely get something out of it!",
    "Be there or be square.",
    "This class was okay. The seminar needs much stronger organization - we just bounced around a lot, and hence the course didn't create an interesting narrative arc about what characterizes theater now (which I found especially frustrating as a non THST major). We read some cool plays, but I feel like we would have been able to delve into themes deeper if certain works had been paired together. The class took a trip to NYC, where we saw a phenomenal play - so that was a plus. The reading load was also too much per week and prohibited meaningful discussion of some works.",
    "I'd recommend this class only to someone who is interested in experimental theater from a text-based perspective. We looked at some really cool and interesting stuff, but all of it was pretty out there and I could definitely see the assigned plays being alienating to students who aren't excited by that."
