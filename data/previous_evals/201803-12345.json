    "Learned about new fields, new labs, new methods, etc. We also got insight into the lab so we can consider if we want to join or not.",
    "It was good but I think starting a little earlier and having 7 week rotations would've benefitted everyone.",
    "I learned a lot of experimental skills during lab rotations, for examples, protein purifications, FACS cell-sorting, immuno-precipitation assays, etc. I gave rotation talks and practiced my presentation skills. And I learned to design experiments to study biological questions and practiced critical thinking skills.",
    "How to work in a lab",
    "I learned a lot about the labs that I was working in. Additionally, this was my first time working with RNA so I was excited to learn about how that research progresses.",
    "I rotated in the Koelle lab and the S. Ferguson lab. Both rotations allowed me to cultivate new skills and grow as a researcher. I explored research topics that were completely new to me. While I felt challenged, I felt very welcomed and encouraged in both labs and both labs were a positive experience. I have never worked extensively with light microscopes before, but both labs allowed me to get familiarized with confocal microscopy. In addition, I was able to get familiar working with c. elegans and cells in the Koelle and the S. Ferguson lab, respectively,"

   "comments": [
    "The second rotation seemed a bit rushed, especially with exams falling on the last week of the rotation. Maybe starting the first rotation a week earlier so the second one can start a week earlier would be beneficial.",
    "Strengths: Very effective in research training. I learned a lot of experimental skills and strategies in experiment designs. I hope each rotation could be longer (>8 weeks).",
    "off-rotation should not be a required thing",
    "I thought that 6 weeks was enough time, but it would have been nice to have a little longer in each rotation. Additionally, the last rotation talk was scheduled a little early initially and while I understand that you don't want to overload finals week with an extra presentation, I thought that adding the extra week before the talk was helpful.",
    "I feel that the rotations are set up to function as optimally as possible, in terms of length of duration and time requirement during the week. Both labs were respectful of the fact that first semester grad students also have classes to balance as well.",
    "Rotations should be a bit longer. Not much can be done in this time, between taking classes."
