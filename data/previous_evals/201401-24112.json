   "comments": [
    "good class",
    "Strengths: real world examples, external lecturersWeaknesses: students should be more involved (e.g. group work)",
    "Excellent. Very nice to hear from industry experts.",
    "The strengths of this course were the guest lectures. It was very useful to hear about regulatory affairs from other professionals in the field. One weakness of the course is that the lectures were not always engaging.",
    "Disappointment",
    "I came in genuinely interested in regulatory affairs and left with absolutely no interest. The course was disorganized, covered inconsistent material and students had absolutely no incentive to attend class.",
    "Strengths: There is no other course like this at YSPH and maybe even the university, so for that reason it's a good class. I also liked that the professor tried to bring in some speakers, even outside of class time, for us to learn more about the industry. I like that the tests are open book, open note.Weaknesses: I'm not sure if this is something that can really be changed, but the material is really dry at times. I wish there was a way to make it more interesting.",
    "Professor is not receptive to student response and input. Lecture is very one sided.",
    "strengths: I like how different speakers in the field came to talk so I can learn how it is like in the real world. Please keep on doing this!weaknesses: please be more clear on the expectation of the exams. Some questions are tricky and not well covered in class.",
    "Overall I thought that this course was very informative and I learned a lot. One thing that I found frustrating was that the course sometimes felt unorganized. For example, we covered non-inferiority trials 2 different times and were given a draft guidance to read on them. I felt that instead of repeating things already covered we could have discussed a few more things from the book that were never mentioned in class at all.",
    "The instructor is a very nice person who wants to teach and have everyone do well, but what he teaches has no bearing at all on what's on the test, which is silly. The textbook used to teach the course is written in such a way that you don't recall what you read as it is over technical. Many of us left the class not really informed of regulatory affairs or what the most important things were from the class. The guest lecturers were highlights of the course.",
    "The course is very practical, and provides good insight into the topic. I particularly liked the approach of having many invited speakers to give lectures as part of the course.",
    "It gave a big picture of how FDA works, but students will be easier to learn that if it's delivered in a more systematic way.",
    "very useful coursetoo much information for one semester though",
    "Course material was interesting, lectures poorly structured. Still feel like I learned a lot about the regulatory system."

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr Makuch is very knowledgeable about regulatory affairs and brings a lot of experience to the class. In the future he can try to increase student participation in the course.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0The instructor doesn't do much",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Completely unavailable via email. Often was not available during post office hours. Very nice and pleasant, but seemed scattered.One instance that sits with me is we had a speaker from a pharmaceutical company come in and no one was there to introduce her or assist her, neither the TA or professor. She stumbled upon the correct room almost by accident and needed a student from the course to help her login to the computer to give her presentation. This just did not sit well with me.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0He's a good teacher. You can tell he is very knowledgeable about the subject and the internal politics of the FDA and other agencies. Sometimes he goes off on tangents that seem irrelevant, but overall he's a good professor.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Very good. I like all the stories and examples of how drug evaluation\/development is like in the real world.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0I thought that Professor Makuch was a good instructor and his passion for the topic was obvious. My only issue was that we went off on a lot of tangents, and while I felt like the tangents were useful many times, sometimes we went off to the same tangents during multiple classes and I thought that time could maybe have been better used.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Please see above",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is a very knowledgable and great instructor. I like that he structures the course in a flexible way, and focuses on very practical aspects of regulatory affairs.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Knowledgeable and interesting professor.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Good overall, great personality and really cares. Needs help in being more organized with course."
