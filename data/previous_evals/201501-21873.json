   "comments": [
    "You're probably taking this class in order to fulfill an E&EB requirement. It's hard. The lab final is comprehensive (200 scientific names of fish). That being said the specimens are cool and the lab atmosphere is nice and chill.",
    "A lot of memorization but fun to learn",
    "Good course, but requires a lot of memorization.",
    "Harder than any lab you will ever take, and one of the harder classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "If you really like fish and you want to learn to identify fish, this is a great class. This class works great with the main lecture. But be aware that you need to memorize a lot of order and family names of fish.",
    "One of the more difficult organismal classes at Yale (there are four) -- you'll need to memorize, and learn to identify on sight, 150 families of fish within about 40 orders, in addition to about 50 individual species. Yes, that is as hard as it sounds. The upside is that you'll learn a massive amount about the fish of the world, and if you're up for the workload, this is a great survey course.",
    "You probably won't get into the lab if you aren't an E&EB major, since there's quite a lot of demand. However, the lab itself is quite good, and provides a really useful context for what we learn in lecture. It also gives you a deeper understanding of the diversity of fishes, their taxonomy, and how they're put together. Though the practical at the end was quite difficult, it was overall a useful and interesting lab.",
    "E&EB 265L is a great way for students to get a hands-on approach while studying fish, and especially while taking the accompanying Ichthyology class. You get to look at some pretty cool specimens from the Peabody Collections, including a famous Coelacanth specimen. There is a lot of material because we cover ALL of the families of fish, but I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It was highly informative and is unique due to the Peabody aspect of the course.",
    "Ichthyology Lab is pretty fun. If you love fish or are interested in animals in general, learning identifications and the breadth of biodiversity is very interesting. It can be a bit boring at times just because it can seem like rote memorization, but at the end you'll discover that you've learned a lot. It's definitely not too stressful, although there's a lot to memorize sometimes. If you take it in the fall, you'll also get the chance to go on field trips, which will be fun; in the spring we didn't get to do this."
