    "This class is great! I honestly can't think of anything that needs to be improved.",
    "The course is great in introducing students to advanced Indonesian language usage, specifically in the context of expressing opinions, arguments, and formal writing. I do think improvements could be made in having a syllabus that outlined the timeline of the course as well as what textbooks could be supplemental for students. At times, I felt that there was no where to find such supplements, leaving students to feel very on their own in terms of learning the language. Thought the professor is always a wonderful resource, I would like to have had a textbook for the course.",
    "It was slightly disorganized because we had a different person from Indonesia teaching many of the classes and it was unclear when assignments were due and to whom we should hand them in to.",
    "It's fun but disorganized.",
    "Strengths: Improved our grammar, reading and writing skills Weakness: Organization of class could be improved."

    "As this is an Advanced Indonesian course, I would only recommend it to the student who is willing to put in a lot of effort for the self-discipline required to succeed in this course. All too often, students rely on the internet to learn the language. For a student to truly succeed, a genuine desire to learn as well as the extra effort can make this course all the while better for anyone who wants to see improvement in the language.",
    "I would recommend this class because I love Indo and the professors are great. The people in the class are nice and the atmosphere is fun.",
    "If someone wants to further learn the Indonesian language, take it."
