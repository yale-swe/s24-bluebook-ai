   "comments": [
    "This course helped me focus on my critical analysis of historical texts and the purposes of their authors. It enabled me to write well-constructed, concise argumentative papers to defend a specific thesis.",
    "We learned the historical and political thought process of great thinkers from Thucydides to Machiavelli by reading primary sources. I also think this class was one of the two that led the most to improvement in my ability to participate in sections. My writing abilities were also developed by this course, as was my ability to critically interpret an author's view on a certain subject by comparing what he wrote in several different parts of a text.",
    "I learned how to study classical history and glean important political conclusions from them. I learned how to not only manage reading a large amount of material -- but how to really engage with the material in group discussions.",
    "i learned about historical methods and political theories, and developed better writing and analyticial skills.",
    "Certainly developed reading abilities, and I gained insights into placing texts in historical sequence in dialogue with each other",
    "General survey of major historical works and works in political theory from antiquity to the middle ages.",
    "My abilities to read comprehend and analyze ancient texts and discuss the different interpretations amongst a small group of people.",
    "I learned how to read quickly and discuss.",
    "Critical reading skills, primary source reading"

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are in the seminar setting where the main points of interest in significant historical and political works can be discussed openly. The instructor makes it a very question-friendly environment. The weaknesses are in the vast amount of material to cover to cover, so one will never get everything into their mind despite all effort. The discussions can occasionally be free-range without much direction.",
    "While literature and philosophy had clear indications of how one was supposed to write the essay, H&P often felt like guesswork. It would have been nice to have a bit more guidance on the essays beforehand. We talked in section about how we would sometimes read short excerpts from a book (this actually applies to all DS sections) and would have to buy the entire book for that. If possible, the course should provide PDFs in those cases (such as with Al-Farabi and Maimonides). There was some overlap with philosophy regarding Plato. Personally, I think it was fine, but I do think that the time we spent on Plato was a bit excessive and could have been better spent on Cicero or another thinker.",
    "I thought the selections of the texts were a big strength for this course. However, a weakness (which is also attributed in general to the directed studies program) is that we were reading so much material, that I feel that I only previewed a minimal amount of some texts -- and so only got a superficial understanding of its political and historical significance.",
    "I thought the course was very interesting overall, though sometimes material wasn't presented in a very engaging manner. Also, I thought a few parts of the assigned reading on the syllabus didn't really relate to the course as a whole.",
    "A strength was that our instructor kept dialogue on track by making sure that we address multiple parts of the text each seminar Also, our instructor was VERY accessible outside of class",
    "This course is very well taught and organized. Everything ran smoothly and the selection of works was pretty good, although some Cicero would not have gone amiss, perhaps in place of Polybius or someone. I had Dan (aka Prof. Luban), who consistently led interesting, informal discussions. While he was a new professor and has not yet ascended to the ranks of DS all-star legends, I have no doubt he'll get there given a few years.",
    "Strengths: - accomplishes all of the goals it sought to. - engaged many in class Weaknesses: -level of engagement could have been more enthusiastic. Overall was a great section.",
    "The volume of reading was extreme when it was impossible to discuss the works entirely or wholly in class. However, many of the readings were very interesting."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone interested in history or political science majors as well as students interested in classical history of the Greco-Roman era.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning about the foundation of historical and political thought in Western society today. One really sees through these authors how Rome and Greeece have affected the US by reading authors such as Livy and Polybius.",
    "I would -- if they are interested in learning about classical historical and political thought. It is a LOT of reading and writing -- so if you are not passionate about the material -- it is not a very enjoyable experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I had gone into Directed Studies expecting H&P to be my least favorite class, but Professor Luban made it very interesting and fun.",
    "Yes; Directed Studies as a whole is not an experience one will regret",
    "Yes! Definitely take DS if you're a freshman who's at all interested in the humanities.",
    "Yes. All who have the opportunity to do directed studies should do so.",
    "For the DS classes this might have been the hardest to get through the reading for because it was pretty long (unlike some of the Philosophy readings) and could be pretty disjointed (unlike the Lit books). It was sometimes hard to understand the point of all the readings and to grasp the authors' holistic themes or perspectives."
