    "Broad understanding of economic growth in the long-run and short-run economic fluctuations.",
    "This course teaches a broad overview of macroeconomics, including GDP, the basics of development, money and banking, and recessions. The discussion of the Great Recession was fascinating. As someone who has not been focused on economics, this course was invaluable to add to my ability to analyze how the economics situation and economic events influence domestic and international politics and to able to spot the mistakes in how economics and economic events are portrayed by non-experts like elected officials, most media, and people in general, and the problems that arise from that.",
    "This is a great intro to macro class. The fundamentals are covered, alongside real world application (ie European debt crisis). The pace was extremely manageable, but you walk away with a good basis to build upon.",
    "Tons! GDP, banks, money, long-term growth, short-term growth, the relationship between the two, the financial crisis, inflation, interest rates, etc."

   "comments": [
    "Course strengths include excellent teacher and focusing on concepts and understanding broad policy issues instead of math. For suggestions for improvement, I felt that the pace of the course was at times a bit rushed towards the end of the semester. So I might have spent a little less time earlier for instance on the definition of money and economic growth in Europe v. Africa\/China.",
    "I thought it was a very good course for non-economists. I would not change it.",
    "NA - I thought the class was extremely well done!",
    "This was a fantastic course that was incredibly relevant to any global affairs student. Sometimes the problem sets did not align with the material gone over in class, you often had to read the text point to answer the questions."

    "Yes -- excellent instructors and good coverage of key policy issues in macroeconomics.",
    "Would highly recommend",
    "I highly recommend this course! If you're looking for a macro refresher or a first time intro, this class will cover all the basics so that you have a strong foundation.",
    "Yes. Marnix does a great job of teaching, using real-world examples, and explaining macroeconomics. I would HIGHLY recommend this class with the caveat that you will have to do outside reading of the text book to make it through the problem sets and quizzes."
