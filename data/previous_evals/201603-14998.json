   "comments": [
    "I gained so few skills from this class. It was honestly such a waste of my time. There are classes that are easy workloads, but you still learn things. This was not worth my time.",
    "I learned so much about emotions and their importance in this course. The material was so innovative and applicable to everyday life.",
    "In this class, I learned so much about not only myself but also why other people act the way that they do and what this means and how to control it. This class really left me feeling like I have a better grasp on how to handle my emotions, assess situations and use these skills to improve my relationships with others.",
    "Literally the best class I've taken at Yale so far. We learned a lot about Emotional Intelligence and the skills required to be emotionally intelligent. Everything I learned in this class is very applicable to my life and I am a better person after taking it.",
    "I feel like this class is the only one I've taken at Yale that truly has impacted my behavior and my daily life. Although all the theoretical things are a bit lofty for me, the on-the-ground emotional regulation stuff has completely turned my life around. I've cried in this class at least twice because of how it's just cut me to the core. I've even started telling people about the techniques I learned in there, like I'm some sort of shill for the YCEI. Maybe I am!",
    "I learned a lot about managing emotions. This course actually made me become more aware about my emotions in highly-emotional situations, and helped me become better at managing, expressing, and understanding emotions.",
    "This class allowed me to make my mental wellbeing a priority and I am so beyond grateful for that. I really learned how to regulate and handle my emotional responses to stressful times, etc. It was very informative, psychology wise, but also something I can absolutely apply to my daily life. I have become an overall much happier, productive, engaged person because of this class.",
    "Will really improve your emotional intelligence ability and I would suggest to anyone to take this class!",
    "I think that through this class I have learned a lot more about myself and my own emotions than anything else, which I believe was Brackett's goal for the course. I also learned a good bit about how education policy is currently failing to address emotional development for children and how this is a travesty. I think that I became more emotionally intelligent through this class, especially with the idea of the meta-moment - it's something that I take into my life all the time. Same goes for positive reappraisal and positive self-talk, although implementing those is a work in progress.",
    "I learned that emotions matter and the idealistic method of controlling ones emotions basically restated a million times throughout the semester.",
    "I learned about the ways to implement social and emotional learning in classrooms, but that was about it. I feel like I really didn't learn much else throughout the semester. Much of the material was redundant and unnecessary.",
    "I learned about emotions' importance to our lives, and RULER.",
    "Most of the material in this class is really intuitive stuff and could be covered in a lot less time, but you do learn a lot about yourself\/emotions that you probably wouldn't ever explicitly find out if you didn't take it. It's definitely cool stuff",
    "I learned about the field of Emotional Intelligence - the different approaches to measuring it, what an emotion is, different theories about emotions, etc.",
    "I learned a ton in this class. I didn't think I would but it has been one of the most helpful classes during my time at Yale. I learned how to properly address certain situations and emotions and I feel more mentally stable because of it.",
    "I learned how Emotional Intelligence pertains to my everyday life and how to best recognize and manage both mine and others emotions.",
    "I didn't know anything about emotional intelligence before so pretty much everything I learned about that was new.",
    "I have definitely acquired understandings, skills, and strategies in being more emotionally intelligent. More specifically, I have gained a better understanding on how to deal with high levels of anxiety, place difficulties into perspective, and expanded my emotion vocabulary.",
    "Develop social emotional learning and intelligence. Self awareness, self management, social awareness, decision making skills, and relationship management. A class to make you do well in life and really strengthen how you are as a person and live your life to have your emotions benefit the situation in the best way possible. Extraordinarily useful knowledge.",
    "I developed knowledge on emotion regulation and understanding.",
    "I learned what emotions are, the effects of emotions, what emotional intelligence is, how to test it, and how to teach it in schools. I would say the things that I learned were more broad rather than specific. I also practiced my writing skills with the final essay.",
    "Like Professor Brackett said in the first class, Psyc 151 is really meant to teach you how to be more emotionally intelligent in everyday life and a majority of the lectures are dedicated to activities applying some of the EI lessons to our own lives. These are nice if you take them seriously (which I didn't always do), and they make for easy lectures. You also learn a decent amount about what it means to be emotionally intelligent and how we are currently teaching emotional intelligence in schools.",
    "This semester I've learned how to increase my emotional intelligence through the acronym RULER. I'm learned what the field entails, how it got started, how it is measured, and how you can master your emotions. This is one of the classes at Yale that you must take. It's not a traditional class, and pushes your growth in areas that normally aren't touched upon in Yale classes.",
    "I learned about the vocabulary of emotional intelligence. I also learned about Social and emotional learning implementation in the United States to promote emotional intelligence in schools.",
    "This not only taught me everything about Emotional Intelligence from its definition, to methods of Social Emotional Learning, to the science behind the methodology, but mostly how to improve my own Emotional Intelligence by developing personal skillsets. I now know that emotions are malleable and have the skills to recognize, understand, label, express, and regulate emotions in myself and others.",
    "From this course you can learn as much or as little as you want. Depends on how regularly you attend class and how often you use the techniques and material you learn in class. It's a useful class to take because you get to develop some skills that are useful for your lifetime. The class is overall really easy. 2 exams and 1 paper. The first exam gave us an option of attempting any 40\/50 questions so it worked well even if you hadn't done the readings (but you should still do them)! Take this class. You won't regret it,",
    "We learned about the importance of educating young students in the areas of social and emotional learning. We also learned that we're not as emotionally intelligent as we think.",
    "Very useful for everyday life. Already able to apply what we learned in my life.",
    "This course was really geared towards giving students an introduction to the field of emotional intelligence, and helping students improve their own emotional intelligence. I came away from the course with a greater understanding for the need for emotional intelligence, and also several great strategies for how to recognize, understand, label, express, and regulate my emotions. I took this course as a senior, and I honestly wish I could have taken this course as a freshman. The things I learned in this course have helped me better manage the stress of Yale and keep a focus on my well-being. I will say, however, that you get what you put into this course. If you are truly present and open during this course, you can gain a lot. If you are looking for a course where you can zone out and not really apply yourself, look somewhere else.",
    "The first half of the semester focuses on the theory of emotional intelligence, and the second half focuses on social and emotional learning and the implementation of emotional intelligence in schools. The class is a fantastic combination of factual learning and personal skill building. Not only did we learn about psychology and science behind emotional intelligence, but we developed our own emotional intelligence skills, and learned how to incorporate them into our every day lives.",
    "I developed my understanding about the field of Emotional Intelligence, and learned some helpful emotion regulation strategies.",
    "I decided to take this class because it seemed interesting, seemed like it would be an easy accompaniment to my more difficult courses, and also to see how I could improve my emotional intelligence. It fulfilled all my expectations and more. I am now familiar with the concept of emotional intelligence as understood by one of its OG proponents,Marc Brackett. I am now hyper aware of my own emotions and the emotions of others. And I have the tools to make my own life more wholesome through the perspective of emotional intelligence.",
    "I honestly believe I am a much more emotionally intelligent person now, which has been beneficial in so many ways!",
    "I developed the knowledge of what emotional intelligence is and how it can be fostered and strengthened. Thus, I also developed the skills of how to recognize, understand, label, express, and regulate my own emotions. Notably, I learned that you have to name it to tame, and also that you have to feel it to heal it.",
    "This class actually taught me skills that I could -- and have -- used in my everyday life. Learning to be more self-aware as well as learning techniques to regulate my emotions has been so helpful and, honestly, life-changing.",
    "This course is great - teaches how to be more emotionally intelligent on a daily basis which is something that can be repeatedly use.",
    "how to regulate my emotions better",
    "I learned a lot about the concept of emotional intelligence and about how I could apply that concept to my everyday life. We learned skills like meditation and set goals for ourselves. It was a cool combination of personal and academic material.",
    "How to write a 10-page paper that says nothing",
    "I learned many interesting theories about psychology and hope to use them later in my life.",
    "I learned about RULER, its specific details, and how to teach it.",
    "I am now more aware of my emotions and their importance they play in my life and in society as a whole, especially in our school systems.",
    "I learned about the field of emotional intelligence and that it is a growing field. We learned how it is implanted in schools and the main parts of emotional intelligence.",
    "I learned a lot of tools to manage and regulate emotions, as well as ways of recognizing how my and others' emotions influence me daily. I developed tools to use my emotions so as to benefit me in things I do. I learned the relevance and necessity of developing the tools of emotional intelligence for success.",
    "While I developed little knowledge in this class, the practical skill I recieved was invaluable. I now know how my emotions affect my reasoning, and how to better modulate them when relating to certain people. I know which emotions are most useful to use when I'm studying as compared to when I'm delivering a speech, and can better prepare myself for talking to people that trigger me.",
    "Learning emotions",
    "I learned a lot about what emotional intelligence is, how to evaluate it, and how to teach it. I think the most useful pieces of knowledge were insights into human psychology that surprised me, such as the fact that the best mood to be in when you want to be detail-oriented (like when taking an exam) is sad.",
    "This course gave interesting insight into the ways that Emotional Intelligence can be implemented in academic and social environments. Professor Brackett was engaging, but sometimes the class seemed like it was just an opportunity for him to present his research, which granted makes sense because the Yale Center is one of the leading EI programs in the country and the study of EI was founded at Yale. Still at times it seemed like it was a symposium for him to present his work rather than a classroom.",
    "I actually really enjoyed this class because in addition to learning about emotional intelligence, Professor Brackett had us spend time reflecting on our own lives and thinking about how we can apply different techniques or strategies.",
    "Abilities to self-reflect as well as skills to analyze the emotions and emotional intelligence of people around me.",
    "This course was a lesson in why self-help isn't a bogus topic. I learned plenty of things applicable to me and to others. It was my first ed. studies course, and I thoroughly enjoyed exploring that field from a physchological viewpoint.",
    "I learned that there are ways to better regulate my emotions. I learned strategies that have helped me slow down and become more aware of how I present myself in the world and how I feel.",
    "This course is actually quite practical in the skills\/tools that it teaches one in helping one better regulate their emotions. The effectiveness of seemingly ineffective exercises such as 7-10 minute breathing exercises is, for example, something that this course eventually covers. The first half of the course is focused on a contextual overview of E.I. and what leading research in the field has 'uncovered'. The second half of the course focuses on importance of incorporating E.I. curriculum within schools across the nation through social and emotional learning programs as a real-world application of E.I. and its empirically shown effectiveness in improving the general lives of people. Overall, I feel that this course has made me more self-aware of my own emotional health and how I can begin using my emotions to both better serve myself and help others better develop their own emotional intelligences. :)",
    "I learned why emotions matter and how they can be managed to enhance everyday life. The ability to recognize, understand and regulate emotions in a healthy manner is essential for personal happiness and productivity, but it also creates more positive social interactions.",
    "I developed a wider knowledge of how emotion isn't just an uncontrollable aspect of human nature-- it can be a helpful force when manipulated through the use of skills and strategies. It matters so much for quality of life and success.",
    "I learned the technical definitions of emotion skills and how they can be taught effectively. Above all, by making me think about emotions on a daily basis, the class taught me to be in tune with my own emotions in a way that was beneficial to my overall well being this semester.",
    "I learned the importance of emotional intelligence in mental health and in overall success. I also learned how to develop the skills necessary for applying emotional intelligence to daily life.",
    "I gained a new appreciation for the importance of emotional intelligence in completing everyday tasks, and have begun to pay more attention to it in my daily life. I have gained various skills for emotion expression and regulation, and learned how to use them to more effectively use moods and emotion to my advantage.",
    "This class was kind of a self-exploration of one's emotions and emotion state regulation. Classes involved a lot of break-out activities, some meditation and a lot of reflection. I left the class with a much greater knowledge about how to adequately express and regulate my emotions.",
    "Most of the material was common sense it appeared for the second half of the course. The first half of the course was interesting looking into the history and development of emotional intelligence. Also examining the different theories of emotions and developing emotions from childhood to adulthood. The second half of the course was focused on SEL and regulation strategies, which the long-term strategies are sleeping, eating well and exercising which I think everyone could have predicted on day one of the course.",
    "The ability to control my emotions and those of others",
    "This course on Emotional Intelligence was the first Psychology class I have ever taken. I very much enjoyed the class, especially because I learned how much my emotions affect my decisions and actions every day. I was surprised by how little I knew about myself and the reasons for my reactions, my emotions, to certain events. Through this class I learned how to deal with the emotions I feel and how to deal with them. Another fact that stayed with me, is the importance of teaching Emotional Intelligence to students and teachers to change the entire schooling system around the world.",
    "I learned the RULER method and how to implement it. I learned how important emotions are in my everyday life and how I can use them to my advantage.",
    "Gained valuable skills on managing my emotions, understanding them, accepting them, and managing relationship with emotions playing a huge role in our intra-persoal relationships.",
    "I learned how to manage my emotions exceptionally well through this class.",
    "Very little.",
    "the importance of emotional intelligence",
    "Learn about emotions via the RULER (recognizing, understanding, labeling, expressing, regulating) approach that was created by Prof. Brackett. Class taught you better strategies for dealing w emotions and how emotional intelligence can aid schools across the nation.",
    "I developed I very good knowledge of the Emotional Intelligence field and basics of psychology in general.",
    "Great self-help topic. As an academic subject, it's lacking in substance. Most of the course can be distilled into a couple of obvious lessons - for example, it's OK to be angry!",
    "History and theory of emotional intelligence and SEL Emotion intelligence related skills (emotion regulation was particularly helpful)",
    "Better understanding of Emotional Intelligence skills",
    "I learnt how to regulate my emotions and how managing and understanding our emotions can help us perform better.",
    "I have a greater appreciation for the importance of emotions and am more aware of my own shortcoming in emotional intelligence, so now I can work on them to become a better student, leader, sister, daughter, athlete, etc.",
    "Writing skills, emotional knowledge including stress and time management, insights about emotions in the educational setting.",
    "recognizing understanding labeling expressing regulating emotions teaching of social and emotional learning",
    "I learned a lot about emotions and how to regulate them to be your best self.",
    "How to be emotionally self-aware and how to be more empathetic",
    "This course taught me so very valuable communication skills. Above all else, however, I think this course showed the importance of emotional development in addition to traditional learning.",
    "I learned a lot about emotions in general. I think I may have had some misconceptions about the nature of emotions which lead me to think they may be uncontrollable or difficult to regulate. I learned through Emotional Intelligence that there is actually an entire field devoted to emotions (understanding them, regulating them, etc.) I think more than anything this class helped open my eyes to this field.",
    "A class completely dedicated to the social self was a daring and new idea to me. Never before had a class been so directly applicable to my life and my conversations. I learned to treat my emotions in a respectful way. I learned to view them not as a needless distraction.",
    "Emotional intelligence",
    "I learned a lot about the new emotional intelligence and the ways the program is being implemented across the country",
    "I learned about the field of EI, but also how to use this information in my every day life.",
    "Not much. The course was too large to be able to discuss the class material, or to get advice on how to improve our writing. I never got comments on any of my exams or the final essay I wrote, so I have no idea where I lost points or what areas I'm weak in. The lack of feedback in this class was disappointing, and definitely prevented me from improving my abilities. I understand the class is large, but I walked away feeling like I learned limited content in lecture, most of which seemed obvious, and had very little opportunity to improve as a student (with respect to writing skills, ability to read research papers, etc). I have definitely been in other large lectures where I learned much more. Overall, I felt like I didn't have an opportunity to develop any skills in this class.",
    "I learned about what Emotional Intelligence and SEL are. I was able to not only dive deep into what these topics entail, but also why they are so important and how I could\/should implement what we were learning into my everyday life.",
    "You learn about emotions and how to use them in beneficial, structured ways",
    "From this class I learned information the we simple and easy to understand, as well as applicable to my life. I learned ways to be aware of and manage my emotions, and why this is important in life.",
    "In this course you learn the value and meaning of emotional intelligence, as well as your own level of emotional intelligence.",
    "This was a great class. The lectures were engaging, and the topics were very interesting.",
    "I gained a greater knowledge of myself and my feelings and reactions to things and a honed awareness of emotions of those around me.",
    "I learned the significance of all types of emotions. Emotions serve an adaptive purpose in our life, and while it is easy to try to rid ourselves of all negative emotions, that is not ideal. I have learned to accept both positive and negative emotions that I experience. I have also learned to be aware of my emotional state."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course could be improved by actually introducing research and information. I know there is really cool, new research out there. We even got close to talking about it a few times. I know that the professor thinks RULER is great, but that could have been once class and then we could have actually learned other things.",
    "The course is all strengths: the lecture format, the readings, and the exams were all designed to enhance your knowledge of the subject matter.",
    "The strengths of this course are the instructor and the content. It's very interesting and Prof. Brackett is so passionate about his work it's inspiring. I think having more tangible information in the power-points would help students prepare better for tests and know more concrete information as opposed to just ideas.",
    "STRENGTHS: no section, two relatively straightforward tests and one paper, you learn actually useful real-world skills WEAKNESSES: hella long and difficult readings to wade through, Marc Brackett",
    "Strengths - very interesting, left every class feeling inspired Weaknesses - tests are strange because we learn a lot of information that is hard to predict the way in which it will be presented on tests",
    "A strength was how awesome Marc Brackett is and I thought a weakness was the design of the two tests that we took.",
    "I think this course accomplishes what it's meant to accomplish very well. I think Brackett is giving us exactly what he wants us to learn, and I think he delivers that content quite well. That being said, I think that the way that Brackett used his time in lecture was really unique, not necessarily in a good or bad way. I would say probably 2\/3 of the class was not Brackett lecturing at us, but rather us doing activities, working in pairs or groups, or listening to Brackett tell us stories. I think that this approach was good for solidifying the information in our heads and also for making this course a catalyst for real change in our lives, but I also think that Brackett could have delivered 3 times as much hard content as he did if he chosen to do so. It never felt like Brackett was rushing through the content or trying to cram stuff in; he took a leisurely route and taught us exactly what he wanted us to know.",
    "Strengths: brought to attention the importance of emotions in out lives as students. Weaknesses: exams were awful and the course wasn't super organized. And I became quite skeptic of it throughout!!",
    "Personally, I really don't see any strengths to this class besides the practical approach to SEL implementation in schools. On the other hand, weaknesses abound. Again, most of the material was incredibly redundant and should be removed and replaced with something more interesting and relevant. Additionally, although we do take a couple personal emotional intelligence assessments, the course should also involve more of that. Because there is so little actual information, it would be helpful to include more activities of introspection and situational roleplay. That would make it more engaging as well, if we feel we are getting something more out of it.",
    "I think the weakness of the course is that there are no check-ins of understanding throughout the course, just exams and a final paper. It would be better to have homework where we journal about emotions or something.",
    "more feedback on grading more engagement from TA's.",
    "The beginning of the semester has lots of interesting content, but the end is very dry and boring. I wish interesting, engaging content continued throughout the term.",
    "This course is a little repetitive and kind of unclear about what knowledge you are and aren't responsible for, but it delves into a very interesting area of study",
    "This class felt too easy. A lot of the material could have been condensed or could have been covered in a shorter amount of time, especially for the weeks following Thanksgiving break. I don't think it helps people's perceptions of emotions (that they come secondary to academic achievement) if a class on Emotional Intelligence isn't as challenging as classes on, say, Plato. A lot of the material we learned also felt common sense. I'm sure there's a lot about the field of Emotional Intelligence that's not common sense, but if there is, we didn't delve that deeply into it.",
    "Strengths were definitely in the lectures. Marc offered an open and interactive atmosphere for his students and I appreciated that. He was very involved as well and you could tell that what he was teaching was important to him and this made it more interesting for the rest of us. Weaknesses might have been in the final paper. I thought that 10pages was a little long for an EI paper, especially because we are so new to the topic. Perhaps if it had been 7-8 pages it might have been easier to offer a more useful application to the field of EI.",
    "Some of the stuff in the course seems mad obvious. When the professor found a way to introduce stuff that was like, \"duh\" in a novel way that was when I was most interested. If he kept doing that then I think the course could continue to get better.",
    "Strengths-- Material was directly relevant to my life. It provided me with strategies to developing higher levels of emotional intelligence. Weaknesses- The exams were difficult, especially the second one. Professor Brackett also attempts to be funny but at times, he fails and is more mean than funny.",
    "Needs to be improved by the tests. THey should be all short answer or more wide open because the fill in the black doesn't test student's the write way on some concepts that are abstract or hard to put into words. Positive that it was engaging and actually teaches you habits and goals for life.",
    "Teach more ways to improve emotions. We all know how to recognize them, but need tactics for improving our own weaknesses.",
    "The course seems to lose its structure in the second half of the semester.",
    "Strengths: not to much work and very interesting readings Weaknesses: the grading is a little unclear and the TFs are hardly utilized. Would have loved a few discussion sections (even if they were optional). More guidance was needed for the final paper. Lectures could have been more focused and organized with key points emphasized more.",
    "For the first midterm, there could have been better communication about what material from the readings would be on the test. We had been told on the first day that readings were a minor part of the class and wouldn't be tested on, but later we were expected to have done them. I think having more guest speakers would have been great too.",
    "Strengths: the content itself is very interesting, and the research in the field is growing rapidly, which makes it exciting to keep up with the work. Weaknesses: The professor, the TFs, the way that the class is taught, an unnecessary and frustrating and heavy emphasis on SEL (I was looking to learn about emotional intelligence, not how to teach schools to teach their students emotional intelligence). Many of the conceptual work from the textbook were ignored completely in lecture and the exams, depriving students of the foundational basis for emotional intelligence. The lectures consisted of the \"what\" in emotional intelligence, never the \"why\" or the \"how.\" The students were expected to accept the concepts as they were and at face value. There was no attempt to explain the concepts from a theory-based view. Research was a heavy emphasis in this class, but without the basic psychological explanations for the phenomena, the concepts were confusing and not well organized. There is a completely unnecessary and heavy emphasis on in class \"emotional\" activities. This only disrupted the flow of the class and gave excuses for students to doze off or not come to class completely. There was no engagement between the TFs and the students other than the fact that students found out they had a TF during the midterm and they had to email them their outlines for the final paper for approval. The professor primarily gave lectures in reference to his own, personal, and private experiences that was not based on theory or evidence from real-life research. The powerpoints had minimal information to help guide the students throughout the class. The exams had unfair items like \"the professor said something in relation to emotional intelligence. What did he say?\", forcing students to focus on unhelpful rhymes that the professor said in class instead of the bigger concepts and and ideas. Exams also did not have anything in relation to the textbook, making it extremely unfair for the students who read the textbook all semester compared to those who did not read the textbook at all before the exam.",
    "Would have liked more interaction with the reading material. I would only read things right before the exams because we had no reading responses to keep me on track. Meditation in class was always really nice, learning skills for my own experience and getting feedback was really important. I didn't even realize I had a TF until the first exam, so more accessible office hours (they weren't posted anywhere) and more TF interaction.",
    "Strengths: you learn a lot about yourself and your emotions and should actually make efforts to apply what you learn in clas to become a better human being",
    "The large lecture format without a section makes it hard to engage more with the material.",
    "Very useful content, and I liked the way Brackett engaged the class, but listening to the lectures got boring quite quickly.",
    "This course required a final paper of 10 pages. We were told from the beginning that we would need to write a final paper, but we didn't receive a rubric or further guidance until the last 3 1\/2 to 4 weeks of classes. I would have liked to receive detailed information about the paper sooner, so that I could have completed the paper before large projects for other classes were due. One strength of this course is that it requires a high level of student involvement. Professor Brackett engaged students in response activities every week in which students had to apply the skills of emotional intelligence to their lives. Professor Brackett is very big on action steps-- I came away from almost every class with something new to try in my life related to emotional intelligence. The student involvement in this class is definitely a strength. Professor Brackett was also very open and honest about his own experiences. I found this to be helpful for connecting with the course material.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. The lectures were definitely the strengths - I went to every single one and I always looked forward to it. Professor Bracket does a great job of making the lectures interactive - you alternate between activities and partner discussions and taking notes from slides. Each lecture is focused and specific, and I never felt like going to class was a waste of time. The information was all relevant and practical. I also loved how engaged Professor Bracket was with the students during lecture, I actually felt like I was being taught instead of just spoken at. I thought the two exams were the weakness - I'm not sure they properly reflected what we learned in class, and a lot of the questions were confusing and poorly worded, and I was always uncertain exactly what I was supposed to say. It was frustrating to think that a written test was judging the skills I had learned in such a interactive and engaging lecture. I think changing the format of the test to be more essay or short-answer focused would be beneficial.",
    "The strengths of the program is how engaging the content is. The weakness if that the content got very bland and un-interesting about half way through the semester.",
    "This course was amazing. Don't mess with perfection!!!",
    "Great class in just about every way.",
    "The strengths of the course were that the topic was interesting and relevant to everyone's lives. The weaknesses were that lecture was fairly pointless and a waste of time, and I don't feel like I learned a semester's worth of information. However, there was not too much work and this class was very low-stress.",
    "I love that the class was very much designed to be applicable to daily life and the emotional labor faced everyday by being Yale students. This class is by far the most applicable class I've taken here. I really think everyone at Yale should take this class!",
    "Very engaging - no real weaknesses",
    "Honestly i'm not sure what the strengths are. The material is repetitive and honestly kind of stupid since it is never unpacked. The regulation strategies and the emotions are just repeated over and over again each lecture. I could have learned everything i'd need to know from this course after lecture 1-3 honestly. The tests were so ineffective it's honestly a joke. Why in the world are direct quotes from the professor being tested on via FILL IN THE BLANK?! i can't get over how pointless this class was.",
    "The strength is that Marc Brackett is the leader in this field and so is of course very knowledgable about the course. However, it is a large lecture class, so the extent of the depth to which you can get into topics is limited. Also, some lectures felt repetitive.",
    "I found Professor Brackett to be a very knowledgable and interesting lector.",
    "Strengths: Important and interesting lectures taught in an engaging way by Professor Brackett! The guest lectures were also phenomenal, and I would have loved more similar to the one regarding emotion regulation, cultural responsiveness, and the Yale college EI project. One of my favorite components of the class was when our anonymous answers were displayed in class, and I wish that kind of work was integrated more within other lectures because it makes them that much more engaging. Weaknesses: The exams seemed somewhat unfair at times, especially when there were questions concerning specific phrases said in class that could easily be missed. The essay also crept up quite fast without enough guidance. I wish the graded assignments for this class were weighted more fairly to alleviate student stress -- something that seems rather important in a course about emotional intelligence...",
    "I think it is very interesting. Towards the end of the year it seems like we spent several lectures covering the same material and didn't learn much new material.",
    "The class material was good and helpful, but at times the delivery was poor. Information on the application of Emotional Intelligence was boring and not much of that information was retained. At some points the lectures seemed irrelevant to the course material or testable material despite being interesting. The readings in the beginning of the course did not supplement the lecture materials and seemed useless. Test questions were not the proper way to assess knowledge gained throughout the course. Questions would have multiple potential answers but the grading was based on specific buzzwords. Even if a question was correct and was directly from lectures or readings, if the buzzword was not present then no points were given, which was unfair. Tests just did not feel like appropriate ways of assessing students' knowledge of the course material. Lectures were usually interesting but at times seemed to go on unnecessary tangents. I think that some other form of assessment would be more appropriate for this course other than tests.",
    "I loved Brackett's energy and enthusiasm, and the way he had us turn to the person beside us in class. I didn't know anyone in the row I sat in in class-- now all of us are quite close! On the other hand, he has this annoying way of having us brainstorm definitions to terms, which he then promptly correctly defines himself. It's not as if he's taking our opinions into account or anything -- it's obvious that he is always correct, but if definitions aren't debatable, why have us waste time trying to discuss their definitions? Professors are professors because they know more than students -- Prof. Brackett needs to just accept that having us guess and correcting us with the \"proper\" definition is inefficient: just tell us the definition outright if there's only one for god's sake!",
    "This course at times proved very frustrating. I often felt like we were moving extremely slowly and lectures were so joke and anecdote-filled that we were barely covering any real course content; we could've covered ten lectures in one if we just stuck to the topic. I also found Professor Brackett's constant and random use of Spanish to be distracting, erring on offensive. His attempts to make the course interactive with lots of \"Turn to your partner and discuss X\" also didn't really work since this was a huge lecture and many of the students were taking it Credit D and\/or not paying any attention.",
    "Strengths- Not too much work, Fun classroom environment Weaknesses- Sometimes hard to stay focused, readings could be tedious at times.",
    "There were times that I felt I was sitting in a deep-breathing exercise class rather than a Yale Undergraduate course. While I understand that this is a strategy in de-stressing in Emotional Intelligence, I felt that it took away from lessons.",
    "I think more guidance on the final paper would be nice. I was very lost and unsure how to get started, especially since there had to be 4 original ideas either for the theory or application of EI or SEL.",
    "Though the course did present interesting ideas and helpful life advice, I don't feel that the course was academically robust. Most of the readings were opinion-based and not extremely insightful. I think the lectures themselves could have been 30 min. shorter and that the professor could have covered the same material. To the class and Professor Brackett's credit, I did walk away knowing the value of emotional intelligence and with the knowledge of several skills that will aid me in difficult situations. However, I feel like the class was more of a \"life workshop\" rather than a Yale academic course. I didn't learn any substantial material, and the lectures sometimes were drawn out and uninteresting.",
    "Readings are very redundant; more diverse readings would improve course. Strengths are Brackett's charisma -- always a joy to be in class.",
    "The lectures are slow and we often don't move through a lot of material. A lot of the class is demo-based, which is nice in lecture, but a pain when it comes to studying for exams.",
    "Strengths -- the material is very interesting and fascinating, especially in the first half of the course whenever E.I. and a review of its most important developments, as a field of study within psychology, are discussed and explored Weaknesses -- the second half of the course's focus on SEL programs within school-specific contexts was not as stimulating or interesting as I had hoped. Indeed, after SEL, specifically RULER, had been introduced and it had become clear to me that RULER would form the basis for many of the remaining lectures, I felt that the course had become more of a pitch for SEL's relevance within the U.S. educational system rather than a course that could have potentially explored other real-world scenarios where SEL\/E.I. insights could be implemented well. --- In other words, I felt quite saturated with the notion that SEL and E.I. within school-systems was important after the second half of the course; and although I agree with the initiative(s), I felt that much was lost in not more thoroughly discussing other potential applications for E.I. within the 'real-world'. (for goodness sakes, our final paper asked us to hypothesize on potential real-world applications!)",
    "strengths- being engaged while in lecture weakness- keeping up with all the readings (need to be more organized\/ time management)",
    "I think the content of the course is important, but it is sometimes taught in a redundant way, and some of the most interesting things are skimmed over.",
    "There is a lot of class participation - students giving personal anecdotes, responses, and interpretations of concepts being discussed. While this kept the class engaging, it was not always easy to follow what was expected to be known or kept in notes.",
    "Strengths: Enjoyable topic with a great professor",
    "The material for exams seemed nebulous at points I felt like I was mostly memorizing slides and textbook definitions, which seemed counterintuitive to the class's mission of emphasizing emotional knowledge over senseless knowledge.",
    "The course dragged on about the importance of emotional intelligence, which could have been established in fewer classes, when it should have spent more time on how to apply and improve upon emotional skills.",
    "I think this course could benefit from a section. Though the periodic lecture checks are relatively effective for maintaining attendance, I think much of the real-life application of this material is lost in lecture, and all students could benefit from the tactics being reinforced with TFs. That said, this course will make you look at your life in a different way, and is one of the few Yale College courses that teaches you skills you can and will use every single day.",
    "Material doesn't feel very in-depth, but lectures are interesting.",
    "strength- super engaging weakness- the readings are kind of brushed over but a big part of the exams",
    "The course attempted to cover too much material. Ranging from how to develop emotions, to reading emotions, SEL, and regulation strategies there was too much material to cover that it all got a very broad stroke and made everything seem easy, and not all that insightful. I think it would be stronger if the course chose to focus on just a a couple of the current aspects in order to allow for more depth and exploration. In its current state many of the material presented in class seemed more common sense facts where I know that it is probably a bit more complicated than that at times or at least the process getting there was. I also was not a huge fan of all the self-reflecting moments. I thought it brought attention away from the course, but I suppose it is a fairly good representation of how the material can be applied to you.",
    "Strengths were the lectures, weaknesses were the assigned readings and the objectivity of the tests.",
    "A great strength were the interesting and entertaining lectures that successfully conveyed the course material and made the students participate in class. On the other hand there was a large amount of students, which made it impossible to interact more thoroughly with the material and the class more impersonal. For a class covering emotions it would be useful to be able to interact with people more.",
    "Great class. No complaints. It was run very well.",
    "Planning and organization of the class was great, only problem i ran across was not knowing who my teaching assistant was towards the wanning weaks of class.",
    "The class was light in workload; the size made it difficult to attract attention.",
    "Grades on midterm\/final\/essay were not\/have not been distributed to students in a reasonable amount of time.",
    "good participation efforts in class but you feel like youre not learning anything during lecture",
    "Strength: guest lecturers, the professor's personal anecdotes, info you learn about yourself, coping styles, emotions, low time commitment ( 1 midterm, 1 final, attendance checked via short and personal in class reflections, 2 in-class emotional assessments that show your emotional intelligence that is also used for participation, no homework) Weaknesses: long class after lunch",
    "I like how the lecture is given in a very fun way, and how the professor tries to create a very pleasant course environment. But I think we don't get the opportunity to personally interact with the professor often.",
    "Strengths: very interesting material and Professor Brackett is a great lecturer Weaknesses: dry readings, grade comprised of very few assignments, little guidance on a vague, intimidating paper, tests graded in strict accordance with an answer key, tested on obscure details from the readings with no guidance on what to study, tests can be memorization based versus knowledge based",
    "There was a lot of participation and interaction but I think this course could be improved by incorporating more specifics into the curriculum.",
    "There could be greater interaction with my Teaching Assistant. There were no office hours to discuss content in class. Mark is an expert in the field with incredible projects. The course's readings are well structured and follow a logical order.",
    "The material is interesting but I was frustrated by the lack of evidence shown in class. I felt like lectures were more anecdotal than evidence based which made it more difficult to buy into the program. The class could also be very repetitive even though it didn't need to be.",
    "It would be interesting if the professor talked a little bit about the readings assigned to the course.",
    "the lectures were long and could be a bit boring, but the material was really interesting",
    "I absolutely loved this course!",
    "I thought this course was on a few occasions repetitive but overall was very engaging.",
    "I think that the class started out extremely strong -- with a ton of content and powerpoint presentations, etc. I think one of the classes weaknesses was that it sometimes seemed redundant between lectures and readings, etc.",
    "I'm not sure there's enough raw material in this course to justify a twice a week, full semester lecture. The first part of the course felt pretty content-rich, but the second part trailed off and started to feel either repetitive or confusing. This also made exams difficult to prepare for.",
    "Strengths: Focused effort on learning how to view oneself in relation to his\/her environment Important tools for living a healthy life were learned Weaknesses: Too much time dedicated to the impact SEL was having, when fewer classes could have been dedicated to that. At times it felt as though the class, through its curriculum, was trying to validate its importance to a classroom of students who likely believed the science in the first place, otherwise they wouldn't have taken the class.",
    "Interesting material, but didn't enjoy being tested on it",
    "I think for the topic is is taught very effectively",
    "The lecture style was good, the EI testing was neccesarry, the reflections were also good.",
    "More advice, feedback and attention from the TF's would have been helpful. We were told at the beginning of the class that we would get the name of our TF soon. However, we did not learn who our TF was until the midterm. Being able to email our TF questions or attend office hours to discuss the class material would have been very helpful. The professor was often traveling and busy, and he did not hold regular office hours, and so I often felt like I had no one to go to when I was confused, or just wanted to explore something further because it was interesting. This lack of access to TFs and the professor was one of the biggest weaknesses of the course. In addition, the lack of feedback on our exams and essays was disappointing, particularly given the fact that they were our only assignments in the class. I felt like I learned very little because of the fact that I never received comments on my exams and essay. Another large weakness of the class was the fact that a large percentage of the class readings were written by our professor. In addition, despite the fact that there are numerous SEL approaches, we only learned and read about the one developed by our professor. I did not feel like I was learning about emotional intelligence. I felt that I was learning about a very biased view of how emotional intelligence teaching should be done according to Yale University. Despite these significant weaknesses, I thought the lectures in the course were strong, particularly the guest lecturers. I enjoyed all of the guest lectures a lot, especially the one on child development, and the one on culturally sensitive pedagogy.",
    "It is a very intuitive course but hard to engage with because there is not a lot of material to learn. It is useful if studying educational studies",
    "A weakness of this course is that the reading can be long and boring (however its not completely necessary to do al the readings for the class). A strength of this class is that is is low pressure and stress, the information learned is applicable to real life, and I found many of the studies very interesting.",
    "I think that lectures got to be a bit repetitive and I don't think there was enough emphasis on the really solid scientific background that was mentioned in the readings and was heavily tested on. It would have been helpful to have the opportunity to talk those concepts through in the classroom setting.",
    "This course can be very meaningful if you come to class and put in the effort. While the class activities we did were not on the exams or counted as grades, they were probably the most rewarding part of the course."

   "comments": [
    "I would NOT recommend this course to another student. There are other gut classes where you do less work and are still invested and learn something. The ten page paper at the end was hard to write because we didn't learn anything all semester. This class is frustrating and makes Emotional Intelligence seem like a pseudo-science.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, but only if you take the information seriously and don't use it as a gut class because that just wastes your time and everyone else's.",
    "Would definitely recommend- especially if you are interested in psychology and\/or education studies.",
    "I'm honestly ambivalent towards it. I'm really glad I took it, but I'm not sure if I could recommend it to someone else in good faith.",
    "Yes absolutely, I believe everyone at Yale should take this class.",
    "Highly recommend this course, it will help you a lot in improving your emotional state and will improve daily life quality.",
    "This is a cool class, and I think that you should take it just for the sake of learning more about how you and others function, how emotions affect us, and how we can use our emotions effectively to create positive change in our lives. I think that I really did learn a lot about myself and about social emotional learning and emotional intelligence through this course. Marc Brackett has a way of making a huge lecture feel like a seminar - we are constantly answering questions, breaking into groups, working in pairs, doing activities, etc. However, one thing about the class if that you have to know that Marc Brackett has a very unique personality and lecturing style, which don't mesh particularly well with everyone. I enjoyed the class a lot because I enjoyed the content and think that Brackett presented it particularly well, but I also think that Professor Brackett is low key kind of arrogant and narcissistic. He talks about himself constantly, sometimes relevant to the class, sometimes not, but it can get a little old after a while to hear him say he's the \"Director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence\" in every lecture. Also, sometimes when students answer questions in class, he can be somewhat condescending towards them, which can be frustrating and actually scared me off of answering any questions in his class. It's difficult work that he's doing, trying to make a class about something as subjective and personal as feelings and emotions, but he does a good job of teaching exactly what he wants us to learn. I think that if you can get past Brackett's personality quirks, you will find a class with a very reasonable workload, a lot of engaging content, and opportunities to learn a lot about yourself. I say take the class; you won't regret it.",
    "No. I took it because of the great reviews. It was fun being in lecture until the class turned into a real class. The exams are difficult with many out of context questions. The readings are repetitive, talking about the same emotional intelligence theory all the time. Take a different social science.",
    "Not in the least. The course appears to be a genuinely interesting \"gut\" course, but don't be fooled. It is not interesting in the least after the first 2 weeks of class. Additionally, the professor claims he doesn't care whatsoever about the exam, and then writes a particularly difficult exam (on obscure material). And finally, the original syllabus did not include a final paper, but it got added. So if you consider taking the course as credit\/D, DO IT RIGHT AWAY because chances are he will add assignments and you can't go from letter grade back to credit\/D.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who is a human being. Emotions are important.",
    "I would recommend because i think pretty much anyone would find the material engaging, even though it doesn't take that much brainpower to understand.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who wants to add a fifth class to their schedule or needs to fulfill their distributional requirement. It was an interesting class, but I felt like we could have delved more deeply into a lot of these topics.",
    "yes without a doubt. I think emotional intelligence is one of the most important skills to have. This class was very applicable to things happening outside the classroom and I was grateful to have it in my weekly schedule.",
    "It would be a good fifth course. Interesting and useful, but gets rather repetitive.",
    "Look, here it is: the class isn't particularly hard. At all. Just go to class. Listen to Marc Brackett brag about all his accomplishments. Not going to lie, Professor Brackett has his head so far up his you-know-what that it has once again come out of his neck and is a head again. That being said, he's one of the smartest professors I've ever met. Would I be that overly confident if I had accomplished as much as he had? Probably. So I'm not even mad. You'll earn about all the ways you can better regulate your emotions in the future although 3\/5 times you'll just utilize unhelpful coping techniques because it's college and ain't nobody got time for that. The midterm and final aren't hard if you skim a few readings and listen in class. The class itself isn't that long either and it usually doesn't drag on. TBH this is probably one of the only course that, if I actually applied what I learned, would help me long after Yale is over...so yea. 7\/10 would recommend. Painless SO credit.",
    "You could take this course, it definitely teaches you something about your emotions, but there's so much bullsh!t that it's not worth it my opinion.",
    "Yes!! Low workload, very interesting, relevant, and important material, but I highly recommend taking the class Credit\/D though since the exams are challenging.",
    "Definitely would recommend it but would tell them to take it Credit D. Its such an enjoyable class its tough to have to worry about one's grade in it adn honestly the tests aren't a good assessment of your understanding of the material or the lectures. They are extremely nit picky exams that test memorization more than actual comprehension.",
    "If you need an easier class, take this.",
    "Although I had heard great things about this course, I think it failed to deliver. Looking back, I don't know if I would take it again. There didn't seem to be much structure, and Professor Brackett went off into tangents many times.",
    "No",
    "Prof Brackett says at the start of the semester that he wants this course to change your life. Whether or not it does is really up to you. The class teaches certain emotion management techniques that, if you make sure to learn and implement them, will make you a more emotionally intelligent person and will help you better cope with your life. If you simply treat this as a course to get through, that's fine too. You'll get less out of it, but can probably get a good grade with relatively little stress. I'd recommend taking the class with a friend, because around 3 times per class, Prof Brackett will tell you to turn to the person next to you to discuss something, which is much more enjoyable if you know that person.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to a friend. It was pretty easy and I came away with some good knowledge of emotional intelligence and how to apply it to my own life.",
    "Honestly didn't learn much in this class this semester. It was not very organized and didn't really follow the syllabus set at the beginning of the semester. Also, I still haven't received my results for the emotional intelligence surveys we took at the beginning of the semester (even after contacting Professor Brackett). The tests required fairly detailed knowledge, so make sure you do the reading if you're taking it for a letter grade.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about the ever expanding field of Emotional Intelligence. The applications for EI are widespread.",
    "If you're a psych major and looking to fulfill your requirements, do not take this course. You have a better chance at having fun and having an interesting class with Bargh's Social Psychology or Clark's Attraction and Relationships. This class is too heavily focused on education policy rather than the topic of emotional intelligence. The professor is pretentious, unhelpful, unresponsive to requests for help, and does not really rely on evidence-based data to back his statements in class. He primarily focuses on the fact that he played karate since 3rd grade and other private, uncomfortable information to showcase ALL of the concepts in emotional intelligence, which many students believed to be a stretch and unnecessary. The textbook, while very informative and interesting, has no use in the course, since he only bases his exams on his lectures and some of the article readings that he assigns. Don't bother with the textbook, really. Definitely not recommended. There are plenty of other \"gut\" classes at Yale. This one is one of those bad ones. Do not take.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. It's tough to go to a place like Yale and be able to focus on your work when your emotions can be stringing you in lots of different directions. You will learn that emotions are malleable and how to control your emotions and those of others. I have used the class material in my own life in social situations and in helping manage anxiety during stressful times when I have lots of exams and obligations. Tests are reasonable (2 exams) and there's one research paper that is really broad and you can do on anything. If you don't want to worry about that stuff, Credit\/D it and just go to class because Marc is really great to listen to and class is really calming (you do breathing exercises and there's lots of interactions between classmates and opportunity for you to bring your life into the class). Sit next to someone you will want to get to know pretty well, because you'll talk to them almost every class. The guest lectures were all incredible, some better than the actual class. This class has inspired me to look more into this field as a potential career option. Anyone remotely interested in education or self-improvement should take this before you graduate.",
    "Really interesting and practical, but definitely take credit d",
    "Yes. It's super doable. You learn a lot. Take it,",
    "It's an interesting course that makes you think introspectively about your own emotional intelligence. You'll get out of it what you put into it.",
    "I would. It think this is an extremely important life skill that more people need to be aware of. Although there wasn't a ton of work, taking good notes was key to success.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to Yale students. This course focuses on a set of skills that are sometimes ignored in the Yale curriculum, yet are critical to student wellbeing. I honestly wish that this course was offered every semester so that every Yale student would have the chance to take this course. I think that student wellbeing could really improve if a greater focus is placed on courses like Emotional Intelligence.",
    "Absolutely! Take it for sure! This was definitely one of my favorite classes. The material is interesting, and incredibly relevant to every day life. I actually looked forward to the lectures - I would always leave feeling less-stressed and more in control of my life. t was one of the few classes that I felt like I was constantly applying to my current life. I honestly think every Yale student should be required to take this class - the emotional climate on campus would be so much better and people would be so much happier! The class is also not very much work, and the assignments are manageable and fair.",
    "I would say the class is a very easy 5th class. The class starts off interesting, but gets very bland half way through. Marc Brackett is a great teacher with a lot of enthusiasm, experience and knowledge about the field.",
    "Take this course it's amazing. You will leave a better person. It's not just a stupid pointless gut class. It is so useful and enlightening.",
    "Absolutely! Reasonable workload and great material.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking for an easy, low-workload class that is also fairly interesting. I was not extremely impressed with the teaching or the extent of the information that we learned, but lecture could occasionally be entertaining and some of the ideas were relevant and interesting. The midterm and final simply require straight memorization from the lecture slides and readings, and the 10-page research paper at the end of the term is annoying, but otherwise there is no other work required throughout the semester.",
    "Yes, this class was amazing!! This is by far the best class I've taken here at Yale. It teaches you practical, applicable skills of how to be understand and regulate your emotions better -- skills that I think everyone at Yale could really use. This class is basically therapy.",
    "YES!!! If you can take, take it",
    "nah i mean if you want low workload then maybe but you will get absolutely nothing out of it.",
    "If you are looking for a class with a low workload, then take this class. However, it isn't necessarily easy grading wise if you put in the minimal effort required. You can definitely get by without doing the reading, but it still makes up a small percentage of the test that is enough to change your grade to a lower letter grade.",
    "Yes, I would. It is a good option for a fifth class.",
    "I would not recommend this to another student because I feel like I did not learn much besides very common sense aspects of emotion. Honestly, as I went through the class, I kept having to ask myself what *DID* I learn, because I'm still not sure.",
    "Taking this class has definitely changed the way I approach relationships with people and the way I think about myself and how I'm feeling. It's worth to take for everyone at Yale because it makes you think critically about how you treat your emotions and ways to make them healthy and positive, but the instructor doesn't add anything to the course. It's amazing that someone so emotionally unintelligent teaches the course in EI.",
    "DONT TAKE IT WORST CLASS IVE TAKEN AT YALE",
    "I would only recommend this course if a the student intends to major in psychology.",
    "Truly an important topic that I believe everyone would gain from. The information definitely dulls down from the first day and can somewhat become repetitive, but there is still plenty value from the material. The exams are more challenging than they need to be, especially if you don't read thoroughly (or at all). The final essay was also quite rough, but probably my own fault for procrastinating. Overall a really amazing class in terms of the knowledge that you learn and I would highly recommend everyone to take it!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It is very interesting at the beginning but dulls out a little towards the end. I still think that is was very cool subject to learn about considering it is not a very well known area.",
    "I would recommend this class as an easier fifth credit or as credit D if you don't want to worry too much about tests which can be deceptive at times. The material was interesting and, if taken seriously, can be useful. But the tests weren't as easy as you'd initially think (but not super difficult either).",
    "I would. While Professor Brackett got annoying after a while, I learned some invaluable skills that will last me a lifetime.",
    "Definitely take it! It's a very low workload class. You have 2 midterms and a final 10 page paper. The paper may sound like a lot, but if you take time to write it and think thoroughly about it, you'll have a fun time writing it. The content of the class is also very applicable and practical. It's stuff you face everyday and you're basically learning to acknowledge it and how to respond to it. Like I said, definitely take the class!",
    "I think a student could learn just as much from reading the textbook chapters and APA essays on the course syllabus, so no.",
    "Yes, good 5th course.",
    "No. If we're going to be honest, this course has no structure. you don't learn enough to warrant how difficult the tests are and unlike other large lectures, there are few outlets to aid in your work. Don't take this class if you like a structured lecture. Dont take this class if you don't like a structured lecture. Just don't take this class.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes -- as an easy, interesting, fun course that is especially fun because it feels personal as well as academic.",
    "if the material interests you, take it; if not, won't be worthwhile",
    "This is a nice class. It moves very slowly, so if you have trouble staying awake, it probably wouldn't be the best option. The strategies and topics learned in the class are often directly applicable to our lives, so I would recommend taking it for those.",
    "I think every student at Yale should have to take this course.",
    "Yes, I would! I especially recommend this course to anyone who's interested in Education, in addition to the concept of Emotional Intelligence. If Prof. Marc teaches the course as he did for my course, then you're bound to really enjoy the second half of the course as it delivers a heavy emphasis on the importance of E.I. within educational settings. If you're really just interested in E.I., I still recommend this course, though I lay a fair warning in saying that often times, lectures will seem to overlap in material, and considerable portions of lecture time is (often) spent listening to Prof. Marc's personal-life anecdotes (which he brings into discussion to provide examples for various E.I. concepts), which are entertaining but not always as academically relevant as one would like...",
    "I throughly enjoyed this course and its content. The message was clearly and interestingly presented by the professor. Content learned was very applicable to life as a college student.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who I thought could benefit personally from emotion management skills.",
    "If you are looking for something different and applicable to everyday life then I would recommend it",
    "This was an enjoyable course on a significant topic that students may never again have the chance to study formally. The workload was not overwhelming, and it was great to have as a low stress class in a busy schedule.",
    "Take this class if you want to take a relatively easy course. Let's be honest though, it's Yale. It's not going to be like you can lean back and chill if you actually want that good grade. HOWEVER, the final essay is fairly easy and the 2 exams are fine as long as you actually study for a solid couple days-- lots of concepts.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, if anything only to reinforce the importance of taking our emotions seriously. I think every person, even if they themselves are not fully emotionally intelligent, must have an understanding of emotional intelligence to be a functional human being in society. This is one of very few courses with lasting implications, and skills that you will use every day of your life.",
    "I would say you do learn to view emotional intelligence and emotions in contexts you've probably never thought of, and lectures are interesting. However, material felt redudunat at times. It's not a particularly hard class though.",
    "DEF TAKE IT- it is great for learning how to handle stress and deal with the emotional labor that is being a college student especially at Yale",
    "No because it is not as well presented and the material is not in depth or interesting enough.",
    "Yes I would",
    "I enjoyed the course and I enjoyed how the material makes me think introspectively. I will be more emotionally conscious after taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking for an easy, but interesting and entertaining course that teaches you a little bit more about yourself.",
    "Great class. Very useful in life. Brackett wants his students to succeed.",
    "Yes because I value it as something of great value to learn about the role emotions play in day to day life.",
    "It's a good gut. Not a lot of week-to-week work, and you can definitely cram for the exams if needed. Very fun lectures.",
    "Yes. The life skills you ill learn in this class are incomparable to other facets of academia at Yale.",
    "sure",
    "Tough to say, class was a bit boring at sometimes but the class was interesting.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because I thoroughly enjoyed going to every class and felt like I walked out of the class having learned something about myself and about the study of emotional intelligence that piece by piece added up to a solidly comprehensive understanding of myself that I didn't have before.",
    "Yes. The topic of Emotional Intelligence is extremely interesting. Also, the professor gives many tips to the students on how to manage their lives as college students.",
    "Not worth taking, you won't learn anything new and the work is annoying.",
    "It's a self-help lecture, but doesn't really have much academic substance. Take it Credit-D - since the material is simple (the gist of the class is \"emotions are OK!\"), it seems as if the instructors make up for it by grading more harshly than the average course.",
    "Yes very interesting information that's worth knowing. Professor Brackett is great. Course structure can be frustrating.",
    "Yes, because emotions are a large part of every person's life and understanding the importance of them and understanding specific skills associated with emotions can help a person out tremendously.",
    "Emotional Intelligence was a great class with not much of a workload. I got to learn a lot about emotional intelligence and I was able to use many of the learnings in my personal life. I would recommend it to anyone since EI is embedded in all aspects of our lives, including our professional.",
    "Yes because it is cool to learn about it at Yale since the center at Yale is basically the founder and leader of EI research. And EI is becoming increasingly important in all fields\/careers but is also just good to know for life skills. However I would tell them that you can probably learn everything you need to know by reading a short book on EI which makes the class repetitive.",
    "Yes, the professor discusses topics that you would never find in another course. Moreover, you learn techniques to deal with your own health and self-management.",
    "Yes! Professor is very good and topic is interesting.",
    "Yes, it is a fun course that teaches you a lot of new information.",
    "A must take for all Yale students!",
    "Yes, because the course material is interesting and valuable.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class but I think I would have to explain to the person what it is ahead of time. I think students found it hard to do well on the tests because the correct answers to questions evolving emotions can sometimes seen subjective when they are not.",
    "An atypical lecture. The course definitely does its job of teaching about the importance of emotions and the role they play in life outcomes (academics, employment, etc.). This is an ideal Credit\/D: always come to lecture and then skim the readings before tests (I took it for a grade and did the readings and they were kind of a lot). Youll definitely remember what you learned in this class after the course ends. Prof. Brackett is a TED talk lecturer more than a college professor, but he was very funny and good at doing his job of keeping his audiences attention. He was a bit of a tool, though, and radiated arrogance. So watch out for that. Grading for Fall 2016: 2 exams (noncumulative, each worth 25% of your grade), a 10-page final paper (30% of your grade), and mini responses to lecture that are used to track your attendance (20% of your grade). There was no section.",
    "Interesting but can be repetitive",
    "This class has great info, and it is very applicable to everyday life.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. I did not feel I learned much. The lectures covered material that felt obvious. The readings were interesting, but too many of them were written by our professor and focused on his emotional intelligence curriculum. We read several papers on his RULER program, but no papers on any other emotional intelligence curricula. Consequently, the course felt extremely biased. In addition to that, we never got any comments or feedback on our exams or essay, so I didn't feel like I had the opportunity to develop as a student at all. If you are looking for an easy class, with little work, and mildly interesting lectures, then this class might be worth taking. But overall I was extremely disappointed.",
    "Yes definitely. I think this is a course that everyone should take. It is very interesting plus you learn a lot about yourself.",
    "Yes I would but only if you want to learn more about emotions and ways to develop emotional intelligence. Not extremely challenging but a practical skill set.",
    "Yes, i would recommend this course. The information learned is relevant in the real world and was easy to understand.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "This course was amazingly enlightening and affected all other aspects of life. I think it is extremely relevant especially as a Yale student. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It was literally like going to therapy twice a week. If you show up to class and allow yourself to engage in the lecture, it can be really meaningful. The skills you will learn in this course are so valuable."
