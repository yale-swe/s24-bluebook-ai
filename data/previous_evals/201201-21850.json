   "comments": [
    "I want to speak up strongly in favor of Prof. Horan, who has an idiosyncratic style. She never seems satisfied with what you're saying, but just embrace that fact and realize you're going to learn a ton. She speaks specifically, factually, and on-topic with very little tolerance fo rambling or bullshitting, for which she will promptly call you out. So when she talks, it's always informative, and when students talk, they're forced to make better points than people do in other comparable classes.I was very engrossed in the material for the first half of the semester but did notice a drop-off near the end. It may have been that more general theories of poverty and approaches to poverty alleviation provided better material for the class to dig in on than more specific case studies of various anti-poverty campaigns. Still, it was all very important stuff that I consider invaluable to anyone hoping for a career in social services, domestic policy, teaching, etc. This class felt important and relevant throughout.",
    "Good class, discussion lagged a little at times, but generally learned a lot.",
    "This is a discussion of the different factors affectinv poverty, some of the solutions proposed, and the dilemmas facing those who want to end it. You learn a lot and hear from a variety of different sources.",
    "This was the best \/ most useful seminar I've taken in the Political Science department. A great course for anyone interested in public policy. Professor Horan is especially helpful during office hours, and would probably make a great senior essay advisor. Keep in mind though that there's plenty of writing, particularly if you choose to go the research paper route.",
    "Take this class. It's important. Readings are long but good, Professor Horan is great, and the papers can be confusing but are based on the readings, so really one can't complain. If you have any interest in modern American politics, ending poverty, government, etc etc, take it. Take it even if you don't."
