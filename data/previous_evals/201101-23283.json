    "While the topics for each class were very interesting, and the Professor is excellent - I felt like there is more room for integrating the classes. I did not see the flow much - apart from micro to macro development\/economics\/policy.",
    "I could have done without many of the readings which I did not find very interesting. It's a bit annoying to have to do weekly commentaries, particularly when you don't care for certain readings.The class tries to cover a lot of material, which combined with lots of powerpoint charts and diagrams, dilutes the learning value.",
    "Readings were good but could have tied together better. Course needed a central theme which seemed to be missing.Lectures straight from the slides which paralleled the readings - not very helpful, could stay up to date just by reading the powerpoint.",
    "Question 1: the readings for some weeks were better than others. I found the readings for woodfuel lecture unhelpful, but readings got better as the course progressed.Question 3: I enjoyed writing the commentaries because it helps me conceptualize all the readings together, and I also really appreciate that we got one free week. I think that more help could have been given for the midterm modelling project--maybe broken up into small groups of ~10 people outside of class where we could get a more one-on-one experience using the program and asking the professor for help\/clarification. The one half-lecture we spent on it barely helped prepare us, because we weren't doing the clicking and exploring ourselves, and it's a kind of complicated program for those who have never used it before.Question 5: I really appreciate how the professor would take time to answer students' questions, and if he didn't know the answer, would make note of it, look it up later, and tell us next lecture or via email. I felt like he fostered a good atmosphere for asking questions and encouraging discussion.",
    "The subject matter of the course was interesting and useful. I also thought that the organization of the semester was intuitive and helpful. The biggest problem with this course was the level at which it was taught. The subjects were so interesting, but the instruction and discussion was at an undergraduate level - for people with no background in energy or development. I was so excited by the readings and subjects covered in this class but constantly disappointed by the actual class sessions.",
    "More courses like this please! This course was an excellent basic intro, I would love to be able to continue on with more advanced readings in this area.",
    "question 6, the class runs slow but you do learn a lot.",
    "This is an important course for everyone interested in energy."

    "Modeling project as midterm assignment. very useful and interesting.",
    "That it covered not only issues related to energy but also issues related to poverty and development.",
    "The readings were always very thoughtful and often multi-disciplinary. The Homer assignment was also an excellent applied project.",
    "Homer",
    "I like that energy and development are tied in this course. I think it's an exciting mix, but there are so many things that need improvement with the course that I actually did not find it exciting in the end. I like how responsive the professor was to questions, and I like that the course seemed new, fresh, and up to date on many of the current issues in energy and development.",
    "The instructor",
    "The HOMER exercise - taught us how to use a model to actually value different types of renewable and conventional energy generation sources according to cost, emissions, resource availability metrics etc. We don't get enough hands-on modeling experience at FES - certainly not in energy - so this was a huge help. Loved it. Otherwise, I appreciated how much detail Prof. Bailis put into the lectures. His knowledge of each of the disciplines that come together to inform this material is impressive - technical, social, economic, policy etc. Also enjoyed the discussion sections at the end of each class. Most students did a great job and facilitated some interesting conversations. Was great to break up the lecture format.",

   "comments": [
    "Some of the topics towards the end sort of dragged, but I think mostly because they weren't particularly interesting to me, not because of the quality of presentation or material.",
    "Lecture style. Too many slides, too much scattered material.Also many of the reading choices can be improved, particularly those at the beginning of the semester around the concepts of gender, access, rights, poverty, etc. The first few weeks seemed like a class on the theory of development, not a class on energy.Give students a bit more slack on the commentaries, requiring only say 8-10 out of 13 weeks.",
    "Bowers not at all conducive to discussion.",
    "Perhaps because the lecture material was not tested on, students' attention and participation seemed to waver by the end of the semester. Other than that, it was a very enjoyable class.",
    "class was too large for meaningful discussion, dissection of topics. a smaller class size would have been benefitial",
    "FES needs to start building tracks where courses build upon each other. Otherwise, courses repeat so much. In this case, energy systems analysis should be a prerequisite for this course which is then taught at a much higher level of presumed energy knowledge.",
    "I think the course should cover a little less topics in order to make a deeper analysis of some issues.",
    "Rethinking the structure of the course might be a good idea. In the lectures, the professor tried to cover everything, which of course is impossible. As a result, I learned very, very little about very, very many aspects of energy in developing countries. A more in-depth focus on key areas would be helpful -- you can't cover everything that everyone wants to learn about energy in one class, but at least students would walk away with more concrete knowledge rather than broad exposure to a bunch of different ideas.Also, the discussion format did not help foster discussion. It would have been great to have the two TAs lead discussion section during the 2nd half of class, or to have the students lead discussion sections (instead of presenting to the entire class). There were people in the class who were real experts in a given week's topic, and discussion section would give us an opportunity to learn from each other.",
    "My only suggestion is to be slightly more cognizant of the time devoted to lecture and discussion to allow for longer discussions.",
    "The discussion session would be better if there were fewer people in the class.",
    "The after class discussion was often difficult, mostly because of the large size of the class. Perhaps breaking the discussion section into smaller groups would foster more dialogue.",
    "Discussion sessions get dull sometimes.",
    "First, discussion section did not work. I have some theories about why: Bowers is not conducive to discussion. It's too big, echo-y, and we don't face each other. But beyond that (because that is easily fixed), there were too many people. I find that discussion with 25 is about the limit, and we had over 30. It should either be restricted, split intotwo groups, or discussion should be scrapped.Second, the structure of the course and the topic of lectures was not that great. I think the course spent far to long on development at the household level. I think one, maybe two lectures would be good, but not a third of the course. It started getting interesting at the national and especially international levels.Third, lecture always went over time, giving us only half an hour for discussion usually. I think there is virtue in only lecturing on the most important, the take-away message, instead of getting bogged down in the details. Time and content needs to be managed better.",
    "The level at which it is taught",
    "The weekly student facilitations - corny",
    "Maybe add a few minutes to allow students to comment on\/relay their own reading responses for each class?",
    "Discussion sessions should be shorter, and dedicate more time for class time.",
    "three hours can be too much. I dont like the discussion among students. I would prefere something led by the professor (lecture) or the TA. Student discussion in such a large class can get way to distracted and boring. Discussions get over concentrated among few students.It has such like a dispute for few second to \"run the show\". There is no time for everyone to talk.",
    "The discussion sessions can be more stimulating. Also Bowers is too large for this class."
