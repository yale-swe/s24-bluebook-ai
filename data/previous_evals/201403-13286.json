    "The pace of L3 Korean with Professor Choi is much faster than that of L1\/L2 with Professor Lee. You learn a lot of vocabulary (at least 52 words per lesson plus a lot of miscellaneous vocabulary) and a lot of grammar (5-7 new grammatical constructions each lesson). Professor Choi speaks mostly in Korean during lecture and can be intimidating although she's actually not as strict as she seems. She's a traditionalist and we had to do more memorization and recitation than I thought necessary (ahem, zero), but I ended up learning a lot. Class time often felt less productive than it could have been. In any case, you'll learn a lot.",
    "KREN 130 is the next class in the solid Korean language sequence. The class experience, though, depends heavily on who is teaching it. Professor Choi is a fairly traditional language teacher. Class is spent going through powerpoint slides and repeating after Professor Choi grammar and vocabulary. There is an expectation that you learn outside of class, primarily by reading the textbook before coming to class. Thus, class oftentimes felt like an addition to my Korean learning than the main aspect. So, be prepared for a significant individual component, as class time sometimes felt wasted. Professor Choi is awesome 1-1 though so do not hesitate to ask her questions at her office hours. In class it is a little more hectic. I learned a ton, though, from Professor Choi and the more difficult textbook she used. Definitely read the textbook, it helps you understand the grammar much better and if you're into it, has a whole bunch of additional grammar and vocab that you can learn on your own.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. Extremely disorganized and messy. It completely discouraged me from wanting to continue my academic career in learning Korean.",
    "Definitely take KREN 130 if you have a chance and want to further improve your language skills. Professor Choi might seem intimidating at first but she is really open to questions and helping you with whatever language struggles you might have. Korean is a good foreign language to take at Yale."
