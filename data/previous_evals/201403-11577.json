    "Question 11 I really think that the class could be better than how it was taught in this semester. There were too many guest lectures without any prior concepts\/terminologies were given to the students. Out of 100%, I guess I was 80% lost in this class, especially for the guest lectures. The guest lectures were very valuable in providing the information on how the things worked in the practical world, but they were so hard to understand for folks that did not have any prior experience on finance world before. I liked the class more when Deborah was teaching. She was clear. I only hoped that she would have devoted more time in \"teaching\" the class.",
    "To be honest, this class was a disappointment for me. I'm not really sure what I learned other than getting some additional practice with DCF's. While well intentioned, I think this was driven largely by the fact that we had so many guest speakers. Other then our last one, none of them were very good and I wasn't sure what I was supposed to take away from the lectures. Court was especially painful. I think this class would have been better with more, but shorter assignments. That way I wouldn't be so lost in starting my final one. I would also flip the second and first modeling exercises: The first one was MUCH harder than the second one. The other big advice I have is changing the time-slot for this class. I am not sure it is possible, but having this two days a week during the day would have kept me much more engaged in the subject matter.",
    "Pace - hard to answer this question because it likely went way to fast for some and way too slow for others. I\"ll say it was just right, because I know it tried to compromise. However, we should have learned more than we did. The explanation of LEV was far too rushed and I now never use it - which I don't think is a problem. Also, we never talked about the assumptions needed to build a model. That would have been useful - how many carbon credits\/acre? Learning how to reason through this in class as opposed to blindly making up numbers, could have been useful. Teaching - I really like Deborah. Her personality really added to my learning - at least initially. Towards the end of the course, her attention to the course and clarity seems to lessen. Speakers - some were much more valuable than others. Some were just boring and spoke much longer than they needed to.",
    "This class came so highly recommended due to class discussions and concepts learned from the readings. I was disappointed that we did not have any class discussions and were never once held accountable for the readings.",
    "There was little direction in this course for how to actually value forestland and forest services. Additional instruction, assignments and direct feedback would have been helpful. I also would not have so many guest speakers - guest speakers don't really know how to teach and having too many of them disrupts the continuity of the course.",
    "This course is essential for student like myself (MF candidate, interested in forest management, no prior experience with finance). However, I wish that Deborah had taught more of it. Every time she led the class it was excellent. I particularly liked the first few classes. As soon as the guest speakers took over, the class became too advanced and the SOM students seemed to take over. I would have greatly appreciated more time of the basics of finance before jumping into talks which were somewhat too advanced for my understanding. That said, the assignments were useful and I feel like I can now do basic financial modeling. More timely feedback on assignments would have been great, but I understand that they take a long time to grade. Best speaker: The man at the end of the course from The Conservation Fund. His presentation was accessible to all of the students and seemed to cover many of the topics discussed in class."

    "I did not really enjoy the class.",
    "Eh...practicing DCF's?",
    "deborah's clear and engaging teaching style that kept us going for three hours on tuesday nights... she brought life and humor to finance. a few of the speakers were also brilliant to listen to.",
    "It was a great overview of concepts that forestry students should be aware of.",
    "I had never done finance so getting to understand those concepts while applying them to my field was great.",

    "To get to know the real world's situation",
    "content\/subject matter",
    "Well-designed assignments that forced students to deal with the discomfort of imperfect information. Some good speakers, and some very helpful readings.",
    "Deborah is a wizard when it comes to explaining the course material, particularly when she speaks with extra candidness. I wish she taught more of the course.",
    "The assignments were fun and really important to understanding the concepts. Some of the guest lectures like Evan Smith were also great.",
    "Deborah is an excellent lecturer and she presents material in an interesting, engaging, and organized way. Assignments were very useful because they were based on real-world situations, and guest lecturers were, for the most part, good at providing insight into forest finance operations.",
    "Deborah is a knowledgeable and effective teacher. Her presentations were clear and made it easy to learn the concepts. Getting to learn from her was the best part of the course.",
    "The material. This is the area I want to work in and gain an internship! It was interesting to hear from guest lectures, but a basic understanding the concepts was often lost as a consequence.",
    "This course provided great experience in building financial models and developing proformas to use in assessing properties. It offered very practical tools and concepts.",
    "Deb is a fantastic teacher and her explanations seem to satisfy both the newcomer to finance and those with more experience. I liked the fundamentals covered in the beginning of the course, and the assignments were great ways to have to use my own judgment in realistic situations."

   "comments": [
    "The quality of the guest speakers was variable, and I sometimes felt that they did not cover the fundamentals that I would have liked to learn in class.",
    "The way the class is structured needs to be improved. I would prefer Deborah was teaching for the first hour for giving us some background, and then followed by the guest lectures for the rest two hours. I think I would gain more from this class if it was structured this way. The TAs of the class: Heather and Jennifer are very smart and they understand very well the content of the class. However, I really wish they could be more helpful and responsive for questions that we addressed to them. I also wish they better managed their office hours by having more permanent\/regular office hours. It was really frustrating that they did not have any regular office hours while the assignments were confusing\/difficult, and Deborah was not at school. They were not responsive through email either.",
    "I came in expecting a greater balance between the timber and conservation finance portions of the course. found the segments on timber to be dominant. while it is crucial to learn about timber finance as a foundation, perhaps a little bit more weight could be placed on exploring integrated timber and conservation finance models. it would also be great if the class could take on a more international lens.",
    "It would be great if Deborah could lecture more next year. Though the speakers were interesting i got the most out of Deborah's lectures.",
    "Deborah was such a great lecturer, I almost wish we had less guest lecturers and more lectures from her where we really dive into the material.",
    "I found the integration between forestry and finance to be a little lacking. The class was more heavily weighed for students with a finance background. While great for those students, I think it is unfortunate that the forestry students did not get to participate as much due to the gap in knowledge. This is particularly unfortunate in the sense that this may be the only finance class many forestry students will take.",
    "- regular office hour would be helpful the information was always announce just before the deadline of the assignment - too many guest lectures lectures by Deborah was really clear and helpful. I had heard time connecting content of the guest lectures and what we learned from the Deborah's lecture.",
    "organization - I had a good handle on the material when I came in so I could roll with the ambiguity and lack of direction, but I imagine it was very challenging for those without prior experience Homework - some of the models we were given were incredibly complicated (formulas etc.) - seemed to undermine the goal of learning when they are too complicated to understand..",
    "General lack of organization and structure. Many guest lecturers and no strong underlying progression through topics after the first few weeks. Many speakers seemed to be poorly briefed, and gave repetitive \"intro to forest finance\" lectures, or just pitched their own companies.",
    "The guest lecturers. While some were fantastic and the real world application was a bonus, I didn't feel like I sacrificed a stronger understanding of the material to spend more time with guest lecturers. I wish we spent more time with the readings and smaller assignments than with the guest lecturers.",
    "Too many guest lecturers--I know we were the guinea pigs for this format, but I think there are gaps in our knowledge that inevitably occur when teaching is outsourced to guests. The joint degree and SOM students, because they had a higher initial understanding of the subject, dominated during the guest lectures. A lot of this material went over the heads of the typical FES students. Deb did a good job teaching to different ability levels, but other lecturers did not--they mostly taught at a higher level of finance than other courses.",
    "While I appreciate the format of guest lecturers and the different perspectives, it makes it difficult to gain information in an orderly way.",
    "Guest speakers sometimes did not cover the required material and Deborah had to fill in the gaps.",
    "Class discussion. I would have preferred greater learning from my peers. We had such an interesting mix of business and forestry students and the knowledge of each was never transferred.",
    "The course needed a clear framework, with updates made in the syllabus. Many changes were made throughout the semester, and it was often difficult to decipher which readings were paired with which speakers, etc. An updated syllabus would have provided a better road map as well as a reference document later on, when reviewing the course and the materials presented. Also, Deborah could have better introduced and debriefed us with the guest speaker lectures. It was sometimes difficult to follow them, since they all made assumptions our level of financial knowledge. Many of the terms they used were unfamiliar to me, as I'm not a business school student. Better briefing of the speakers, as well as the class before and after a guest speaker, would have helped with our learning curve. This also could have helped to better tie together the lecture and make connections to the readings and assignments. It was a bit disjointed without more explanation from the instructor.",
    "I think more of a case study approach to some assignments\/examples could be useful. A couple of the assignments (those geared toward making decisions regarding whether to invest or not in a project) felt like I was just taking shots in the dark. I would have benefited from Deb walking us through what she would have done in each scenario, sharing her logic with us. I know that a lot of it comes down to each of our values, but I would have appreciated hearing more about her perspective. I felt like many of the guest speakers were presenting on material that I couldn't really connect with. This was especially true of the earlier speakers. I think that part of this was due to having very few lectures\/classes devoted to the basics before we moved right into advanced topics. Also, many of the students in the course (presumably from SOM) used a great deal of jargon in their questions and comments, and seemed to dominate the Q & A. At an interdisciplinary school all students need to make a better effort to not use jargon (when possible). Perhaps this could be emphasized by the teacher. I sensed that for some of the students they wanted to course to be more advanced (SOM students) and for some (myself, and a few other MFs I know) it moved a little too fast, particularly when the guest speakers started. I haven't noticed as much tension of this nature in my other classes at F&ES. I was under the impression that it was a fairly introductory course, but given a lack of other more advanced courses, maybe it is inevitable that this broad of a student body would choose to participate."

I took this course hoping that it would provide me with a foundation in forest finance and enable me to walk into a timber investment firm on day one and know how to perform basic valuation tasks. While the instruction was useful from a theoretical standpoint (I now know what wetland restoration credit markets look like), I left the course with no idea on how to actually build their value into a model. Likewise with timber growth & yield - I don't understand which assumptions can be modified and which ones are fixed. Without this, it is difficult to determine how to actually increase the value of a property (from a financial standpoint).",
    "For the most part. I feel like I gained a lot from this course, but given the quantity of the topics and conversation that I couldn't understand, I could have gained so much more if the learning had been more structured (more presentations by Deb, fewer by other guest speakers). That being said, it's an essential course and Deb is a great teacher - if her schedule can only allow her to offer the course if there are many guest speakers (so, exactly as it was), then by all means continue to do so. F&ES benefits greatly from having Deb as a teacher."
