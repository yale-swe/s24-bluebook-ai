   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend if you are a humanities major looking for a fun and easy science credit, or anybody looking for a laid-back kind of engagement with a very interesting set of material.",
    "Absolute best science credit for a non-science person. The material is relevant to daily life and taught at a very manageable level. You go way beyond plant physiology to societal uses of trees ... couldn't recommend it highly enough.",
    "A introductory course on the anatomy, growth, and development of trees, as well as their ecological role\/function. Land use histories related to trees were also explored, as well as the various properties of different woods and their implications for construction, furniture, and musical instruments.",
    "This was a fantastic class. Professor Broderson is a wealth of knowledge. I would recommend this to anyone interested in trees, plant physiology, or the environment.",
    "Would highly recommend. Is a pretty easy class and for those who are non science majors this would be a great class. Brodersen does a lot of hands on work to keep the topic engaging and everything is very well explained",
    "I would recommend this class to non-science majors, especially those looking for a science credit.",
    "I think Trees is a wonderful science credit. It was much more challenging than I anticipated it being, but it was never too much work. Tests require a lot of preparation, but homeworks were super manageable and reasonable. I loved the lectures and learned a lot. I also appreciated how much of it was hands on and practical.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class!! Professor Brodersen is fantastic, and he makes the already interesting course material even better with his adorable enthusiasm. I took this for one of my science credits, and I felt like I learned a ton, real biology included, without having to stress all that much because of the easy grading and scarce homework assignments. The field trips to the furniture exhibit and the musical instruments museum were great too! An all-around amazing class.",
    "Anyone who wants to understand the environment around them in an interactive way would love this class. It's biggest strength is how accessible it is to people who are not as knowledgeable in the sciences as others, but is also very stimulating for people that study science, especially environmental studies. It is also very interdisciplinary because of the hands-on activities and field trips that we had as part of our assignments. Not many classes have you explore the trees of campus, visit the furniture museum or hold a violin in the Collection of Musical Instruments - especially for the purpose of learning how it all relates back to trees and wood! The lectures were clear, entertaining and shared with us outside of class so we always had them as a study resource. I would recommend it to anyone!",
    "You get to learn all about trees, which is really fascinating. From physiology to flowers to giant beavers, every lecture could be expanded into its own course."
