    "Good MCDB course. Different from the traditional courses offered in the major. Less focus on specific mechanistic detail and far more focus on applications.",
    "This is a really good class to take as a senior MCDB or science major because it is a comprehensive overview of all topics and how it relates to the science and business of the biotech industry. I learned a lot and am happy I took this class. Craig Crews was very inspiring.",
    "This course felt like a crash course on biotechnology and after it's completion I definitely felt like I learned so much about so many areas of biotechnology and its' advancements.",
    "I learned how to apply the basic skills from my intro and intermediate-level science courses to biotechnology.",
    "MCDB 370 provided valuable insight into applications of the knowledge we have been able to build over the past few years of core science classes. I was held accountable for the scientific reasoning and skills I've developed in previous courses, which was both refreshing and challenging - but it was never to an extent to which I was uncomfortable with the material presented. Of note, the innate variety of biotechnological material presented was fascinating and elucidated the broad applicability of biology. The focus on industry, which is often ignored, was also particularly insightful. I was challenged to think critically about modern medicine, to understand the underlying principles and politics of existing interventions, and to apply various biological models within physiological contexts.",
    "Excellent course. Biotechnology is a broad and complex field. I think this course did an excellent job at introducing various areas of biotechnology and innovations within these areas.",
    "I learned a lot about pharmaceuticals, drug development, plants, and many forms of biotechnology.",
    "In this course, you learn a lot about the applications of biological concepts you learned in biochemistry, molecular and cellular biology, genetics, ecology, etc. You also learn about the business strategies, marketing, and institutional processes in the field of biotechnology."

   "comments": [
    "The midterm exam was pretty difficult because it was hard to gauge what the scope of the questions would be. I would have preferred a Discussion Section focused on Review that clearly outlined what the major topics would be. I loved all of the guest speakers, their number was by far one of the biggest draws of the course.",
    "This is a really good class to take as a senior MCDB or science major because it is a comprehensive overview of all topics and how it relates to the science and business of the biotech industry. I learned a lot and am happy I took this class. Craig Crews was very inspiring.",
    "There are so many different concentrations that fall under the realm of \"biotechnology\" so I enjoyed being able to learn about these various topics from the experts in each area. That being said, it was very difficult to switch between the various teaching styles of all of the different professors. I also found the quizzes to be organized in an unfair manner. With such a large amount of material covered i each lecture, there was quite a bit that we were told to be responsible for for both quizzes, making it heard to hone in on specific details in the studying process. However, both quizzes focused on VERY minor details and questioned exclusively on a single lecture and even a single topic. Since these quizzes counted for so much, I found it very unfair that our knowledge of many weeks of material was being assessed by our knowledge on one very minor topic. I feel that the same goes for the midterm exam. We were told to be responsible for many many lectures, all rich in content. However, the midterm itself focused disproportionately on one or two lectures, asking little to no questions on the ENTIRE other lectures! Obviously, in balancing focusing our studying equally on all of the lectures, our focus on the details of each one was difficult. This made the test a very bad reflection of how much we did in fact know.",
    "The course suffered, as all courses with multiple instructors do, from a lack of cohesion and lack of consistent style of lecturing. Additionally, many aspects of course material were repeated over a number of lectures in a redundant way, with other parts of the material being given very short shrift. Overall, it seemed as if the communication between the instructors in terms of coordinating the course material and developing a coherent course rather than a survey in stops and starts, or a series of mini-courses, was lacking. The lectures themselves were by and large strong, but having four separate lectures by different professors being given on the same exact material was frustrating.",
    "I took this course to fulfill my upper-level MCDB requirement. Although it was interesting to take a class taught by 5 professors, this can get confusing because each professor has his\/her own teaching style. Furthermore, each professor\/TA may write different style exam questions, making the exams difficult to study for. The test questions can be quite ambiguous in terms of what the graders are looking for. Furthermore, the grading distribution of this class was not optimal. Having the two quizzes worth 25% of our grade was stressful. Aside from these weaknesses, the class material was very interesting and relevant.",
    "Biotech has been one of my favorite courses while at Yale, given its penchant for working off an assumed foundation of knowledge within the field. The lack of regurgitation of core principles of biology and the emphasis on distinct pathways and applications was refreshing and provided rapid acceleration of course material - although I should note that the cursory background introductions were quite helpful in contextualizing the work we were doing, and should therefore not be removed from the course material. I especially enjoyed the variety of fields we were exposed to. The course could be improved by introduction of practice exam questions -- given the variation between the professors and their specific expectations, it was difficult to discern the level of application that would be required by students. On a similar vein, it would be helpful if students were able to review the key for the midterm exam or quizzes, as feedback could be unclear. Of course, I will say that the exam questions were fair, and that these additions would just enhance the already incredible nature of the course.",
    "Weaknesses would be that due to the layout of the course, the professors sometimes covered the same material twice. The guest lecturers were particularly strong. All of the professors had interesting lectures that were presented with clarity.",
    "The strengths are that wide array of topics covered. The weaknesses are the course often feels disjointed and disconnected. The professors don't seem to interact with each other much outside of the classroom. The material they covered was not tested equally and so some was emphasized more than other.",
    "The rotation of different professors was very effective! You end up learning about so many different fields from experts in each. The discussion sections were also fantastic and actually covered weaknesses in pharmacology and medical research.",
    "Overall the course really gives a great perspective to a graduating MCDB major about the major discoveries and scientific approaches that have defined the potential of biotechnology to solve real world problems and treat diseases. However, the fact that the course was taught by so many different professors made it challenging and at times confusing to prepare for exams and know what to expect in terms of grading. I really enjoyed the lectures and feel like they made a really valuable contribution to my knowledge as an MCDB major. At the same time, I think that the logistics is one of the major weaknesses of this course, which often made it feel disorganized."

    "Good course, disjointed but still good. Interesting topics, some instructors were better than others. You should take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I was a great way to learn about the applicability of basic science concepts taught in lower level classes to clinical contexts and also provided fascinating insight into some of the business side of science not touched on by most biology courses.",
    "Yes.",
    "This is a really good class to take as a senior MCDB or science major because it is a comprehensive overview of all topics and how it relates to the science and business of the biotech industry. I learned a lot and am happy I took this class. Craig Crews was very inspiring.",
    "I definitely got a very broad overview on biotechnology by taking this course and that was definitely interesting. However, I think the testing and grading in this course was truly unfair, so if you take this course I would recommend doing it Credit\/D",
    "I would recommend this class, be aware that it is not a single class so much as a lecture series, but the knowledge and material is fascinating, well-presented, and highly relevant to today's biotech industry.",
    "I took this course to fulfill my upper-level MCDB requirement.

Having the two quizzes worth 25% of our grade was stressful. Aside from these weaknesses, the class material was very interesting and relevant. It would be nice to have better gender representation. Professor Clay was the only female lecturer.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The course material is exciting and is framed well by the accompanying prerequisites - making this a refreshing and appropriate course for further work and expansion within MCDB. The exams are not cumulative and the course work is particularly light (a single summary a week), but the course material is rather engaging and exciting. It is worth noting that the course is taught by a slew of professors who run between two and five lectures, along with a few guest lecturers. Each lecturer presents on a different field and all are capable of linking their syllabi to core principles that run throughout the course of the class, which allows for a smooth process.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you are interested in biotechnology. It is a fantastic experience, and you will learn a ton.",
    "Yes, but beware that it is disorganized.",
    "Absolutely. This is a fantastic, well-taught upper-level MCDB course. It's incredibly well-refined because it's been taught for over 20 years. You actually learn practical things and will gain useful insights for future careers in biotechnology, medicine, or business."
