    "I really enjoyed this course and Tom was very helpful.",
    "Tom Swarr was an incredible resource when working through the client projects. He was also very realistic when describing the strengths and limitations of LCA as a tool for measuring environmental impacts.",
    "In this version of the course, Edgar Hertwich had minimal involvement, only coming in for two or three lectures more along his area of expertise (carbon footprinting, energy sources). Thomas Swarr was the most involved with the course and was great during lecture. A suggestion to make class more compelling is to directly\/explicitly reference the readings for each lecture. It felt like most students were disengaged with lecture and material that was interesting and important to understand because we did not complete the readings and were not properly situated in each topic prior to class.",
    "The information gained about using SimaPro software was very useful, but unfortunately I'm concerned that this software is obsolete in many instances and that most employers no longer use this. The topic of life cycle assessment is fascinating but unfortunately the lectures do not do it justice and a majority of the students did not even listen to the lectures, nor did they do the reading.",
    "The client project was very helpful. Class time was not helpful",
    "Professor Swarr is very patient and helpful. I appreciate that he encouraged our opinions on how to make the course better. He is also constantly checking in to see how we felt or where we were with the project or software, understanding fully well how frustrating the process can me. Offered helpful additional materials to support the project and constructive feedback for homework and project work.",
    "The course was really inefficient. You couldn't do any work with your client until you learned the software and that took half of the semester. then it was too little time to do much with your client. I suggest splitting into two courses. Thomas was really nice but most lectures felt pointless and I didn't get much from them. I wish he would compress his toughts and only talk about the most important stuff. We should use the time in class towards the end of the semester to work with our clients and have the prof be there to help us. It would be goo to have office hours in the comp lab."

    "THE PROJECT, BY FAR.",
    "I loved working on a group project with a real client to apply what was learned in the class.",
    "My favorite thing was how practical it was.",
    "I enjoyed working on the client project and putting the skills learned in the problem sets to work on a real example.",
    "LCA is so important to know and understand! If only more companies and clients were interested in measuring and quantifying their potential environmental impact through LCA. But this course allows you to understand the theoretical framing of LCA in addition to learning how to use the most comprehensive (and complex) analytical software to perform LCA modeling.",
    "The client project because it gave us a chance to build a model in LCA. I wish that the TA had been encouraged to meet with each group before they started their model to go over the approach since our group built our model incorrectly and it would have been beneficial to have assistance in identifying the best approach.",
    "Good 'hard' \/ practical skill to have for students interested in the Industrial Ecology \/ Corporate Sustainability space. Software aside, the course also provides general framework for understanding how a product's impact are assessed. The client project was very rewarding especially if the clients are LCA experts themselves.",

   "comments": [
    "lectures didn't help with my knowledge base. I would recommend getting into simapro more often",
    "It was hard to jump into working with a client without truly understanding the SimaPro software first. We were asking our client for data based on what we thought we might need, and then going back to them as we learned more of what was required to build our model, and eventually it got too late in the project to keep asking for more data.",
    "LCA is a critical skill to have (or at least understand) for those going into CSR. However, learning the foundations of the course at the same time as consulting with a real world client is not an appropriate model. Additionally, not having the class in a computer lab is a huge mistake. Learning was significantly impeded by not being able to work through software issues with the instructor in real time. Conceptual material would have been much better understood, had it been applied to a model built in class. Big missed opportunity here.",
    "More case studies would have been nice.",
    "The SimaPro learning curve is quite steep, so perhaps having one class a week in the computer lab to work through the software foundations together would be beneficial.",
    "This course has a lot of material to fit into one semester. I feel that there needs to be a more comprehensive effort devoted to LCA theory and knowledge, even if it would probably be dry and boring for most students. But with LCA methodology as flexible and sometimes arbitrary as it is allowed to be, there should be more training and discussion around what is and what isn't permissible, else we leave the class learning incorrect methodologies and parameters for carrying out LCA. This is already touched upon throughout the class, but I think it was somewhat lost once the client projects started and it was difficult to just keep all streams of thought separate once we were dealing with so much knowledge.",
    "The lectures. Maybe there could be a way that each student has an LCA topic that they have to learn and then they each present to make it more interesting. I liked the homework assignments and really enjoyed the client project.",
    "More support on software. A lab is totally necessary for this class. Simply showing how the software works in class is not helpful. Having lecture held in a computer lab might solve this problem. OR having a 1-3 hour lab section a week where both the TA and professor are there to help answer software questions could be offered as a stand in if the lecture is not taught in a lab.",
    "First, you are definitely disadvantaged if you don't have SimaPro readily on your personal computer\/laptop. The software was incompatible with my Mac and SimaPro is something you want to open multiple times a day to experiment and explore with. Finding time to work at the IT lab proved to be challenging. At the end I felt I was still not exposed enough to the software. The structure of the course which included the client project detracted from us building our SimaPro skills. The project was demanding and there were other aspects such as communications, data availability and report building that you had to juggle on top of the other homework. A bit too much, as almost all of us were new to the software and just wanted time to understand it better. I think that most of us took the course to be versed in the software and deciphering the impact assessments. Not sure we full achieved that.",
    "There is too much material covered in this course - how to use Simapro, lifecycle analysis, and working with a client all at the same time is a bit overwhelming and you don't feel ready to dive in with your client until you're comfortable using the software. Also, the client scope should be more clear and the client's expectations should be the same as the students. It would be helpful to have one session or an evening session on setting up a proper timeline and meeting deliverables throughout the semester in order to deliver solid recommendations and analysis.",
    "Structure of the course does not work. Split into two courses.",
    "Classes should be held in the computer lab. More individual assignments Weekly group tutorial sessions for Sima Pro More critical discussion and examples from Sima Pro during the conceptual classes (power points)"

Only one or two people can work on a model like this at once, but if you don't work on the model then you cannot write the report of the project because you don't understand the model. Myself and one other group member volunteered to build the model, and then eventually had to write the whole report anyway because our two other group members did not understand the project. There was no way around this.",
    "We had SIGNIFICANT free rider issues. There is no team evaluation component of the course, so there is virtually no accountability. Also, with the limitations of the software, building a model and revising it throughout the semester as a team is incredibly difficult and slow moving.",
    "Group work was good",
    "I enjoyed the group work aspect of this course, particularly since we worked well together and shared the project work evenly. With larger groups, it would have been challenging to share the same SimaPro database and split up the group work among all the team members.",

    "Needed more support on the model. Hard to all learn the software in a large group.",
    "A lot of the group members did not put in there fair share of work. It was difficult to break up the model work among 4 people",
    "Luck factor here. My team mates were great and efficient and we had wonderful clients (GE). GE had LCA specialists and dedicated an engineer for the project. Thus we had plenty of expert help and data to work with, unlike some of the other teams. Because of the software's limitation to transfer project data between computers, only one of us ended up intensively working with the software.",
