   "comments": [
    "English 120 is about learning how to read and write the modern essay. You read interesting essays by influential and contemporary authors and learn how to revise your own work through drafts and peer review. Yes I would absolutely recommend this class, it is the first class I've taken in a while that has genuinely changed the way I write. My writing has slowly but surely improved.",
    "Definitely take it. It is a pretty solid amount of work, but it helps you improve as a writer.",
    "English 120 is a great course and I highly recommend it to everyone. I enjoyed the course, the readings and even the five papers I had to write for the course. It is a lot of writing, but it is very different from the types of writing I have to do for most of my other courses and I actually enjoyed writing the essays for this class. The readings are very interesting-funny, pertinent, and not just full books for us to read. The reading is quite manageable and enjoyable.",
    "This was an incredible course. You read about three essays for each class and discuss them when you meet. Every week, you either hand in a rough draft or final draft of an essay you write. There are five final drafts by the end of the semester. Professor Stuart was an excellent professor and resource. I loved the readings and felt that might writing improved tremendously. I also feel this course cemented for me just what writing I love to do.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 120 to another student. It was such a fun class and I really did learn so much from it.",
    "The course is really good, extraordinarily useful for learning how to write. The readings are really insightful and usually fun to read. The essay-every-two-weeks aspect of it is really tough, but justified and understandable. I would've liked some more analysis of the pieces to identify how we could relate the to our essays, since once in a while there seemed to be a disconnect between what the professor was discussing in class and what we were meant to write about.",
    "I would recommend it. You will write five essays which are based on personal experience and which must have a public point. It is a great course, a classic, and teaches to write in a different and very useful style. The essays will probably end up being essay you will want to re read later in life."
