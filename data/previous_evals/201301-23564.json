    "An excellent and much needed class, and a great run for a first attempt.More depth and scientific rigor in the cosmology and ecology sections would be great, and might attract more FES students. Teachers were incredible mentors and people. I loved being in conversation with them and feel really seen and supported."

    "The material of the course is so different than any other course you will find at Yale, both in the graduate and undergraduate schools. The interdisciplinary approach is truly illuminating and helpful for anyone interested in either religion, the environment, or both!",
    "Chance to integrate deep thinking and holistic questions and emotional and psychic experience into our environmental work. Mindblowingness of the material.",
    "The best aspect of this course was the enriching dialogue that Mary Evelyn and John immersed and invited us in to every class. It was truly inspiring walking out of class every day and feeling a renewed sense of purpose and vigor for the great work that we are undertaking."

   "question_id": "FS0044",

   "comments": [
    "Because the course covers so much material, it ends up moving quite fast and it is difficult to fully grasp everything. The only way to fix this probably would be to split the course into two separate semesters though, because all of the information is vital.",
    "Discussions were often too student led\/meandering...more focus and discipline with some of the readings and discussions would be useful, more rigorous survey of concepts and ideas aside from \"how we feel about it\"...Breaking up the course into 2 sections a week would be better for me energetically.",

Its also an area I am comfortable thinking in and in some ways it didn't fully push me as much as I'd hoped. I think it was so great to have it though and look forward to seeing how it will develop.",

   "comments": [
    "The knowledge from the course definitely met my expectations. It did leave me with more questions than answers ultimately, but that is just the nature of the syllabus. It allows for a very open-ended conclusion, where each student can take whatever they find as most essential to their own coursework.",
    "Yes, more or less. As said above, slightly more scientific rigor would be good. The course felt slightly weighted towards the divinity school students. But overall much in line with what I hoped to gain. Mary Evelyn and John and just brilliant humans.",
    "Yes. The knowledge and perspectives I gained from this course wildly exceeded my expectations."

    "Do not fall behind on the readings, as this will make the three hour seminar quite boring and just difficult to understand. Because it is such new material for most, it is important to stay on top of everything. If you are going to take the course, be prepared to prioritize as one of the most important courses of your semester. Otherwise, it will just be overwhelming and unfulfilling in the end.",
    "Bring the critical mind and really dig in, use this as a chance to open your big beautiful heart.",
    "Take this course. It is one of those that will leave an indelible impression on you for the rest of your life, and it is an utter pleasure to interact with Mary Evelyn and John on a regular basis."
