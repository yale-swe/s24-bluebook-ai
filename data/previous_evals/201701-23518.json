    "Unfortunately I could only go on one of the two field trips, but the one I went on was informative and I'm glad I went. Jessica is a fantastic professor. I took her Land Use Seminar in the fall, and was exited to take another course with her this spring. She is accessible, patient, kind, and very clear in her instruction. If you're interesting in land use planning, take a class with her!"

    "Jessica is very flexible and cares that everyone gets what they want out of this course. She is aware that everyone would like to have a project that they can discuss at interviews etc. so she was very flexible in making the project work for everyone. I got to work on the project that I was most interested in, with a great client, and semester ran smoothly.",
    "Jessica is one of the best professors- organized, clear, direct, and very responsive. This class was really helpful and well put together!",
    "The best part of the course was the professional environment and autonomy given to the students. It was designed in a very intelligent way...not sure how the instructor managed the various projects given the variety of demands from students and the projects themselves. However, I was impressed with the attention given. The course included a well thought out lecture series, with great outside speakers and contributors.",
    "Working on client projects and the field trips",
    "The project work - very helpful in learning more about topics.",
    "The ability to work with a client to solve a real problem",
    "A significant amount of learning came from working directly with clients during the project portion of the course",
    "The professor is flexible and the projects are often on the leading edge of research in certain areas. Therefore you have a lot of freedom to go where to the project takes you as long as the client is in agreement.",
    "The projects and the field trips both provide interaction with communities and exposure to real world land use issues. It's a very practical course and has a wide variety of project options.",
    "Jessica is a great professor! The whole point of the course is the clinical project, so I'd say that's the best aspect. It gives you real, hands-on experience with a client, which is a nice break from regular classroom work."

    "I wanted to have some real life experience with land use and urban water management.",
    "The course offered a capstone project that was perfectly aligned with my academic focus and interests in oil and gas. Not having to create a project from scratch saved a lot of time. Additionally, the project required someone with a strong marketing and branding background to see the project to launch. My combination of skills and background allowed me to focus on creating high-level content and a high-quality finished product, rather than spend the time acquiring new skills for the sake of the exercise, which I believe served quite well, the students and professors who put in valuable time before me.",
    "Wanted to work on the client project and Jessica is a great instructor.",
    "Did not have a background in land use, and this was an opportunity to gain more knowledge about land use challenges and policies.",
    "To learn more about how communities can be engaged in the siting of large renewable energy projects.",
    "I am interested in land use and urban planning. This course provides very practical skills and related experience.",
    "I really enjoyed Jessica's fall course. I thought having some hands-on clinical experience would be a good idea, and I also thought that diving a little deeper into land use planning would serve as a nice compliment to my interest in land conservation."

    "We were able to accomplish more than if it had just been one person.",
    "We didn't have group work, per se, but each student had a semester long clinical project which was the foundation of our learning in the course. I enjoyed my project a lot. I had a great supervisor, and I learned a lot."

    "I would suggest students think about what they hope to get out of the course and select a project based off of those interests and skills. I would also suggest that students set clear boundaries with their client at the beginning of the semester. If things are at all unclear, it becomes difficult to deliver a true \"final product\" at the end of the semester.",
    "Jessica is a great person to know, and work with. No matter your interests and direction, I recommend taking her course. We often meet people who have amazing qualities about them (work ethic, integrity, tact, grace, etc.) that have little to do with the \"job\", and the experience of being with that person or working with that person transcends the task, and ends up being more valuable in the long-run. Jessica has that unique quality about her, I learned more from her 'the professional' than I did the course - which is not something advertised on the syllabus!",
    "If you're excited about a client project take this course. Jessica is great and the field trips are informative and fun.",
    "If you are interested in learning about land use planning and happy to take a class where the assignments center on a project for a partner organization, that you will enjoy this course.",
    "Jessica is a great professor, and if you want more exposure to land use with the opportunity to work on a wide array of interesting projects you should take this course.",
    "Jessica is great a resource and a good person to know. As long as you pick a project applicable to your interests and one you are excited about, you will have a great experience. It isn't an overly time-consuming class but you can get a lot out of it.",
    "Budget your time wisely! It's easy to push off project work since the final deliverable isn't due until the last day of the semester, and class only meets once a week for an hour or so. There isn't much to hold you accountable, so it's easy to procrastinate. But then you might find yourself scrambling to complete everything in a timely manner as well as produce something with good quality."
