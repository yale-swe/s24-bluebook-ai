    "Yes, take it. You'll learn to perfect your grammar.",
    "YES!",
    "German is a great language to take here and I would recommend it because it is a language that could be useful in the technology\/engineering sector in the future and it's not too difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone. It is a great class and If you have already taken German it is perfect.",
    "I would recommend German 120 to anyone interested in either the German language or German culture. The course nicely mixes syntax, grammar, and diction with projects centered on expanding the student's knowledge about German, Austrian, and Swiss culture.",
    "I would highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would say this is a great course for you if you want to learn German.",
    "German 120 involves a lot of small projects, but keeps you immersed in the language. I would recommend it to a student if they are serious about working on his or her language skill.",
    "Highly recommend the class. I would also encourage GMAN 120 students to attend the cultural events and Kino dienstags.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking German 120. It is a super fun class! The workload is not overwhelming, but you need to be prepared to put in a fair amount of work, if not everyday, at least every other day. The homework is actually enjoyable and I felt as though german was a great class to have at 9:25 every day."
