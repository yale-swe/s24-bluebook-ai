   "comments": [
    "great",
    "Its ok! There are some problems with communication on assignments.",
    "The course was a good introduction to using ArcGIS software and the theoretical aspects of spatial analysis. The lab component of the course was critical and where most of the information was learned. The lectures were generally difficult to follow and it was not clear how the more technical\/statistical information is applied in the \"real world\". A more interactive lecture would be much more conducive to this type of course, perhaps by having the lecture in the lab where the instructor could integrate explaining the principles of GIS while demonstrating their application with the software concurrently. I also felt that the final project was somewhat disorganized. Many students had different interpretations as to what needed to be done and the TA and instructor gave my group different instructions.",
    "I learned a lot about GIS this semester. I felt that most of my learning happened in lab. 2 lectures each week seem to be a lot. It is hard to keep lectures from being dry. I would rather have 1 lecture per week and 2 labs per week so I could learn more interactively.",
    "GIS is a very interesting and useful skill to learn. Though I knew it had the potential of being interesting before choosing to take the course, I only appreciated how beneficial it could be when I completed my final project. Having said this, I feel the course should focus on having more lab sessions so that students can have the opportunity to practice more. Since GIS is totally new to 99% of the class, students should be guided thoroughly on the basics and given ample opportunity to familiarize with the software. In addition, the instructions for the labs should be more explicit for students to be able to follow without necessarily being guided by the TA.",
    "TAs were very helpful, lab course was relevant. Even though a textbook was assigned, lectures did not refer to it.",
    "This course taught me a great deal about the ArcGIS software and various tools within the software that are especially helpful for analyzing epidemiological research.I did feel that 2 hours of lecture each week was unnecessary. One hour per week would have been enough, because the computer lab component is where the bulk of software learning occurs.",
    "Good lab assignments. Lecture a little dry.",
    "GIS, is a resume builder like SAS, STATA, SPSS, etc therefore I cannot possibly regret taking this course. I think there is a huge disconnect between lab and the class in that Dr. Holford gives his presentation about what we will do and when lab comes we are rushing to get through it or to get the TA's attention. This would be better as a long lab-only course. OR AT LEAST OFFER A GIS 2 course that picks up where this semester left off. There is no way we learned enough to be more than familiar with GIS. While I feel 100% of what was taught was useful, I feel that I only learned a fraction of what could have been learned--more a problem with time than anything else.",
    "This is a good course. It is a little slow in the beginning but begins to pick up and we really get to learn GIS in labs. The teaching assistants are all very helpful.",
    "I like the lab session which transfer the knowledge on slides into real practice. I feel some concepts are not well explained as it is beyond the scope of the course. Sometimes I am confused by the formula due to the lack of maths or stats knowledge. But overall it is a very good course.",
    "GIS is a great skill set to have and the TFs for this class couldn't have been more wonderful. They all were available to meet with us outside of class when we needed it.",
    "This is very interesting course. Students can learn and master useful skills through this course. The computer lab is very good and designed very well. I suggest that all the EPH course should set up a computer lab for students to practice if the course contents are related to the use of software.If there are answer key posted for each assignment, it will be great",
    "Great class - loved the course material, and the lectures were informative. I liked it the way it was.",
    "The strength of this class is the lab - it's the only time where you actually get to learn GIS. The lecture some theory, but seemed completely divorced from any practical issues of using GIS. The main weakness is that it's very difficult to learn GIS from a powerpoint. This class would have been much more useful if lecture was only once a week, and the second lecture replaced either by the lab, or some sort of practical session where the professor opens up GIS and actually shows us how to apply concepts. Otherwise, attending lecture felt like a waste of time, as all the learning occurred in the lab.",
    "I feel like I mastered the basics of ArcGIS software and would feel comfortable using it in the future. That said, I feel like many of the assignments, particularly the final project, included extraneous information that did not teach or assess my abilities to use and analyze GIS data.",
    "Strengths:1. Instruction -- both professor, T. Holford, and 2 TAs, Keita Ebisu and Ryan Carney.A. The expertise of the instructorsB. The willingness of the instructors to assist you and\/or answers questions. Tremendous in this regard.Weaknesses:Due to the limited infrastructure at the YSPH, the class is bifurcated into lecture (passive slide and lecturn) and lab.A really strong GIS class would always include live programming and the opportunity for students to follow along on their own GIS machine.",
    "The lectures were not helpful or engaging. It probably would have been a better idea to add more lab time\/ assignments and cut down lecture. I felt that after the first few lectures, it wasn't helpful to attend them.",
    "After the first few lectures, the weekly hour lecture was completely noncontributory to learning GIS.I would have preferred having two weekly lab sessions over lecture and lab. Additionally, I wish there had been lectures that addressed real life applications of GIS, whether through work that has been done at Yale, by fellow students in the class or otherwise, or from the literature.Laboratory experiences need to be better directed, particularly during the first few labs when we are all (for the most part) GIS novices, referring particularly to *how* to use the system (e.g., even where certain buttons are).The final project was poorly designed and was obviously contrived out a necessity to give a final; it was not an informative learning tool and there was an extreme lack of organization around 1) how to complete the final project; and 2) what the expectations of us were.",
    "Overall this class could be very useful. However, I felt like there was a disconnect between the lecture and weekly labs.",
    "This class was a good introduction to GIS. I think that sometimes we spent too much time on mathematical theory rather than on learning GIS. Additional lab time or more opportunities to use ArcGIS might have been helpful.",
    "The course was really interesting and offered an impotant skillset. However, the lectures are extremely biostatistics-heavy and were often a bit over my head.",
    "too much lecture, too little lab",
    "It teaches a useful skill, and I think in retrospect, I learned quite a bit.",
    "Strengths - use of GIS to answer epidemiological related problemsWeaknesses - the course should have been focused more on the labs and not have a lecture component",
    "I felt that the lectures for this course were easy to understand and helpful in understanding the basics of GIS. On occasion, however, the lectures were difficult to follow since we did not have the GIS computer system in front of us. I was better-able to really master the concepts in lab.I felt that the midterm was fair in testing the concepts that we learned at the beginning of the semester. However, I found the final project somewhat confusing. My partner and I spent the majority of time (15 hours) manipulating the project data. We ran a SAS macro that took 45 minutes to process (as did the other students). I felt that this detracted from the learning experience because for the final I only spent a few hours working with the actual GIS program. Perhaps next year the data can be cleaned in advance so that students are able to spend more time working with GIS than with excel spreadsheets.",
    "it's strengths are in the notes and in the labs. they were very useful. the lecture could have been in a larger room, so that seats could be available to all.",
    "I found the mixture of lectures, labs, and final project to a be a good balance for the course. The TAs understood the material and wanted to ensure you understood the material by the time you left lab.",
    "Poor.The textbook should be replaced.",
    "it is very good useful",
    "final project was absurd and HORRIBLE. labs were great. lectures were pointless.",
    "I felt the course was much more theoretical than practical. After a semester, I'm still not sure how well I could really use GIS software. It might help to cover more program operation in class in addition to the time spent in lab.",
    "Strengths: VERY practical application for public health work after graduation. The labs were very helpful, more helpful than the actual lecture.Weaknesses: The final project needed required more thought and clarity before providing instructions to the students. The directions on completing the final assignment were very vague. The lecture concentrated on the theory of GIS (hard to understand without having the GIS software currently present). Lectures should be dismissed and instead, have lecture and lab at the same time. If this cannot be done, lectures should only be one time a week.",
    "Labs for this course were very unorganized, which made learning the material much harder than it should have been. The course would have been more enjoyable and I would have learned more if the lab TAs had gone through each lab step by step and also if there were systematic lab instructions for each lab. Thank you.",
    "The lectures were quite boring at times and could have been made more easier and less abstract for the students.",
    "The course itself is useful in the public health realm. Unfortunately, I thought the course was poorly taught. The lab instructions were not very helpful at times. When one were to do a lab on their own or missed a step in lab class because they were stuck on a previous step it would be hard for that student to pick up from where they were. For the midterm, I thought it was very unfair because I took the exam separately since I was out with the flu and I had all mathematical calculations which is not necessary in GIS. The majority of the labs that were taught in class were about mapping diseases and analyzing the maps in various ways not about math calculations. The midterm did not reflect that whatsoever. Also, I thought the work load for the final exam was not reasonable because there was no rubric\/guideline to follow. One could do anything and there was so many techniques that were taught in class that a group could spend many hours on the final exam to do just one technique andstill not be done."

This class would be much stronger if lecture was once a week, and the second lecture was either replaced by the lab, or some sort of practical session.

    "Yes I would recommend this course for another student because I think that understanding GIS is a useful skill to have while pursuing a career in public health.",
    "a great skill to learn, which could be invaluable later. this is an introduction, you'll just want to take more classes.",
    "This course covered both the theory and the practical aspects of GIS in public health. The final exam was a group project that brought together many aspects of the course. I would recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in public health and GIS.",
    "I would tell other students to attend the GIS workshops at Bass library, instead of taking this course.",
    "Yes",
    "The course mostly covers the statistical theory behind operations in GIS software. If you just want to learn how to use the program, I would try some of the classes offered through the library first then take this class if you want to learn more. If you are interested in statistics and GIS, the class is great. Beware of the final project though - it is a beast. Make sure to budget extra time.",
    "Yes, GIS is one of the practical courses offered here at YSPH. While other courses teach you what you can learn out of a book, this primarily lab-based course is very helpful if you want to be able to incorporate public health technology and knowledge together. This course will definitely help you with fulfilling your job duties in the public health field.",
    "Recommended. Very good course. Instructor and TAs are very approachable.Great skill acquired upon completing the course",
    "This course teaches you some basic tools of GIS but I would not say I am an expert in using this software. One should have previous SAS knowledge because many of the lab classes require SAS and GIS in order to map diseases. I would recommend this course to a student who has never taken GIS but someone who has had previous experience with the software probably is not learning more material as this course is not for advance students but for beginners."
