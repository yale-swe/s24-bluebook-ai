   "comments": [
    "strengths: great content. great exercises. the course overall is a good overview for linguistics students looking to get hands-on practice in doing statistics. weaknesses: maybe it's just me but the lectures are kind of easy to get lost in",
    "Interesting content, but more focus on worksheets and discussions and less time on lectures would be useful.",
    "This course is great because it teaches quantitative skills in a small seminar, which is more conducive to learning than large lectures. It's also great that it doesn't have prerequisites in statistics, as I had no statistical background. However, the lack of linguistics prerequisite meant we had to spend some time catching people up on the topics being discussed. Everyone in the class was coming from a different educational background which made learning together difficult even though it was interesting to have a diverse group - so I'm not sure how this could be solved for. I also loved that this course had no exams, unlike most quantitative courses.",
    "Strengths: very thorough introduction and interesting for all levels of experience due to incorporation of linguistics Weaknesses: lectures can sometimes be a bit dry and hard to understand",
    "Less R commands more stats",
    "You do come out of the class knowing how to interpret and analyze data in linguistics studies, but it helps a LOT to have some background in R or coding in general I didnt, and the learning curve was very steep. Class wasnt particularly helpful in teaching your how to use R as well because the commands and function arguments werent actually explained, it was more just a demonstration of pre-coded lines. A good number of people in the class were S&DS majors too taking it as an elective, just something to note. The linguistic theory behind some studies we looked at were briefly explained, just a quick run through of basic linguistics concepts nothing new if youve taken any linguistics before. Most helpful thing of the course was the comments on homework assignments",
    "Strengths of the course include the exercises, which helped to solidify how to use the R commands correctly. A weakness of the course was the somewhat dull lectures. It felt like most of the stuff could be looked up or read ahead of time, and class could have been spent just doing exercises or talking about linguistics.",
    "Honestly Professor Sanker is really great and super kind. The class is well organized and both she and Parker (our TA) really wants us to succeed",
    "The course is basically a small lecture with occasional pop quizzes and in class exercises. I would have preferred if visual aids accompanied the lectures, such as PowerPoint presentations."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you're interested in linguistics or data science or both, give it a shot! You'll learn lots about both fields alone and their intersection, even if you've never had experience in either.",
    "Yes, I think this is the perfect course for people interested in both linguistics and hard skills like R, but it's also a great course to take for stats people and non-stats linguists.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes if you want to learn how to think about linguistics from a stats point of view",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who likes linguistics and wants to learn a bit more about how the analyses are done.",
    "Absolutely! It was great to have this class as an introduction to linguistics!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a fun and light stats elective."
