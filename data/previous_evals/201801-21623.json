    "One good thing is that this course even exists to try to teach students musical literacy. At the same time, there are too few classes per week to make any real improvement in musical literacy - the students that are competent at the beginning remain competent, while those slightly less competent remain less competent.",
    "I really enjoy the course and recognize its practical and important usage for musicians; however, as one of the few musicians in my 218 and 219 classes who is neither a vocalist nor a singer, I constantly feel that I'm not good enough, especially by comparison. Though my professor did his best to accommodate my experience and background, I felt humiliated when one student in a class literally laughed at me when I tried to sing a piece (though simple) that I was struggling with. I think it would be really helpful to have a section for musicians who are non-keyboard or non-vocalists."

    "Yes - if you want to improve your musicianship skills as a serious musician.",
    "Absolutely; a great continuation of 218. Improved as a musician for sure",
    "Only if you have never had sight reading or musicianship eperience",
    "I think the course is great and drastically improves your musicianship, but again I felt extremely out of place and non-comparable to the vocalists and pianists."
