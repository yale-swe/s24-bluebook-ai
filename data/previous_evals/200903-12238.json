   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. It's a chill American history lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are already interested in American History and have a lot of background knowledge; otherwise, you are likely to spend a lot of time confused and feel as though what you are reading is not actually important in the larger scheme of things. But it's not very much work, and if you are interested, can be enlightening at times.",
    "I'd recommend it if you think you'd be interested in the material.",
    "Very good class. Russett is an excellent lecturer, and the readings are great (but for one or two, I wanted to do all of them). There's a paper, midterm, and a final. As always, make sure to get a good TF - mine was crazy (seriously), and thus my experience was not as positive as it could have been.",
    "I would recommend this class. I felt that it filled in the holes in my high school American History classes, which focused more on political history. This class gave me a good understanding of the cultural movements in America throughout the century, and their relevance to America today.",
    "Absolutely, it was really enlightening and easy to learn.",
    "An interesting survey of certain trends in American intellectual life throuhgout the century....what the title sounds like.",
    "The class deals with all the liberal thinkers of 20th century America: Lost Generation, Harlem Renaissance, Beats, Hippies, and then concludes with a twist: neoconservatives. It was definitely a good lecture, but not one of the very best lectures I've experienced in the History department. Professor Russett is informative and very knowledgeable, but not especially engaging or dynamic. The open-ended research paper was a nice break for me, because I got to write about something far removed from literary history, which I thought occupied too much of the first half of the course. Once it gets to the 60s, I think the syllabus gets more interesting.",
    "Definitely take this class. Russett's lectures are so engaging, you'll be surprised when class ends and you have to leave. The assignments (a midterm, a final and one paper) are reasonable, but challenging. TAKE IT. It's a great way to fulfill an american history class, but it's also great to just take for the sake of it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! I am not a humanities person by any stretch, but I loved it. Professor Russett is captivating; I felt like Iwas going to a grown-up version of \"story-time\" every time I went to her class. I was genuinely sorry to see the class end. Exams and the paper were entirely fair; I honestly enjoyed writing my paper. The reading load was a bit heavy, but most of the material is enjoyable and worth putting the time aside for.",
    "This course is earnest in its convictions, but in its execution it is at times superficial. The ideology of the class is very prominent and gets in the way of the material; one gets the feeling that the American intellectuals of the twentieth century were all either minorities, women, or (former) leftists. Lectures should have been more focused around specific ideas. What we got instead was typically a condensed overview of our high school history classes; there was not a great sense of value added. Sections were, however very good. If the course is to be about ideas instead of personalities, it may be better run in the future as a seminar.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Professor Russett gives wonderful lectures, and she has a way of incorporating seemingly trivial stories to give you a better understanding of whatever she's talking about. The subject matter was always interesting, as were the readings... I took this class with another reading-heavy class (Readings in American Literature, hoping the time periods would overlap, which they didn't), and it wasn't bad at all.",
    "While this class advertises itself as a survey of 20th century American history, I would emphasize in particular the \"intellectual\" nature of the class. Professor Russett mainly concentrates on ideas and ideologies of the time, from asceticism to neoconservatism. I liked this approach because I finally understood some of the ideas that many people touch on and never really explain. I would recommend the class to people who are more interested in this aspect. The workload isn't terrible and the assignments (midterm, paper and final) aren't too difficult. Overall, a solid history class.",
    "Absolutely take it--great combination of literature and cultural history",
    "Good LEcture, Great Reading.",
    "History 174 offers a very broad overview of the intellectual status of the US throughout the 20th century. Professor Russett puts the development of ideas into the context of the events of the 20th century. I truly enjoyed this class. The lectures were a pleasure to attend.",
    "I'd recommend it. Gives you a good perspective on the past century's movements. The paper is also an open topic so it's enjoyable to work on.",
    "A good class to take if you want some general background on the time period. Maybe a better class if you already know more about the time period than I did going in.",
    "Great class, take it!",
    "Very good class, perfect for History majors",
    "Great reading list. Not enough time for the midterm.",
    "I would take it, but shop around with the TA's.",
    "Definitely take this class! Professor Russett will make you excited about the material (which is great on its own). Some great and interesting reading that I think is often overlooked in other classes on the same period.",
    "The course is more or less exactly what it purports to be-- there is a certain amount of selectivity so I would review the readings on the syllabus before enrolling.I would recommend the course."
