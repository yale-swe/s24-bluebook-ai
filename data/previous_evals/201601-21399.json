    "I would not recommend it. It was way too much work for what it was worth. Too stressful.",
    "I would not recommend Math 118. If you want a course that will teach you what you need for Intermediate Micro, just take Math 120 and review matrices on your own.",
    "Good For Econ, Math 120 will be unnecessary if you don't double-major in stems and decide to pursue a less 'mathy' path in econ",
    "Take it for a good basis in multi and linear. If you ask questions and make a point of going to office hours, you'll do fine.",
    "I would recommend this class to Econ majors looking to form a solid background in math. The topics in this class allowed me to understand many of the mathematical principles behind the theory that I learned in intermediate Econ courses. The topics covered by this class are interesting and useful, and the workload was always manageable."
