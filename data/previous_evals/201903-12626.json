    "Search and match literature, analytical skills required to read papers and solve problem sets, skills required to develop research ideas, presentation skills",
    "In the first part, Ilse gave us insights into several models of labor search and employment. In the second part, Michael gave us several perspectives on economic growth",
    "Searching and matching theories in labor markets. Firm-based growth theories, macro-development, structural change, and spatial growth.",
    "I learned the mechanics and the tools related to sorting, searching and matching and growth in a more advanced way than in the first year. Some topics were new to me, like sorting. Others were not completely new, like growth and search and matching, but with this course I believe I reached a much higher level. It was nice that, compared to the first year, we not only learned more in terms of the mechanics and the math behind these topics, but we also saw how papers in the frontier are applying such models. The course had a remarkable ability to conciliate teaching of foundations and theoretical aspects with presentation of cutting edge papers and the ongoing literature. Moreover, the course gave me an opportunity to experience the first steps of research: the process of coming up with an idea, the challenges of elaborating an interesting question, maturing it and finally presenting it. It was an extremely rich experience."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Key concepts in the search and match literature were extremely well taught Weaknesses: None",
    "I think this course was very good in both quarters.",
    "Very well organized.",
    "The course (in its both halves) had a remarkable ability to conciliate teaching of theoretical tools with the presentation of cutting edge papers and the ongoing literature. It was, therefore, a valuable experience to grow in terms of analytical skills and also as a researcher in a broader perspective: I could get a sense of the papers being currently published in top journals, the questions which interest the literature, the methods being applied, the open questions and research agendas. The problem sets were really good for the analytical learning, and I believe they were really well prepared. The math notes provided in the second part of the course, as well as the detailed derivations in the slides of the first part of the course were amazing to better learn the mechanics of the models and the associated tools\/theorems. I must also say that the final project was a great experience - it gave me an opportunity to experience the challenges of elaborating an interesting question. The feedback provided by the professors about these final project was spectacular! They really put effort to understand our ideas, to put forward great suggestions for future advances, and so on. I had the opportunity to talk in person with them in the middle of the semester, to later present my final idea with their comments, and also to receive a detailed email containing their feedback. This was a precious opportunity."

    "Yes. A must take course for all economics graduate students.",
    "Yes very much. I think this class provides an excellent way to experience Macro topics. Even for the students who are not seriously committed to Macro, I still believe this course can provide a helpful tool and a way to think that you can apply for other fields.",
    "Yes. I especially liked quarter two as I'm more of a growth person than a labor person I would say. But both quarters were valuable.",
    "Yes. The topics are interesting and both professors are super helpful and supportive.",
    "Yes. I think this course is a must for everyone who wants to deeply learn macroeconomics. Even the ones interested in labor, development or even trade would highly benefit from many lectures which took us to the intersection between macroeconomics and these other fields, making the course rich and very interesting. The fact that course had a remarkable ability to conciliate teaching of theoretical tools with the presentation of cutting edge papers and the ongoing literature also makes it very appealing."
