   "comments": [
    "We were able to do a deeper research dive into a subject than any course I have taken thus far, and I acquired more useful skills and knowledge than any other course I have taken. I learned a great deal about a subject I was interested in exploring in a directed way that was driven towards solution.The speakers did a great job of bringing in professionally and academically proven models and skills. That consisted of project energy finance mechanisms, thinking in systematic, expansive and inclusive ways, business and finance mechanisms that have worked for solving other wicked problems, and example ways to build connections between stakeholders.",
    "I practiced the skills that have to do with reaching out experts, interviewing them, asking the precise questions and analyzing data.",
    "Great specific knowledge on the project I worked on.",
    "This was a good course, speakers were interesting, and project was valuable. I think it would benefit from being made into a full term course (as opposed to half term), as the project did feel a little rushed, and at times unrelated to the speakers\/course sessions. See comments in SOM course review for more details.",
    "I gained a better understanding of a subject area I was interested in. It added to my research and presentation skills and fit very well with my interests and research into organizations and a field I may work with in the future."

   "comments": [
    "Everything I did and learned in this class was the most relevant class experience I have had and will most likely have. It surpassed my expectations for it.",
    "I expected to gain a greater understanding of the other challenges, but there was almost no engagement or cross-pollination until the final presentations. In this sense, expectations were not in full alignment. On my own project, I largely developed the insights expected, but more guidance would have been appreciated.",
    "Good, I'm glad I had the time to explore my question.",
    "See comments in SOM course review.",
    "I had very few expectations for the course but I found the course to be very good. This was a course that required individual drive and interest in the material. I was pleased to have a interest in my topic so I found it very useful."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great idea, great professor, amazing and inspirational speakers, lots of knowledge and skills gained Weaknesses: should be a semester long, needs more check in points and feedback, might be interesting for teams to have some way of publishing or presenting information to professionals\/academics in the space so they can benefit from the research (perhaps final presentations should be a series of lunch events grouped together by interest)",
    "The idea of the class is very interesting: challenging students to find solutions to problems that haven't been solved. However, since we had the prompt and then we were basically 'free' for 7 weeks, it was difficult to organize the work and develop a roadmap without advice of the professor. I am thinking that constant checking-ins would have been more helpful. Also, the idea of having speakers with innovative projects is great, and it could be complemented with sessions focused more on the logistics or methods to do research, frame a question or develop a solution.",
    "Some guest speakers were great and relevant (Dan Gross); others interesting but less relevant (the New Haven-centric ones); others a bit bland but useful (Coca Cola); others fell flat (religion & ecology). Better alignment with the projects would be good, as it seemed that few seemed to feel that there were specific takeaways that were applicable to all. Additionally, a presentation of the progress reports would have been good to hear what other groups were up to, and to share ideas \/ feedback. Finally, having a final presentation sign-up sheet in advance.",
    "Strengths: Unique class, would like to see this work shopped and offered again Weaknesses: Speakers are largely redundant for anyone in the CBEY community (have heard many of them before). 1\/2 semester is not enough time to complete a good research project. It is hard to shift into second gear when groups are just getting started on projects. Accelerating the project would have been easier with fixed group workshop times, even then more time would be better. Finally, while the lectures were interesting, they did really distract from the scope of the projects as many were not totally applicable to the project specifics. The course needs to make class time into group work time with instructor guidance. One lecture and one class working session\/week would be great.",
    "See comments in SOM course review.",
    "The major weakness came from my group, who all had very little interest in the topic we were focusing on. I found all other aspects of the course as strengths; guest speakers, background materials, connections etc. I thought it was a great experience overall."
