    "I went from L2 to L4 in French during the semester, and I've improved more than I could have ever imagined. I have improved my speaking, writing, listening, and reading skills exponentially and am a lot more confident in my ability to use may skills in francophone settings. Through the readings and films I have also learned a lot about France on a cultural and political level, and also about francophone countries around the world and their relationship with France and the French language.",
    "This class really bumps up your level of French. It has intensive in the name for a reason (there's a lot of work\/reading), but if you're really trying to advance your French in a short amount of time and *not* forget it, I suggest you try this course.",
    "I developed my speaking, writing, and reading to become much better at communicating in French.",
    "This class is a really great way to patch up the holes in the mechanics of French, especially if you are a couple years removed from your last French class or have at least some background in the language. Additionally, this class really facilitates being able to actually understand the language spoken at a \"normal\" speed, as opposed to the slower speed that may be used when one first learns the language.",
    "We reviewed a lot of grammar from L2 and learned new conjugations. We also learned a lot of small details that are important in the French language",
    "My French definitely improved a lot. I feel much more comfortable speaking, listening, and reading in French now."

   "comments": [
    "Great selection of book! Loved the discussions. There is an ENORMOUS amount of homework, which is understandable considering the intensive nature of the course. Honestly, I hated the audio material. It took me about 1,5 hrs everyday to go through the entire thing. It is very slow, boring and I did not find it that helpful most of the times.",
    "Effective way to learn but A LOT of work",
    "The main strength of this class is that, with a couple caveats here and there, it does what it advertises. My French improved by leaps this semester. There is a lot of work (my comments on some of the weaknesses of it are below), but in general the system works. As long as you put in the work as a student, you get great results out of it. I think that one of the main weaknesses of the course is its reading list. A list of more recent and engaging works, instead of works like La Symphonie Pastorale could really change the ways the students experience this class. It would change the energy of some of the discussions and in make students see the reading as a fun activity rather than a chore; and with so much homework every day, that matters. A list that changes some of the old readings for more contemporary works could really do a lot to inject new energy into the class. Similarly, I think the class would really benefit from discussions about contemporary France and francophone countries regarding topics like politics, culture, social issues, technology, etc. This would make the class feel more situated in the present day, but would also help students gain a vocabulary and speaking skills on topics that directly influence our lives. Currently we miss a whole lot of vocabulary and speaking skills related to what people talk about and use nowadays (social media, Facebook, politics, etc.). This knowledge would be more practical than some of the vocabulary we learn or memorizing poetry from the 19th century. On a material level, I think the course pack needs to be updated to make sure the chapters are in the right order. I also think all the blank pages, of which there are a lot, should be removed because this would bring down the cost of the course pack significantly as it is so big. All the white pages are a waste of paper and money. Finally, the audio recordings should be updated. Many of them are bad quality, have very low volume, or simply don't correspond with the exercises in the course pack. The audio recordings are also very slow,. and include a lot of silence, making some of them last 20-30 minutes while the actual exercises the students listens to are 5-15 minutes. With a class that takes up so much time on a daily basis, having the recordings go at a normal pace, without the large pauses, silences and repetitions, would really help the student dedicate time to something that is actually helpful.",
    "Sometimes I thought the extra work (we have a Skype correspondence for which certain worksheets and activities were marked) shouldn't have been graded. Otherwise things would have been fine.",
    "I think the course is structured well overall, but I think less audio and more grammar exercises would help. I think it would achieve a comparable improvement in the student with a less heavy time commitment, especially early on. I personally did not find the audio helpful: it read out or very slowly the phrases I had on paper, which did not enhance my comprehension of spoken words. In order to make up for that, more films could be integrated in the course and discussion - it would be optimal if they had french subtitles or no subtitles at all.",
    "I thought that one strength was the compositions, and another was the Telecom sessions. I enjoyed the books and films as well. It was understandable that the syllabus had to be flexible, but the many changes and small additions made it difficult to plan for contributing sufficient time to French studies while managing other coursework.",
    "I wish it was adapted instead of adding L3 and L4 exactly together. The level of work sometimes works against the learning."

   "comments": [
    "If you have a great interest in French, I'd definitely recommend it! I feel that the regular language course is too slow sometimes You will improve your French so much (after all, you will see yourself investing about 20 hours of your week in the learning of the language).",
    "Yes. BUT BE READY TO WORK YOUR TAILS OFF!",
    "Absolutely! This class is the best option for anybody who wants to improve their French radically and think they have the time to dedicate themselves to this class. Yes, it is a lot (and I mean a huge amount) of work on a daily and weekly basis, but I put in the effort and my French has improved more than I would have ever dreamt at the beginning of the semester. Professor Skorupa is an amazing teacher and human being, who will go the extra mile for you and get to know you on a personal level. She's also quite strict, so make sure that you have the time to make this class your priority for the semester. If you can make this class your nr. 1 for the semester, I'd definitely take it if I were you! I had a great time and am very advanced in French because of it!",
    "I would recommend this class only if French L4 completion is extremely urgent and if accompanied by only 2 other relatively easy credits. It is a class that gives 2 credits for the workload of 3 and requires 2 hours in class (and about more 2 hours out) at full force every.single.day. Yet, it also gives quick and significant improvement in the language that no other course could ever provide. Your choice on the trade-off.",
    "If you want to improve your French rapidly with solid gains, do it!",
    "Much more work than 125, but if you put in the effort, your French improves proportionally (hugely). Make sure you really have the time to devote to it before committing so that you limit how overwhelmed the work can make you feel and so that you can get the most out of the class. Madame Skorupa is wonderful.",
    "Yes, it was difficult to manage along with other classes, but I thought that it helped me to learn more and retain more than if I had taken the course over two semesters.",
    "Be warned: this class is A LOT of work. On top of the two hours of French class each day, you will probably spend at least three hours a night doing homework (that is, if you attempt to do everything fully... which not everyone did). Take this class if you are willing to sacrifice a great deal of time to it. Coming into this class, I expected the class to be rigorous, but at some points the class could be quite overwhelming. You will have to invest a great deal of effort, but it will be worth it.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course but only to a student who is willing to put in the work for it.",
    "It's a lot of work but it pays off"
