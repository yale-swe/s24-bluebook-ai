   "comments": [
    "If you can get in - TAKE IT! THIS IS THE BEST SCIENCE CLASS AT YALE! Do not be scared by the workload, its easy and manageable... also Kaury is the best.",
    "Great class for non-science majors. Highly recommended",
    "If you can get in, TAKE IT. It's not for someone who isn't interested in the material--the science is detailed and the case studies, though interesting, won't make sense without the science--but for someone who is, it's a fascinating and very applicable class. There's a fair amount of work, but it's never stressful and grading is very light. Professor Kucera is one of the best professors I've had. Absolutely recommended.",
    "I would highly recommend Human Hormones. There is no better way to fulfill a science credit. The course is low stress, but interesting material with practical application, and a seminar.",
    "This is the epitome of a fun and easy course. In retrospect, I enjoyed it less than I thought I would because it was often too cursory, but still highly recommend it.",
    "Take it if you get in! My year it was no freshmen, a couple of sophomores, and rest juniors\/seniors.",
    "This class MUST be offered again. Not just next year, but every semester. And it should definitely be a priority class for any student who is not necessarily comfortable in the sciences but wants to learn and appreciate interesting things.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in fulfilling his\/her science distributional requirement. It requires minimal work in comparison to the other science classes.",
    "Yes, take it by all means. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Kucera is brilliant and makes a lot of complicated science quite engaging and easy to understand. But she also really cares about her students in a way that is quite rare in most professors.",
    "Definitely take this. Best science credit ever.",
    "Take it for a pretty easy\/accessible science credit on a relatively interesting topic. Pay attention in lecture and go over lecture slides\/notes to do well on quizzes and tests, and make sure you hand in essays on time (although Prof. Kucera was pretty lenient on deadline extensions if you gave her a heads up). It's hard to get into though cuzit's pretty popular, so make sure you have a great reason why you should be in the class or contact her ahead of shopping period if you really want to take it. I really enjoyed it and I learned a lot of cool stuff that relates to a lot of things in daily life.",
    "Definitely recommend for non science majors who are interested in science and eager to learn more about hormones. Awesome class.",
    "Yes, absolutely. If you can get into this class, take it. The professor is awesome, the lectures are interesting and engaging, and you will actually love going to class."
