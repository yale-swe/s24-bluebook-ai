    "Improved my speaking, listening, and writing of Hindi",
    "I somewhat strengthened my Hindi speaking skills by taking this course. There was good focus on reinforcing some of the grammar concepts covered in L2, and better focus on learning new, more complex concepts. There was a lot more reading assigned in L3 than in L1 or L2, which was a nice change.",
    "Learn Hindi language skills: reading, writing, speaking, vocabulary",
    "I greatly improved my spoken Hindi, and am now able to hold complex conversations with my relatives. Additionally, my understanding of the language also greatly improved, and I can now watch movies in Hindi without subtitles."

    "The professors for this course are lovely. They care a lot about student learning. There's not a high degree of organization from the top down, and there are sometimes difficulties with communication of assignments.",
    "Sometimes it is a bit too much work, also the conversation section is a hassle to add onto a class that is already every day. We should just do more spoken work in class because the grammar you need to learn is way less by the time you're in L3",
    "The class is very well taught and structured. The weekly quizzes for both vocabulary and grammar really help cement the concepts we learn each week, and make sure we are learning new vocabulary. I think making a list of grammar concepts before each quiz would be helpful."

    "Yes, if you want to learn Hindi. These professors want you to succeed.",
    "Yes, the professors are very interested in the students' learning and the TF is easily accessible. It is probably hard to learn the alphabet but once you get the hang of that, it's pretty much smooth sailing. There is a midterm skit and final magazine project which are time consuming but not hard.",
    "Yes! The Hindi department is incredible. You will learn so much in a short period of time. And the class is super fun."
