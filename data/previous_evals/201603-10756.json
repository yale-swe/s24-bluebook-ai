   "comments": [
    "I learned about some of the key currents of thought during the 60s and 70s in America. I wrote two papers, one of which was an outside-the-box assignment that helped me integrate different modes of analysis from disparate disciplines. I came to understand how elements of the Counterculture have become assimilated into our modern mainstream (e.g., Silicon Valley).",
    "I can paint a better picture of what countercultural figures tripped out on LSD were thinking than I could before. Some cool ideas about consciousness, countercultural intersections with science, and the influence of technology on society. Definitely taught me new viewpoints into the world.",
    "This course taught me to synthesize large amounts of information and draw a cohesive narrative out of contradictory sources. The readings and Professor Williams' lectures also gave me a renewed view of the American counterculture and, particularly, its impact on today's society.",
    "A new appreciation for the complexity of a period and movement in American history that is too often reduced to buzzwords. Read fantastic texts, had a great time writing a research project.",
    "I learned about the makings of the American Counterculture and its vision it had for a new utopian future. Through literature, I gained a deeper understanding of the ethos of certain areas of the counterculture and how figures of the counterculture interacted and influenced each other.",
    "This course taught about the histories and works of countercultural figures in the 1960s and early 70s. I learned about some such individuals I had previously not known about and studied their theories and philosophies through analysis of their literary work. I developed insights about the counterculture, its influences and its impact, as well as how to define a 'counterculture' in general. We discussed in depth the tensions involved in crafting a definition of this type of historical phenomenon.",
    "I feel like I gained a greater understanding of the hippie movement, though I think the class may have neglected some of the wider aspects of the movement.",
    "Almost none. The one thing I think I may have learned a little bit about was looking at how to analyze and utilize different types of media. Unfortunately, I would be hesitant to say that I gained any firm grasp of these skills, because we really did not spend any time closely reading the assigned reading. Mostly the professor just lectured on the history of the movement and the biographies of the people that wrote the readings.",
    "Before taking the class, I had very little previous knowledge on the counterculture, and the class was a wonderful way to delve into it, both as a historical and literary foray.",
    "By taking this course, I've definitely gained greater insight into how one can and should approach developing a conversation between related, but not particularly connected texts. By this I mean, that a major theme of the class was understanding the intersection of the ideas and people throughout \"The American Counterculture,\" and while not many texts were not written in response to one another, or as an extension of that which preceded it, we explored in what ways they were indicative of the general zeitgeist of the time. Moreover, we explored in what ways each text presented ideas that were later picked up and integrated into another text, or expanded upon in another text, even if this was not done in direct response. This process helped to facilitate a better understanding of how to learn from a wealth of inter-texts, which is extremely useful in most realms of academia, particularly in realms that deal with large groups and contexts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths--the class works within a very interesting period of American history; some of the works we read were great (e.g., Pynchon, some of the Sixties Reader); very cogent arguments set forth about the Counterculture on the part of Professor Williams; lectures, assignments, and exams were all very clear and fair. Weaknesses--a solid third or more of the syllabus was not interesting and not appropriate for an English class (e.g., Lilly, McKenna, Ram Dass, Leary, Capra)",
    "Good, interesting class that I'm glad I took but I do wish readings were more well-integrated in the lectures. Sometimes I felt like they were ignored entirely.",
    "I found the lectures to be excellent: they analyzed and drew from the course readings but also added their own interpretations and additional information. The two writing assignments were also very helpful in facilitating understanding of the texts. I would have liked more discussion of the opposition to the counterculture - in particular, texts by the counterculturalists' opponents offering opposing views.",
    "A little too broad. This class would be more than complete just covering Countercultural literature. And though, obviously, the other branches we covered are crucial to understanding the period as a whole, they (the science especially) were covered at a surface level that did not leave me with much to take away, and left me wanting more on the Beats and other authors like Pynchon. The class straddles history and English, and I don't think it would be a bad thing to focus on English more than history.",
    "The lectures were very interesting and engaging. It was at times difficult to tell which readings were more important than others. Sometimes two books would be assigned at once and it was hard to know which one should be focused on. The beginning of the course was very interesting as it focused on an array of figures. Towards the end, the course began to feel repetitive because it focused mostly on white men dropping acid and getting really into mysticism. For future classes, I would enjoy more focus on the Civil Rights and more diversity in terms of the focus of countercultural authors, i.e. what they are discussing in their work. Overall, I really enjoyed the course.",
    "The course had an interesting approach to studying the oft-taught 1960s. The threads tying together Eastern thought, Western medicinal technologies and modern technology culture was novel for me, and there was a strength in teaching the decade this new way. Discussion sections were helpful in terms of tying together seemingly disparate works thematically and understanding important ideas from lecture. Lectures themselves were also entertaining and informative. Professor Williams is also delightful in general and his assessment style is very fair. For me the syllabus at times was niche to the extend that it was somewhat homogenous. Voices of certain groups that are essential to the counterculture were minimized or excluded. Toward the end of the syllabus, the figures became a bit redundant and the focus on psychedelics perhaps could have been demonstrated with fewer related texts on that subject.",
    "This class would be great as an American Studies, History, or Art\/Media Studies course. However, it was billed as an English class (and only an English class; no crosslistings). In that vein, it failed completely. I was not motivated to do the reading because we did not actually analyze it closely in class. Most of the time was spent discussing the biographies and history of the figures involved in the movement, occaisionally touching on extremely high-level themes of the book (which you could get by looking up a summary online). In addition, entirely too much reading was assigned and then not even discussed at all in class. I think that if the reading was pared down a bit, this class could be very engaging for someone interested in media studies, but as a standalone English class, it was not engaging or useful at all.",
    "The entertaining and engaging lectures of Professor Williams were a definite highlight, and the feedback from my TF was very much appreciated. Because we covered so much history in class, we often spent section talking about the books and minor readings we did, and I would have appreciated more overlap between what we discussed in section versus in class.",
    "This course provided compelling evidence in support of Professor Williams' overarching argument that the aesthetics and themes of certain strains of 60s and 70s countercultural writing (or what has been complexly and somewhat uncritically named as such, post-hoc) have been appropriated, ironically, by the once-new technocrats of Silicon Valley-- those who would have us all \"think different\" to the point of an alternate homogeneity. The texts that we read to support this argument--which was frustratingly only revealed to us midway through the course (although I guess we all could have done our research into RJW's scholarship [which is worth a read] beforehand)--were sometimes interesting but frustratingly niche for a course the title of which suggested that it would be a broad survey. The blame probably falls on the registrar for this, although the syllabus also displays some anxiety with respect to its niche-ness-- see for instance the not-even-quite-a-handful of days we spent reading the entirety of the literary contributions of the black civil rights movement and Betty Friedan's strain of feminism. I'm not complaining about the lack of representation, strictly speaking, but rather about the fact that this class was called \"The American Counterculture\" when it displayed only one very specific valence-- which also involved a lot of reading that was truly turgid to get through (many, many drug trip anecdotes and vaguely mystical thinking that verges frequently on self-parody). In sum: a great argument, well-supported by this class, that involved some stellar reads and lectures (Williams on Pynchon is a dream), some anxious lip-service to the counterculture's more obviously political strains, and a whole lot of (unfortunately, often repetitive and redundant, I think) drug-talk.",
    "This course is very strong in its syllabus organization and class structure, which help to highlight certain ideas while still leaving a lot of room for personal interpretation of the counter culture. It is, however, held back from idiosyncratic formatting. While it is a literature course, it has a midterm and final exam, on top of what is effectively midterm paper and a final project. While this works to have students engage with the texts in different ways, it also can be disorienting, as it can be hard to discern on which method of engagement one should be focused. This isn't too much of a problem so long as one gives themselves time to thoroughly engage with the class, but requires that students give this class a particular amount of attention, which may draw attention away from other classes."

   "comments": [
    "I really wanted to like this class: it examines a interesting, fertile, and relatively recent period of American history (the 60s and 70s), and Professor Williams is a young and dynamic lecturer who's really fun to listen to. Unfortunately, the syllabus needs serious work. We started out reading some really excellent stuff (Pynchon, Friedan, Larry Neal), but most of the second half of the course focused on psychedelic and Eastern mystic writings (Ram Dass, John Lilly, Terence McKenna--google them) that for the most part were lacking in any real literary content. This was the first year the class was being taught, so I'm sure the syllabus will be revised; if the psychedelic\/Eastern mystic works are cut down to maybe a week and replaced with literally anything else, this class could be way better. I'm not saying the whole class has to be \"woke,\" but you'd think we'd spend at least a week on the Civil Rights Movement, and fewer than six weeks on firsthand accounts of acid trips. If the syllabus doesn't change, just read Professor Williams's recent article in Critical Inquiry, which lays out the theses of this year's iteration of the class and takes maybe an hour to read as opposed to an entire semester.",
    "This course was definitely not what I expected. It focused a lot more on ideas of the counterculture, some of which can be abstract and \"far out,\" than on concrete social movements of the counterculture. The readings were mostly super strange, often artsy, but in a good way - I think I got a glimpse into a surprisingly relevant world of thinking I didn't know existed. We talked about technology's impact on the future, consciousness, etc. Prof Williams is a cool guy, and his lectures were always fun. He's also super chill, so it's a fun, low-stress 5th credit to have.",
    "This was my favorite course of the semester - I would absolutely recommend it. All of the texts and lectures were interesting, particularly where they connected to and paralleled the present day. This was a phenomenally taught and fascinating look at the counterculture.",
    "Absolutely, if you're interested in the material\/period. The Counterculture is obviously niche, and Prof. Williams is a clear expert with so much knowledge to share about it. Lectures were a pleasure, section was great too (loved both TAs), got to write a research project that was very fun to do, and the tests were easy. The second half of the course lost momentum, but I'm sure the syllabus will be tightened in the future. Really glad I took it.",
    "I would, Professor Williams is a very interesting lecturer and the material is very interesting and not something normally encountered in normal academic settings.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is looking for something different and a little weird where she will also be able to exercise literary analysis skills. I would not recommend this class to somebody looking for a broad overview of the American canon of countercultural and protest figures most well known.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who was very interested in film and multimedia studies, possibly also to someone interested in American history. I would not recommend this class to an English major or someone who was interested in the serious study of literature, as they would only be disappointed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, even for people who are not familiar with the themes\/writing of the counterculture, because it is a fascinating course which felt relevant to my other, completely different academic interests.",
    "This is pretty much the only class offered at Yale that teaches Thomas Pynchon; it's almost worth it for those lectures alone. When Williams has good material to work with, he really impresses; when the material is dry or turgid, he does his best but the lectures necessarily suffer. I would read a bit from Williams academic corpus before signing up for this; the shopping period lectures don't really prepare you for the real direction of the course. If you like his work, or if you for some reason love reading drug trip stories, you'll enjoy the class. Look elsewhere if you want to spend the majority of your time reading truly great works of literature. The midterm, project, and exam are also all incredibly easy.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. While it requires a good deal of engagement, the tools derived from the course, and the insights available in the content of the texts, is absolutely invaluable."
