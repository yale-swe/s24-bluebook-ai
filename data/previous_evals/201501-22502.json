   "comments": [
    "I had to take this course in order to be eligible to do a summer abroad Arabic program, however I felt like my Arabic actually declined this semester. We spent a lot of time learning different grammar concepts but then would never have any practice using them. We also barely practiced speaking in Arabic but then were expected to do a 10 minute long oral presentation at the end of the semester. The last few weeks of class felt especially disorganized, for by the last week of classes we had already finished our final assignments and just spent class time doing vocabulary from the next chapter in our textbook or learning other random grammar. This all really hit home when I took the placement test for my summer program, which is run by Columbia, and just barely made it into their third-year Arabic threshold. Before I leave they asked that I find a tutor to help get me up to speed with Columbia's Arabic program, for it is at a much higher level than Yale's.",
    "Don't take this class unless you genuinely are passionate about Arabic. Unless you put in time for self directed study you will get virually nothing out of the in class time. I would caution against taking it with Professor Aziz if you're looking for proficiency. They've also started teaching only dialect in sections and expect you to learn an almost entirely different language in 50 minutes a week.",
    "I recommend this only if you're serious about Arabic and willing to take lots of time out of the classroom on homework and going over what you learned in class.",
    "Professor Aziz is a great man who cares about his students, yet he is not a strong teacher. I have not made too much progress this year.",
    "Great course that doesn't focus on one aspect of the language. Speaking, writing, listening, culture, and other topics are all within the scope of this course.",
    "This was not a great course. Professor Aziz is a good guy and cares about his students but the material is very scattered and it is very disorganized. The integration of dialect does not work well and it is hard to learn arabic from this course, as the assessments do not reflect what we are doing on homework or in class so much. If there were more speaking in class this would definitely improve the course and also if the assessments forced us to learn more of the material. Additionally I felt the homework was long and arduous, but often didn't really help me learn Arabic myself, which was really frustrating. This, as well, could be easily changed if the homework were different."
