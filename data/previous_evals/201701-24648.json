   "comments": [
    "The course is a good survey into the current issues in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, most of the information I learned came from the reading and not from the seminar discussions. In the future, for this class to be more than a useful reading list, there needs to be more imput from Professor Adlparvar during the class.",
    "Really great content, and the structure of seminars was very productive. More feedback early on would have been useful. Also, I would have liked more theory, we focused a lot on practical applications, but a basis in theory would have made our critiques of the field more focused.",
    "This course has two primary strengths. First of all, it focuses on a country and topic that few other classes in Yales Middle East curriculum do. Since Spring 2015 there has not been a class that focuses on Iraq, and even then it was a class that viewed Iraq largely from a U.S.-U.K policy perspective. MMES 348 focuses on Iraq and, while there is certainly a good amount of U.S. and U.K. policy discussed in the class, as a whole I think it focused on the Iraqi perspective. Also, MMES 348 focuses on social dynamics from various perspectives (religious, political, ethnic, etc.) and this again is something that few Middle East classes at Yale do. The second strength of the course is that the class discussions provided nuanced perspectives on the topics of Aid and Development in Iraq and Afghanistan, and I believe this course is a critical part of a curriculum on the Middle East. There are very few weaknesses to this course. If anything, I would say that the Professor should speak a bit more (maybe at the start of class, or maybe after the presentation) to provide a solid outline of facts and on-the-ground realities from which students can have a discussion. Also, I would dedicate at least another week to discussing the military inventions in Iraq and Afghanistan and the history behind them. I think it would help students with less experience studying the Middle East feel comfortable in discussing the course material.",
    "My only suggestion for improvement would be to provide feedback on assignments earlier in the semester if possible.",
    "The readings were excellent. The class should be less focused on presentations and more on discussions and lecture from the professor",
    "The principal strength is the knowledge, efficacy and charm of its instructor Naysan--a debate facilitator with a wealth of on-ground knowledge from statebuilding in live action, ever encouraging students to develop their own principles and takeaways. He cares for how his students exit the classroom, while recognising his to be a classroom only (at least, til his redeye to Jordan tonight, or something).. The principal weakness of the course is a purview too broad for a single course, at the dept it attempts and with the debate it holds vital."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class, but with reservations. Professor Adlparvar has had a very cool career working for the UN and is very happy to talk during office hours. However, the class itself is very student-led. There were hundreds of pages of reading expected every week along-side a reading response which never got individualized feedback on. For the majority of the two-hour seminar, student presenters just summarized the reading we'd already done. Professor Adlparvar is a new teacher and does not intervene in class discussions which makes it hard to take anything substantive away from class discussions or to leave class with big thoughts rather than just a list of facts from the reading. The class is also extremely fact-focused which makes it hard to see the bigger themes or connect individual case studies. Still, if you're interested in learning about these conflict areas from someone who regularly goes there and is deeply invested in the non-profit world (as opposed to the political scholars you'll find elsewhere at Yale), it's worth taking the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but only after an introductory course in development politics. Without that basis, I think it would be difficult to get the course arc.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. While I think nearly anyone would find this course interesting, I think that students interested in international development, the Middle East, peace-building and post-conflict reconciliation, international relations, and current events in general will find it very interesting. Professor Adlparvar is a great class leader and makes the discussion flexible and therefore accessible to students from a variety of academic backgrounds.",
    "Absolutely. Great as a writing credit + engaging and interesting subject.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The professor knew a lot about the field from firsthand experience and that really showed during classroom discussions. The readings assigned were interesting and covered a lot of different aspects of Iraqi and Afghan life. There were a lot of reading responses throughout the semester (8 in total), but apparently there will be fewer in future semesters. The final term paper (15 pages) is long but Naysan provides a lot of support in how to structure your paper. The class presentation is not that stressful, either. Overall, this class was enjoyable and definitely worth it.",
    "Absolutely, amazing professor and very interesting course material",
    "Yes! Take it-- a lot of work but our class was great and Dr. Adlparvar is super knowledgable.",
    "Absolutely: a course for which to attend Yale and dare say, for those whose interests walk the divide between apollonian realities and dionysian norms of state- and citizenhood, for which to attend University. Taught by perhaps one of the greatest professors in the game. Done right, the course imparts panoptic knowledge of the military's interface with the two countries that pose the greatest quandary to US foreign policy thus far this century---from tree-level development and social rights research to the forest of the Allied aid leviathan."
