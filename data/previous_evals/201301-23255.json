    "Great class, especially if you're interested in nature. the readings are interesting, although sometimes a little long. the professor is good and gives good feedback, although the class is not easy so don't expect an easy A. improved my writing a lot though, I recommend this course, even for non-English majors (I'm premed)!",
    "The best. Class discussion a bit more philosophical than I had expected, but I grew to like it.",
    "Take it if you love nature and want to have a space to explore ideas and learn how to write personal essays. Take it if you can let go of your pride and love of your own voice and desire to please and care instead about figuring out what the heck is this universe and who you are and your relationship to it. One of those classes that can be formative to you as a person rather than as a student just looking for an A.",
    "FANTASTIC COURSE. Dean Loge is the best. If you are interested in the subject matter, if you've ever read Thoreau or wanted to, if you want an english class that is creative and philosophical but also grounded-- take nature writing.The readings are reasonable and interesting, the writing assignments are pretty open, and your writing within the genre will really improve with Loge's teaching.",
    "Take it if you want to learn how to write better, especially if you've had some background in writing any form of essay but still need to improve. Odds are you do.This class is a great break from science, and allows you to be creative!",
    "Amazing class. Amazing professor. Nuff' said.Actually, there is more to say.Dean Loge is very accommodating and understanding if you're sick and couldn't come to class.When I was sick for two weeks and came to class to hand in my work, he patted me on my back and told me that I didn't have to come to class and that he hoped I felt better...he's just such a sweet man.Also, I improved SO much in his class. Prior to Yale, my writing was NEVER criticized. I always got 98-100 on all my high school essays. I was always exalted for my writing and entered endless writing competitions, in which I won numerous accolades. I had become a writer and begun authoring a book, even.But Dean Loge is such an extraordinary professor that I got my butt whooped on my essays. My first essay had so many corrections on it in the form of pitch black ink that I couldn't even find my own computer print underneath all of those corrective markings.He loves what he teaches...and it shows in the way he expresses such genuine interest.You learn a lot, you read a lot, you write a lot. You become more observant of the world around you and notice things you never noticed before. Your senses become more acute and your writing becomes more succinct, and even stronger. You leave the class seeing the world in a different way--you actually undergo a metaphysical transformation in which you literally transcend beyond this quotidian lens you see through prior to entering his class. He offers you a new lens for the world.I have nothing but great things to say about him and this class. It is a MUST-take for anyone who wants to take an English\/writing class.Just be really to get your butt whooped super hard even if you're an extraordinary writer.P.S. He also sends very meta and inspiring email responses if you email him.Here's an copy of an email exchange between me and him:Me: Hey Dean Loge! I just had a quick question about final grades in your class.Is our final grade based simply on the average of the cumulative 4 major essay scores? Or is participation in class discussions, and other factors taken into account?Also, are essays going to be weighed differently as the semester progressed (e.g. the latter essays count more due to time needed for acclimation to the nature writing style)?Hope you're having a happy Thursday and enjoying this weather!Regards,JayProfessor Loge: Dear Jay,Yes to both questions -- participation is taken into account and improvement is also taken into account.Do not let grades define you. Do not let anyone other than yourself define you.",
    "Take nature writing! The readings are engaging, and Dean Loge is a very approachable and helpful professor. My writing definitely showed improvement.",
    "Yes. Great readings, great professor.",
    "If you are looking for a fun, laid back, interesting class that will challenge how you write take this course. Although many people might not know it, nature writing has its own distinct set of requirements and rules. It will challenge the creative-writers, the poets, and the research paper junkies. The in-class discussions are great and tend to build great relationships between class mates. Dean Loge is absolutely wonderful as a professor and writing mentor. I highly recommend you take this course if you are looking to discover a new writing genre, meet great people, and have fun in an awesome course! Also, the class goes on occasional nature walks and if the weather is nice we attend class outside. If you are looking for a good way to de-stress and learn, nature writing is the perfect class for you. 10\/10 for sure.",
    "Take this class!",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It is more than just a writing class. It involves thoughtful discussion about what defines nature, wilderness, humanity, culture, and other topics. There's a lot of opportunity to shape the class, in that regard. Dean Loge is open to ideas for class writing exercises. The readings are amazing-- you'll want to hold onto the reader afterwards. Overall, highly recommended.",
    "Nature Writing is the best class I've ever taken at Yale, hands down. Dean Loge is fantastic, the readings are beautiful and thought-provoking, and the writing assignments are fun and meaningful. I can't say enough good things about this course. My highest recommendation."
