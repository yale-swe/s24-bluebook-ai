   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, as long as you don't overload on other things. The texts in Lit are really incredible and having such a small seminar with such smart students and professors isn't so easy to find.",
    "DS is probably one of the most amazing experiences Yale has to offer.",
    "You write very little (15 pages over three papers) and read very much.",
    "I would recommend Directed Studies to anyone who is interested in humanities, or just wants a solid background in great works. There is a lot of reading, but I would much rather be reading works of literature than doing problem sets or other homework. I feel like a more well-rounded student for having completed one semester of Directed Studies, and I look forward to branching out from the foundation that it provides.",
    "I would recommend it only if you really want to focus on texts the entire semester. If that's what you want, this class is excellent; if you want help with your writing, or with broader literary topics, this isn't the class for you.",
    "Great writing practice and basic investigation into foundational western literature and literary thought.",
    "If you feel enthusiastic about it, taking Directed Studies will be the best decision of your year. Don't let concerns like the amount of reading or the limitations on your course selection get in your way if that's all that's stopping you. If, however, you're just not that excited by the idea of the classes, DS may not be for you. It should be, though, because it's great.At this point, though, you're probably looking at your assigned professors wondering if you should try to switch out. Don't. Professor Lewis is a wonderful teacher. Now, the central function of a teacher is to teach, but teaching has several parts of its function, and to be a good teacher one must have the virtue of a teacher with respect to each of these functions. [This is the kind of humor that will be inflicted on you for the next year if you stick with DS. If you can't politely smile at someone who thinks they're being clever, you may not enjoy other DSers.]Professor Lewis does, in the following ways:1. As a section leader: We almost always had excellent discussions. He strikes a good balance between guiding the discussion and getting out of the students' way so that they are talking to and arguing with each other. That's very difficult to do, but I really appreciate the way he handled it. You'll feel respected for the things you say in this class, but also held to a high standard for your contributions.2. As a lecturer: Prof. Lewis gave two very good lectures. Of course, everyone in the program gets to benefit from those, but you'll be proud to tell people that you're in his section afterwards.3. As a grader: I always had a clear idea of what Professor Lewis expected in a paper and what I needed to improve on to get there. His comments have been helpful and encouraging, even and especially when critical.4. As a motivator: Maybe the highest praise I can give Professor Lewis is that, in the midst of the craziness that is DS, he made me want to read more books. He always seems so happy to be talking about literature, you can hardly help but be infected by it.",
    "An inspiring overview of classical western literature from Homer toI would recommend it for its breadth.",
    "I learned a lot from the Directed Studies program, but I know that it's not for everybody. If you want a good, general overview of the Western canon, DS is perfect. However, if you don't like feeling rushed and would prefer to get to know the material in more depth, you could feel frustrated.",
    "DS Literature, Fall Semester is a great survey course of early Western literature. It's a lot of reading, but is definitely worth it - especially if you didn't study classics in high school, this is an excellent way to get acquainted with Greek and Roman literature. DS Literature reads more complete works than either of the other two DS courses, but it still does skim through some (for example, you only read parts of the Bible and Dante). If you really want a complete understanding of specific authors or time periods in literature, you might want to look elsewhere. But, if you're interested in Western literature as a whole, particularly in terms of how it complements the works we read in the other DS courses, then this is really a fantastic course.",
    "As long as you're willing to read a lot in your first semester at Yale, I would definitely recommend this course. The workload is somewhat great, but the readings are extremely interesting and definitely worth the time. Also, TAKE IT WITH LEWIS: he's a great lecturer and a terrific section leader."
