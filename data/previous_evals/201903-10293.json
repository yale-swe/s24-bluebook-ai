   "comments": [
    "The course had only four students, which allowed each of us to thoroughly engage in class discussions. The course was discussion-based, rather than lecture-based, which I enjoyed. Prof. Mercer was adept at leading the discussion by offering his own expertise while also still leaving ample room for our comments and interpretations. I enjoyed the assignment that each student had to offer a presentation which offered a critical analysis of the texts we had read that week. The presenting student provided a helpful recap of the texts and offered comments that were good launching points for discussion. I also appreciated that Prof. Mercer often brought in guest speakers. The course was reading-heavy, which was to be expected because Prof. Mercer made this clear prior to taking the course. The readings were mostly manageable except for one week in which he assigned three books, which proved difficult to get through in one week's time. Overall, my status as the only student not in the African American studies first year PhD cohort (I realize this does not preserve the anonymity of this response) was not an issue. The students were receptive to learning from me given my background in sociology, and vice versa. However, there were a couple times in which I felt \"out of my element\" when discussions centered on art history or poetry, despite having read all of the necessary materials for the week. I appreciate that the course pushed me to gain a kind of 'literacy' in these matters but must admit that Prof. Mercer at times seemed slightly unsatisfied with my attempts to contribute to discussions centered on art\/art history. While he was a great professor, to be frank, I felt nervous to make a mistake or offer an incorrect analysis when it came to such discussions. Finally, I never received any feedback on the two major assignments I turned in (the scholarly journal review and the research prospectus). Perhaps I have yet to receive them, in which case, this comment can be disregarded. However, at this point I think it would have been useful to have a sense of my progress in the course if I received feedbacks on the assignments.",
    "Overall, I feel I learned a great deal in Theorizing Racial Formations, through the combination of engaging readings, response paper prompts, helpful longer form writing assignments directly related to our larger research projects, and thoughtful dialogue between students and faculty in the Department. A weakness was the varying amount of reading from week to week. For example, three full length books for the Black Atlantic Formations week was an immense amount of dense material to cover for one week. Whereas the week on Visual Culture only had three relatively short essays to discuss. More excitingly, involving professors from across the Department was an incredibly effective and interesting way to learn about African American Studies and its interdisciplinary possibilities."

I would also recommend the course to students outside of the African American Studies Department interested in genealogies of thought around race and identity, in the context of Black Studies."
