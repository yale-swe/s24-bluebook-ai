    "This course gave an overview of the theory and theoretical and historical origins of cultural sociology, a field of sociology that focuses on understanding how cultural constructs shape social life. It was a thorough exposition of the theory and practice of doing cultural sociology. Lectures were occasionally somewhat dry, but they were always informative. Cultural sociology gives you a whole new way of seeing politics and culture. If you're interested in understanding how social life works and how narratives, symbols, and cultural scripts shape the way we think and act, then this course is for you.",
    "This course is a great way to really delve into what cultural sociology is, taught by one of the founders of the field. It is a lot of reading, which I found difficult to keep up with. Though I initially thought that the cultural part of cultural sociology meant that readings might be pretty accessible or similar to cultural studies, in reality a lot of them were pretty theoretical and dense. Professor Alexander's personal analyses of certain theorists and theoretical biases definitely come through in the class, but as long as you realize this, it is not stifling, but rather a way to adopt the viewpoint of a hardline cultural sociologist, which you then can choose to critique or combine with other perspectives. The final paper is a really fun way to create a pretty self-directed piece of writing.",
    "The important thing to keep in mind is that this course was highly theoretical. It gave a great survey of cultural theory from its beginning in the late 19th\/early 20th century all the way through the cultural turn and through recent cultural sociological theory. I wish this course had also covered the post-structuralists and Foucault, but we definitely went over a lot of good material. If you're not really down for lots of theory this class may not be for you. Furthermore, some of the readings sucked (Parsons!), but I overall enjoyed most of them, especially the contrasts between Bourdieu, Swidler, and Alexander, which was a high intellectual point in the course.",
    "If you're studying ANY kind of science that has to do with human behavior or experience... psychology, economics, political science, history, and so on, for goodness sake TAKE THIS COURSE. It discusses a vital element of social explanation that is often neglected in disciplines beyond just sociology. But be prepared to skim through horrors of paper and ink for said enlightenment. Skimming will be your friend, but there are a few key texts that you MUST engage closely with.",
    "fantastic course -- one of my favorite at yale. TAKE THE COURSE. Extremely interesting perspective on culture, social life, politics, etc. Jeffrey Alexander is FANTASTIC. He is the founding theorist of cultural sociology. Take the course. Can't recommend it highly enough. Readings are fascinating, half theoretical half empirical. Just so good.",
    "Cultural Sociology is a very interesting course, and it's not essential that you be a sociology major to take it. There is quite a lot of reading to do, and some of the readings may be difficult to understand, but the content itself is fascinating. I would definitely recommend it if you're committed to the subject, the topics are complex and you need to be willing to dedicate time to the course.",
    "Offers a fascinating set of readings tied together by engaging lectures. Essential if you're interested in culture and theory.",
    "Cultural Sociology is a fascinating genealogy of a field, taught by its pioneer, Jeffrey Alexander. Unlike other intellectual history classes, the themes and discussions are presented in a coherent, narrative and normative frame that (unabashedly) privileges Alexander's work. The class provokes and undermines many of the premises and methodologies of the humanities and social sciences that reduce meaning to power, interest, material conditions or strategy. It will teach you to to apply the theories to life around you, and leave the class seeing this a little differently."
