    "I would recommend this class to someone interested in film, maybe even passionate about it. We watch more arthouse, avant-garde, and intellectually challenging films than block busters, which is great, but it means you should appreciate film as an art form and not just enjoy it. I also believe this seminar (like others in general, but this especially) is really contingent upon other students' engagement and passion. If people aren't excited about film theory (e.g., film studies major taking it because it's required), discussion can be really uninspiring."
