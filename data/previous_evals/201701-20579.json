   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the functions of the media that we often take for granted in other fields. I think that this course is amazing at making you think critically about all the things that humans create artistically. This course is incredibly interdisciplinary and I learned how to draw connections thematically between seemingly disparate fields of study.",
    "This course teaches you to understand a modern phenomenon, media, in a holistic sense and each of its facets.",
    "I developed a broader understanding of the definition and possibilities of various media forms and its relation to cultural-historical developments.",
    "I learned how to write a close read essay and how to read and analyze more complicated readings.",
    "Fantastic overview of media theory.",
    "introductory theories and history of media, critical analysis texts including essays and literature",
    "I feel like I have a broad and interesting knowledge of the way that all media, which includes writing and stuff, interacts and I think that all TFs, along with Professor Williams, were brilliant and I think this course changed my life.",
    "I learned a lot about media and rhe history of different social concepts across many different disciplines. It was really interesting to me how the class was split in four units, and in each unit we looked and at such broad and varied ideas.",
    "An overview of the history of media and the different ways media influences our lives.",
    "I definitely learned how to evaluate media works more critically, to also consider the author and the context of the work as a part of the story. I also learned of some incredible authors and movements historically that are often overlooked put important in how they have shaped our culture.",
    "Great overview\/intro course that helped me understand the basics of \"media studies\", which I had engaged with before in other classes but never fully understood as a field.",
    "This course developed a useful background in a very wide variety of areas. It seems a bit discombobulated and contrived in the moment, but it's not until after taking the course that you realize you've learned a lot of useful random stuff."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was incredibly disjointed and felt very pseudo-intellectual. The readings were not thoughtfully chosen - we were asked to read hundreds of pages of nonsense that was barely touched on in class and did not seem helpful in the slightest. Professor Williams should have been more discerning and considerate about the bevy of essays he demanded us all read.",
    "I think that this course lacked a bit of focus considering that any novel, movie, or art could be counted as media. In addition, the Critical Terms texts sometimes felt that they lacked cohesion at some points, but overall this course is super interesting and good at making you think differently about art in all forms.",
    "Interesting class, but the content was all over the place, and some weeks seemed to have no relation to media.",
    "Could include more modern application examples",
    "The lectures were all well planned, but I wish we could have had more interaction with the professor in class.",
    "The scope of media was incredibly broad which felt at times a bit too expansive. Otherwise, the readings on the syllabus were incredibly interesting and uncommon.",
    "The course is interesting because it provides a broad view on writings surrounding the different types of media. However, I think that it should be condensed to a less wide range of topics.",
    "The syllabus was far too ambitious to be well-executed, the lectures were generally irrelevant, and the course was overall nothing but an opportunity for the professor to show off how many texts he has read.",
    "Sections are great but the course material didn't seem to always match up.",
    "breadth, content was interesting--however, often I didn't know how the material connected to the class",
    "Strengths: The syllabus material was extremely interesting and related well to one another. Professor Williams' lectures were also really fun and captivating. Weaknesses: Just a few little things-- I felt a little uncomfortable that we spent so much time on orientalism and Asian otherness, and Chinese orthography, I think it was interesting to learn about in terma of language and culture, but I dont think that we needed to spend so much tome talking about it. It felt a little fetishizing, to me as an Asian person.",
    "This course is too easy and has too low a level of student engagement, meaning that it is unable to create a hospitable learning environment. The topics are interesting, but they feel too irrelevant.",
    "I wish the course had more clearly related to film. Though it's cross listed, it felt much more like an English course. The film was an afterthought. Which is less than idea since it's required for Film and Media Studies majors. I also wish we had talked more about newer forms of storytelling.",
    "Lots of good readings, although the lectures wander a bit sometimes.",
    "I think the course would benefit from being framed as in part an exploration of literature. I often felt, mostly in the first half, like I wasn't sure what I was supposed to take away from the course. After taking the midterm I felt like I had more appreciation for the literature and context of it, but if the class was framed with that purpose I would have had the appreciation much sooner.",
    "Well-paced syllabus, diverse material, stimulating but enjoyable assignments and discussions, and truly fascinating lectures. It certainly seems like a difficult task to pull together the topics\/issues we covered, but Professor Williams made it work.",
    "This course seems very disjointed and random when one is taking it. It might be better to get a clear direction laid out from the start, but I understand that breadth is one of the important features of the course."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I just took this because it is cross-listed with English and I am an English major, but it is a very film-heavy class and really doesn't develop the skills required of English majors. It was an unfamiliar academic environment focused heavily on very modern issues in a way that felt hard to reconcile with the academic nature of Yale.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any humanities student who is interested in the workings of the machine of media that often occurs behind the scenes when writing, directing, etc. However, the theoretical nature of the class and some of the more \"out there\" readings could rub students who prefer a more applicable course the wrong way.",
    "No, unless you are VERY interested in theorizing about abstract concepts of media. The class is very abstract, and even the TAs often don't understand how readings relate.",
    "Yes, great class for anyone interested in the intersection humanities and technology.",
    "It's a thought-provoking course about the various modes and possibilities of communication-- it's at times very philosophical\/theoretical but Professor Williams makes connections across various readings in a really interesting way. Great reading materials.",
    "Intro to Media is one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The reading list is great, the content is endlessly interesting, and Prof. Williams is a superstar. Take the class.",
    "yes!",
    "Yes, but only if they want a very easy course in which they don't learn anything.",
    "I didn't have the best experience in this class, but I also checked out early on. I think if I had made more of an effort to engage with the material, I would have gotten more out of the class. Whether because of my attitude or the course itself, I had trouble wrapping my head around the idea of media studies and how each text for the class related to that field.",
    "Take it if you need to, or if you want to do some good readings.",
    "I think this is a fun way to look at media in new ways. At times the content feels very ambiguous\/airy\/philosophical, but I don't regret taking this and I think Prof. Williams is a very engaging teacher that creates a great class dynamic. A great class to take if you want to step outside of your comfort zone.",
    "I would recommend this course. It really is a literature course and you get a lot out of the readings if you do them. The professor doesn't put the lecture slides online so you do have to pay attention and take notes in class.",
    "An introductory leminar. This class was frustrating at times. The midterm and final are both passage identification, which we were only told a few days before the midterm. In the end, they were quite fair, however. The readings really pile up, especially towards the end when several full books are assigned and really complicated essays are put back to back. It would be more effective for Prof to assign sections from the book since very few students were able to fit an entire novel in a week's time. This sort of derailed discussions towards the end of the semester. The tests focus mainly on you connecting the readings to the larger themes of the course -- basically, \"Why did we read this?\" -- but it would be helpful if the class focused on this question rather than you trying to answer it on the test.",
    "Definitely - and still worth taking as an upperclassmen, especially if the workload stays the same. Glad that I was exposed to this complicated material that will greatly inform my work in other classes. (Have to say I'm biased as a film major, though.)",
    "This course builds helpful background for any area, but it seems very disjointed in the moment. You will learn a lot and be exposed to a lot of information, but it will feel amorphous and uncertain while you are taking the course."
