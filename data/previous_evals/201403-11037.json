    "I higly recommend this class for a good teaching training.",
    "If you are interested in foreign language teaching, this class is an absolute must.",
    "Principle of language learning and teaching is very nice course for language teacher. It provides the clear pictures of different teaching techniques and also provides opportunity to implement in own classroom. It provides a platform to think about our teaching in present days and to discuss with other fellows. It also focuses on the teaching through technology that is very relevant nowadays.",
    "The course gives you a good overview of several different theories and methods of language teaching. However, little attention is paid to implementation. Furthermore, although you do write a teaching statement and create an Online Teaching Portfolio as part of the course, you get very little feedback on them and they seem to be an afterthought rather than a key part of the course.",
    "I would recommend the class to teachers of language if they haven't had any exposure to theory. Although I'm not sure I got much out of the class that I couldn't gotten from reading a book.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me a more specific awareness about differnt teaching scenarios and theories and helped me to frame my own teaching experience.",
    "According to my area of research this course is mostly related to my research topic, ELT. I learnt a lot of things in this classroom such as teacher observation, writing your own teaching statement and evaluating yourself, to think critically on many important aspects of teaching. Use of technology in language classroom, assessment, writing research papers and so on.",
    "I do feel much more comfortable talking about my intentions as a teacher and justifying the kinds of tasks I design. While it doesn't relate to my dissertation, it was helpful from a professionalization standpoint. It could have been better though in helping us to prepare the materials we'll need for the job market.",
    "The course gave me some basic tools for answering questions on the job market. I don't feel like it really changed my teaching style."
