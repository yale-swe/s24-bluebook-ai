   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It has a lot of required reading and writing so I would warn students to be prepared for that, but it was a really interesting course that made me really appreciate literature and formal writing.",
    "The best way to describe the course would be by calling it an \"intense book club.\" The books we read were fun and exciting, yet also of literary merit. I would recommend the course to anyone who's either seriously considering the English major or even someone who just needs a distributional credit.",
    "Extensive opportunities to improve writing skills. Professor will challenge you on this front. Discussions in class very free-flowing and invigorating. All around a wonderful English experience.",
    "As someone who is more oriented towards the sciences, this class did a wonderful job of reminding me just how great literature can be. I recieved a lot of constructive criticism and feedback on every paper I wrote, and always knew what to work on going into the next paper. There is a lot of flexibility in this class to be as creative as you want. The class requires you to participate a lot and it is really important to not be shy. The workload is manageable as long as you are dedicated. I highly recommend this class.",
    "It's a great class. If you love reading and analyzing literature, then you'll enjoy it a lot. The class discussions are the best part--you'll receive insight from all of your peers in a stress-free setting, and Professor Hunter is a excellent professor who really wants you to grow in your analysis and writing.",
    "Examining villainy in different works, in different ways. I would absolutely recommend this course--not only did it improve my writing ten times over, but the idea of a lovable villain is so fun to talk about, so class discussions were always really interesting. 10\/10 would recommend to a friend.",
    "This is a great class if you love analyzing literature and are willing to have your boundaries pushed. It's a difficult class but also thought-provoking and fun. The discussions are long but fly by because all the students are so engaged and enthusiastic to participate. The supplemental readings are annoying, but the main works are always a pleasure to read. Great class."
