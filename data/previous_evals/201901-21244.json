   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course could be improved by having a more cohesive plan of what topics are covered, having slides that are actually comprehensive and comprehensible, having exam questions that cover understanding more than just memorization, having homework and final projects assigned on time and having them be free of critical typos and actually explained thoroughly.",
    "The upside I think was that there was a lot of material and I got exposed to several different topics. The downside is also that there is a lot of material, so many topics were not discussed thoroughly. I understand that this is a balance, though.",
    "the course is well organized, but the teaching content is a little bit too much",
    "I think the breadth is a strength because awareness of what analysis I could do is important. However, because of the breadth, I don't really understand how I would do any of these techniques. I thought the homework gave me a good understanding of how those techniques actually work, but we only had two of them. I think more short coding homework would have helped me learn the material better. I also felt that the presentation materials had a confusing organization for the first half of the course, but the discussion sections were a good addition to the material. Also, the due dates for assignments could have been spaced out more. The second quiz, the second homework and the final project presentation were all due in the same week.",
    "I gained exposure to some areas that I previously had very little knowledge in, and the discussion sections offered a place to further improve understanding. The section leaders were engaging and helpful. However, the course could have been better organized. There were supposed to be three homework assignments in addition to the final project, but somehow only two were assigned, and the final project was assigned with very little time to work on it before it was due. The discussed section structure should be tweaked. The paper summary assignment guarantees that everyone has read all of the papers (or at least skimmed them), so it didn't make a lot of sense to have summarizing the papers be the main activity in section. While the lecturers were mostly pretty good, slides could often have been improved. Basic terms and ideas often go undefined or unmentioned, while there are vast amounts of data (especially in figures) that are hard to understand or are not necessary for the course. One example is the data mining lectures, where we didn't go into enough depth to truly understand each technique unless we already had familiarity.",
    "I really liked that the lectures were available online, and that the attendance policy was relaxed. Matt Simon and Steven Kleinstein's lectures were my favorites. They were polished, and presented useful information without getting overly detailed. Corey O'Hern's lectures were OK, but in my opinion, they seemed unnecessarily concept-light and math-heavy for an intro-level course."

    "Nope. You would be better off just learning the material on your own. If you're taking this class to learn how to program, you will never actually be taught how to and will just be expected to know how to do it for the assignments and project.",
    "yes, this class can be taken by students from different backgrounds. and the course is video recorded so that if someone misses one class, they can still teach themselves.",
    "I would recommend it but only to someone looking for a broad overview."
