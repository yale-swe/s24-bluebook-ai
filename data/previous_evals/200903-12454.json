    "If you're looking for a good seminar on medieval architecture and the context in which it was created, this class is a great one!",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class to any other student even if you have no background, Professor Genoni makes this seminar worthwhile and makes you learn so much throughout the class.",
    "definitely a good class, though harder than the syllabus makes it appear. Genoni is a great teacher and very funny but she does expect a lot from you so be prepared to put a lot of thought into the assignments and readings",
    "This was a great class! Prof. Genoni was great as a discussion leader - I would highly recommend her class next semester on that basis alone. She's a bit crazy, but in a good way, because she's just so excited about all the material. Naples is off the beaten path as far as art history goes, so it was very interesting to take a class on how art and architecture developed there. Also, taking a class designed around a single city\/region was great, because it really gave us a chance to look at local trends and such in depth, rather than the \"survey of ___ art\" pattern more prevalent in the department. Take this (or another class with Prof Genoni) if you can!",
    "Yes! Take any class with Prof. Genoni - she is simply amazing. She is very lively during seminar discussions - you will never be bored, trust me - and she can truly make anyone love art history. She also really cares about her students - she would think about her students when writing class sessions or exam questions in order to cater to everyone's interests. Workload is manageable, though very heavy during the last part of the semester.",
    "take it! professor genoni is amazing! a reasonable amount of work and you learn so much. professor genoni is so funny, fun, and approachable!"
