   "comments": [
    "Of course, if they want to learn how to speak French, this class will be the best way to start learning.",
    "A good course to take, you'll learn a lot, really pushes you.",
    "Very challenging but worth it if you want to actually learn the language through immersion.",
    "French 110 is a standard introductory French language course. By the end of the course, you will have learned a shocking amount of material. An understanding of the present and some of the past and future tenses can be expected. The course relies of reading, writing, speaking, and listening to obtain these goals. I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Although there is a substantial amount of work, FREN 110 provides a solid start towards fluency in French.",
    "I would recommend Professor Burton but not necessarily the Capretz method. I tend to do better with a more structured, grammatical approach which allows me time to memorize and internalize the language. The strange vocabulary and fast pace of the Caprezt method was more difficult for me to retain.",
    "Difficult and intensive, but well worth taking if you put in the effort.",
    "French has a lot of workload and is hard for the first time. It gets better with time. Madame Burton is a great instructor and she cares about each student."
