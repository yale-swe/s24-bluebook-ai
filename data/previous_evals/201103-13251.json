    "One of the best courses I've taken as an EMD student. Strengths: you really learn how to effectively critique journal articles. Weaknesses: none.",
    "This was a fantastic course - I loved the course material looking at different parasites every week, and it was a great introduction to some of the new techniques for fighting neglected tropical diseases. Learning to write critiques and grants were really valuable skills, and I felt as though I will be able to apply my learning from this class in many different ways in the future.",
    "This a fabulous course and a wonderful introduction to parasitology.",
    "The course is comprehensive, but also tailored to students' specific interests. In addition, important guest lecturers add a dimension to the course material. Overall, it is an exemplary parasitology course for students interested in global health.",
    "Strengths:Broad variety of parasites coveredBringing in experts to discuss their topics of interest is greatWeaknesses:Presumed knowledge of biology not clear going inGuest lecturers shouldn't choose their own papersSet up of student presentations doesn't really allow enough discussion"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Dr. Tschudi is a great professor - he's not afraid to be blunt if someone is doing something that isn't up to the work expected in the class, but takes his time to provide thoughtful feedback for students so that they can really improve their work over the course of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Chris is wonderful and very encouraging. He makes the classroom setting more relaxed because it can be intimidating to approach a subject one doesn't have experience in!",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0At the beginning of the semester, I felt that the instructor was somewhat strict, but in hindsight, I truly appreciate his positive criticism and demand for better efforts, especially with assignments. Because of this, I believe I improved my approach to difficult course material. It was a rewarding experience to be able to see my improvement by the end of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Dr. McMahon-Pratt is fantastic - she's always available for questions outside of class and really believes in letting studentstake most of the control over their projects while just facilitating wherever needed.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0Diane is an excellent teacher. SHe is brilliant and very excited about her subject. She gives great criticism and is very helpful when you have questions about papers. Sometimes, she might assume that students have more background knowledge than they actually have.",
    "Instructor: Diane McMahon-Pratt \u00a0The instructor is kind and generous with her time and efforts. This is now my second course with the instructor and my only disappointment is that she does not teach any other courses in the division. She is very knowledgeable and experienced in her field and it translates well in the classroom."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend to anyone thinking about a PhD, a career in academia, or publishing in the future. One of the best EMD courses I have taken. The workload was very manageable. Each week we were assigned two journal articles to read and then had to provide a 2 page critique for each. No midterm. The final is really straightforward - we had to submit a 2 page GatesFoundation Application and do a 5 min presentation. You also have to sign up to present twice over the semester: these are 30 min presentations of an assigned journal article for that week. On weeks that you present, you don't have to do a written critique. In summary, I learned a TON about parasites and Drs. Tschudi and McMahon-Pratt are very accessible, provide all of the feedback on critiques (no TA's), and pretty much know everything. Do yourself a favor and take this course.",
    "This class is fast paced, but gave a great look into the newest scientific literature on parasites and scientific techniques that are on the cutting edge of research. It's a fairly science-heavy class, but if you are engaged with the subject material it will be fantastic!",
    "My favorite course so far! I reallyrecommend this to any EMD student and any student interested in learning about different parasites. There are great speakers that come in from diverse departments at the university to talk about their specialties. This is an intense writing course and you get good critique on your science writing, but it takes time as you have to write 2 reviews of papers each week.",
    "I would not think twice about strongly recommending the course to another student. Not only is the lecture material relevant, but guest lectures and student discussions make for a unique learning experience. Overall, it is a well-taught parasitology course with a positive focus on current research.",
    "This course is a really good course on the biology of parasites, as you might think. However, there is a significant amount of presumed biology knowledge going in, so if you've never taken a science class, it's probably not right for you.The course covers lots of different parasites and the critiques of papers is a really good way to get in-depth knowledge of them. But the papers are mostly molecular biology-type work, so don't be expecting to critique epi papers.Overall, I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot. It's also quite small which is great for discussion."
