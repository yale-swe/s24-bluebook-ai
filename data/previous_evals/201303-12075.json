   "comments": [
    "In this class, we examine some cognitive capability that humans have and look at experimental evidence as to whether babies and animals possess that capability. Topics of discussion include Language, Theory of Mind, Object Permanence, and Attachment. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It is an incredibly interesting course with a manageable workload, and I feel it gave me more insight into human cognition and culture.",
    "Take this class if you're even remotely interested in infants and animals. The work load isn't too bad, especially if you find the material interesting. Professor Wynn is amazing and very approachable.",
    "This is a really fun class!!! I thought at first that it was sort of frivolous- how will learning about animals and babies be useful in any way? However, my first impressions were proved wrong entirely. I learned so much! Learning about babies was the highlight for me (although the animal studies were interesting) because we learned so much about where the biases we have as adults originate. The workload is pretty standard. Absolutely do the readings because it's awkward\/ very apparent in section if you don't and they come up on the exam. The readings are fun for the most part, though. The exams are fair- if you study you will do well. The annoying thing is that you have to remember the authors of papers\/ the studies you read about. The papers are also short and not difficult to write. Take this class!!! You have to put in the work, but it isn't difficult, and it is enjoyable.",
    "Great class. Challenging but a ton of fun.",
    "Yes! Great class! Not too much work but you learn so much and professor Wynn and Arber are great",
    "I would definitely recommend this class even if you're not a Psych major. It was one of those classes that I just talked about with people even outside the classroom.",
    "This class is a general overview of infant and comparative cognition, but it is extremely accessible, even for people who have no background in psychology or cognitive science. Though very general, it explores some very interesting topics, from infant morality to social cues in canines, and it allows us to make some cool connections between our baby lives to our own.",
    "This is a really great course to take if you are a cogsci major or have an interest the cognitive differences between humans and animals. The lectures are interesting and section is useful for wrapping your head around some of the more difficult readings. The readings are all journal articles, so they can be a bit dense at times, but at least there isn't a textbook so you've got that goin for ya. The class is kind of a heavy load in terms of work, but you will learn a ton, even if you aren't doing all of the reading. The knowledge you gain will be useful both in the classroom and at a dinner party, as some of the topics you will discuss make for great dinner table debates. Go in expecting to work hard, but likewise, expect to be rewarded for your effort.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who has ever wondered what goes on in the head of babies and animals - if they dont have interest in that, I would tell them to stay away.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was fun and very interesting.",
    "This course is very interesting and unique in that we compare the cognitive\/social aspects of infants and many different species of animals. The workload was manageable (5-6 readings a week with short reading responses, 3 essays, a midterm and a final). The midterm was pretty tough but the final was manageable. The essays were fun to write and the TA was willing to help. I would recommend this course, but I would suggest taking it Credit\/D. It would be less stressful. But beware, if you don't like to get called out in section\/review sessions, then you will be miserable during weekly section.",
    "Mental lives is an awesome course if you want a trying foundation in infant cognition research and animal behavior. It helps answer questions about our own psychologies, and the instructor really know her stuff and present it in a clear, enjoyable way. I enjoyed going to lecture and section every week. Definitely worth it.",
    "Definitely recommended. The only suggestion I would have to improve this class would be to scrap the section as it does not feel very beneficial to the course. Otherwise, everything was great and the subject material lives up to the title of the course spot-on. Having two reading responses a week is a bit annoying. Not because they are long (they're both very very short), but just because of having to remember two of them per week."
