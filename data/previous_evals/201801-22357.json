    "I learned a lot about Baroque art, and even more about the scholarly discourse around Baroque art since the nineteenth century.",
    "Professor Suthors seminar provided an intellectual history of the Baroque in relation, specifically, to Baroque aesthetics \/ style.",
    "This course provided me with insight into past and present discussions and ideas regarding the Baroque movement. Class seminars produced fruitful discussions which supplemented the weekly readings.",
    "I built up a long list of philosophers, thinkers and art historians many of which I had heard of before but had not read in depth. I thought much deeper than I had before about what is defined as the Baroque period and how definitions are changing and fluid."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: I liked the historiographic approach. Though the thematic clustering of the texts was useful, I would have preferred that the texts be sequenced chronologically so I could have gotten an idea of how the discourse on Baroque art evolved over time. It was nice to visit the galleries, and I appreciated that we looked at art nearly every section. The readings were difficult at times, but the amount of reading was pretty fair. Weaknesses: It was a very large seminar, and there were a few too many presentations. But I am glad that the course readings ended several weeks before the end of the semester so that we could work on our final papers.",
    "This was a phenomenal course I only wish we had more time to continue it!",
    "The course included discussions, presentations, and firsthand interactions with Baroque artworks at the YCBA and YAG which allowed for deeper insights to be revealed.",
    "I enjoyed the mix of readings, museum visits and student presentations. I would have liked to see more reference images during class as we were discussing certain issues."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to students concerned with intellectual history and students who like to look closely at Baroque art.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. The material is fundamental to the critical history of art. And, of course, it covers a fascinating and complex period in art history, religious, political, and intellectual thought.",
    "Yes, the course was interactive, informative, and ultimately very useful.",
    "Yes, it was challenging but rewarding."
