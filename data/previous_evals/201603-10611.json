    "I did feel like I learned quite a bit of grammar and vocab, though I don't remember most of it! There was so much material that I couldn't really absorb all of it. Still, my writing skills definitely improved from last year. The level of knowledge demanded by the heritage class is really on an entirely new level.",
    "The basics of Korean grammar as well as key concepts in pronunciation. Culture was touched upon as well.",
    "I definitely learned a lot of new grammar and vocabulary necessary to have simple conversations",
    "I learned Korean Grammar as well as tensing and speaking rules that I did not know previously. This class also helped me bring my reading and writing skills to be on par with my speaking skills.",
    "I further developed my Korean skills via improving vocabulary, grammar, and speaking."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: A teacher who really cares about her students, interesting projects, lots of feedback Weakness: Sometimes unreliable\/unclear organization and grading, so many different handouts and online resources that I believe should be condensed somehow. It would have been more convenient, I think, to do our homework in bluebooks and to receive all handouts in a course packet, so that we could have everything in one place all at once. I would have appreciated a little bit more of a regimented routine when it came to revising homework. I think that a lot of us may not have learned as much as we could have because we were not pushed to actively reflect back on our work and correct our mistakes.",
    "This class was a very fun class as the students were allowed to converse with one another and participate verbally to practice the language.",
    "The class had a mix of levels, but in the end I think all of us understood around the same even if our speaking and writing were still on different levels.",
    "Strengths were that it met everyday and the class was very engaging. Weaknesses were that homework could have been more useful as sometimes it felt like busy work."

    "KREN 132 is a relatively low-key course with an extremely knowledgeable instructor. Professor Choi is very familiar with \"heritage speakers\" of Korean and knows how to bring up our literacy to an acceptable level. Although there is daily homework, it is never overwhelming, and the grading is very fair.",
    "I would recommend this to someone looking to become more fluent in Korean because it's the only option on campus for that pursuit. I would warn them, however, that the class can be a bit haphazard organizationally. I would also advise them to keep the hundreds of handouts in a 3-ring binder and to turn in homework, always, in a separate HW notebook.",
    "Yes this class will most definitely help improve the student's Korean as it is taught by an amazing professor.",
    "The course isn't particularly hard it's just time consuming at some points. The end of the year project saves you from having to deal with the class into finals but both options end up taking more time then you intended them to. Just start earlier rather than later and you'll be fine. There are level test after every chapter or so and those aren't really that bad either if you know the vocab. I literally can't stress it enough. Professor Choi loves making you translate pieces from English to Korean so not knowing the vocab is fatal. Lastly, there are quizzes everyday (mostly) but they really aren't that hard. At all. Again, just study the vocab. I came in the class hoping to better my Korean listening and conversation skills and that definitely happened this semester so yea, I'd recommend it if that's what you're looking for.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to those students who grew up in Korean background so they can speak the language but were never really exposed deeply so can't read or write well."
