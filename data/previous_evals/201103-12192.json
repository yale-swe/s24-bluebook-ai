    "I enjoyed the course this year and think it will be even better in future iterations. It's mainly a focus on 20th century responses to failures of the Enlightenment, which are really interesting and relevant to today's world. It's a lot of reading\/writing, but Prof. Wetters\/Jan were really helpful and you can certainly get through it with a bit of hard work and reaching out for assistance. Class lagged at times, but it was a small seminar with an even smaller contingent willing to participate so that was as responsible as anything for that. Survey courses are inherently frustrating, but this offers a lot of interesting perspectives on things that are important\/interesting but are generally not covered in depth at Yale. Would definitely give a thumbs up.",
    "A wonderful tour de force through Enlightenment thought, continuing the legacy into the present!"
