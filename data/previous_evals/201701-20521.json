   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I developed skills pertaining to legal reading, writing, and analysis, as well as lots of knowledge surrounding educational law and its interactions with public policy and day-to-day life in a school.",
    "I learned a lot about how to read case law and how to apply and interpret those precedents in the practice of problems. It was a great introduction to the study of law and the legal writing and reading that comes with it.",
    "I learned about the development of case law that effects the US education system. I learned how to read and analyze cases as well as how to apply legal standards and precedent to new scenarios and determine how different situations would be ruled in the court.",
    "EDST 230 presents a generous work:development ratio! The requirements of the course are not above average in demands (weekly seminar, ~100 pages of reading, 25 pages of writing paced across the semester as you would like it). However, a student who takes 230 without prior knowledge of the legal world will learn a fantastic amount. Garfinkel paces his readings across the semester to mix historical and contemporary cases, which allows each class to touch on contemporary issues with past context. Also, the cases build in complexity, allowing each week's discussion to build of the last's. Sometimes the discussions felt one-sided (more lecture than conversation), but Garfinkel's humor and wisdom inspired me to overlook this flaw. Also, as a senior who spent most of February interviewing for a job, the relaxed nature of the writing assignments allowed me to prioritize effectively.",
    "I learned a lot about the mechanics of education law, but even more about how to look at problems and real-world issues for their nuance and to find ways to apply different legal strategies to reconcile those nuances.",
    "I learned a lot about how to read case law, and learned a lot of terms that are common in legal jurisprudence that I know I will always be able to use. It also thoroughly convinced me that I should do not go to law school. Don't get me wrong: the course is incredible. This realization came more from my own experience grappling with the case law, and realizing that I really did not enjoy it.",
    "I gained a strong understanding of constitutional and state laws on a variety of educational issues.",
    "The course was a pretty comprehensive overview of different topicsranging from segregation, to vouchers, to gender inequality, to disability, to free speech, to religion, etc. In addition to the outcome of the specific law cases, I think the biggest thing that I learned this semester was how to think like a lawyer: analytically, dissecting every detail of a situation, and thinking about how any little change could affect the result of the case. I learned a humility regarding how difficult and complicated topics in law can be.",
    "I gained experience reading case law, and got to hear the reflections of someone who's spent his life practicing law.",
    "I learned how to read and analyze legal cases. In the beginning of the semester, the readings in the casebook were challenging since it was my first law class. As the semester progressed, it became much easier to understand the cases, and our class discussions gradually became more rich as we were able to analyze the decisions of the courts more accurately\/in depth. My favorite part of the course (and also the area where I saw the most personal academic growth) was writing the response papers based on our class discussions, in which we considered how the law would apply to the casebook problems. My classmates asked a lot of thought-provoking questions, and it almost felt as if we were \"playing judge\" for the day, since we got to analyze cases in the same way the courts did. Very cool!"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course has so many strengths--Professor Garfinkel, the readings, the preference to Education Studies students who have relevant background experiences. I think it's only weakness may be the minimal engagement students have between the written assignments and in-class discussions. It would be nice if the writings could connect with what's being discussed in class.",
    "There was sometimes too much reading to tackle, so people had different levels of preparedness when we came to class. It might be better to focus on 3-4 cases each week instead of full chapters.",
    "The course offered an in-depth look at the laws that affect how schools are run from early childhood education to college. The class discussions were good and there was time for both questions from the reading and to explore difference legal scenarios. Another positive of the class were the guests who specialized in certain aspects of education law.",
    "Strengths: Garfinkel may be the reincarnation of a bygone Dalai Lama. His knowledge of the legal world blew me away, and his ability to communicate complexity without aggression inspires me to do the same. Weaknesses: The class felt repetitive. Every week we read cases, then arrived in class and discussed them (with Garfinkel doing most of the talking, usually). I still learned a good amount of knowledge, but the familiar and repeated nature of the class did not push me out of my comfort zone. I would have enjoyed something more active -- a field trip, a more collaborative project, etc.",
    "I loved how student-directed the course was. Compared to other more minutely structured courses like Constitutional Law, I liked that Judge Garfinkel gave us the opportunity to use the class for our own interests and purpose. I often found that our tangents were the times when I gained the most insight!",
    "This course is incredible. Jumping right into the material allows students to truly get comfortable with legal terms quickly.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is Professor Garfinkel. First, he is an extremely talented seminar leader, being able to transition from topic to topic with grace, humor, and inclusiveness. Second, he is very approachable and great at answer any questions that you might have. Third, he has the ability to give feedback in a way that is simultaneously constructive and blunt, but nevertheless comforting and supportive. The course material is also fascinatingranging from segregation, to vouchers, to gender inequality, to disability, to free speech, to religion, etc. The discussions were nuanced and lively. The assignment structurewriting 25 pages any time, with any prompts, and in any incrementsis a double-edged sword. On one hand, the amount of flexibility that it offered was incredible throughout the semester, and I know that a lot of my peers took advantage of it fully. Personally, having never taken a law class before, I wish that there was some sample prompts or a sample schedule that Professor Garfinkel could have given. I have no doubt that if I had asked him earlier in the semester, he would have given me one though. I went into this course with extensive background in education theory and policy and was hoping that that knowledge would be applicable in some waysI think the biggest thing that this course needs is some extra guidance for people that have never taken law courses before. I spent a lot of time reading the casebook, but felt habitually held back by a lack of familiarity with specific legal terms. This, along with the fact that there were many cases every week, made me struggle with figuring out what the takeaways were. To remedy this, I would recommend that each week Professor Garfinkel list a couple of terms that students should be able to define. Having students watch out for terms such as strict scrutiny or heresy or summary judgment would make reading things clearer. I dont think that its necessary to have specific guiding questions, since the casebook has many guiding questionsbut the sample prompts might be a similarly guiding force that would not limit discussion in the seminar.",
    "The strengths of this course are how much Professor Garfinkel loves the law and how enthusiastic he is about sharing his thoughts on the law with us. It's also a strength that, if you're taking the course in a busy semester, you can choose when to write your reading responses\/when to work for the class. There are unfortunately a good number of downsides -- mostly, that you'll get out of this class what you put into it, and, since Professor Garfinkel doesn't expect very much from his students, most of us didn't put much into the class. Since everyone is writing their reading responses in different weeks, in no given week did everyone engage deeply in the course material, and it was far too easy to not do the reading because we were never really asked challenging questions in class.",
    "I think the class moved a little slowly in the beginning since most students were unfamiliar with analyzing the law. Tips on how to read\/analyze the cases would be helpful. The strength of this course was the amazing discussions we had, especially towards the latter end of the semester, in which we tackled casebook problems and asked hypothetical question after question. Professor Garfinkel was a great conversation facilitator and always willing to answer questions, which is helpful for students who are unfamiliar with the law."

   "comments": [
    "One of Yale's greatest gems that any student should take. You will learn so much about legal reading and writing, but more importantly you'll get to learn from Judge Garfinkel who is so experienced, funny, and kind. If you are able to get in, you simply must take it.",
    "Absolutely! This is a wonderful class. It is fun, engaging, and challenging. Judge Garfinkel is a wonderful teacher and mentor.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if you are interested in taking a course that will introduce you to the basic aspects of studying law or are interested in education and want to learn more about the laws and requirements that form the US public education system.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to anyone who is interested in the subject. Judge Garfinkel is warm, funny, and very knowledgeable about the cases covered in class. The class covers lots of ground, but the workload was not overwhelming, and grading was fair, even generous. The one thing I'd warn about is that the class is less off a seminar than others I've taken, and is more Judge Garfinkel talking and asking questions at intervals. I didn't mind this though because he was great to listen to!",
    "Sure! You'll learn more if you haven't taken a course in law before, because I imagine some of this was review for those who took ConLaw. That said, know that junior\/senior EDST scholars get priority on seats, so I (not EDST) had to wait for someone to drop before I got a seat.",
    "YES! Take this especially if you are thinking of law school, as it forces you to dive headlong into reading case law and writing original legal arguments. It was a very tough course, and you have to read very carefully to wrap your head around the fine-grained complexities of the case law, but it is worth it. Also Garfinkel is a GEM! One of the funniest, most down to earth professors I have ever met. I really look forward to the coming year.",
    "Absolutely",
    "YES! This is a great class for growing in ones understanding of how law affects everyday life! Ant Yalie would be lucky to learn from Judge Garfinkel!",
    "This course is definitely worth itbut be careful not to underestimate how initially challenging some of the concepts can be if you have no exposure to the law. As someone that had no prior experience with law, and a lot of experience in education, I think I thought I was going to into this course with more knowledge than I hadbut I ended up learning a lot as the result! The course material is fascinatingranging from segregation, to vouchers, to gender inequality, to disability, to free speech, to religion, etc. The discussions were nuanced and lively. The biggest strength of this course is Bill Garfinkel. First, he is an extremely talented seminar leader, being able to transition from topic to topic with grace, humor, and inclusiveness. His anecdotes are hilariousand he seems like the kind of guy you would just want to grab a beer with. Second, he is very approachable and great at answer any questions that you might have. Third, he has the ability to give feedback in a way that is simultaneously constructive and blunt, but nevertheless comforting and supportive. The assignment structurewriting 25 pages any time, with any prompts, and in any incrementsis a double-edged sword. On one hand, the amount of flexibility that it offered was incredible throughout the semester, and I know that a lot of my peers took advantage of it fully.",
    "I'd recommend this class to another student, given that they know what they're going to get out of it. The best part of this class was getting to know Professor Garfinkel, who is genuinely one of the most kind and thoughtful professors I have. He cares so much about the law, and clearly loves teaching and being with students. The workload is extremely light -- very reasonable reading from the casebook each week, and 25 pages of writing that you can space out however you want -- so, if you're looking for a relaxed class with a kind professor where you get to determine how much you put into it (and how much you get out of it), this definitely fits the bill. Unfortunately, the course demands so little, and Prof. Garfinkel is so relaxed, that it's easy to get very little out of this class and to cruise without doing the reading or engaging much at all. Most of class is spent listening to Prof. Garfinkel reflect and share his thoughts on the law, which is interesting, but not at all engaging -- there wasn't much actual class discussion to speak of, and I just felt like I didn't learn too much at all. That said, it's a joy getting to know Prof. Garfinkel -- but know that the class might be frustrating, if you're hoping to learn a lot about education or about the law.",
    "Yes! This class is strange because it's simultaneously super laid-back and also very thought-provoking. If you space out your response papers, the class is pretty low workload. My tip would be to base your response papers on in-class discussions of the casebook problems. The problems will have a couple questions that you can answer, but to lengthen your response, you can ask more hypothetical questions and explore those in greater depth. Garfinkel will often use class time to discuss the problems, so if you are unsure how to approach them, that's a great time to ask questions and get a better handle on your analysis. This strategy also sparks excellent conversation too--one of the best parts of the class! Professor Garfinkel is extremely kind, very approachable, and has a good sense of humor. He is always open to questions and is very responsive to emails. I sent him multiple articles throughout the semester that related to some of the cases we had covered, and he always emailed back promptly with a comprehensive response. He's also very helpful in brainstorming paper ideas and clarifying questions. If you're writing your first paper and you're a little uncertain about how to analyze cases, reach out to him! He is the kind of professor that wants learning to be natural, not stressful."
