   "comments": [
    "Continues where first semester left off. This year we read Petrarch, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Goethe, Tolstoy, Proust, Elliot, Stevens, Borges. SO MUCH Great reading. I liked the lit from this semester more than last semester. Take it.",
    "You take a wide variety of texts from the West and read them, tracking themes as they develop\/echo through the years that go by. If you do take this, don't skip Tolstoy.",
    "A course you should take. Thematically, stylistically and historically interesting and significant.",
    "I'm pawning off quite a few of my philosophy and history and politics books, but I'm keeping War and Peace, Don Quixote, Wordsworth, Paradise Lost and most of the rest of my literature books. They're the works I think I'll really remember and come back to in a few years. Definitely stick with DS for the second semester--it's worth it!",
    "The second semester of DS Lit is perhaps the best feature of all of DS. The works are both enjoyable and deeply thought provoking. It's also a remarkable experience to watch as the classical literature of the first semester finds its way into modern readings. Prof. Bauer is excellent. He is not an easy grader and he demands a great deal of preparation before each section, but it is WELL worth it. While I obviously didn't have any of the other professors, it seems like he is easily in contention for being the best on the DS lit faculty.",
    "DS Lit second semester is definitely more work, but so worth it! The material is more modern, so you can relate to it better. The amount of reading can get a little overwhelming at times, but things were easier to read. It's definitely a challenge, but an extremely rewarding and worthwhile one at that! Just be sure you're ready to take it and are committed to it, or you won't get much out of it.",
    "Second semester DS lit is the best. The books are amazing, and you will want to read them really well. If you are lucky enough to be placed in Professor Bauer's section, DO NOT SWITCH OUT. He is by far the best DS professor I've ever had. His insights are mind blowing, and they really help you see how philosophy and h&p interact with literature. Yes, he is tough and he expects a lot of you, but make sure you go to office hours and take advantage of his amazing writing tips. This class is life changing and Professor Bauer is the best of the best.",
    "RECOMMEND. DS ROCKS.But don't take it if you don't want to. DS doesn't want you if you aren't excited about it.",
    "TAKE THIS. just do it, it will change your life. you will learn to read better, write better. anything that you see or hear or read later on in life you will be able to understand with so much more clarity and depth and will thus also be able to understand and enjoy things to a much greater degree. this is the best course at yale, and worth the work and stress.",
    "The literature part of Directed Studies has the largest amount of reading, so it is both demanding and time-consuming. The sections might be frustrating sometimes because most of the time we are not able to discuss as much as we would like about the works we are studying, especially when we read War and Peace. However, Professor Bauer is very good at leading interesting discussions and most of the times we were able to get a lot from the books. I would recommend this section of Directed Studies, as well as the program as a whole, for those students who are not overwhelmed by it in the first semester, because it gets even more intense. It is definitely worth it if you are interested in the subject.",
    "I enjoyed the Spring DS Lit reading, which includes modern poetry and plays as well as prose fiction, much more than I enjoyed that of the Fall. I found that modern literature was much more my taste than its ancient counterpart, and was pleased to learn that my knowledge of the classics enhanced my understanding of the modern works. The lectures this semester were consistently engrossing, and my section was particularly strong. The Spring semester of Directed Studies Lit was my favorite part of DS.",
    "There is an ungodly amount of reading, but the reading in this class is some of the best you could ever partake in. Take it with Mark Bauer--he's outstanding."
