   "comments": [
    "This course is very interesting and the discussions were interesting. I wish however that the course was more than just 3 sessions and also wish it was not on Friday afternoons at 3 PM.",
    "Strengths: definitely got us thinking - a lot. Case study format worked well. Weaknesses: not a lot of facetime with professor (mostly run by student TFs) - while the TFs obviously put in a great deal of effort into organizing the case studies and discussions, they simply are not trained to lead discussions. My group experienced a lot of dead silence and consequently we weren't able to delve too deeply into anything we talked about. It would have also been nice hear the TFs' opinions on the questions they were asking us, which weren't offered probably because they were hoping we would take up the time with our own. But lively discussion was just rare in these breakout sessions. I think it would be better if we had more time with Dr. Khoshnood.",
    "If students were more engaged, the course would have been a lot more effective and also interesting.",
    "Honestly, I don't feel like I learned anything new from this course. I felt like most people didn't care about it, so our conversations were not engaging at all.",
    "The training is too much",
    "This was my favorite seminar series so far. I loved the open discussions and the different cases prepared by the TA. I wish that this course could be translated into a semester-long series or that we do a series like this every semester (the last 3 Fridays of every semester). I think it is very important for all students to have training in ethics, especially in the health care industry. It was great hearing from people in different professional careers - students, researchers, physicians.",
    "The course could have thought more in depth about the foundations of public health ethics. Additionally, I wish there had been a wider variety of case studies, rather than just research ethics.",
    "I liked that we were able to discuss cases with our peers but I think it would have been more beneficial if each of the discussions were being led by a faculty member or a public health professional.",
    "Weakness: preparation, in that TA's did not upload the readings in an adequate amount of time prior to the class. I could not do all of the readings within the short time we had to prepare. Strength: the breadth of cases discussed",
    "literally the worst course I have taken- ever",
    "This course was poor. The instructor seemed knowledgeable, but exposure to the instructor for many was minimal. The TF's who led discussions were nice but not necessarily expert. It seems as if this course was put in place purely to meet some legislative requirement, rather than to consciously advise on how to handle\/address certain ethical issues that one might face. 2 of 3 \"classes\" were structured as interactive discussions, but the seating was for a didactic lecture, limiting the ability for discussion as a group. I felt that it was a waste of my time.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I think it was a great structure for us to talk about relevant ethical issues in public health. The TAs were great and led great session discussions. I enjoyed the case studies, but I didn't always have time to read them before the session because it was always my last priority among the other work I had to get done in a week for my other credited courses. It was sometimes frustrating because other students didn't seem to be as engaged or to want to be there, which meant only a few people contributed to our sessions. I didn't love the 3-5 on Friday time for this class, especially on the day before Thanksgiving break. It would have been nice if it was pushed back a week and took place during the same time as the professional skills seminar so we could have been done earlier in the day. I also think this would encourage more engagement from students.",
    "I think that the course had interesting topics, although our break out discussions were not structured very well. They were quiet and not all that interesting.",
    "This course should be a full semester course offering for those interested, not a requirement on Friday afternoons.",
    "Interesting course and was instructed effectively, despite limited class time.",
    "The large size of the breakout sessions to discuss the two cases made it hard to really engage with the material.",
    "I would suggest having a session in which we split up my department and have relevant reading and discussion relating to what we are studying. It would have also been helpful to go through philosophical frameworks. Without these, I found that discussion was not as enlightening as it could have been.",
    "I don't feel that I got a lot out of this course. While ethics is definitely crucial to public health, I don't think this was the right way to teach it. The classes were too big and because it was non-credit, there was no incentive to do the readings.",
    "I feel that the course would have been better if the TAs were better at leading the discussion. In my group there were many silences but the TAs were not good at guiding the discussion or even moving off of the selected topic. I felt that the ethical problems discussed were kind of ridiculous and i wish they were more relevant or at least more able to incite discussion. the ta's were obviously frustrated with the lack of response but they were unable to actually talk from their own experiences or even give very good examples.",
    "I think it would have been better if we had learned more about the study of ethics or a more guided background of the cases.",
    "While I enjoyed this course, it seemed really unnecessary. I could have gotten just as much out of reading a paper or having one single lecture.",
    "great!",
    "I wish the course had touched upon more relevant topics. I only really found the material interesting during the last section.",
    "Core course but good introduction to ethinc",
    "I enjoyed the first class where we discussed the criminalization of HIV- everyone was excited to talk about it. But the cases in the second were not engaging. Simply put, no one in our subgroup knew much about the topics or cared much about the topics. It made for an awkward last two sessions where facilitators attempted to make conversation, but no one had anything to say. The third class had better cases, but it felt forced- of all things to talk about in ethics in public health, THIS is what we talk about about? Electronic medical records and fat-shaming PSA? Again, conversation was lacking because either people didn't really care about the topics or it was so obviously bad that there was no ethical debate to be had, we all agreed.",
    "Interesting and engaging, but just should not be on a Friday afternoon.",
    "Interesting, could be structured better so students take it more seriously",
    "I think that ethics in public health in an extremely important topic that we need to be thinking about as public health practitioners. I wish this course was a core course and graded like other courses. The fact that is is ungraded means that little effort is put forth by students. 3 sessions is not enough to address the ethical issues around public health. I think if it's going to stay as a non credit 3-week seminar then perhaps incorporating prepared debates or something else engaging. The TA's were basically pulling teeth to get people to participate. I also that the case studies weren't completely thought through. Some of them I thought weren't realistic, i.e. the case study of the e health records, I just don't think a healthcare system would be so unaware of HIPAA violations, usually health systems are hyperaware and overcompensate. The refugee health case study was also ill thought out and a few of us commented on this in class that it didn't make any sense.",
    "Good, not much work. I'm not sure how much I learned, though. I liked the lecture on the criminalization of HIV transmission the most.",
    "This felt like a very random and odd structure to force the ethics requirement on YSPH students. Perhaps designated \"ethics\" lectures could be given in core classes we're already taking. Did not get anything out of this course. The late Friday afternoon time frame was also a poor choice.",
    "It was very interesting to me!",
    "lecture notes are very organized",
    "The class was good but at times included wasteful information but overall it was explained well and interesting class.",
    "I think that an ethics course is necessary for all YSPH students to take. I think that breakout groups and case studies are a great way to learn - better than lectures. However, not exactly sure why or how, the discussion sections just didn't work. They were too big. Nobody wanted to talk except for the 3 people who always want to talk. There were way too many questions to be answered which left very little room for discussion. Between cases, we had a two minute break because we went over. Two minutes for a 2-hr class is not a lot when you're sitting in a circle staring at each other. What I think could have been better than the TF's reading questions out loud and staring at us while we blankly stare back, is smaller groups. Small groups bolster confidence. Perhaps if within those breakout groups people were to split up into smaller teams and have to report to the larger group their conclusions, it would have been more engaging and interactive. Not having ownership of the case made it very very passive. TF's and Kaveh did a good job though!",
    "I wish had a chance to interact more with the instructor and hear about his work and have a more formal teaching in Ethics. It is worth appreciating that the TAs took a lot of effort in preparing the cases but I didn't particularly find it helpful. It was disappointing to be in the same group with the same TAs for all 6 cases. the Instructor could perhaps have rotated through all the groups.",
    "The course seemed to have fallen short from what previous students had said about the course. I expected more engaging conversations with the TFs leading the conversations. Most of the conversations were quiet and only had active participation with a few students contributing. It felt as if there were too many students to allow for an intimate conversation about difficult topics.",
    "It could be improved by being lengthened. There was not enough time to explore crucial themes. It is inappropriate for a program of public health, especially one that prides itself on developing leaders in the field, could not have at least a one semester course on Public Health ethics. It is woefully inadequate, especially when there are so many young, formidable minds in the program who remain unsure of their next steps, to not provide them with the opportunity to develop this lens. I have been very surprised by the extent to which this type of critical thinking and robust analysis of these issues has been lacking from the first year of a program in this field. It is probably my biggest eye-opener in coming to YSPH that exposure to and involvement with this type of thought is more of an afterthought. Especially in this field, the value of having a full length required course in this area CANNOT be understated. It is absolutely my biggest disappointment in the program and it is not my primary area of interest at all.",
    "i think the number of sessions was right on point--3 seemed adequate for what we needed to accomplish. friday is, of course, the only time everyone at YSPH can attend this seminar, but the instructors should really communicate with the professional skills people so there isn't that overlap. because if the prof skills seminar is the only reason why we have to be having ethical discussions from 3-5 on a friday night, then there needs to be another solution, because absolutely no one is engaged with anything at that point in the day. also, i think it would be more valuable to spend the first two sessions really talking about the standards, approaches, and theories behind public health ethics, and then use the last session to really discuss two cases in depth. the cases we did also seemed way too easy, which is also probably why no one really wanted to talk about them.",
    "The individual sections were very dry; the TA's had to beg people to talk because the material seemed painfully irrelevant to everyone.",
    "Overall this course felt like a loss of time. The individual sections were very dry and nobody wanted to participate. The material seemed painfully irrelevant. I would have enjoyed being challenged to think about ethical issues in public health, but the presentation by some TA's who had to beg people to participate was poor. There would be awkward 2-minute silences all the time where nobody spoke and we all just wanted it to be over. I feel that there is great potential, even using some of the same cases, but presented differently and in a more engaging way.",
    "This course could meet more regularly and be a smaller size.",
    "I really enjoyed this short course as an introduction to issues in ethics and public health. I thought the case studies were interesting ways to engage with some of the concepts, although I sometimes felt like I didn't know how to contribute in a meaningful way, because I did not have much knowledge on some of the topics. I liked the format of the class as having 3, 2-hour long sessions, broken up between lecture and discussion sections where we engaged with the case studies.",
    "Strengths- Case discussions",
    "This course gives me a comprehensive view on the ethics in both research or I hope they can post slides online afterwards. I wish this course could be longer, as well.",
    "Poorly structured. Students were not given basic principles or frameworks to discuss ethics. Friday afternoon\/evening is a poorly scheduled time for the seminar, as many people do not pay attention by that point in the week - especially when there is a break schedule right after.",
    "I think that ethics shouldn't be a separate class. Ethics should be sprinkled throughout all YSPH classes.",
    "Not a very useful course.",
    "Overall this is a poor course. Ethics should be a core course instead of a seminar. Due to the high number of students the professor needed the assistance of second year teaching fellows. Their discussion sections were out of the reality and did not discuss any bioethical principles relevant to each case. This course does not teach any bioethical principle (e.g. four common bioethical principles) nor any key papers (e.g. Declaration of Helsinki, Nuremberg trials, etc.)",
    "the discussion cases are very interesting",
    "I get the intention of the course & i think it's a very important topic but I ended the course not really knowing what the main takeaway points were. i think making sure the students understand what you're trying to teach in the end at least a few sentences summarizing what it was could help.",
    "It was fine. It was good to talk about the topics of the class although the 2nd class (when we talked about cancer treatment and something else) was a struggle. I guess because students didn't have an adequate background and no one read beforehand and because it was the Friday of Thanksgiving break, no one really talked much and the TFs had a hard time running the class. But the next class went much better (also it didn't require any prior experiences\/technical knowledge to have an opinion here).",
    "This course was not useful. Ethics is incredibly important in the realm of public health, so there must be a better way to present information about the ethical practice of public health. The lectures and discussions were incredibly boring, making the information difficult to absorb.",
    "good",
    "strengths - TAs chose interesting topics weakness - group participation determined how much you learned from discussion",
    "I really enjoyed splitting off into sections. I felt more comfortable with engaging with the class and addressing ethical issues that I would never had thought of. I also learned a lot from my peers as well as teaching fellows through their opinions and their experiences.",
    "I would have preferred to have this course divided into shorter time periods throughout the semester.",
    "The case studies prepared for the course were thoughtful and very relevant. However, the discussions around these case studies were somewhat lacking. Students in the discussion groups simply didn't put enough effort into understanding or debating the topics. This could potentially have been improved with smaller discussion groups.",
    "Good",
    "good",
    "I believe bioethics to be crucial to public health, and although the course did the best it could in 6 hours, I felt is if it was not enough for students to get an in-depth understanding of ethics in order to guide their future public health practice. I'm not sure if it is possible to make this course worth half a credit or an equivalent alternative so students obtain more exposure and are more motivated to learn about ethics.",
    "The course was very brief, which I think is unfortunate considering the fact that the topic and scope are extremely important. We had a couple good discussions, but I think the course should be semester long and for credit. I am concerned that I am going to graduate from this program without ever having any kind of course that discusses the complex history of the field of public health through an ethics lens. Public health has historically been, and continues to be, an often unethical field and I feel that the curriculum at YSPH has completely failed to address this and to think critically about public health work from an ethical standpoint. I was hoping this course would address some of my concerns, but it was so brief that it just wasn't set up to do so. It also is kind of set up for a failure though being a no credit course on a friday afternoon during a time of the semester when people are overwhelmed and burnt out. It felt like YSPH was sending a message that this topic doesn't matter, and that felt really disappointing and frustrating. The instructor and TAs were great, but we just didn't have enough time or space to get anything out of the seminar.",
    "Good.",
    "This class needs more of an ethics background\/framework\/general overview. The focus is now is far too specific.",
    "TA's had too much autonomy to teach the course, would have appreciated more teaching time from the professor.",
    "Important topic but not taught in the optimal fashion. Did not engage students\/felt rote",
    "This is an important course. I think putting it at Friday between 3p and 5p, including the Friday before a holiday week hinders the impact of the course. I know finding a time slot is hard but best to have it when people are more energetic.",
    "This course was a good introduction to ethical issues in public health. However, it was very short and not very in depth. It covers a really critical topic and I think ethics should be integrated into other courses at YSPH.",
    "It is taught in an interactive manner with students drawing insights from their experiences",
    "This seminar is on an extremely important topic; however, many students were unwilling to engage during the discussion sessions which limited the class",
    "- dividing into small groups was good - TAs were excellent",
    "This is such an important topic in public health, however I felt as if each session was a bit rushed because there was a lot of content that had to be covered in a short period of time. Rather than having three, 2-hour sessions, it may be more conducive to have a half-semester's worth of seminars that each touch on the different topics of the course.",
    "Strengths- this course was very interesting and informative of the ethical issues in the practice of public health. I thought it was applicable to typical issues faced in the professional world of healthcare. Weaknesses- this is not a mandatory course and it should be.",
    "I liked this course, and actually wished we had had more sessions. It's a very important topic that should be applied to every course.",
    "A brief but well designed class to introduce PH ethics",
    "none",
    "Could have been more interactive"

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings are very interesting (if you actually do them!) and the discussions can be lively depending on who your TA is. I wish more ethical frameworks were discussed but overall really enjoyed the brief taste of public health ethics that this course provided.",
    "Advice is to read the case studies beforehand. I couldn't prioritize reading them over all the graded reading I had to do for other classes, and I was at a disadvantage during the discussion. Or maybe no one read beforehand - that would explain the stark silence in our breakout sessions. It's tough when you're taking an ungraded seminar in the middle of midterms and close to finals. If there's a way around that (like having it in the very beginning of the semester), that would probably work better.",
    "Such an interesting topic, but the course itself felt like it fell short of doing it justice.",
    "I mean you have to take it. But I wouldn't get excited about it.",
    "Good",
    "Take this class! Conversations about ethics are very necessary.",
    "The course was okay. While it is mandatory to take, it does not give a great introduction to ethics and if you want a deeper introduction and understanding of public health ethics, this is not the course for that.",
    "In this course, we discuss the ethics of different cases. I think ethics is an important course to take before we become practitioners but I think each of the smaller discussions need to be led by Faculty or other professionals and not students.",
    "The course was acceptable but could be strengthened in preparation and material. Overall, a miserable way to spend a Friday afternoon, but without any other time allowed, I understand.",
    "Obviously some Yale-mandatory course, no one wants to be there.",
    "I would not recommend this to another student, but it is required, so the recommendation does not really matter. If this is meant to be a series of interactive seminar like sessions, then group size needs to be reduced, the TF's more consistent in their approach, quality and discussion. Alternatively, have the lecturer who is knowledgeable give 3 didactic lectures with readings and perhaps an online test or write a short paper on a topic.",
    "Great class. I'm glad that it's required for everyone. I wish more people took it seriously and engaged more with the material.",
    "I thought the course was decent and I think it would help another student to be exposed to ethical issues.",
    "Not memorable, does not achieve desired end of teaching ethics.",
    "Go to this class and be engaged with the material and professor\/TAs, you will learn something if you go in with a desire to learn.",
    "Take it because you have to. It is pretty painless, and not a big time commitment at all.",
    "Not that great. something that you have to do to fill the requirement.",
    "Although it was pleasant, this course seems pretty unnecessary, and you might not learn anything new. Would not recommend if it wasn't required.",
    "Yes. Very useful",
    "RECOMMONDED",
    "The course takes place over three 3-hour sessions. The first class, we are introduced to ethics in public health and discuss as a large group in Winslow. In the second and third class, we break out into sub-groups and discuss case studies with a TF as a facilitator.",
    "Not much work, fun, learned things!",
    "Unhelpful and required. Should be updated to be more engaging and include learning.",
    "I think so -so they can get an ethics overview of public health!",
    "yes, i think it is neccessary for us to know the ethics problems.",
    "Yes, I would recommend, because it is a useful course",
    "It's a requirement. But yes, it is helpful to better read and understand studies and assess if they are quality or not.",
    "No - unfortunately, it is a requirement.",
    "If you have never encountered ethics in the context of any health profession then this might be useful. However, if you have previously had an ethics course or something similar then the subjects and cases might not be as interesting.",
    "Wonderful and so important. The readings are interesting and imperative. Unfortunately it was the type of class people could get by without doing anything for, which many people did. It's sad given how imperative this type of thinking is to all work in public health. As a Friday class with only three sections, it seems like an afterthought, and many students treated it like that. This is something that needs to be a requirement by far and away. If it is an issue of having too many requirements, do away with the EHS class. No student who has taken both would bat an eye. Every first year could have taught the EHS class. Ethics is an area we need to be exposed to, experienced in analyzing, and pushed to be ever more critical about. That is something I expected to feel much more well-versed in after this degree and bizarrely, it is something a student needs to search out. That is twisted given the field we are in.",
    "If this was an optional course, it would be better not to take it. While it is very easy, the material is not applicable and it almost seemed like a waste of time in general. I would have loved an Ethics course that made me think and challenged how I view public health issues. I'm sure this course can be improved and made to be just that!",
    "This seems to be more of a seminar than a classic lecture course.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. I think it was an engaging short-course in how to think about ethical issues in the context of public health, and it was especially interesting to have these conversations with people who will be future colleagues in public health.",
    "Recommend",
    "Necessary for people who wants to conduct studies based on human subjects.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, as ethics is a huge topic public health, which was ignored for a long time. This course would give you a good overview of what you should have caution on in research and practical settings.",
    "Poor - did not take anything away from this seminar series. I wouldn't recommend it to another student because you don't learn how to engage ethical conflicts well.",
    "Really boring lectures and discussions.",
    "Can be improved with more relevant theories and help from bioethics TF.",
    "Yes, you can know lots about the ethic questions in public health",
    "This course will not be useful to you. To learn about the ethical practice of public health, you might as well read on your own.",
    "Yes",
    "It's great class! I just wish it wasn't in the afternoon on a Friday after the professional seminar.",
    "This course is worth the time, although it feels slow at first. It gets really interesting when one is able to discuss in groups.",
    "Good",
    "good",
    "It's good.",
    "This is a required class that takes place three times on Friday afternoons (which is not a good time late in the semester!). It mostly consists of talking about specific topics in smallish (20-30) groups with teaching fellows. There is reading, but most people in my group didn't do it.",
    "Terrible course timing (3-5 on Fridays)-- not ideal for maximum student engagement",
    "Students this year had to attend three, 3 hour sessions. Each session goes over a broad ethical issue in public heath. Requires students to complete HIPAA and Human Subjects Protection trainings which I thought was useful. Gives a good, but brief, overview of ethical issues but I think these types of discussions are really important and need to be integrated into other YSPH courses.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course since the lessons taught are essential for research",
    "This short seminar explores some of the challenges of public health ethics; however, those interested in the topic will want to explore it further than this class",
    "I would recommend this seminar to another student. I think it is necessary to consider ethical issues in public health practice.",
    "I would recommend it, because I think it is important for students approach all public health issues with ethical concerns in mind.",
    "yes"
