   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. It's a great class and I found it very interesting to discuss historically prominent papers as a group. The workload is very chill and I really learned a lot.",
    "Good class. It was cool to learn about how science was done before all the technology we have today was available. Interesting and not a lot of work, so a good class for seniors. Professor Hochstrasser is great! That said, I don't think the class was as good as previous reviewers said it was. It didn't really challenge me as much as I hoped it would, and I didn't really think of it as a culmination of everything I had learned so far as an MB&B major. Still good though.",
    "I would really recommend this class to people interested in research. It's very little work, but you actually get better at a valuable skill: reading and analyzing papers.",
    "It's a very high quality seminar for MB&B majors. But how much you will enjoy it depends on how much you engage with scientific papers. Some of them were really interesting but others were kind of boring. But the professors and other students still make it enjoyable nonetheless.",
    "I would totally take this course for the MB&B lecture requirement. I learned so much and it it the first science class where I actually felt I am doing smth useful, practical and that I am learning smth.",
    "Take it! One of my favorite classes in this major!"
