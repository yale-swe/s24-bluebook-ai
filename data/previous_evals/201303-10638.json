   "comments": [
    "This class is awesome. You learn a lot about such an important period of History, in which so many of the foundations of modern society originated: nationalism, the nation-state, Enlightenment ideas, colonialism, modern democracy and nationalist authoritarianism. Professor Merriman's also a great lecturer. His lectures are entertaining and informative at the same time. Also Max is an awesome TA. Take this class if you are at all curious about the foundation of the modern international society and politics!",
    "This class is a great survey of European history. Professor Merriman is one of those great professors that you'll find only at Yale, so take advantage of this opportunity. The class is fast-paced and has a solid amount of reading, so be prepared to work if you want to do well. I highly recommend the class.",
    "If you love history, especially if you are a major, then I would recommend it. But if you have a mild interest, you may be better suited in a class that doesn't have such a broad scope. The material was interesting, but we covered so much that it was hard to remember. There is A LOT of reading, but other than that there is a fairly decent midterm, a doable paper, and a final.",
    "AP Euro 2.0",
    "I found this course to be extremely interesting. It was just what I wanted in terms of learning more of a breadth of European history rather than a depth. Professor Merriman can be a bit odd at times, but that enhances the lectures and makes them enjoyable. I loved his textbook more than the history textbooks of high school because every now and then a funny quip would be interjected that would lighten the density. I felt like I learned so much more from this class than I have from all the history lessons growing up. Merriman's lectures and textbook also worked to thread events together so you could see how important historical events influence one another, rather than learning about them as separate entities in and of themselves. I also liked the added books and films because they provided a more visceral idea of what was going on at the time. If you're looking for a general history course to learn more about the world wards, imperialism, the Russian Revolution, etc, then definitely take this course. You'll learn loads.",
    "If you like Europe and you want a general outline on its history, take this course. While Professor Merriman is a nice person, his lectures are disorganized, so be prepared to learn primarily from the book.",
    "Great ouline of European history. Section, midterm, short (6-7 page) paper and a final...very manageable and low stress",
    "Tremendously worthwhile overview of European history, a topic all Yale graduates probably ought to have a better grip on than most do.",
    "I would recommend it to a person who really wants to know more about European history. It is a good survey course, and it adds some perspective to look at history. But it may not be the most inspiring or engaging class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want a VERY broad overview of European History. It is so broad, that I struggled a bit to keep it all in perspective in both time and place. However, Professor Merriman is great; he really makes every class very interesting!",
    "FANTASTIC COURSE. So interesting, such an excellent overview of European History -- just the right amount of general covering of important facts, and fascinating little vignettes and analysis. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT, whatever your major or interests.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend it--it's an interesting history lecture, regardless of how much European history you know already.",
    "I'm not a history major but I took the class anyway because Merriman blew me away during shopping period. He's a really great lecturer and literally wrote the book on European history during this era. I took it credit\/d because I didn't want to do all the reading (during the second half of the semester you have to read novels and watch movies as primary sources), but it was very much doable as a fifth class. Definitely take it, Merriman is a legend.",
    "It's similar to Merriman's other class apparently. There are definitely times when the OYC version of his lectures trump the actual version in lecture in terms of organization and content. His take on history is definitely one that I completely agree with and it's nice to see European history presented this way from an intro level. But it's a class that will definitely be great if you don't have any background in Euro and the period of time that's covered is absolutely essential to reflect on at some point during your time at Yale.",
    "Like Euro AP but better",
    "This is a great lecture with minimal work. You will learn a lot about Europe, and France, even if you already took this topic in high school or somewhere else.",
    "A survey of all if modern Europe. The amount of information you are responsible was at times overwhelming and the class is not particularly well organized. Professor Merriman is an amazing lecturer though and makes this class really fun",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to fill in large gaps in their history background without looking too much into any one part of the mess of European politics of the time period. The reading for the course is completely manageable and the only paper required was short and easy to write, as the topic was of the author's choosing.",
    "It is a very fast paced survey course that covers around 300 years of complicated modern European history in one semester. As a consequence, you get brief exposure to a lot of events and ideas but very rarely have the opportunity to go in depth. Great Cr\/D\/F course for those looking for an introduction to European history.",
    "I would recommend this class if someone is interested in the material. That being said, it is really easy to get lost and not do readings since the class is not graded very harshly. The class is what you make of it and if you take it with Merriman, be sure to use him as a resource.",
    "This is a course advertised as a survey that covers a lot not very deeply, and is precisely that. Though Professor Merriman's lectures were often scattered and uninteresting, especially if you've already read the textbook.",
    "Yes, definitely! Especially to students not familiar with European history",
    "Take this course!",
    "History 202 is a fast way to learn a lot about European history. A lot of focus is put on France since Merriman LOVES France. The class requires a lot of reading and staying on top of assignments. Since there are only 3 grades the midterm can be pretty stressful, as it will be the only grade you receive until the end of the term. I did not like this but I guess that's just part of adjusting to college, as I took this class as a freshman.",
    "Take this class if you are prepared to do the readings for you will get much more out of it than from lectures alone, however wonderful they are. Merriman is a great lecturer and a really funny and refreshingly down to earth guy, but there is only so much time in lecture and the readings are crucial for a better depth of understanding.",
    "Great class! Definitely take it if you want a broad overview of European history since the thirty year war till WWII, although given Merriman's background he has a tendency to focus more on France. Pretty chill workload (midterm, final, and a 6-8 pager) and prof's a great lecturer.",
    "It's a survey course on modern European history. If you don't know anything about it, you'll learn A LOT of really awesome stuff. I would recommend it - very straightforward, not too many assignments, and really well taught!",
    "A great introductory class on modern Europe. Covering some fascinating periods with thrilling lectures, it was one of the best class I have ever taken at Yale. Definitely take it whether you intend to be a history major or not."
