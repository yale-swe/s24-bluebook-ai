    "yes",
    "I would only recommend this for Credit-D. The exams are VERY hard and only out of 26 points. Lecture can be fun, but is often boring. We spent a lot of time on the foundations, but it's the specialized topics that are interesting. There is a fair amount of work (1 or 2 reading responses per class). All in all, I really wish I had taken this course Credit-D because it's pretty interesting at times, but hard to get a good grade in.",
    "Yes. This class was great, and Professor Scholl is incredible. It is such a fun class.",
    "Awesome, awesome material. Studying is necessary for the midterm and final, but you don't have to stress too much about it. The biweekly reading responses usually aren't that bad since you can get away with answering some questions without fully doing the reading. Brian Scholl is hilarious. Definitely take it if you are even remotely interested in cognitive science.",
    "Interesting class, parts of which are very relevant to everyday life. It will change your view of the world, sometimes in depressing ways if you think about the philosophical implications too much. Scholl was never explicit about it but he seemed to have an ulterior motive of turning us all into atheists.",
    "Take it credit\/D. For an into-level class it never fails to provide interesting material, which Brian Scholl presents with the flair of a showman. The exams, however, seem to be crafted and graded with the sole purpose of frustrating those who take it.",
    "Not exactly what I expected. Some lectures were great, some not so much. Professor Scholl is a fantastic lecturer.",
    "Cognitive Science was a good course, although it probably won't be one of the most memorable. Many topics are covered in the course which is good, however because of this it was difficult to go into depth with any topic. Because of this, I feel like Ilearned a lot yet very little.",
    "Interesting class with a great lecturer. Not challenging. I would definitely at least recommend shopping it to see if it is something you would enjoy.",
    "A good class to take, but Professor Scholl is definitely a unique professor. Try out a couple of classes and see if you like his personality\/teaching style. You won't really know your grade until the end of the semester and depends on the curve.",
    "Absolutely! I think I like the class more than the average person because I am a prospective cogsci major, but I really enjoyed the lectures, and I think most people would find the information in the class fascinating and relevant to their daily lives. It is not a lot of work but has a great payoff.",
    "THIS CLASS IS AMAZING!!!!! Seriously though, Scholl knows what he's doing, and his lectures are fabulous. I got a lot out of the class, and he is not hesitant to make fun of himself to get students' attention--always a plus. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a social sciences credit--I don't really like social sciences that much, but this class fascinated me. However, he does not stick to the syllabus--we didn't get through nearly all of the subjects he had listed, which was disappointing solely because I always wanted to hear more of what he had say.",
    "CGSC 110 is a good course for those who are considering majoring in Cognitive Science or a related field, or for those who have a broad range of interests.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to anyone considering Cognitive Science. While it will introduce you to many of the different topics in the field, it doesn't quite cover all of them. The workload isn't terrible, but I found some of the readings frustrating in how difficult they could be and how we didn't go over them in class (but they also weren't covered on the exam which was good). It is a good survey course, but you don't learn too much about any one topic.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS! Although the tests are pretty challenging, every class is fascinating. Professor Scholl is an amazing lecturer and you will get a lot out of this class.",
    "It's a pretty broad course, especially enjoyable if you're interested in social science with a basic understanding of potential laboratory work. There's around 2-4 reading responses a week graded on a pass\/fail (but really just pass, they ask you to redo it if you \"fail\"), a midterm and a final, and a final paper (4-6 papers). It's extremely manageable. I took it credit\/d - almost wish I didn't,",
    "Cognitive Science 110 is an introduction to an inherently interdisciplinary field that attempts to understand the human mind and thought. You learn about decision-making, themes of cognitive science, perception, linguistics, robotics, philosophy, cognition, neuroscience, infant cognition, and several other fields related to the topic. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone considering or not considering a major in cognitive science (or a similar\/related field).",
    "Yes. Fun fifth class.",
    "Under Brian Scholl at least, the workload in this class was very manageable. For each class, you have to do one to three readings and a one paragraph response on one or two of them. These are graded pass\/fail and it's nearly impossible to fail if the least you do is submit it on time. Some of the readings can be long and obscure (many are scientific papers. Scholl doesn't believe in textbooks) so you have to learn to skim. Most of the test material (according to Scholl, 95%) comes from the lecture so don't worry if you don't understand a reading. There is one midterm, one non-cumulative final, an a 6-8 page paper. Some say his tests are tricky but as long as you take good notes in class, they shouldn't be a problem. Also there seems to be a tremendous curve. The average on our first midterm was a C+ and I'm pretty sure that'll be curved to a B. If you have a question about anything, meet with Scholl! He gets very excited about cog sci and is eager to explain. Also, if you're interested in doing cog sci research, Scholl'll be more than happy to point you to labs (or ask the TFs! Ours were all from different cog sci labs).",
    "Yes, if with Brian Scholl",
    "Take it if you're interested in psychology, and even if you've taken intro psych. there's a little overlap, but this involves many more disciplines such as computer science and philosophy so that it still adds a lot of interesting twists to the intro psych material.",
    "This class is good for what it is. It is a brief introduction to cognitive science, a really broad field. Students who have already taken Psych 110 may want to reconsider taking this course because much material overlaps, but there is still a good amount of information that is not thoroughly discussed in Psych 110. Professor Scholl is a good professor but is in no way approachable. In fact, he comes off as a little pompous and abrasive. But he is a good lecturer which is really all you need in a class of this size. Exams are not easy, but manageable. There are really no surprises in this class.",
    "This course is very interesting overall. It covers a lot of topics, so it can seem nebulous at times, but Professor Scholl is enthusiastic about all of them and he teaches the class well. There is a fair amount of work, although it doesn't always seem like it because the readings (although long) are usually very interesting and new.",
    "I would certainly recommend it - it provides a good overview of many of the most interesting topics in cog sci and certainly piqued my interest in continuing to study cognitive science in the future.",
    "CGSC 110 is an amazing course that provides a broad introduction to the field of cognitive science. Although you won't have time to go into anything in too much detail (because of how inherently broad the field of cognitive science is), you will learn a lot of really interesting new things and most likely whet your appetite for future CogSci courses. I found lectures, for the most part, to be really interesting and enjoyable to sit through. There is no textbook for the class, and the readings, which consist primarily of scientific articles and short excerpts from relevant books in the field, to be very interesting and not much of a hassle to do. Definitely try and take this class with Brian Scholl - he is an exciting and engaging professor and a fantastic lecturer. Whether or not you know anything about cognitive science (or even what cognitive science is), I highly recommend taking this course - you will learn a lot about how the human mind works.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student.",
    "An interdisciplinary approach to figuring out how the mind works, drawing on all relevant methods, e.g. from neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, game theory and more. You will first be introduced to the 'foundations' of cognitive science - the ways of classifying cognitive science and cognition - then you delve into case studies of selected topics (which vary from year to year). I find the material to be fascinating, as it inherently relates to everything I do and you do; it aspires to holistic explanations for human (and animal) behavior. I would recommend this course to anyone, especially those interested in a social science or humanities program of study.",
    "You will be confused at the beginning, amazed by the middle and missing it by the end. It is an amazing class!",
    "Take freshman or sophomore year if interested in a general survey course.",
    "PSYC 130 with Professor Scholl was a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend other students to take this course with him. It is a great introductory course for students who are interested in cognitive science. Even if you are not a psychology\/cogsci major you will learn a lot in this course. The workload is not much greater than other courses: there are weekly reading responses, a semester paper and two exams but the exams can be slightly tricky.",
    "Good class. Professor Scholl is funny and entertaining, and a lot of the material is pretty interesting (though some of the topics are a bit dry...*cough*linguistics*cough.) Overall, I enjoyed this class and would recommend it to another student. However, it did also make me decide that a cog-sci major was not for me - as I described it to a friend, it's \"the less interesting parts of psychology, plus turing machines.\" The workload is not too bad: a midterm, a final, and an 8 page paper, plus a lot of reading responses.",
    "If you want a lecture class that just is pretty disjointed and is only good for the one or two illusions and punchlines that are given, go for it. You don't learn much. ESPECIALLY if you've taken any Psych class ever.",
    "CogSci is a pretty good class. Most of the material is very interesting, though sometimes the readings are a bit long and dense. The lectures are fairly enjoyable.",
    "Yes! I have already. It's a fantastically interesting and interdisciplinary class that a science and humanities student can enjoy alike.",
    "I'd recommend it if you're interested in going into psychology\/cognitive science and want a survey course. The class touches on the major fields in cognitive science (very briefly), but this is great if you don't know what you're interested, just to get a sampling of what's out there in cognitive science. The lectures were pretty engaging, and I thought all the readings were really awesome. The midterms are fairly straightforward, and easy if you put in the time to actually study for them.",
    "I would recommend this if you are a freshman or sophomore and not sure what you want to study, but think you might want to major in one of the following: cog sci, psych, linguistics, neurobiology, philosophy, or comp sci. This class is a great way to see what all these different fields are about. I'm a senior, and wish I had taken this class as a freshman. But I would not recommend this class if you're just looking for a fun class to round out your schedule- you can find more engaging and equally chill lectures elsewhere.",
    "This class is a very basic course in terms of depth and material regarding cognitive science. Be that as it may, I do recommend the course to others. I learned a lot of applicable knowledge about my mind, thought process, and decision making abilities.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Intro to Cognitive Science to a student who is interested in understanding the mystery of how the brain works.",
    "I would definitely recommend Intro Cognitive Science for another student. It doesn't have too much work, and the course material is engaging and valuable, whether or not you plan to continue in the field.",
    "Yes!! The class is wonderful. Lectures are always fun to go to and the material, though challenging sometimes, is manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in psychology or have some type of psychology background. The class was interesting only if you knew basic knowledge of psychology and didn't mind being confused sometimes.",
    "Brian Scholl is a great lecturer, although he does tend to ramble on certain topics that are of particular interest to him. If you've taken Intro to Psych or Intro to Linguistics, you might find substantial overlap, though; I'd say roughly 60% of the class covered topics that I already knew.",
    "Intro to CogSci is a fantastic course. It is a well-tailored introduction to the study of Cognitive Science, and Professor Scholl is one of the most brilliant people I have ever met. There is little point to taking this course if you do not take it with Brian Scholl.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is one of those classes that will shape the way you think about everyday matters. Not particularly rigorous; doesn't require much original thought.",
    "A general study of the mind, from basic foundations of the science, to specific applications. You will definitely find at least parts of this course interesting.",
    "It is exactly what it sounds like, a general broad overview of the course. It's really good in covering all of that but just beware that Prof. Scholl, while entertaining and really knowledgeable, tends to get distracted by his own discourse sometimes. Otherwise, great course. Interesting material!",
    "Yes! This is a great course, super interesting material, and thought by an amazing professor. I enjoyed going to every lecture.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone interested in this subject matter. I was taking this course just for pure interest, not for a potential major and was pleasantly surprised. The readings are interesting, and the work is very reasonable.",
    "I would recommend the class even if you don't want to go into Cog Sci. It's interesting and fun!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material is really cool and you actually learn a lot in this course.",
    "Great class! Professor Scholl is a fantastic lecturer. Every lecture was well organized and very engaging. It is more work than Intro Psych because reading responses are do before every class (so you have to do the readings). But a lot of the readings were really interesting. The two exams were tough, but definitely doable if you prepare correctly. The concept of the final paper was difficult to grasp, though. Not having to devote additional time to going to section is nice, but the TAs are very nice when you need them. I would highly recommend this class!",
    "If you have any interest in cognitive psychology but want a more research based approach, this is a great class. The topics are interesting and varied. Professor Scholl's lectures are fun, and the workload is not very heavy.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to other students. It is a fantastic introduction to the combination of all disciplines of cognitive science\u0097neuroscience, psychology, computer science, philosophy, evolutionary biology, etc.",
    "Definite recommendation. Scholl was a superb lecturer and made the subject matter more interesting, in my opinion, than it already was.",
    "Intro CogSci is an interesting course that covers some amazing topics. But it's not as fun as it may seem at first glance. The readings are mostly from scientific journals and not all of the topics on the syllabus are covered in class.",
    "Not as interesting as I thought it'd be. All the cool stuff was sped through right at the end and we spent the majority of the class on boring foundations of cog sci and very abstract principles of how you think about the mind. You definitely have to study\/work if you want to get a good grade.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Brian Scholl is an excellent teacher, the material is extremely interesting, and the workload is average for an intro class at Yale.",
    "I hated this class. Lectures seem like they should be interesting, and the topics always are, but I didn't lose anything when I stopped attending class (and the over-long 75 minute lectures) and started just reading the slides on my own.",
    "I would recommend it if you are looking for a basic, intro survey course. its not amazing nor is it a very engaging class. it is much more passive, with ideas that are somewhat intuitive with a more scientific spin. Its a good fifth class, scholl is a good lecturer, and interesting.",
    "I would recommend Intro to Cog Sci to anyone who is considering the major. This course will help you clarify whether or not cog sci is the thing for you.",
    "Cool, interesting survey class. Take it.",
    "It's definitely worth taking. It can change the way to think about your own mind and your existence. It's pretty low-key work wise.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. Really interesting and anyone can do well in it if you're willing to work hard and get involved in the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It raised a lot of questions about life and how the mind works, and it made me see the world in a new light.",
    "It's a very interesting course but make sure you're interested in the Social Sciences. It seems like a gut but the midterms are very challenging. This course requires more careful thought and understanding more than anything else, though. So if you can understand complex arguments and glean meaning from dense science articles, it's a great class and you really learn about interesting things. I would highly recommend this class, even though it can be challenging at times.",
    "The class was an excellent, if perhaps overly broad overview of Cognitive Science. It was surprisingly coherent, and it didn't feel like the huge (200+ student) lecture that it was. Scholl was well-informed and excited about his subject. He was very approachable, full of advice and energy.",
    "Intro Cogsci is a great survey of some really fascinating topics in cognitive science. Professor Scholl incorporates concepts from psychology, linguistics, computer science, neuroscience, philosophy, and evolutionary biology. It's very cool. A lot of what you learn may seem sort of vague, because a lot of what this class is about is introducing you to general principles of what the mind is, what it does, and how it does it. Basically, all of the specific phenomena that you learn about are being used to illustrate broad, overarching concepts that guide researchers' current approach to cognitive science. I actually found that in many ways, the class was more focused on showing us how to approach cognitive science\/how to think like a researcher and design experiments that suit the mind best, rather than on teaching us concrete facts about how the mind works. Because of this (and because it's a survey course), it can feel a little abstract, but a lot of what we talk about is amazing when you think about it. There are reading responses (1 or 2) due every class, two midterms (one at the end of the semester in place of a final exam), and a paper.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to pretty much anyone, even if you are not interested in the cognitive sciences or looking to fulfill a requirement. It is highly entertaining, interesting, and does not require to much of your time.",
    "This class can be confusing. Sometimes it was hard to grasp what exactly was being learned\/how it was related to cog sci. Overall an interesting class. I didnt do the readings ever and skimmed them if we had reading responses for them. The tests were fair.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it, unless there isn't a better psych course available.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it, especially if you're interested in cognitive science or have read any of Steven Pinker's books or something of that ilk. I'd say it's more interesting than the psychology class, based on what friends have told me.",
    "I would highly recommend it. It is an interdisciplinary subject that studies how the mind works through different approaches that include Linguistics, Computer Science, Neurobiology, Psychology, Philosophy, and more.",
    "A very interdisciplinary approach to the interdisciplinary field of how the mind works. Professor Scholl will show you how so many fields, that you wouldn't have thought of, contribute to the mission of understanding how the human mind works.Pretty good class overall! It can get somewhat tedious at times, just because it covers so many fields, and you will probably not be as interested in some as in others. Otherwise, Professor Scholl makes the class! Very funny, engaging-you can tell he wants pass on his passion for the field, which is always fun.",
    "The material in this course blew my mind on multiple occasions. I now have such an incredible appreciation for the magic of cognition. Scholl combines enthusiasm with a dash of wit\/sarcasm to make lectures really enjoyable. The readings were incredibly fascinating, and the workload very manageable. I highly recommend this class. It will change how you view your mind, perception, artificial intelligence, and more.",
    "CogSci 110 is an amazingly interesting course. The comprehensive way in which the topics are presented, and the fluid way in which they are transitioned between makes understanding the core of cognitive science delightfully straightforward. In short, I loved this class--including all the associated homework. I learned a great deal and look forward to taking more courses in the department.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It's fascinating to learn about how humans work and how we interact with the world, and it is relevant to nearly all academic disciplines and intellectual pursuits.",
    "CogSci is great. Brian Scholl is the man, and very engaging. Take it.",
    "The problem with recommending this course to other students is that they might be anywhere from freshmen to seniors. Lots of science majors (often seniors) just looking to take a fun social science class will sign up for this.Scholl provides model reading responses online, and one of them started out something like, \"Since I spent last summer working in _____'s experimental robotics lab..........\"These sorts of students who already have tons of experience in fields closely related to cognitive science obviously have a huge advantage... which puts younger, more inexperienced students at a bit of a disadvantage... especially without discussion sections.",
    "CogSci 110 offers an overview of Cognitive Science, focusing on the discipline's underlying principles. The class has a very high ratio of interesting material to work required. Professor Scholl is an excellent, very funny lecturer, though he had a tendency to fall dramatically behind the syllabus. The homework questions are easy, but most were only tangentially related to the lectures. This can be frustrating since you never receive any feedback as to if you understand the material or not. The tests are quite tricky, so don't underestimate them.",
    "I loved the course. If Brian Scholl teaches it again, take it; he's a very entertaining professor and very, very knowledgeable.",
    "A hodge-podge of material--some of it interesting, most of it not. If I had to do it over again, I would not take it.",
    "Take this class if you don't mind huge lectures. It's not a lot of work and it's interesting. There are daily readings and reading responses, but the reading responses are graded pass-fail, so if you don't have time to do the reading carefully you can probably just answer the reading response in 20 minutes. Try to stay awake during lecture and take notes, because all the material on the midterm and final are things he talks about in class.",
    "This has been by far my most engaging class this semester. The course covers the topic of cognitive science from every possible perspective. There really is something in this class for every type of person. In fact, I would say it really opened my mind up to several new ways of thinking about things.",
    "I would take the class to get a gist of the CogSci world, if it is a major you are considering.",
    "Great class. Tough at times but a very good survey of CogSci. Covers a wide variety of topics while keeping the core foundations of CogSci within sight, differentiating this unique field from the larger number of fields (psychology, philosophy, linguistics, neuroscience, computer science, etc.) from which it is comprised. I would definitely recommend this class to others.",
    "Anyone interested in cognitive science or psychology should definitely take this course. The lectures are very interesting and engaging, and it encompasses and touches on almost every aspect of cogsci you could want to learn.",
    "Take this class! Brian Scholl is an amazing professor. The workload is pretty light, but it's very interesting. It's a fun and engaging class, and will probably introduce you to a topic that you might want to delve into more deeply later on in your academic career.",
    "I took this class as sort of a random\/fun extra class. It was interesting, and the readings were good, but I think it is too broad to be valuable unless you're considering taking more cognitive science or psychology classes.",
    "Take it if you're thinking of majoring in cogsci. You'll either love it or hate it, and it will definitely help you decide.",
    "If you're interested and willing to read a large number of studies, take this for sure. Otherwise, maybe Intro Psych would suit you better.",
    "I would because it is the most interesting course I have yet taken in academia because it's a fascinating topic that is well taught.",
    "This is the worst class I've taken at Yale. I went into it absolutely positive that I was going to be a cognitive science major, and this class made me not only change my mind, but killed my love for the subject. I wish its terribleness had revealed itself before the drop period ended; I would have dropped it in a heartbeat. I hated every minute of the purgatory that was taking place in front of me.I love the brain and neurobiology. I love linguistics. I love psychology. This class should have been perfect, right? Wrong.Having already taken Intro Psych and Intro Linguistics, I was bored by the subject matter. This is nothing you haven't seen in a Malcolm Gladwell book. The course is very broad, and the midterms are much much harder than what you'd think. I recorded the lectures, and even I couldn't remember every little esoteric detail that was required for the midterms. The final essay topic was so vague, and no feedback was ever given either about the essay or about the reading responses. Worst of all, there's no internet in YUAG, so you have no choice but to sit and suffer without even the respite of Sporcle.Mainly, however, the problem with this class is Brian Scholl. He's a terrible lecturer. There's a reason why Marvin Chun and Paul Bloom and Provost Salovey attract big crowds for their psych courses; they're amazing teachers. Scholl is not. He takes 15 minutes to start lecture every day, often giving information he already emailed to us. He'll acknowledge that he sent this information in an email, AND THEN REPEAT IT AGAIN WORD FOR WORD. He goes off on random tangents during class; I once timed it, and he spent 18 minutes discussing a prenatal class he took before his kid was born. Once, we wasted 40 minutes playing the Prisoners' Dilemma; what Yale student HASN'T heard of the Prisoners' Dilemma? How many times must we look at the covers of Neal Stephenson books just so you can make some stupid puns? He complains that he doesn't have time to get through the slides (probably because he wastes so much) but still expects you to somehow absorb information as he flips through a powerpoint at lightning speed. He doesn't post any videos or pictures online, so when you look back at the slides, you'll see a ton of blanks and won't be able to remember what he was talking about. He's also extremely unhelpful if you try to talk to him after class.The guest lecturers, which I enjoyed (the only bright spot in this course) only served to highlight how poor the rest of it was.Overall, I'll probably do well in this class. Heck, I'll probably get an A. But was it worth it? Was the soul-crushing agony and slow torturous death of my passion worth it? Absolutely not. And I'm not the only one; many of my potential Cog Sci major friends are now doing other things. What am I left with? Convulsive shuddering whenever I see a man in a vest.",
    "A big overview of the cognitive science discipline. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Intro to CogSci was definitely interesting. As you can imagine, the lectures were all fairly disparate -- I liked sampling a little of lots of different fields, but some people didn't. Brian Scholl is definitely a character, so you should see whether you enjoy his personality from the first few days. The workload is pretty light.",
    "It's an easy enough class even when you do all the readings. The material is reasonably interesting and Brian is not a horrible lecturer. That being said, it's not exactly dynamic and there's no engagement. I also don't think [read:hope]this is not a perfect intro to cognitive science as it covered certain areas disproportionately. If you can motivate yourself and want the class either for credit or to see if anything in cogsci interests you, take it. Otherwise, there are more interesting fluff classes to fill a schedule gap.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It really opens your mind up to the world around you and makes you \"marvel at the commonplace.\" Everyone should definitely take it simply because it has so many implications for the world in which we live.",
    "definitely a fun, interesting course, though you do have to at least somewhat do the readings. no other work for it though, so it's pretty relaxed.",
    "I would say that the course dabbles in many different disciplines of cognitive science such as morality, neuroscience, psychology, behavioral economics, linguistics, and more, both in lecture and in our reading of a lot of lot of journal articles. Although I heard that intro to psych is more interesting, I would recommend this course because it covers all aspects of studying the brain and also requires some thought whereas psych is more memorization. It is a great class for students like me who have never been exposed to the social sciences and would like an idea of what they are like and how interesting they are.",
    "This class is amazing. It's a lot of fun and you really learn a lot. Since Intro Psych is in limbo for next year in terms of who is teaching the course, this one is a good alternative to take if you want one of those classic Yale courses. Even non-freshmen should take it! Brian Scholl is a great public speaker, although I don't particularly like his personality and he can be quite full of himself. Still, no matter how fun it is, you should not take it if you are not interested in the material because it is a lot of work. There are long readings and reading responses for each lecture, which can be a lot of work. The final paper is a bit random and useless too. The two exams are pretty straightforward so that is good.",
    "A lot of VERY interesting material that will have you going \"Oooh\" and \"Aahhh\". A lot of very cool facts. Not very much depth.",
    "Yes. The material is very interesting, and the course exposes you to new ways of thinking. Expect some overlap if you've taken psych, computer science, or some econ. Scholl is a very good lecturer but couldn't manage class time very well -- we got through about 2\/3 of the syllabus.",
    "Intro to CogSci is a fascinating course. Topics overlap with Intro to Psych but are taken from a different perspective so it's especially interesting if you've taken both classes. Professor Scholl is such an engaging lecturer - class was always interesting. The workload was totally manageable but the two exams were pretty tricky. I would recommend this course because you'll definitely come away from it having learned concepts in cognitive science that are very applicable to your daily life.",
    "CogSci is an awesome survey course if you're interested in learning more about how the brain works. I would recommend it to social scientists and those studying fields other than CogSci as well--- it's really illuminating.",
    "I think it is a great course that teaches a lot about the basics of cognitive science. It is well taught, the course load is pretty light, and I felt well-engaged in the lectures. Tests are tricky though and the curve is rough since there are so many people in the class.",
    "I'm torn--this is a fascinating subject, or collection of subjects, and an often enlightening, often entertaining class. Professor Scholl is knowledgeable, clear, accessible, sometimes funny. But I felt that the class didn't give me everything I'd thought I would get out of it. I wish there had been section, I wish we had covered more (Professor Scholl is not good at staying with the syllabus), I wish the assignment and grading system had been different (not that the class is really hard, just that I feel like the tests and paper don't really assess exactly what they should). Go to the first class, and take it if you like Brian Scholl (or whoever's teaching) and if you're really interested in the subject or, of course especially, if you're interested in the major.",
    "I thought I wanted to be a Cog. Sci major until I took this course. If you want to take a class that covers a lot and goes into very little depth, take intro to Cog. Sci.",
    "Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind that examines the workings of the mind through psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. I highly recommend it as an introductory course, as it really does give a solid introduction to neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and computers science.",
    "If you've ever wanted to study the mind, this class is absolutely the way to begin, Intro Psych be damned. Not only will you get multiple perspectives on how the mind works, you'll get a ton of interesting, cutting-edge examples of how disciplines intertwine and intersect to give us a fuller picture of how our minds actually engage with the world. Cognitive science is an emerging discipline RIGHT NOW, and this class will show you why being on the forefront of it is such a great thing. (If that doesn't strike your fancy, there will be psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, economics, inspiring quotes, aggressive fish, bees, computers, monkeys, robots, a basic video game, sexual attraction, a chance to forever break your trust in the person sitting next to you, and more.) Brian Scholl is an absolutely fantastic lecturer who knows this material back-to-front; you'll want him to teach it to you.",
    "A good survey course for Cog Sci. I just wanted a chill social science, and I think it would have been more interesting had I not taken Intro Psych (which I personally would recommend over this, though it is more work). Its hard to get an A in this course, but and A- is doable, since the exams are tricky and take careful reading of the questions. Reading the actual readings is another story: they are really boring, so no one does that. Which is not necessarily good because you may feel \"incomplete\" even if you're answering all of the reading questions based on skimming the readings.",
    "overrated",
    "Yes, I would recommend it - the class is like therapy, learning how your mind works, the different disciplines\/tools that are used to understand the mind, and the clever ways that researchers come up with for exploring the brain. As Brian talks about, the most fascinating thing in the world is us. So of course it's an incredible class.",
    "Take it your interested. It can be demanding, but don't let that guide how you take your classes.",
    "This is an extremely interesting class, and I found that a lot of what I learned in cognitive was not only fascinating, but extremely applicable to everyday life. The lectures were very interesting, but sometimes, the readings could be a bit long and dull. The great thing was that the class only tested on information from the lectures, so as long as you understood those well, the tests were not too bad. The work load was also relatively light -- 2 reading responses a week, two midterms, and a paper. Overall, I highly recommend the course.",
    "Professor Scholl is very passionate about CogSci, and some people find that passion contagious while some others (including me) don't. There seems to be a general consensus on the fact that Professor Scholl is a \"badass\", which is not particularly unfair because he mentioned in class that he wants to be one. I think Professor Scholl is a great lecturer and teacher, if not the most likable one. He knows what he's teaching, and he's very smart. He knows he's smart--the exams are very hard..I got an impression that he was trying too hard to be smart when writing the exams. If you take the course cr\/d\/fail, then you are going to be able to enjoy the course w\/o much pressure, because the exams are actually pretty hard.",
    "I would recommend the class for others. Psychology, however, is a little more interesting.",
    "This is a good course that touches on lots of different really interesting parts of cognitive science. (Although I heard with other professors it wasn't as good) Brian Scholl was good. He usually gave interesting and compelling lectures and seemed genuinely excited about the material and available for meetings and the like. The class had reading responses for every class (there's a lot of reading, but you don't always have to do it all. it can surprise you on the tests though), 2 midterms and an 8pg paper. The midterms weren't too bad, you know most of the kind of stuff that will be on there, although sometimes the questions are kind of hard to pinpoint. The paper doesn't seem like it should be too bad, but some of the most fruitful topics are offlimits because either Scholl said so or he put up really good model papers on them, and so that makes it difficult. Overall, it's a really good class if you're interested in how the brain works in relation to the world and development, etc.",
    "Yes! It's a very interesting class that is a good opening to exploration of the human mind",
    "CogSci was kind of nothing. The content of the class itself was more or less insubstantial, despite all we heard about it being a groundbreaking new scientific field. We seemed to learn more about learning about CogSci than actually learning about CogSci itself. Honestly, when a friend asked me what exactly I learned in CogSci, I had a hard time even formulating an answer. That same friend, actually, once toyed around with my CogSci notes that I left up on my computer; when I was reviewing those notes later, I legitimately could not tell if certain parts were completely made up by this friend (based on the sporadic CogSci terms with which he was familiar) or if they were the actual notes I took in class. That kind of says something about this class... I'd recommend it if you are actually interested in CogSci, or if you don't care about gaining much from a class. I walk away from that class feeling like I could have done something a lot more productive with all that time. We did have a few good laughs and learned a few really interesting things, but I personally don't feel like these things outweigh the lack of class substance.",
    "This is an OK intro class, though Intro Psych is much much better. In fact this class is pretty boring and Brian Scholl is not the best lecturer. The lectures on perception, Scholl\u0092s main field of interest, were by far the best, but some of the other lectures just left me asleep. This is a GREAT class for napping because its dark and the seats are comfortable.",
    "I think if you are interested in CogSci you should definitely take this class. There are lots of readings but overall pretty good, not too work intensive, and it's nice not having a final during finals week",
    "This is a huge lecture course that is meant to introduce students to a very large number of topics in cog sci. Brian Scholl does roughly as good a job with this as I think can be done. He covered most topics very superficially and unsatisfyingly, but I think it would be very difficult to cover them more in depth in this sort of course. Brian does a good job of lecturing theatrically, to an extent that sometimes leads him to be a little too self indulgent and perhaps alienating to some students. His lecturing also often verges on condescension. The workload is not bad: 1 or 2 reading questions for each class, two tests which weren't too difficult to study for, and one 6 to 8 page final paper. I would recommend this class only to a student who is interested in finding out whether he'd like to major in cog sci. It certainly helped me decide against majoring in cog sci, and I have friends on whom this course had the opposite effect.",
    "This course provides a very short introduction to some of the most common ideas in Cognitive Science. Don't expect to learn a lot about a certain field that interests you, but instead to leave with some impression of what \"Cognitive Science\" means.",
    "Yes, because it is a great chance to get interesting information and knowledge from very different fields and apply it to understand how the mind works.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wanted an overview of topics and applications of Cognitive Science concepts, or just to take a class that forced him or her to think about how they think. This course definitely focuses on breadth more than depth in terms of applying CogSci, but that is to be expected in a survey class. Brian Scholl is an extremely engaging lecturer, and his guest lecturers were interesting and added a lot to the course. Overall, a surprising and appealing course that certainly interested me in potentially taking more Cognitive Science classes.",
    "Definitely. One of the most fun and enjoyable classes at Yale.",
    "This course was very interesting and offers fresh insights into all facets of one's life. Your thinking will be challenged.",
    "Cog Sci is interesting. Brian Scholl can be a very good lecturer, but he can also seem like he likes to hear himself talk, so shop it and decide if it's right for you. You probably won't get through all the lectures, but the material is good and the work is not bad and graded fairly leniently. If you've already taken intro psych or intro linguistics, some weeks are going to be repetitive\/boring to you, but you have to decide for yourself it it's worth it.",
    "This class will satisfy anyone regardless of intellectual interest. The study of cognitive science is a conglomeration of psychology, philosophy, computer science, and a variety of other disciplines. I will definitely recommend this class to anyone at Yale."
