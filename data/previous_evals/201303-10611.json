    "If your situation is also were you automatically qualify for 150 because of previous AP\/IB testing, I would strongly recommend still taking the diagnostic test - 140 is not entirely new information but often covers AP\/IB material in greater depth - which I imagine is helpful with 150.",
    "I recommend taking French 140 to improve your reading, writing and speaking skills in French. I think I got a lot better at picking up details while reading and at pausing to say \"umm\" less while speaking. We had a very small class, so each of us got a lot of personal attention and a lot of speaking practice in class.Victor Serre is very nice and approachable, but doesn't necessarily know how to teach grammar well, because he does not have much experience as a teacher. Because he simply \"hears\" the difference between correct and incorrect French, and never had to learn the reasons behind most of these distinctions, he can't explain them very well to students. \"It just is\". He is, however, a native French speaker and listening to him will improve your listening comprehension, because he speaks not like a teacher but like a normal French person. I thought that was extremely helpful for me.If you're worried about not having the grammar explained very well, you might want to take Prof. Koundi's class, because he is also great. However, her class will most likely be larger, so so you won't get as much speaking practice each day.",
    "It is an hour of speaking in french each day. The material read is fun and interesting. Try and take it with an experienced teacher.",
    "Don't choose the section with the \"grad student from france\". Take it with Soumia Koundi or someone else.",
    "This is a fairly standard advanced language course. It will help improve language skills and is worth taking for anyone interested in advanced French courses."
