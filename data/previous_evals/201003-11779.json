    "Good introductory L5 course. I hadn't had Spanish for a year, so this was way for me to get back into the language and satisfy my language requirement.The work load isn't too bad and the readings are pretty interesting for the most part. Good preparation for class requires about half an hour to an hour three times a week (plus 7 written homework assignments that require about an hour of time each).",
    "Yes! It's a very chill class. Not too much work and Margherita Tortora is wonderful. If you want an easy L5 spanish class that will help you get more comfortable speaking, take it. I went in terrified and by the end of the semester, I was comfortable taking the 30 minute oral exam.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in improving his or her conversational Spanish skills. This class also improved my reading and writing skills because we practiced that a lot too. However, I feel like I have gotten to the point in my study of Spanish that classes are not helping me to improve drastically any more--I am more just staying at the same level. By this point, I feel like I need to be immersed in Spanish to really become fluent, so if you are looking for real fluency in Spanish, this class in combination might work.",
    "YES. Yes. yes.",
    "Perfect class to put L3 and L4 skills to use. Truly aids in conversing in Spanish and the topics we study are interesting. However, more work than the other Spanish levels and the grading becomes harder.",
    "It's not a lot of work and will slightly improve your Spanish skills. To get the most out of the class you have to do a very thorough job with the readings and find ways to talk as much as possible in class.",
    "I'd recommend this course for anyone who wants a relatively relaxed, comfortable environment in which your Spanish improves a bit. Don't expect fluency--if you want that, go abroad--but expect improvement. You read interesting articles and do occasional homework assignments on readings, take three quizzes in the semester, and do an oral midterm and an oral final.",
    "I highly recommend Professor Tortora. She is very kind and genuinely interested in helping her students improve their Spanish. I enjoyed the class, but wish I had taken it Credit\/D\/Fail. as I quickly realized my speaking and listening skills left much to be desired when compared to my classmates. I took both L3 and L4 last year, and Spanish 150 is very different as you are graded primarily on your speaking ability rather than written assignments. I do think the class improved my conversational skills as well as my reading and writing skills."
