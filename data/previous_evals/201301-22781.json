    "Good course, prior knowledge of the rational choice theory and game theory is highly recommended.",
    "Great course. If interested in the merits and limits of rational choice theory in political science, definitely take it. Definitely shop it if interested in more quantitative analysis of political science.",
    "very neutral on this",
    "Decent seminar. The organization was a bit strange, since we spent the first 7-8 weeks or so learning technical material about rational choice theory, and only then got into the meat of the \"critical evaluation\". While perhaps necessary so that we could understand the theory before criticizing it (and that even those who didn't take intermediate micro or game theory would have an adequate understanding of RCT), this meant that we didn't have much time to explore the pros and cons of RCT, and to really delve deeply into the issues. It also meant that it didn't really become a true seminar until more than halfway through the course. So, if you're considering taking this, definitely look at the syllabus and make sure you'll be interested in all the topics covered."
