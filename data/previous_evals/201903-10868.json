   "comments": [
    "Research, data analysis, critical thinking, deep understanding of my topic of choice.",
    "I learned about framing a research question, finding data sources, navigating data, running statistical tests, and evaluating my findings.",
    "I learned how to begin a thesis. I primarily learned how to gather data and write a pre-analysis plan that carefully laid out every step I needed to complete.",
    "I have been working on developing my senior thesis.",
    "Great introduction to rigorous economics research. The fall term of the senior essay is a great time for exploring your interests, diving into new topics, and conducting fundamental aspects of economics paper writing - the introduction; literature review; and framework for analysis.",
    "As this was my senior thesis, this was an opportunity for me to get involved more deeply in a topic that I am passionate about. I think that my writing, as well as my visual-making, skills improved significantly. I was also able to interview industry experts, which was a fascinating opportunity.",
    "How to conduct individual economics research - formulating a question, finding data, running analysis, analyzing results and more.",
    "I attended a few lectures and found them pretty helpful. Vitor's office hours were especially great.",
    "I am learning to conduct my own research.",
    "I have gotten a better sense of the initial stages of process of conducting independent economic research -- the tools, techniques, challenges, and rewards of choosing a topic, identifying a research question, obtaining and cleaning data, reviewing the literature, and conducting exploratory data analysis, and formulating an identification strategy. I've learned a significant amount about a specific topic area and field of research, and have familiarized myself with different research tools (e.g., R, Mendeley).",
    "Conducting Economics research and writing a structured research paper.",
    "Very specific tools for my thesis--overall help finding advisors."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Rebecca Toseland is absolutely amazing and truly cares about students' success and enjoyment of the thesis, she was once a Yale undergrad and understand the pressures as well Weaknesses: instructions about the senior essay should be provided in the spring semester of junior year as it takes a lot of time to put everything together and for people not familiar with the thesis process need the additional time to coordinate logistics (advisor, data, topic)",
    "Writing a thesis is a very personal endeavor. Your relationship to your advisor is critical. If you get a strong advisor like I did who is willing to work through problems you encounter or help you evaluate what you find, then you are in good shape and will get a lot more out of it.",
    "My advisor was great and the lectures were very helpful. I had no issues with the course.",
    "My advisor is fantastic, and my one-on-one meetings have been very helpful with Rebecca and Vitor. However, I wish the department gave us more guidance about what we should be accomplishing when, and what reasonable expectations for a solid senior essay are.",
    "As a senior thesis, the student has significant autonomy to develop the project as s\/he sees fit. This is a good way for the project to be managed. The TFs also do a good job of teaching an auxiliary course that supplements the thesis work.",
    "Strengths - you get to choose a research topic that interests you Weaknesses - in general, the process of conducting research well is tedious and time consuming (but worthwhile)",
    "Strengths: lectures are good weaknesses: i wish there was a way to keep us accountable, i know environmental studies has a colloquium and they made a lot of progress on their theses in a productive manner. i know that this is difficult to coordinate since our topics are so different but i definitely had a lot of trouble keeping on track without some schedule",
    "I liked the structure of the course and the optional weekly methodology lectures, and I appreciated that we were given the lecture schedule ahead of time and could choose which lectures to attend, based on our own schedule and interest in the given lecture topic. I found most of them helpful in terms of giving us advice and insight on execution, e.g., giving us tips on how to organize our files, approach our relationship with our advisor, example code for different econometric methods, but I wish there had been more focus on how to identify which econometric techniques are best for our project (though maybe this is better a conversation with our advisor). I think it would have been helpful to have a survey lecture earlier on as to the different types of models and statistical techniques that we could use to help us generate our own ideas and select specific techniques to use. I also wish there had been a focus on R earlier on, given that most students were using R, but I appreciated that the course later pivoted to focus on that.",
    "No weaknesses. One particular strength are Vitor and Rebecca -- this year's TAs.",
    "Self-guided--pretty much what was to be expected."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is such a rewarding learning experience that teaches a student how to conduct their own research, steer their own ship of their project, and create a capstone for their Yale experience.",
    "I certainly would recommend this course. Although I am not yet finished with my thesis, I feel as if I have learned a great deal and I look forward to seeing the final results.",
    "Yes, definitely take it if you want a nice way to encapsulate your economics degree.",
    "Yes, if you're ready to put the work into it!",
    "The senior essay is definitely a rewarding experience. I would strongly recommend for any student serious about economics (or economics graduate school) to undertake the process. Be warned: it is challenging to stay focused and productive in the fall term on the thesis. There aren't many deadlines, and there's a distinct lack of deliverables beyond a short progress report in November.",
    "Yes, if you want an opportunity to dive deeper into a topic you are passionate about.",
    "Yes - if you have a question you're passionate about exploring and finding an answer to, having a class that forces you to dedicate time to what you already want to do is great!",
    "Yes, you should try to write a thesis if you can!",
    "I would recommend writing an economics senior essay only if students are interested in a topic and willing to put in the time into doing it. Independent research is not easy and requires a lot of accountability, but it has been a rewarding experience so far, and I've learned a lot about a specific topic and economic research in ways that I could not necessarily have through a regular class\/seminar.",
    "YES! :)",
    "Yes--theses are great."
