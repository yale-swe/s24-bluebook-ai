    "Weaknesses: Class standard of questions does not reflect example of questions on tests or homework. Often homework involved very tricky things that we did cover in class. Webassign was unbelievably hard sometimes and took hours! Strengths: a lot of office hours and extra review sessions which were helpful",
    "This is possibly the worst course I have ever taken in my whole entire life. There was no teaching conducted. It wasn't a flip style class because there was no teaching material to use at home. This course needs to be completely reconstructed and taught by professors who actually can do their jobs and teach. Everything in this course was terrible. The text book, the teaching, the problem sets, the review sessions, the exams, etc. Never in my life have I encountered a course that gives such a bad name to academia.",
    "I think an improvement could be teaching more in depth and going over harder examples in class, to help kids who haven't taken calculus before and to prepare students for the tests.",
    "Sometimes the various schedules (canvas vs webassign) did not align and caused confusion."

    "I would never recommend this course to anyone ever. I would encourage anybody who has this course as a requirement to take it at a different university or a community college because it is a waste of tuition and time to take math 112.",
    "Unless you HAVE to take this class, DON'T. If you DO, pick a good professor above all else. John Hall is good - I'd steer away from Grad student teacher, they try their best but to do well in this class you will need a teacher with experience.",
    "Yes, if they need to take a math class.",
    "No, it just seems as if its set up for the student to fail, or feel like they're about to fail throughout the course",
    "Only for someone who needs it to satisfy a prereq or someone who didn't do much math in high school and wants to learn calculus."
