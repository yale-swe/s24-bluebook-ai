    "Great intermediate level course for statistics at the graduate level",
    "This course touches on a variety of advanced statistical concepts and models, but does not go into a lot of depth for any single topic. It is primarily theoretical, so it would be good for a student looking to get a deeper theoretical grounding in statistics, but would not be ideal for a student hoping to gain applied analytical skills.",
    "I would definetly reccomend the course to fellow students as I have never attended a course. It is a very good course if you intend to work with advanced statistics as it provides you with the right critical mindset and the necessary mathematical underpinnings to read up on all kinds of methodological literature."

    "It helped me understand another layer of the methodological literature that previously had been inaccessible to me due to a lack in matrix algebra \"literacy\".It also inspired me to critically re-think my methodological choices in light of what I had learnt.The course will also help me be a better reviewer of other people's work ."
