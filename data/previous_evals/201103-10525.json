    "Demotic is hard. The grammar is really simple, but reading the script is difficult. That said, Professor Darnell really helps you to grasp the language and by the end of the class you are able to read Demotic rather smoothly! Not to mention you read approximately 5 different texts, and other random rock inscriptions throughout the course! For an introductory course, this was really a great class (and much more than just an introduction into the language!).",
    "Yes, it's wonderful introduction to Demotic. We covered the progression of Egyptian from Late Egyptian to Demotic to Coptic as well.The students are taught to do a thorough analysis of the script, grammar and contextual information regarding the assigned texts.It was a challenging yet very rewarding course."
