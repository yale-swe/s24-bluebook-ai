    "Excellent take it no matter your major if you want to learn more about computers underneath the hood.",
    "EE201 is a pretty interesting course about the 1's and 0's of programming. After this class, I feel a lot more knowledgeable about how computers process everything.",
    "Its a great course and I would recommend it to everyone, even non EE majors.",
    "A good introduction to Computer Engineering. Professor (Colonel) Sadowski was fantastic. The only trouble was not having a TA for the first 1\/3 of the course, which slowed down the lab schedule. (We also got slowed down due to Hurricane Sandy though, so I can't say the lack of a TA was fully responsible for this development)",
    "If you are doing EE, take it, it was my first EE intro course and overall it was fine. Not a ton of work and fairly interesting content if you are into the CS side of things as well."
