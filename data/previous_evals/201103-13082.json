    "Great course. You work methodologically through Cervantes's great masterpiece. This book is one you should read and read again and read again. Excellent secondary readings, reasonable workload, good professor - and not a huge demand! A win-win all around.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS! It's a gem of a class. There were only about 20 people in it this semester but they were all fantastic. The professor is highly accomplished and gives great, fascinating lectures and the Spanish section was great for practicing my Spanish. The book itself was incredible, of course. It's one of the best books ever written, and I loved getting to read it for the first time with a professor who knew so much about it. I never felt like I was even doing work for this class because it's just so much fun to read Don Quixote!",
    "Yes. Everyone should read Don Quixote at some point in their lives. Prof. Echevarria is very knowledgeable about the novel and you will learn a lot from lecture. You don't only study the novel, but learn about the author and Spanish history. There were a ton of supplemental readings, but you don't really have to do those. There are 4 2-pg papers, a midterm, and take-home final. All in all, it was a good experience.The only bad thing about the class is that Prof. Echevarria would sometimes spend a good amount of time reading quotes from critics that wrote about the Quixote. This was only bad b\/c the quotes would sometimes not make any sense and be completely random. Everyone in the room is confused except for the pretentious literature majors who are like: \"oh yeah, of course that quote makes perfect sense.\"If Jennifer Darrel is TA-ing a section, attend it. She's fabulous. She taught the class a few times when Prof. Echevarria was out of town, and I thought that she was actually better than him.",
    "Please take this course!! You will not regret it! This class gives you the opportunity to read one of the greatest books of all time, taught by a great professor. Take it!",
    "I definitely recommend this course. Don Quixote is an incredible, very funny book. Prof. Gonzalez Echevarria is a great lecturer and unintentionally hilarious. Always enjoyed going to lecture.",
    "Such a FANTASTIC class. I highly recommend it. Here's a breakdown:--You read Don Quixote, along with a few other short stories and history books. Your main focus is on this wonderful novel, but you learn about it from a variety of perspectives.--The reading is truly interesting and entertaining. You will be laughing out loud, even though the book had profound themes as well.--Prof. Gonzalez is one of the kindest, most knowledgeable, and funniest professors at Yale. He's not intentionally funny, but you'll probably be giggling to yourself throughout the semester (in the best way).--He also usually lets you out 10-15 minutes early, which is 100% awesome.--You only have to write short papers (2 pages each!) in addition to a midterm and take-home final. The work is really not too bad, and you feel like you get to show what you've learned, rather than showing a lot of busy work.Without exaggerating, this has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. I recommend it to anyone interested in literature, Spanish history, or just a good story.",
    "Take it. You should read Don Quijote at some point in your life, so you should definitely do so with the man who knows more about it than anyone else...",
    "I would recommend this course if you are genuinely interested in learning about El Quijote. It will also give you a great overview of Imperial Spain as a whole.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to have a great course in the Quijote, and introductory course in Cervantes in general. There are multiple long readings aside from the Quijote, but they are quite useful and interesting. There are four short papers (2 pages long), a midterm in-class exam, and a take-home final exam. Professor Gonzalez-Echevarria is a fair grader and an excellent lecturer. Attending the optional section is an excellent idea!",
    "Maybe your only viable opportunity to read Don Quixote in its entirety, along with background material like Cervantes's short stories and a book about Golden Age Spain. Don Quixote is absolutely hilarious and a joy to read. The accompanying history book is small and manageable but terribly written, contrary to what the professor claims. Professor Gonzalez Echevarria is full of himself and patronizing at times (\"DID YOU ALL DO YOUR ELLIOTT READING?!\"=question of the day, every day, always shouted) but he really knows his stuff. Workload=lots of reading (but it's all entertaining so the trick is just to stay on top of it), 4 2-page papers, one midterm, one take home final consisting of essays.",
    "Great course. Professor Gonz\u00e1lez is the rare combination of an expert in his field who is simultaneously down to earth and interested in his students (this means he expects student input in lecture). The course is a true mix of Cervantes' text, Spanish history and culture.We had four 500 word essays and a mid-term take home final (three 4-5 page responses) which were all straightforward. This mid-term identifications were HARD, although they gave a slight curve. Make sure you keep a detailed character list and notes while you're reading. And to enjoy the course you will need to do a lot of reading."
