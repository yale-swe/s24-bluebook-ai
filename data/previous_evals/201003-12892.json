   "comments": [
    "This was a very good course. By the end of the semester, I felt that our discussions (about themes, stock characters, etc) got a little repetitive, but that's inevitable in a course focused on the writings of one author. Basically, both lecture and section were continually stimulating, and workload was extremely reasonable (2 short papers, a midterm, and an exam). I loved all of the books except for Bleak House-- that was long and boring, but if you get through that the class is great! Professor Carlisle is a compelling lecturer and a very nice person.",
    "Yes, if that student likes reading novels. I think that it sometimes felt like too much reading, but it is no more than any other novel-class.",
    "Fantastic class. You won't regret taking it!",
    "YES! This was one of my favorite classes this semester. Professor Carlisle is such a sweetheart, and her passion for Victorian literature is infectious! The material is also fantastic-- who doesn't love Dickens?",
    "Professor Carlisle is one of the nicest ladies at Yale, and she has a deep love for Victorian literature that shines through during lecture. If you like Charles Dickens, then you should take this course. It was my favorite course this semester.",
    "I would recommend this course -- Dickens is one of the greatest English writers, and the professor really guided the reading in an informative way.",
    "English 266 is a wonderful class, and a great opportunity not only to read Dickens' works, but also to learn a lot about the life of the man, himself. Professor Carlisle is incredibly smart, and always came to class with a very compelling argument. The class definitely made me think about the novel in different ways. I would recommend this course if you already are familiar with, and enjoy Dickens. Make sure-- if not, this could be a long haul of sentimentalism and dying children.",
    "A lot of reading, but worth it to gain an understanding of Dickens' many facets.",
    "A great sampling of Dickens' oeuvre. Extensive historical perspective lends even more credence to the genius of the author.",
    "Loved this course. If you like Dickens at all, you will love this course. Professor Carlisle is great and you will have wonderful readings and a good blend of history and literature.",
    "I don't know whether or not to recommend this course. The readings are fantastic. At his core, Dickens is a great story teller, and these books are a lot of fun to read. In this course, however, there was too much reading. We read part of the Pickwick Papers, The Old Curiosity Shop, A Christmas Carol, Bleak House, Great Expectations and The Mystery of Edwin Drood. BleakHouse is the killer. Unless the list is shortened in the future, I wouldn't take this course unless the rest of your schedule is light on reading. Professor Carlisle's lectures are a cross between analysis of the literature and discussion of the historical context. She is very enthusiastic and will make you love Dickens as she does.",
    "It's a good class to take if you enjoy reading Dickens and are interested in reading, well, a LOT of Dickens. I enjoyed the class, but I would only recommend it too someone who has taken other English classes, because the lectures, while interesting, don't really support the essays or midterms; you really have to formulate your ideas on your own.",
    "An excellent course if you like Dickens as an author. The syllabus may change in future, we've been warned, but as it stands, you start with excerpts from Dickens' first work (Pickwick Papers) and end with his last (The Mystery of Edwin Drood). And along the way, you get to read his two greatest novels: Bleak House and Great Expectations. Prof. Carlisle is a very engaging and informative lecture, one who brings a highly historical approach to reading the novels (if you like that sort of thing), trying to immerse you in a sense of Victorian times."
