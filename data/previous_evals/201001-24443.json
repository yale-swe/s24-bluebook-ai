    "Manley is an amazing scholar. His range of knowledge is incredible, so his lectures are dense and fast-paced, but if you have ever wondered why reading Shakespeare is important, Manley will make you believe. His plays encompass all of human experience; they are about life and love and growing up. Manley approaches them with wisdom, sensitivity, and compassion. I gained a deeper appreciation for the fullness of humanity and the power of art in this class - take it.",
    "It was a survey of most of Shakespeare's comedies and romances. Most of them were fun reads, but there were a couple I could have gone the rest of my life without reading. I'd definitely recommend it if you don't have a lot of Shakespeare background. Manley covered both the plays themselves and their context.",
    "A good overview of the material. Interesting insights.",
    "Shakespeare's comedies and romances. One play per week. Analysis and discussion. I would absolutely reccommend this class. The plays are fun, and Shakespeare is great!",
    "Nice if you want to read a lot of Shakespeare in a small amount of time, but lecture can be a little dry.",
    "Yes. Everyone should read these plays. Make sure you get a good section though. My section experience made this class for me.",
    "good class overall.",
    "i liked it. didn't love it, but it was pretty good. i chose the class because i wanted to read the books, and i got to do that. i wouldn't say lectures are particularly thrilling, but you'll end up with a working knowledgeof the comedies and romances. take it if you want to read the books, not if you're looking for an amazing class.",
    "ENGL 200 is a great introduction to the comedies and romances of Shakespeare. As a non-English major, for the most part I found the lectures pretty accessible--sometimes they were over my head, but whether you like the lectures or not, at the end of the semester you walk away having read 13 plays you've probably never read. It was a thoroughly enjoyable class--minimal workload, maximal pleasure. I would definitely recommend it to a non-english major.",
    "I'd recommend it because reading Shakespeare was awesome, and the workload was pretty light, but be prepared for a very boring lecture. First class at Yale I've decided to skip just because it wasn't worth it.",
    "Professor Manley clearly knows his stuff. The problem is that the plays themselves become repetitive.",
    "The class is an effective overview of a large number of shakespeare plays.",
    "I thought it was wonderful. If you are the kind of person who needs zing and energy from every single lecture in order to stay engaged, know that that is not the style of these lectures. That said, I found Professor Manley's lectures insightful, compelling, and useful in my understanding of the material. I would highly recommend the course!",
    "No. Only for an easy pre-1800. Shakespeare is awesome, Prof. Manley is not.",
    "Take it if you don't mind reading Shakespeare. In theory there's a lot of reading, but it's really not very difficult to get by without having done all of it and you can take what you want away from section and lecture. Manley's lectures are definitely interesting but not vital to succeed in the course.",
    "Take it. I didn't particularly feel confident in my paper writing abilities for this class, but at the end of the day, you read some great plays and have some pretty meaningful discussions about love, war, and society.",
    "Good plays; only two five-page papers. Take it!",
    "Take it if you love Shakespeare. Otherwise, it's not worth it.",
    "The class is a great introduction to a selection of plays that make Shakespeare the great remembered writer he is. As a credit\/D student, I enjoyed soaking in the stories and themes of his work.",
    "It's not the most inspiring class, but it's still enjoyable if you are willing to read a Shakespearean play a week."
