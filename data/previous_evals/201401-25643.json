   "comments": [
    "FREN 160 is a course focusing on the current issues of French culture in general. You can't beat this course if you want to know more about France, French culture, or just want a laid back place to speak french with other students. At times, it is a lot of work (with random readings, writings, and videos to watch) but it was completely worth it.",
    "French 160 is a lot of work. If you're prepared to put in a couple hours a work for every class, it will be worth it. You will learn a lot about French culture, history and politics, and have a chance to practice your conversation skills on complex topics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in both improving their conversational and written French and learn about French culture. There will be homework due for almost every class, but none of the assignments will take more than an hour to complete (usually a couple articles to read, and a short writing assignment or a forum post). We covered many interesting topics such as immigration, religion, education, regional differences, the European Union and political life in France. We watched about 6-7 movies which were all great and interesting. Prof Sherak is fun and engaging and good at giving feedback to improve your French. Take it!",
    "If you want a class that will give you a strong overview of modern French culture while improving your conversational skills, FREN 160 is most definitely the class you want. Be forewarned that class participation is very important, so if you tend to be shy the class can be difficult in that regard. However, the class is wonderful in that it is a small class where everyone knows each other and everyone has a desire to learn the material. Also, Mme Sherak is an awesome professor, everyone should take a class with her a some point! She is always willing to work extra with students who have questions and does a wonderful job of keeping a fun atmosphere during class discussions (which make up the bulk of the class).",
    "It's a great class that gets you immediately up-to-date about French culture while simultaneously helping you to improve your French conversational skills. I loved it and found it to be a nice \"current events\" class."
