   "comments": [
    "The second half of the course taught by Sanchez is a lot better. Overall it's a basic intro to evolutionary biology, most of the material isn't that challenging and you've probably learned it before.",
    "I gained a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms and motivating forces behind evolution.",
    "We learned many of the basic principles of evolutionary biology, usually using microorganisms as study species. I learned a good amount and enjoyed the class material.",
    "I improved my skills in evolutionary biology",
    "I learned the importance of how one frames a question or a definition by examining current controversies in Evolutionary Biology along with a lot of general evolutionary biology knowledge.",
    "I much higher understanding of evolution, ecological relationships, and adaptation. Proficiency in the use of scientific terminology. Higher level scientific publication reading skills.",
    "Good basic understanding of evolutionary principles.",
    "The class does a good job of covering the material from Bio 104 but in more depth with more specific examples. It's helpful for getting an idea of how and why evolution occurs, reading about the important studies in the field, and helping you make educated guesses about what will happen in a situation that you haven't studied before but where evolution might take place.",
    "To be honest, I don't feel I learned very much from this course. Exam 1 did not test what we learned in the course, and Exam 2 was far too easy. The class itself was fairly interesting and I learned about evolutionary biology, especially in relation to genetics and ecology."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Sections seemed like a waste of time, especially because a lot of the papers we read were kind of over our heads. The lectures are pretty standard, not horrible but not super engaging. I think Sanchez was a better professor.",
    "Lectures involved some class involvement, but not a lot considering the relatively small class size. Class participation isn't always necessary for students to learn, but it can help. I did get a lot from the class!",
    "In my opinion, the second half of the course was taught much better than the first half. Some ways to improve the first half of the course would be to better format the lecture slides. For example, it seemed as if the objectives listed in the slides did not accurately represent what was on the first midterm. A simple way to avoid this problem would have been to add one or two study questions at the end of each lecture just as the professor for the second half of the semester did.",
    "The TA wasn't good at all, but the course information is excellent and interesting.",
    "The first half was a bit weak in that we often talked about math models that we weren't prepared to learn nor had to fully understand. The second half was strong because lots of examples were used to teach.",
    "The strengths include a small class size, which helps students ask questions and interact with the teaching staff as necessary, and a focus on specific examples that illustrate the material we learned. The class could probably be better taught with a different textbook -- the one we used was okay but not outstanding -- and it would have been interesting to learn about more experiments in the field that showed how the theories we learned played out in real life.",
    "I did not like the grading of the course. I felt that having only two exams and participation put too much pressure on only two 50-minute exams.",
    "This was my least favorite class this semester, which was sad because it had the opportunity to be really good. However the teaching quality was very low until halfway through the semester when we switched professors, but even then the TF leading my section was not particularly useful.",
    "Strengths: not too challenging, covered a wide breadth of information and gave me a better perspective on evolution Weaknesses: not challenging enough, did not go into enough depth on topics. also, prof. powell was very boring and not engaging at all"

   "comments": [
    "I mean you probably have to take this for your major, but it's not awful. It's nice only having 2 in-semester exams so you don't have to take a final, but at the same time the grading could seem arbitrary at times. Nothing super special but not a very difficult class I think.",
    "Yes! I love biology and this class covered a lot of interesting topics",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Alvaro Sanchez was one of the best professors I have had so far at Yale.",
    "Yes, this is a fantastic class, and I learned a ton about Ecology and Evolution. Having not taken the intro 104 before taking this class I was slightly intimidated at first, but as long as you work, its easy to learn a lot.",
    "If you're thinking about the E&EB major, you'll need to take it anyway and it's a reasonably interesting class. Don't be reluctant to do it. If you're just looking for any biology class, though, there are others that are probably better as electives because they cover more specific material that's more interesting and applicable.",
    "I think taking this class really depends on how much you are are willing to teach yourself. The first half of the semester was horrible, but when we switched to Prof. Sanchez the class really picked up.",
    "Take this if you're looking for an easy class. it isn't challenging or particularly interesting. this class is the reason i decided not to be an EvBio major."
