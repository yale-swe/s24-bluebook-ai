    "This course is designed for architecture students, and as an FES student, I felt that it didn't cover the subjects I was interested in as much I would have liked. I also felt that Professor Garvin sometimes was dismissive of questions (not many were asked in general, and when FES students asked questions, we tended not to get fully satisfying or even thoughtful responses). If you really want to work in local government or development and have NO experience in the field already, this can provide a decent way to get a run down of the issues. If you already have some exposure, however, and want to better understand the nitty gritty of how to leverage tax credits or historic zoning or create logical environmental regulations, you will be disappointed. Professor Garvin did a great job of presenting historical details about architects and specific development projects across America, but since this was not what I was interested in (I can reference his book on my own time), the actual class presentations were not very engaging.",
    "Professor is a bit rambling. The homework assignments (\"games\") are great, but don't really seem to match what we learn in class.",
    "The class was very helpful in understanding the basic mechanics of development and many historical precedents. It's especially oriented toward financial profitability. Social and --importantly for me, environmental-- effects of city planning become peripheral, and all but neglected."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "As an FES course, this course *should* address, or at minimum be more responsive to, the challenging questions surrounding continuing development in an increasingly constrained natural landscape. Smart growth -- even if Garvin doesn't like it -- should have at least been defined. Topics like open space requirements, green building codes, and integrated land and transportation planning were completely neglected. As an FES course, it is thus sorely lacking. As an architecture class, maybe its fine, but it may be time to take if off the FES cross list.",
    "The course would be much more useful if Garvin tied lectures to case studies. For example, talk about how a development really came into being, things that went right and wrong, real analysis of results, etc."

So, by default, you take the writing section of the assignment and hope that the rest turns out ok.",
    "It was good to interact with architecture students, though many of them seemed to have foregone conclusions about non-architecture students and their non-helpfulness. I enjoyed surprising my group members with a background in design and an ability to use graphics programs.",
    "It was necessary to work in groups to distribute the wok load for games. Each member brought their perspective to the group, so it was very helpful overall."
