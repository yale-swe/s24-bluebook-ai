    "In this course, I learned how to tailor my writing for specific audiences. I also learned the inner workings of effective forms of musical criticism.",
    "First, I got exposed to such new, exciting music and artists that I hadn't before! I worked with different techniques for \"evoking the artifact\" and got an eye for recognizing journalistic concepts and strategies to make a piece hum."

    "awesome class. readings are great, the assignments are flexible and thus can be quite enjoyable. prof. sexton is a great and chill professor. the research paper was a sharp change compared to the journalistic writing before it and thus is questionable in being included in the seminar, but it's a good thing to learn as well so i don't know exactly what should be done about that.",
    "This course had no weaknesses and I highly recommend everyone takes it at some point. The professor is incredible and the subject matter is fascinating",
    "Overall the course was well-layed out, we did end up skipping one of the writing assignment which might have been interesting to tackle.",
    "This class is very focused in the topics covered: it starts with the music review (the most well-known form of musical criticism) and then jumps off from there, exploring the breadth of musical journalism. I feel like we could have spent more time analyzing the structure of the specific forms of writing we learned about before seeing numerous examples of them: before reading assigned articles and books we should have at least talked about the structure of these pieces and what to expect and what we should pay attention to while reading.",
    "Enjoyed the discussion\/seminar setup of the class, though sometimes I felt we got bogged down in semi-unproductive conversation (still interesting!). Big strengths were the workshops and very comfortable feel of the classroom."

    "YES! If you love music take this class! readings are awesome, essays are fun to write mostly, discussion in class is great. our class ended up only being six people so it was very intimate and very flexibly structured around us which was great. also we only ended up writing four essays instead of five because of time and that was an added bonus. you can write about artists ranging from Kendrick Lamar to Philip Glass - there's an appeal in this class to any music lover.",
    "As I said before I think everyone should take this class at some point. Worth every hour.",
    "Take this class if you like music and want to write and talk about it! Adam Sexton is super chill but also really helpful when dealing with papers and thoughtful in leading discussions. Lots of reading and writing but that's what English is about right? Overall I thought this class had a very reasonable workload but also a good environment to grow as a writer.",
    "Take this class if you're interesting in writing about music! Prof. Sexton is very knowledgeable and you'll definitely learn something about how music writing works in a variety of styles. make sure to do the readings though, or else you won't get as much out of the class. If you like using words to describe music, you're gonna love this class!",
    "This class is great if you're a music lover looking for a writing credit. It's fun and engaging and you definitely learn how to improve your own writing.",
    "Yes, I would!"
