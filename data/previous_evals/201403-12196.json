   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to another student, because it is extremely confusing - partially because of the coursework (Aristotle, the Arab philosophers, and others were very hard to understand) and partially because of how the course is taught. Needs to be more guidance in how to go about studying philosophy. I would summarize this class as a survey in the major works of Western philosophy from antiquity to medieval times.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student as an important starting point for understanding the development of philosophy and as an opportunity to learn how to write write academic papers about philosophy.",
    "Yes, take DS Philosophy from David Charles! Prof. Charles is a spectacular section professor; you are very lucky if you are in his section! He is a world expert especially on Aristotle, and his insights and comments truly change the way you engage with the texts as a section. He also places great value in your development over the course of the semester. I especially liked his one-on-one meetings with everybody in the section after each paper submission. His comments after each paper was always useful. Professor Charles really focuses on your individual progress and therefore exemplifies an ideal DS Philosophy section. His only weakness is that sometimes he analyses only a single argument for the entire week and does not properly reflect the \"bigger picture\" regarding the relevant philosopher. But this is a very minor point when compared to the multitude of other skills he enables you to acquire. He teaches you how to read and analyse philosophy, and I cannot think of a more important take-away from DS than that.",
    "Comprehensive, thought-provoking, would recommend this class in itself and also because I would recommend DS in general. I believe DS is possibly the best path a freshman can take no matter what he\/she is majoring in, because it's essential to our worldview to understand the tradition of thought that our society has inherited and continues to contribute to. Reading the greatest works by the greatest minds and seeing that the issues addressed by classical authors are still open and controversial is an experience at once empowering and humbling.",
    "DS Philosophy is a general overview of major authors and concepts. Would recommend to anyone looking for a cursory look at important texts and riveting discussions about their implications.",
    "Yes absolutely. A good discussion leader is the most important thing in a class like this, and David Charles is certainly that.",
    "Very interesting",
    "The course made me realize how under-prepared I was in respect to argumentative thinking when I came to Yale. The course has made me comfortable with making and analyzing arguments to the point of taking great pleasure in them. I feel that this course will be an indispensable asset for me for the rest of my academic life. And I would definitely recommend it for that reason."
