   "comments": [
    "I'm not sure I would recommend the course, per se, but I absolutely think it is a course that should be required.",
    "This matters little seeing as every IR MA student is forced to take it.But I would speak highly of it. The lessons are interesting and lively, and the guest speakers are especially interesting, particularly Joe Circione and Stanley McChrystal.",
    "INRL 700 is a great course that harmoniously combines a theoretical perspective on international relations with a discussion of practical issues the world is facing today. This course serves very well as a introductory course for the IR Masters' Program, as it offers a thorough review of IR Theory paradigms, and a detailed account of the debates surrounding one real-life issue or another. Iwould also recommend that this course continues to be compulsory for all MAIR students, as it is not only a good way to introduce them to the program, but also a great venue for all IR students to meet and exchange opinions on various subjects.",
    "A wide ranging course on contemporary IR issues. I would must assuredly recommend this course."

   "comments": [
    "It gave me an overview of international relations. In particular it deepened my knowledge of issues like climate change and world trade, which are issues I paid comparatively little attention to at first, but which I have come to appreciate through this course.",
    "This course was especially helpful for me as it offered a great review of basic theoretical approaches in IR theory and of practical issues the world is confronting with today.",
    "This course helped me to understand other issues in IR, while allowing me to really focus my research paper on climate change."
