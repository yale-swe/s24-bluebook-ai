    "I'd take it again. The articles you learn read are interesting bits about Arab culture. There's not too much work besides that, and you're able to talk more because it's a smaller class and the structure fosters it. If you're still interested, it's certainly worth continuing.",
    "More useful than the levels before. Arabic definitely improving. Still a lot of memorizing vocab lists, though.",
    "Yes, its less intense than the first semesters and much more enojoyable."
