   "comments": [
    "Math 115 is equivalent to Calculus II or BC calc with more detail. I would recommend this only to students who are willing to work hard to get the grade. Studying in-class notes will not help you on the exams, which are very hard.",
    "Math 115 is a fine class. If you need to take it as a requirement, don't be scared off by what other people say about it. If you don't need to take it, I see no real reason to.",
    "The homework for math 115 is reasonable, but the tests are very difficult. I suggest shopping several professors to find one that you can understand.",
    "I would not recommend this course. While the homeworks and in class problems were all reasonable, the exam questions were ridiculous.",
    "Math 115 is not necessarily just like your AP calculus BC course in high school. I'm glad I took it even though I already took it technically in high school because I like the way calculus is taught at yale better. You are forced to go back to the basics, use no calculators, and really think about all the problems.",
    "Honestly if you can avoid Math 115, avoid it like the plague. If you need math 115 for your major take it knowing that it's very hard.",
    "You should probably only take math 115 if you are in a section with a teacher who speaks English well. For me, having already taking BC calc was definitely helpful.",
    "Important to take seriously!",
    "Yes I would recommend Math 115. It was a good course. Keep up with the work and you'll be fine.",
    "Single variable calculus covering topics such as volumes of revolution, series, sequences, differentiation, and integration.Yes, but only if they have a strong background in math. The coursework was rewarding and the exams were challenging, but fair.",
    "Math 115 was an extension of Calculus AB. I would recommend it for students interested in furthering their knowledge of calculus.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 115 to a fellow student. The coursework can be difficult at times, but it's manageable as long as you keep up with the work and go to office hours if you are confused about anything.I think you should take this class if you have already taken Calc AB in high school. There are a lot of students who have already taken BC, but they don't have too much of an advantage over everyone else. Also, Susie Kimport is a fantastic teacher. I highly recommend her if she ever teaches the course again. If she is teaching, try to get in her section! She made the class so much more enjoyable.",
    "Math 115 exams are at the level of ap exams, but everyone struggles together. The exams are much harder than needed to be, but if you study all the practice problems and review problems then you can prepare yourself for the difficulty. If you keep up with your homework, go to the problem sessions, and take advantage of all the other extra resources then you will be able to find success."
