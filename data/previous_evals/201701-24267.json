   "comments": [
    "The course was, in its own right, a great, rigorous, and interesting look at how law, morality, and religion intersect. However, it really suffered from the quality of discussion\/engagement from the (very few) students in class. This is a pity, because this course could have been so much more with engaged students (who read the readings beforehand instead of being on Facebook\/email all throughout class). Andrew is great and he's a great seminar leader.",
    "This class pushed me to read carefully and nuance the arguments of writers. I learned how to write more precisely. I also learned a lot about the nature of the law.",
    "The ability to read complicated texts and highlight key arguments, and formulate our own opinions based off of relevant readings."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: readings were super exciting (esp Part I and Part III). I didn't engage that much with Part II (the religion stuff) mostly because I was familiar with it (law and gospel, etc.) and didn't learn many new things from that section. Andrew is phenomenal. He is a brilliant seminar leader. He really places an emphasis on the quality of our writing and argumentation in the weekly memos (which I appreciate). Weaknesses: the students in this class, unfortunately. Somehow the composition of this class just turned out really poorly, and most students were not engaged \/ hardly speaking up \/ blatantly not doing the readings and using Facebook in class \/ speaking up and saying shallow or frustratingly unhelpful things...) I wish there were more robust and productive discussions in class. Instead of going through the argumentation in the outline so carefully (as we did in the first few sessions), it could have been opened up for more free engagement with the text.",
    "Strengths: great overview of intersection of law, morality, and religions. Intellectually stimulating. Weaknesses: readings and seminar discussion can sometimes be dry, expectations are a little confusing at times",
    "strengths-- really got to discuss the readings weaknesses-- didn't talk about much else beside the readings. While I learned a lot, the information seemed dissociated from my life. I wish we applied the readings to real life examples more.",
    "Strengths included interesting reading assignments paired with well-formulated discussion topics. However, our Professor expected us to cover profound topics and write in-depth \"memorandums\", which were challenging and felt impossible due to the lack of background knowledge most of us had in each of the topics. For example, it's hard to answer a question such as \" Whats divine about divine law?\" using eighty four pages of background reading, in only two pages maximum."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, with the caveat that a lot of how this course turns out depends on the students who end up taking it. I think the composition of the class this semester turned out poorly because Andrew missed the first class and many interested students withdrew as a result. So hopefully this won't happen again if it's offered again. Other than that, Andrew is great -- great seminar leader, gives very helpful feedback on our memos; the readings are excellent -- loved the jurisprudence pieces and the law & religion cases; the topic, of course, is super important.",
    "Interesting class, but take only if you are truly interested in the topics. Decent amount of reading (hard topics). Workload is consistent, which is good.",
    "I would recommend but it's a lot of work and Andrew expects a lot of his students. I learned a lot about the law and the debates surrounding American law and religion.",
    "I would not. This class was too broad in the topics it tried to cover within one semester, and I did not have adequate background information to complete the assignments at the level expected."
