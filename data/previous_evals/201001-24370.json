   "comments": [
    "Do this course!! If you are interested in econ but scared of the math, this is the perfect course for you! It's a little more math heavy than the other econ classes but there is so much support put in place that the course is more than manageable; even for someone like me who hates math! Tolga is also an amazing professor, and he manages to make each class a lot of fun. Take this class - you won't regret it!",
    "This class is an introductory seminar to Microeconomics. While the material itself didn't interest me that much, Tolga has moments where he is incredibly entertaining. (He will relate most topics to your hypothetical children and maybe not quite so hypothetical relationships.)I took the class to get a QR credit and because I thought that it would be useful to know some economics. It fulfilled both of these expectations, especially since Tolga doesn't just cover rational agents, but also a bit of behavioral economics. I'd definitely recommend this course.",
    "Take it.It is a great introduction to economics. He makes concepts easier. And Tolga is the best person to take it with.",
    "This class frustrated me because of the curve. Despite the fact that Iwas doing A\/A- work, my grades were B+\/B because of the required curve. To that end, I was really upset by the class and would share that with other students. However, if QR isn't your thing this class is totally manageable and not completely dreadful.",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. I spent so much time literally counting down the minutes. That's some serious boredom. Some people love Tolga, and while he was very accessible and can belt out the material, he can only explain things one way - kind of frustrating when you can't understand the first explanation. Getting a professor that could explain the difficult concepts was the only reason why I took the seminar in the first place.Also, the class is graded on a curve, which is just really absurd for a class with twenty over-achievers.If you're anything like me, you will get really, really frustrated with the 30 minute long digressions. Microeconomics is not fun, and all you really want is to just acquire the material and move on to more interesting things.I heard glowing reviews about the lecture from my friends. Go for that, and if you need more help getting through some of the more challenging material, get a tutor. This class isn't worth getting up for 9:20 on a Friday morning.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for anyone wanting to get a solid understanding of microecon, especially for those concerned they would get lost in a lecture.",
    "I would summarize the course as being a course for the less mathematically-inclined. However, I hear that it is more challenging in some respects than the lecture course because we did do more on graphs and calculations. It is a great course in which you feel that you've learned a lot at the end of it.",
    "I would recommend! I personally struggled but if you want to take Econ, I'd say this is the way to go!",
    "It a great class for people that want to really grasp intro micro ideas, either because you haven't learned micro before or because you are very interested.I would recommend it, its not impersonal like a big lecture, the professor is amazing, and the workload is very manageable",
    "It is a great class. It was great to learn economics a bit slower but still learn all the material that any other economics class would learn. Take it!",
    "Good way to learn Econ in a small intimate environment. I would take it again, just study hard.",
    "Take it if you don't have a strong math background, or if you want an econ class that won't go too fast. Don't take it if you already know econ, because it is very much for beginners.",
    "This class is a good class if you're not great with math but be forewarned, their will be people that have more math experience in your class then you might think. Tolga is an amazing professor. You will never be bored because he is very lively. The workload isn't difficult. You'll organize in study groups of 3 or 4 to work on problem sets (which are not weekly). If you're like me and need more practice with problems that might be on the test, I'd go out of your way to do problems from the book. Sometimes reviewing the notes that he gives and the problem sets is not enough to get a good grade, if that's not your learning style."
