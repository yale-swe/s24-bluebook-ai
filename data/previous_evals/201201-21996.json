   "comments": [
    "I loved this class. The class-time went surprisingly quickly, and while Prof Shin (who is hilarious) always said the material was dry, it really wasn't. A group presentation, a quick oral final, and a take-home final were all the work, which was perfect to show our understanding.",
    "A beautiful course on how logic unravels when applied to itself. Everything ultimately comes together very nicely. A fantastic course to see how limitations inhere in the mathematical\/logical tools that we set up for ourselves. Sun-Joo is as great as ever, I don't think there is much to say: She teaches with her usual charm, wit, and impeccable understanding of the material. A must-take for anyone interested in logic and in exploring the boundaries of our understanding.",
    "It would probably be a good idea to have taken at least one logic course before this class. the first part is Turing machines, Chruch-Turing Thesis, and recursive functions, and is all understandable without a previous training. The second half is all the preparation for Godel's incompleteness theorem, and gets confusing and muddled if you have no basics to grab on to. There is an oral exam! Before you take it, study the things that you need to know but that she did not cover in class, because those are things she will ask you about! (She does it on purpose) It's stressful when you're asked a question one-on-one and don't know how to respond. Overall, the class is full of extremely fascinating subjects that will keep you awake at night when you're trying to falling asleep.",
    "Take it! Take every course you can with Sun-Joo. She's an amazing teacher, and this course covers some fascinating material. It's less technical than Math Logic, and doesn't necessary require Math Logic, but I'd suggest that you take some logic before you take this so as to be familiar with the notation, at least. But this is really a must-take. Not much work, great teaching, cool material.",
    "Computability and Logic is a phenomenal course which doesn't assign a lot of work but requires a lot of attention and work to keep up with. Unless you've covered related material before in Math or Comp Sci, there are a ton of very new and unfamiliar concepts which you have to get your head around fully - the assessed coursework is a presentation to the rest of the class and an one on one oral exam. That being said, the reward for understanding the material is huge and it really is a beautiful class.",
    "This course covers countability, computability, and godel's incompleteness theorems. The course is fairly standard for a math class (minus the problem sets---there are none!), and quite easy.",
    "This course is a low amount of work, but you learn a lot, and the material is pretty interesting. Sun-Joo is great and go over proofs in detail.",
    "If you like rigor and want to love dying in the class, definitely take it!",
    "This class had a VERY low workload but was enjoyable nonetheless. We covered two important topics in computability&logic: for the first 60% of the class or so we looked at Church's Thesis (aka Turing's Thesis). We spend some time building fundamentals--looking at Turing Machines, Abacus Machines, and recursive functions--and then we proved that these three things have equivalent spans. During the second half of the class, we proved Godel's famous Incompleteness Theorems, which (in a rough nutshell) prove that there is no consistent, complete, axiomatizable extension of arithmetic. The two halves of the class link to each other in a subtle way.Professor Shin's lectures are interesting--and the 2-hour class meetings are lectures, not seminars, whatever the Bluebook says. The only graded assignments were a group presentation of ~25 minutes worth of lecture material, an oral exam with Prof. Shin (though be warned--for me it only covered one very small topic, rather than the class as a whole!), and a take-home final (shorter than the last problem set for PHIL 267). If you want feedback on your progress, though, this is not the class for you. We've received nothing back from her all semester.If you like logic you should consider taking this class. It's definitely doable as a fifth class, especially if you've taken Sun-Joo's earlier course, Math Logic (267).",
    "This was an introduction to computability theory with a quick discussion of Godel's Incompleteness Theorems and some related results at the end. Take this if you are interested in Formal Logic.",
    "A very thorough investigation into all the theory necessary to truly understand Godel's Incompleteness Theorems. Remarkable opportunity to work through the work of not one, but several geniuses, and to understand each step of the immense progression that led to a total reformation of our understanding of arithmetic and logical systems.While one can take this course without having taken Math Logic, make certain you understand and have practiced inductive proofs and are comfortable with having to backtrack after lecture to understand various mathematical notions. ASK QUESTIONS after class, so that you do not fall behind. Note that there is very little regular work to keep you on track; however, don't take the course because you hear that it has little regular work, as it will come back to haunt you come the oral exam, and final. That said, keep on par and you'll do well.For those prepared for the course, it can be a fantastic venture; I have taken away more from this class, including what it inspired me to research on my own time, than any other single course."
