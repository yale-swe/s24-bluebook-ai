    "This is a course that requires the absorption of an analytical system. If you are already familiar with that system, it may be easy, although it is still a fabulous opportunity to work through the scores of a very good quantity of music. I would highly recommend taking it. Seeing Professor Hepokoski in his element with this material, as well, is not to be missed.",
    "A course that offers a good balance of literature coverage, analytical probing and methodological explorations. But if you really like Multivalence or have studied with James Webster don't take this course... just kidding."

    "Probably not relevant for dissertation, but I imagine that this will be very helpful for qualifying exams.",
    "I feel much better prepared to tackle sonatas on my own now. That sounds like a silly and cliche thing to say in a course evaluation, but I mean it seriously. I think Hepokoski's elaboration of Sonata Theory is actually pretty brilliant."
