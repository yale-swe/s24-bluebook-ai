   "comments": [
    "Good class. Seems like a survey course at first glance, but you actually get pretty in depth and discuss really interesting issues. Good mix of both theory and historical fact. Plus Prof. is good humored and funny guy.",
    "Absolutely loved this seminar! Did a great job of balancing a general survey of lots of empires across a wide time range while still allowing us to learn in some detail about the empires we did cover (but not so much that it felt like an information overload). The class also balances pretty well covering specific empires, having discussions about them, but then taking that back into a general discussion about the concept of empire. I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "A refreshing take on the empire. I would definitely take this if you're looking to really engage with concepts\/ definitions through a lot of reading and challenging discussions.",
    "Sure, this course is good. The material is very interesting (center-periphery relations, economics\/incentives v. norms, role of religion), and you get to learn about a handful of empires' histories while maintaining focus on the big picture theory. The readings are easy to do and the assignments are very doable. Overall, it's a good WR credit and EPE seminar.",
    "Take it if you are interested in reading about the theory of Empires, but don't expect to broaden your knowledge of history or sociology.",
    "Empires and Imperialism was a very interesting, reading-based course that focused on what really makes an empire. This broad focus means that the readings cover a wide range of history and theory."
