    "I now have a much better grasp of various streams of theory related to gender, sex, and race, and, broadly speaking, of how they developed over time. I can more adequately name the major thinkers writing on particular topics, and speak with some authority on their basic arguments, conversation partners, and theoretical lineages. I also have a much better sense of how certain topics and questions grow and come to be (ie., how thinkers are not asking their questions, or coming to their insights, out of thin air). I also really appreciate the time we took in class to think about various writers' strategies and approaches to research and writing, as well as to talk openly about our own development as scholars. In short, I developed a better sense of the field and its arguments, and I also feel I received a higher degree of professional development than I often have in graduate courses."

   "comments": [
    "strengths: - welcoming environment for discussion - interesting compilation of texts each week - interesting topics areas for improvement: - it would have been nice to have more conversation about through lines across the weeks - it would have been useful to have more of an introduction to the concerns for each week (coming in with limited previous knowledge of the material made it difficult to get grounded sometimes)",
    "The course offered a good breadth of topics, writers, and time periods. I really appreciate Jill Richards' intentional work to demystify theory and immediately defuse some of the competitive tendencies that can develop in some seminars. Both enabled really good and constructive conversation. The assignments were all very useful\/personally productive, and struck just the right balance between challenging and still do-able. (The assignment in which we read through and presented on a journal special issue was particularly useful.) It would have been helpful to have a little less reading toward the end of the semester to allow more time to work on final papers."

    "Yes, the course was challenging in important ways but also supportive.",
    "I absolutely would. Jill Richards is a terrific instructor, and the course is helpful, intellectually and professionally, for reasons named in questions 1 and 3.",
    "Yes! Particularly if they are looking for a course that will give help them situate particular theoretical formations in their historical contexts and within larger intellectual trends and lineages.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Richards was a great instructor who helped us parse through and navigate a really wide variety of thoughtfully selected texts. I feel that my understanding of the texts as well as the intellectual discourse they respond to has grown significantly."
