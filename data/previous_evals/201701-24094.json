    "learned a ton of history",
    "This course provides a valuable historical overview of conservatism in American history, covering many key figures and movements. However, the most valuable take away is undoubtedly the practice you'll get in analyzing secondary and primary historical sources. This occurs both when you're doing the readings every week on your own as well as in the class discussions. Professor Lynn is one of the most capable discussion leaders I have ever witnessed, striking a balance between letting the students talk about what they thought about the readings by letting the conversation flow and keeping the discussion on track with incisive questions. There is a fair amount of work required for this class, with well over 100 pages of reading per week, but it is nothing crazy and it won't really feel like work because it is so interesting.",
    "This seminar pushed me as a thinker and a historian. The breadth of the time period covered and the authors included on the syllabus challenged my perceptions of American Conservatism. Likewise, Professor Lynn's dedication to his students grew me as a historian. The final paper is a task, but something very worthwhile.",
    "This class taught me how to approach historically ideas that I found little in common with. Contextualizing in history constantly changing ideas is invaluable for any history student.",
    "Understanding history of conservatism, the ideas as well as the politics",
    "I gained a vast if still basic grasp of the history of American conservatism in a way that links together past and present strands of conservative thought. During the seminars, we had to defend our assumptions, linkages and conclusions, giving us reason to analyze the primary and secondary sources more closely. Writing the reaction and final papers helped me experience researching and writing historical papers. Overall, this course presented a side of American politics that I had seldom studied and helped me better understand this country.",
    "I learned how to track the history of conservatism in America and parse through cultural\/political\/historiographical readings to draw conclusions about Conservatism in America. The Course gave me a better understanding of what Conservatism is in the American context and how it played out across various cultural milieus.",
    "I gained insight into the origins of conservative thought and how it has evolved throughout time I had no idea how rapidly it's changed in the past few years! I also learned how to write academic papers that include informed political arguments. This class also includes a bit of historiography discussion in which we talked about the philosophy, practices etc. of the field itself.",
    "This course did an exceptional job of encouraging us to read texts both historically and critically. Because we were dealing with political texts through a historical lens, I felt that I understood better how to contextualize conservative arguments than I did before. The structure of the class also encouraged debate and disagreement within the seminar, but it was almost always respectful and empathetic",
    "I gained a greater understanding of how Americans - from the 18th century onward - conceived of \"conservatism.\" The discussions were usually insightful, and the assignments were always rewarding.",
    "Learned to create constructive historical criticism and a more thoorough understanding of how conservatives have viewed themselves throughout the centuries.",
    "Critical analysis of secondary sources"

   "comments": [
    "This course was amazing. The best I have taken at Yale. The readings are super interesting, and Lynn is phenomenal. Even the political diversity of the class was great.",
    "The class was very well organized and discussion was very well balanced between students and professor. The class could benefit from historical contextualization and further explanation of why people think the way that they do.",
    "The assignment structure was great and helped students practice their writing skills at a reasonable pace. Discussions could have used more direction but overall I always emerged more informed than I had been coming in.",
    "Strengths: Great readings, Lynn is a great seminar leader, the class brings together a more diverse point of views than I've seen in other seminars I've taken as well Weaknesses: I bit more structure around the final paper may be helpful",
    "Strengths: Great seminars, knowledgeable and engaging professor who provides a lot of advice for planning and researching the final paper, no real pro- or anti- conservative bias in the course, tends to draw intellectually committed and curious students, fair workload, exciting source materials Weaknesses: Assumes prior knowledge of writing history papers, but this is a junior history seminar so that skill is expected",
    "Strengths: Fascinating readings, Intellectually Diverse group of students, Robust discussions, great professor Weaknesses: None although it would've been nice to know where our participation grade stood halfway through the semester, a checkin of sorts would be nice given that participation is 25% of the grade.",
    "It was really cool that this course was made up of a very politically diverse group of students. We also discussed conservative thought without ever introducing political arguments. However, while in this bubble of discussing what conservative thought was we never introduced how oppressive it was in many of these instances (e.g. calhoun). I guess I'm not sure if I think the implications of these thoughts should be addressed or not, but during the semester at times I wished that it was. Other than that, I thought the course was great and I learned so much about conservatism which is and has always been super relevant. I also find that I was often thinking about how the rhetoric used to oppress certain classes of people has evolved over time (in some instances not very much) and I think it might be interesting to include that.",
    "It would have been good to have a couple of liberal or leftists texts to measure our conservative readings against for each time period we discussed",
    "Lynn is an excellent instructor who capably directs and manages the discussion. The readings, especially those from the 1700 to 1945, were excellent. The assignments were fair and always enjoyable.",
    "Great discussion, professor kept class highly focused, allowed appropriate trials of thought when needed."

   "comments": [
    "10\/10 I tell everyone how much I love this seminar",
    "Absolutely. I think that this course was timely and challenging in all the best ways. It forced and fostered genuine dialogue amongst students from a variety of perspectives on a variety of charged issues. Furthermore, the design of the course helped me evaluate issues in a grander historical narrative and improve my critical eye as a historian.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. It's very useful to be able to understand prevailing ideological formations, even if one disagrees with them.",
    "Yes, highly recommend. The ideas of this class are really important and have few outlets to be discussed at Yale. Professor Lynn handles the topic excellently.",
    "Absolutely. To better understand American politics, history and culture, take this course. For an awesome history class, take this course. If you want to open your mind as a non-conservative, take this course.",
    "A great history seminar that is also extremely relevant to our political moment. Professor Lynn is amazing; he makes himself unbelievably accessible to his students and assigns only the amount of reading that we will practically be able to discuss substantively in one meeting. I would recommend this class to someone looking for a seminar that is highly stimulating, challenging, and rewarding, but that does not require quite same intense reading load that seminars often do.",
    "History of Conservatism is an incredible course that is definitely worth your time. Professor Lynn has crafted a syllabus filled with fascinating readings that truly dive deep into explaining the phenomena of American Conservatism. I learned an incredible amount from class discussions with the most intellectually diverse student body at Yale and found all aspects of the class to be a fulfilling experience.",
    "I would recommend this course! It is a well-taught history seminar with good discussions (naturally, because of how contested the material is), good readings and a final paper that allows you to explore whatever is interesting to you within conservatism. I think it's important to know the enemy if you're liberal and to know yourself if you're conservative. People from both sides learned a lot and are not much more informed about politics.",
    "Absolutely. Especially in an environment at Yale that is overwhelmingly liberal and almost encourages you to socially segregate yourself into having only friends with whom you agree, I found this class to be a space of intellectual, ideological, and geographic diversity that I haven't encountered in many other spaces at Yale.",
    "The History of American Conservatism was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Most students graduate from Yale without ever encountering American \"Conservatism\" in an academic context. Anyone interested in engaging with American political history should take this course. In addition, Dr. Lynn is one of the best instructors that Yale has to offer.",
