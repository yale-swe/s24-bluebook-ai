    "Interesting views on healthcare",
    "This course provided a biased, one-sided view to current issues in healthcare. Professor Swenson did not do a good job connecting to his class. A huge amount of the class dropped.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Take this class if you care about healthcare. Don't take it otherwise. For me, the premise of this class was absolutely worth my time, as was the actual material covered. Unfortunately, the reading didn't always feel completely relevant (the class and reading were frequently a week apart in timing) and the professor was not the strongest lecturer I've ever had. It was a worthwhile class anyway, but it did have its weak points, mostly organizationally and how the grade was distributed across assignments. Like I said, if the material matters to you, I highly recommend this as a great introduction (Professor Swenson is a sweetheart). If you don't care about healthcare, then don't bother -- you'll only end up skipping class.",
    "no, do not take this class. i took it credit\/d and still had to go to lecture every time and work hard on the midterm and final",
    "It was very interesting but this class is normally taught as a seminar. This was the first time this class was taught as a lecture, which meant that there were kinks that still need to be worked out. Some of the readings are entirely relevant and some material was not tested on the midterm and\/or final (there is a pretty substantial amount of reading). I learned a lot about the healthcare system and reform efforts in the US though and really enjoyed the material.",
    "Informative. Lots of reading. Recommend if you are truly interested in the material. Take a look at the syllabus.",
    "Don't take this class!!!",
    "Hard class, unless you have a back ground in health care. Lots of information is presented, almost overwhelming. Wouldn't recommend unless you need to take the class or understand the history of healthcare in the US."
