Students should be able to attend if they want to and because they think they will benefit from being there. Forcing students to attend (via pop quizzes or points for attendance) has no evident pedagogical benefit. All it does is foster resentment among the students. Students should have the option to attend if they think it will help them learn. If no students are attending, then the instructor should take it as a sign that whatever they are offering is not helping the students learn, rather than try to strong-arm the students into attending by directly linking attendance to grades. Some students pick up on the material faster than others, and thus might not feel any benefit to attending section in a given week. Forcing students to attend lecture or section in order to \"collect\" points makes YSPH feel like a much less legitimate institution.",

   "comments": [
    "This course is really helpful for us learn principals about epidemiology and I really like the way of discussion about homework in small groups.",
    "This class is VERY well structured. It shows that the professor knows what she is doing and how to guide us through the material. I felt like I learned a ton, and that the homework was always useful. Loved that it was pass\/fail and that we checked it ourselves. Its a model I would suggest for a lot of big lecture classes with homework. Lectures were always clear. Slides were an awesome reference.",
    "Great introduction to epidemiology. It was organized well, both administratively and in terms of course content. The flow of the material made sense, and the slides were clear and informative. I don't have any suggestions off the top of my head for how to improve. Happy overall with the experience.",
    "Great course - definitely an important piece of our public health education, and the depth and scope of this course was perfect yet challenging.",
    "I don't see any other box to discuss my TA. Elise was amazing and her slides are excellent.",
    "this course is practical and you could learn method to conduct research.",
    "Very good.",
    "Need to have more in class calculation time",
    "Great powerpoints, interesting material, good homework structure. Sections reinforced class learning.",
    "Way too structured and regimented , often inefficient material is very important and powerpoints and homeworks are well designed",
    "Strengths: A good foundation to the study of public health and overview of the baseline skills needed in the field Weaknesses: -The exam grades do not seem to reflect the overall mastery of the material. For example, there are not many questions on the exams, and each question is worth a lot of points. If we get one or two questions wrong, we are immediately knocked down on the grading scale. Exams also require rote memorization of formulas, which is not necessarily a measure of our understanding of the material. -At times, the lecture slides can be disorganized and difficult to follow on a second read. Many of the concepts and techniques follow a logical progression, but sometimes we're presented the material in an \"all-over-the-place\" manner or skips steps. If we do not have background in the material, these details matter. -There have been a few occasions where we have been told to simply do a calculation a certain way or the concept just needs to be learned. It would be more helpful if we could be provided with an answer on \"why\" we need to learn something.",
    "Was a useful course.",
    "This is a very useful course.",
    "The first half of the course was taught really well, but the second half of the course was not taught well and that material was more difficult to understand too, which was unfortunate.",
    "The class section can be a review of the week's material instead of just going over the homework.",
    "This was an awesome intro to Epi in public health! The class was structured well and the professor made learning the material fun and engaging. The use of sections and weekly homeworks also helped to solidify concepts and made studying for the exams so much easier. Great class! 10\/10. Would recommend.",
    "Discussion sections were helpful. At times was dry and confusing, overall a solid course.",
    "I strongly disliked the late policy for discussion. If you're a 3 minutes late, you might as well not come. Even if you're there in time to answer the first question, you will be deducted the point, just like the people that stayed home and didn't show up at all. It's quite unfair. I would recommend adding a 0.5 point penalty for being late rather than losing the entire attendance point. Some of the exam grading seemed completely arbitrary too. Students got deducted points for not showing units in their scratch work, even if the ultimate answer was correct.",
    "This course treated students as if they were in elementary school rather than grad school. Punitive policies on section attendance and timing connected grades to attendance rather than learning and performance. I was shocked by the lack of respect this demonstrates for students spending almost $4,000 and 1\/20th of their course opportunities at Yale on this class.",
    "It was a great and very useful class. I learned a lot of practical things from it. Very good they way the class was organized with lectures, homework, and sessions.",
    "Strengths: -Basic overview of epidemiology - good -Homework being P\/F and self-graded in section I think is GREAT plan. Helped me take a stab myself and learn collectively about improvements or corrections to make. Weaknesses: -Could have included more \"real-life\"\/current events associations for case studies about topics",
    "It's a well designed course where we cover all the basic tools of epidemiology.",
    "I loved this course. It was my favorite course up until about Week 9, when suddenly it was very difficult to follow and understand. The teaching lacked consistency from here on out.",
    "Course material was good, and the instructor did a good job teaching it all. Course policies treated us like children with arbitrary cutoffs to get to the friday sessions, and that was frustrating.",
    "I enjoyed this course.",
    "A really interesting class, I loved the material and i thought every single lecture was extremely relevant.",
    "Professor Nicolai's organization of the course was great, the slides were awesome, the homeworks were appropriate (and I liked that they were pass\/fail and then the exams were for a grade). My one complaint was that the Friday morning sections were unnecessarily long for all of the weeks except for when we had exams. If we had shorter sections (maybe 50 minutes?), we would have gone through the homeworks more efficiently.",
    "Overall the course was very informative and I learned a lot. I think that the lectures and lecture slides were very useful and the discussion section helped to clarify material.",
    "The course is interesting and is definitely necessary for everyone in public health. It depends a lot on memorizing and not really understanding. The course overall gave me a very good background in epidemiology which was a new subject for me.",
    "This is a good course. It was really interesting and a nice introduction to the field of epidemiology. The homeworks sometimes requires a lot of time to answer the questions but they prepared you really well for the tests, which were always fair. The only thing I wished had been different was the Friday morning sections. I feel like the sections could be on a different day--Friday morning is a really annoying time to have to go to section.",
    "Lectures were good until section 3, at which point I feel like very little effort was put into relaying the material in a way that connected with students. I would examine more case studies and papers to give students more hands-on experience with material and making it connect.",
    "This course was a great introduction to epidemiology. I thought the work load was totally manageable and the problem sets and tests were very fair. I really liked how the problem sets were graded pass fail and we had a chance to correct them in class-- helped me to really learn and understand the material.",
    "I very much enjoyed this course. I thought the way that Linda structured the course, with exams every few weeks, really allowed us to learn the material and build upon topics that were covered earlier in the semester. I feel that this class provided a great introduction to Epidemiology, and the skills learned were applicable to almost all of my other courses when critically evaluating peer reviewed literature.",
    "strength - very baseline public health information weakness - examples provided not very exciting or current",
    "Great intro to Epi class! Even if you have an Epi background I recommend taking it. You will learn things you didn't know before.",
    "Very well constructed. I feel that i fully comprehend many of the topics. The topics were taught in a an applied epi way where you could se ho they fit in the real world. Provided, many historical examples.",
    "Besides the fact that you have to take this course, it was very good. The class is well-structured in the topics you learn (it just starts off kind of slow) and the lectures themselves could be better organized. I also think some of the readings would be more useful after the corresponding lecture and not before (when you don't know why they were assigned per se), but Professor Niccolai is great at explaining things and is very receptive with her students.",
    "Liked the review sessions on Friday's. The overall homework took too much time, but was helpful overall.",
    "Epidemiology was a course that I enjoyed in parts, but felt that certain concepts were not fully explained or fleshed out. I understand that it was an introduction course, but I felt that we could have spent more time in class solving problems instead of regaling those to the homework. I would have liked to spend more time with the data in epidemiology, focusing analytical methods (like multivariate regression) that are actually used in the literature. The course was good for a broad overview, I just felt that we could have dug a little deeper into some topics.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount in the course and got a great foundation in epidemiology.",
    "I found that the content would have been more exciting if we included more recent studies",
    "As an EMD student, I thought this was a terrific introduction to epidemiology. There was a lot of contact time between students and Prof. Niccolai as well as the TAs in review sessions and discussion sessions. Homework was a good tool to learn the material and practice. I thought the course was well structured. I felt the early homeworks were rather redundant and wasted time, whereas as the semester went on and the material become harder, maybe there should have been more redundancies to drive home certain points about the material. One of the few changes I'd recommend is in the presentation of material for the third test, namely bias and confounding and effect modification. The bias homework came first and was short and rather simple. Then we did EM and confounding which was rather hard. I would suggest doing EM and confounding first, and then do biases; have that long homework the first week, and then put some additional EM\/confounding problems on the bias homework for more practice. Overall I thought it was a very informational and efficient class!",
    "I took away a lot from this course. It was well-taught and easy to follow and it helped me get a sense of what epidemiology is all about. The material definitely builds on itself so you never really forget what you learned at the start. The course would be improved if we didn't have to memorize all the equations for tests, but that is a small grievance.",
    "I really enjoyed the course and now feel well-prepared to understand different study designs and the mathematics associated with them. My ability to read scientific papers and truly understand the methods behind them has improved as a result of this course. I can't think of any weaknesses related to the course.",
    "Good course.",
    "too much homework and exams questions are unfair, especially the 2 part multiple choice questions. Why can we not have partial credit for the part we got correct? It makes no sense losing 3 points when you have half of a question figured out.",
    "The course was good",
    "The course was informative on the variety of topics in epidemiology and clarified the field and work associated with it. However, it seemed to be an excellent opportunity to include cultural competencies, more on established researcher bias, and both more recent history of public health and the present state of it. Though there is a large quantity of course info, inputting these would be helpful to understand the drawbacks and positive qualities associated with epidemiology now and in the past.",
    "The strength was that there was a logical progression of ideas in the course, so the material naturally built on itself.",
    "Huge criticism: Please get rid of being late to section. Sometimes people are late by 2 minutes and they still get penalized.",
    "While the course content was all valuable and progressed well, I was a bit disappointed by the lack of connection between intro Epi and Biostats (which everyone is required to take anyways). Both of the courses would tremendously benefit from the professors coordinating , as the subject matter supplements each other, but sometimes the connecting concepts came up at entirely different time points during the semester or were explained differently, which made matters a bit confusing or frustrating in both subjects.",
    "I really liked the course overall. I appreciated how Professor Niccolai had a lot of tests and weekly Discussion sections so we needed to keep on top of the material.",
    "I really appreciate the way the class is structured. I felt that having weekly pass\/not pass assignments pushed me to understand the material while not penalizing me for getting responses wrong. As someone who has never taken an epidemiology course before, this class was a huge learning curve for me, but I can confidently say, I've come out on the other end much more informed.",
    "Too many homework assignments. Robyn was a great TA, was very patient and answered all questions.",
    "Strengths: weekly feedback on material, super engaging prof, excellent TFs Areas for improvement: whiny grad students in the course who need to get over themselves.",
    "This course was an extremely practical introduction to epidemiology. The information itself is not particularly interesting, but the instructors did their best to add some 'oomph' to the material by including interesting studies and examples. Overall, I enjoyed the class and the readings.",
    "Overall the class was very well designed. Students were required to critically analyze the material and there were plenty of opportunities for assistance when needed.",
    "the Friday sections failed to add value to the course.",
    "I liked the constant feedback and chances to make sure that I understood what I was being taught. The workload was good for this, although sometimes the homeworks were a little more repetitive than necessary. The tests were very reasonable. The section attendance rule was a bit strict- sometimes section was a waste of time if you really understood that week's material and done the homework correctly. With more flexibility this could be avoided.",
    "The content was very good. I think the way it was structured was very sensible. I always understood why I was learning what I was. The progression and transition of topics made sense and set us up for more effective learning."

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Great instructor. Her confidence in the material and presence in class kept me engaged in lecture material and was essential to my mental presence in the lecture. She is always available and willing to answer questions. Definitely one of my favorite professors this semester.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Academically, Linda is great, and her presentation style is excellent. However, her discussions of material pertaining to healthcare inequities (and, generally, social issues underlying the research discussed in class) leave a lot to be desired. I appreciated her frankness about the effect recent honor code violations had on her personally. I am extremely happy with the way that homework is set up to be a teaching tool.",

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She's great",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She's s great and engaging professor, very knowledgeable. She became hostile towards students asking questions towards the end of the semester. Yes, the students were asking dumb questions, but it got to the point where I felt uncomfortable raising my hand.",

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Good professor",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Funny, engaging, and passionate about the topic. Great instructor!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0This professor's attitude declined over the semester, and I found her to be demeaning to many students while answering (or not answering) their questions. I found that to be off-putting. That said, she clearly knows her stuff and would at times explain things very well.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Niccolai does interesting research, but she doesn't talk about it much. Instead she uses examples in class that she's unfamiliar with. It's been frustrating to hear her say \"I don't know anything about this disease. What happens when you have _____?\" I think she's great overall, but that was one thing I found really frustrating this semester. I would much rather learn more about her research\/have her use examples that she's familiar and comfortable with to drive the point home.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai failed to master the use of classesv2 and made this by far the most challenging course of the semester for me to find the information and materials I needed for the course. Information was presented in class in context of older studies and doesn't appear to have been refreshed in quite a few years. Focus seemed to be on wrote memorization, which strikes me as an antiquated approach to education...particularly when the instructor demanding the memorization and denying use of equation sheets makes errors in her own memory of equations during lecture. I would have preferred less memorization and more application.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is wonderful in teaching and organizing the class",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths: -Grasp of material - she clearly knows her stuff. -Ability to explain concepts to people new to the field - I thought Linda did a great job of logically presenting material in a very organized fashion and highlighting key take-aways. -I think Linda did a fine job of admitting when she wasn't an expert in something, and looking to the class for expertise or knowledge from students (i.e. about specific diseases). More of that could even be better. Weaknesses: -Connecting topics to current trends in healthcare could be stronger. I know that's not why all people are taking the class, but knowing how epidemiology is used in the provider setting would be helpful. Ex: Linda mentioned a few times that there was growing attention in the field of epidemiology in population\/environmental trends impacting health, but few case studies went over that. Also when we talked about Screening, we didn't learn much about current \"hot\" debates about what the medical field does and doesn't screen for.",

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I really enjoyed Professor Niccolai's teaching, again, up until Week 9. Something changed and it was all of a sudden very difficult to follow her. It was not a great end to an otherwise great experience.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very knowledgeable, overall satisfied with her teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is a great professor, I learned a lot from her.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0You can tell she puts her heart and soul into this class, and for that we must be grateful. You can also tell that she puts up with a lot from the students, which must be difficult. I think she does a great job at explaining the material that she has prepared, but not a great job explaining things on the spot (at review sessions and answering questions).",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Nicolai is great! I never went to her office hours so I only interacted with her in lecture, but I found her effective, responsive, communicative, and engaging. I can't even think of ways that her teaching could be improved!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda was a wonderful professor! Her lectures were very clear and easy to understand. The assigned homework helped to reinforce the material. Linda also took the time to incorporate students' suggestions and went out of the way to help us succeed.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai really engages the class. She tries to make the course interesting and explains concepts clearly. However sometimes she uses examples about a certain disease and she assumes that everyone is familiar with it. Having no background in epidemiology, it was hard for me to keep up sometimes to understand those examples. Overall however she did a very good job accommodating everyone's needs and explaining key points.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Nicolas is a great professor. She was sensitive to the needs of her students and a great professor. She was clear in lecture and wrote fair tests.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Again, I feel this course was well taught for the first half, but effort was lacking in the second half. Responses to student questions felt half-assed after October, which made it difficult to learn or even be excited to learn the material.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She always has very great and clear and concise lectures. She covers all the readings in class and her lectures do a great job of synthesizing all the information. She is a very helpful and understanding professor.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I thought Linda was a great instructor for this course. The material that I wished we had a bit more time, or a bit more clarification on, was about confounding and bias as I felt we covered that material rather quickly.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0strength - organized, timely weakness - please understand some of the background for the examples you present, or don't present them. its not enough to show that race is a different factor if you aren't aware of why race in America is a factor Instructor seemed defensive at times by students' questions and\/or confusions",

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I thought Dr. Niccolai was a very compassionate and enthusiastic instructor. However, sometimes I felt she relied too heavily on her slides and didn't engage like she could have. I liked that we did readings from the literature and discussed the studies in class because I thought it gave me a much better idea of how the concepts we learned got applied in research.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I like that the professor engaged the class for discussion",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Prof. Niccolai did a good job lecturing and explaining the material on the slides. I felt the presentation of and flow of the lectures was very nice. I think she largely did a solid job of fielding student questions, although at times she answered with something of a shrug or with almost a flippant response. I didn't find this particularly irksome, but I know others did not appreciate these responses.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai taught the material in a very straightforward manner and she also incorporated a lot of student feedback into her teaching throughout the semester. I think she did a wonderful job organizing the course and picking examples to go through in class.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The semester started off great and Professor Niccolai was one of my favorite professors at Yale. She was very enthusiastic and seemed passionate about the course and epidemiology. Her explanations were clear and she did an excellent job teaching the class. After the first half of the semester, the dynamics of the course greatly changed. I am not quite sure what happened, however the professor did not teach the material as well. Additionally, the professor seemed to change her attitude about the course and did not give off the same enthusiasm. Explanations were unclear and the class became confusing and uninteresting.",

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor is good however it is difficult to have practice for exams because her practice exams do not have solution explanations",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai did an excellent job of teaching such a complicated array of epidemiology subjects and was clear to expose both her mistakes and successes. This allowed us to conceptualize better and reduce stress on not immediately understanding the content.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was clear in what she wanted us to know, but sometimes she would get frazzled. She seemed unsure of her ability to teach us some of the concepts.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Great professor! So funny, easy to get to know and approach, and knowledgeable. I learned a lot. Everything was easy to understand, and Professor Niccolai's structure to the course made sure students could succeed.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Excellent professor. Very intellegent yet humble and down to earth. Knows how to simplify complex topics.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is a wonderful professor! She was very helpful during office hours the couple times I went this past semester.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I liked Professor Niccolai a lot. She was very attentive to students and was a great professor.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I really like Dr. Niccolai, she is a strong instructor.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strength: Very organized with handout information Weakness: Classes occasionally did not end on time",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Super nice and engaging and wonderful! Needs to not let the complainers get to her. I admire that she sets standards for all students, regardless of how entitled they may feel.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was funny, smart, engaging, and always willing to help. She is passionate about the course material and did her best to make her students passionate about it as well. I think the lectures were straightforward and well-organized and the class was planned out thoughtfully.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Prof. Niccolai has thoughtfully designed this course. She does everything she can to ensure academic success without minimizing the integrity of the material. Throughout the term she respected student feedback. One suggestion I have would be to incorporate opportunities for small group discussion when working on pulling together larger concepts. For example, have groups of students discuss the question proposed to the class for a couple of minutes then come together whole group. Logistically I understand there may not be time to do this every class but would be beneficial to promote understanding for the entire class.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was great- she was very good at explaining the concepts and answering questions. She was also good at keeping the lectures engaging and interesting.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda was a very relatable instructor and I enjoyed her lectures. I wish the homework was less tedious. Section could have been capitalized more, as supplemental teaching rather than simply going over homework. I think the key to mastering epi is repetition and reinforcement, and I just needed Linda\/TF to drive home the point and concepts."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely this course is very important for student in public health concentration.",
    "Its a good course. You will learn a lot and you don't learn it painfully. I felt respected as a student. Wasn't asked crazy questions on exams that I was not prepared to answer, wasn't given ridiculous amounts of homework or superfluous assignments. One of the best required courses Ive ever taken and Im pre-med, so Ive taken A LOT.",
    "Great intro course to epidemiology. The material is important, interesting, and relatively easy to grasp throughout the course. Very happy with my experience this semester.",
    "Material presented well. Missed opportunities by Linda to connect material to broader social issues. If your TA is good, then your section will be the most important part of the class.",
    "highly recommend this course",
    "Recommend it. Nice foundation for public health analysis",
    "I wouldn't take it if it wasn't required",
    "Go to lecture, do the homework, you'll learn about epi. It's an intro course.",
    "Yes, I will recommend it.",
    "",
    "go to class and take notes the first half of the class, but the second half of the class you need to be prepared to teach yourself and figure the material out. also enjoy the fact the homework is pass fail, but use it as a way to understand the material.",
    "It's a core course.",
    "Yes! I mean you have to take it, but you'll have fun and learn a lot doing it.",
    "It's required. It's helpful to know the content in order to understand how to read studies, etc. But it may not be a very pleasurable course experience.",
    "It's required and you should take it. You learn an incredible amount regarding study design and measures of association, which will improve your confidence going forward in public health. I'm glad I took the course and it was incredibly beneficial. However, I did find myself frustrated by policies, arbitrary point deductions, and ultimately examples that the professor was not familiar with but insisted on teaching.",
    "This is a mandatory course. I would not take it if it were not, or would seek another instructor. I would avoid attending class and use the time to study the subject independently.",
    "It is a wonderful introduction class to epidemiology. Materials and topics covered are well organized and covered most of the very basic yet important concepts in epidemiology.",
    "It's the fundamental building blocks of public health. take it, if you keep up with the lectures and homework it can actually be enjoyable!",
    "it is probably the most important class you will take next to Biostats. Try to see the bigger picture!",
    "If you can exempt out of it, I would recommend a student do so. This course material is important for future material, but this feels more like an undergrad course than a graduate one.",
    "I would recommend it to people who plan to do research.",
    "Definitely take it! I mean, you probably have to, but even if it wasn't required I would recommend this course very highly.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot about how to use epidemiology as a public health professional and researcher. The student will learn basics in epidemiology like study design as well as more difficult concepts like effect modification.",
    "Good course. Not too difficult but you will learn a a lot.",
    "It's a good overview of epidemiological concepts and I would recommend it.",
    "Great course!! Required for MPH students but I would recommend this class to anyone interested in public health.",
    "I thought this course provided excellent foundation for Epidemiology concepts, and would absolutely recommend this course to another student.",
    "meh",
    "Great class! Will learn a ton.",
    "Well, you have to take it most likely, but the class gives a great overview of Epi as well as the major things you're bound (or already have) come across in scientific literature. Professor Niccolai is great at explaining things (keeping in mind that the focus is very broad for this type of intro class).",
    "Yes, a good course to understand basic concepts on public health epidemiology.",
    "Epidemiology is a core part of public health, and Niccolai's class does a good job in summarizing the main points. It is not a particularly applied course, and will probably prime you for research but not prepare you for it.",
    "I would recommend the course. It is a good introduction of the concepts and mathematics which underscore many public health studies. The course assists in the comprehension of reading public health literature.",
    "Definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about epidemiology. The course is very straightforward and you end up with a good skill set to analyze primary literature.",
    "The course material is extremely beneficial and I would definitely recommend taking the course. It is helpful for understanding and informing all of my other course work and research.",
    "Good course but tested badly",
    "The course is a constant level of work but important to understand the work that has been done in public health and the work we will probably either participate in or resource later in our careers.",
    "Great course, everything was well organized and interesting to learn. Tests weren't hard, so that's why I'm kicking myself for not doing well on them-- I should've done better because the entire class is entirely doable. Take it-- it's an amazing, engaging class.",
    "excellent experience that I would definitely recommend to another student",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "Excellent course. Challenging, but you will learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course. Excellent overview into the foundations of public health.",
    "I would call this an extremely practical course that teaches you the basic ideas of epidemiology. While maybe not as interesting as some other classes, this class is rewarding and fun and teaches you important skills. So, yes, I would recommend it.",
    "The course will challenge you but as long are you put in the effort and reach out for help when needed you can succeed.",
    "You have to take it, but it's a great class! Well taught, interesting and reasonable in terms of work load and assessments.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot and it is essential for public health professionals."
