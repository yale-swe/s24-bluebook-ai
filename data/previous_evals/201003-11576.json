Since the reading load was heavy and the book took a couple of weeks to arrive, it took me several weeks to get caught up with the readings."

    "Listening to Prof. robinson describe the evolution of international environmental laws. he is a treasure trove of historical information! I loved his lectures!",
    "The instructor was very knowledgeable about all aspects of law taught in the course, and provided a very good overview of the material that was easy to follow regardless of the students' previous background. I really appreciated the instructor's teaching method and thought the course is a must for all MEM students.",
    "The professor. Professor Nicholas Robinson is a great lecturer. His 40+ years of international environmental law experience are an invaluable resource for students.",
    "Professor Robinson was extremely knowledgable and genuinely interested in teaching the course and talking to students.",
    "Professor Robinson's lectures",
    "The lectures of the professor were amazing. The professor is very knowledgeable and experienced in his field and he can teach you in 3 hours things that others need 3 months.",
    "The best thing about the class was the teaching. Prof. Robinson knows a lot and a lot about what he is teaching."

    "The instructor was very responsive to questions and always made time for his students.",
    "The professor was always available to answer student's questions in either a group or individual setting. He has even offered to review his comments on our final papers next semester. It is apparent throughout the course that Professor Robinson truly cares about his students and their connection with a topic that might (or might not) be brand new to them.",
    "Professor Robinson made himself available during class breaks and after class to answer student questions. Since he has so much experience in the field of international environmental law and knows so many others involved in such work, he always has interesting anecdotes and examples to share. This was truly an invaluable asset for learning the material.",
    "The professor was always responsive and helpful.",
    "The instructor was always available. He has no TA, and I feel that won't be useful to have one."
