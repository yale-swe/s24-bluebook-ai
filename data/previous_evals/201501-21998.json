   "comments": [
    "Physics major here. You read The Odyssey, The Aeneid, The Inferno, Don Quixote, Ulysses, and one more piece depending on your section. The reading definitely picks up in the second half of the semester (I read something like 1600 pages after spring break started). Papers are pretty chill in this class (four over the semester, and more if you'd like), and for me at least were the main thing giving me some connection to each work. If you're not an English major, you will almost undoubtedly hear some terms and jargon in seminar you will not care about. But I don't know, I thought it was pretty intellectually transformative spending a day trying to figure out why Stephen Dedalus has his Hamlet theory (Ulysses). So if you want to be be well read at all, why not take it? Do all the reading, write cool short papers, look at your stack of books at the end of the semester, and you might just think the class is worthy of the title EPIC",
    "Lots of reading and a mildly unforgiving pace. However, if you are willing to put in the work, absolutely a course to take. Very enjoyable and rewarding if you are willing to put in the time.",
    "Good class to read important texts that you might otherwise have difficulty with. Not really super in depth in any one area.",
    "Epic is excellent I think truly one of the best classroom experiences any student could have at Yale. The reading list is phenomenal, and exactly the sweep of Western lit that one would hope for from a liberal arts education. These texts were so rewarding to read; I don't think the fast pace of the class is necessarily ideal, but I think having support while reading some of the denser material makes up for that (there is no way I would have gotten nearly as much out of Ulysses, for example, had I read it alone). I took this as a second-semester senior English major, and it was one of the most delightful\/stimulating classroom experiences I had in four years at Yale. I think it would have been a shame to graduate without having read all of these books. And if you can, absolutely take this class with Paul Fry; he is a genius. The way he taught the texts was brilliant and accessible (and he's also a wonderful person to know). I'm honestly surprised his isn't generally known as one of those must-take courses. I could not recommend it more highly to English and non-English majors alike."
