    "If you took the first Czech course, this is the next logical step. It builds on the elements of the language learned in the first semester, with more emphasis on readings and translations, which always proved to be entertaining.",
    "I 100% recommend taking Czech. It is a fun language that you can get a lot out of because of the small class size and great professor.",
    "A great class for learning a lesser known, but fun language, and a great experience outside of the more traditional languages tought here."
