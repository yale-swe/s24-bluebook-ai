    "Chinese 110 is an intense but incredibly rewarding class. Although the daily quizzes may seem a bit tedious, they are truly helpful and you will be glad they exist when midterms and finals roll around. This class and its tests are pretty straightforward and standard. I learned so much Chinese during this semester and I'm looking forward to continuing with 120. I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "This class was interesting and I learned a lot but it was also incredibly difficult. It took up most of my time this semester and I still often didn't feel that I was succeeding. I would recommend this class if you are really interested in Chinese but not just for a language credit.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Literally the only reservation is how much work it is. Know what you are getting yourself into."
