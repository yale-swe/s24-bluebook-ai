    "Take it for sure, Doss is awesome",

    "Great class - take it if you care about development!",
    "Take it if interested in economics research and interventions being undertaken in Africa. Bear in mind the course is very much a survey class and does not explore any single top in great depth. Presentations are fairly easy and the final research paper was flexible but grading was harsher than expected.",
    "Great senior seminar, professor Doss is an expert on Africa and is extremely nice. Weekly article critiques (graded on completion), 2 15 min class presentations, 5 page critique of an economics article, and a 10-15 page paper on a topic of your choosing. Take this is you're looking for a low workload, interesting course."
