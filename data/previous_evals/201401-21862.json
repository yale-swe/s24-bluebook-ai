    "I feel as if my speaking and writing has improved immensely this semester. Sarab's teaching style is great; she uses a lot of in-class activities that help you to solidify your understanding of the vocab and the grammar. The weekly quizzes, while annoying at times, definitely help to keep you on track. But you get out what you put in, so only take this if you're willing to put in the extra work.",
    "Structured course - far better than the department's reputation would indicate",
    "If you want to learn Arabic, do it at Yale and with Sarab!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone trying to continue from ARBC 130 or who has proficient speaking and grammatical skills. The course emphasizes speaking in Arabic throughout the entire class and balances between reading and listening comprehension as well as daily discussions.",
    "I would recommend this course. However, keep in mind that there is a LOT of work that you will have during the course of the term. Make sure to be on top of that.",
    "Arabic 140 is a difficult course that requires a lot of dedication, but learning is possible and this course is well worth the effort.",
    "Absolutely! You will learn tons.",
    "Arabic 140 is a great intermediate class in arabic. I have improved my reading and speaking skills this semester especially."
