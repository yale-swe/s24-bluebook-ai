   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course due to its interesting subject and great professor.",
    "Yes! A comparative history class is a must have for anyone interested in the subject.",
    "Definitely take it!!",
    "This was a very interesting, historiography-focused course on frontier studies, using the American West and South Africa as comparative case studies. The reading list is very interesting, and while it is not exactly an introductory survey to South African history, I think that history majors should jump at any chance to study African history, and this course offers a particularly good segue for those already familiar with the history of the American west.",
    "For history majors, this class will teach you about comparative history writing, which walks an interesting line between history and sociology, revealing greater social\/historical trends than one course alone on colonialism will allow. Great course with a possibility to write a really interesting final paper!"
