   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone. Very accessible to non-History majors but equally challenging for History majors. The rich information of the period combined with Merriman's engaging lectures makes this class a must-take.",
    "Prof Merriman is a star! Amazing lectures, great material. Quite a bit of reading, but its mostly very interesting. Two exams (typical midterm; finals questions given in advance) and one paper; and weekly forum participation. Quite a bit of work if youre invested in it.",
    "The course was great! Professor Merriman is a very good lecturer, and he really makes the course material come alive. I definitely left the course with a better knowledge of the French Revolution of 1789 and how it influenced modern politics today. The pre-midterm period of the course the mostly revolutionary era is definitely the stronger half. The second half focuses more on socioeconomic conditions during the time period, but the historical narrative is lacking during the second part, and it was hard to follow at times. I believe the course could be improved by focusing less on culture (as blasphemous as that may sound) and adjust the course so the history of the post-Revolutionary era is easier to follow.",
    "I would definitely, definitely recommend this class to a fellow student, even to someone who doesn't like history. Its a wonderful, enjoyable class. I hope it continues to be offered.",
    "Yes!! This was a great, balanced class. Not too much work, and really fun !",
    "Its a good way to learn about French culture from a man who is the world's leading expert and loves france.",
    "A great class to take Credit\/D!",
    "A course that covers the revolutionary period in France from 1789-1871. Merriman is absolutely wonderful and the course was interesting. As someone who studies American history, I found this class to be very approachable. That being said, be aware that there is a lot of social history, particularly after the first revolution.",
    "Professor Merriman's book are the only good part of the course and you don't need to take the class, in fact you shouldn't take the class, to enjoy them.",
    "This is a very, very good history course taught by a Yale institution: Professor Merriman, who clearly cares about his students and his work. The course includes weekly readings, one research essay (which is long, and thus allows for independent research), a midterm, and a final. (That is, it consists of a faily standard course load.) I would also recommend this course because it explores one of the most fascinating and complex periods of history - ever.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who doesn't mind spending a good deal of time learning the material on their own. Merriman's lectures are good but he often times he assumes people have a basic understanding of the chronology and events. The workload is not too much, there are weekly reading responses and a midterm and final.",
    "I took this course as a \"fun\" course to fill my senior year schedule. It was the best change of pace I could have chosen - lots of interesting, relevant material that is fun to tie to other classes and schools of thought. Workload and reading very light, and I genuinely looked forward to attending class. Take it!",
    "Entertaining class. I was disappointed in the lack of political history in comparison to social history. I had to do a lot of outside reading to orient what we were talking about in lecture to what was actually going on. Merriman likes to go on tangents about his life in France and is very biased in his presentation of history. Take it if you want an easy humanities\/history credit but don't expect to learn too much that you couldn't get from reading a couple wikipedia articles.",
    "It's a great survey course, but mostly engaging for people very passionate about France and French culture.",
    "A wobbly introduction to French history. Professor Merriman's lecture style is somewhat infuriating: about 20% of each lecture is personal anecdotes, nothing is chronological, names and dates are all over the place, and I often left class confused. The readings were slightly more illuminating, and fortunately quite brief. Merriman also did not list office hours on the syllabus, and it was unclear to me when he was available (I think this was because he travels a lot, and is not really trying to talk to undergrads). The course's saving grace was my TA (Miranda Sachs) who was very knowledgable and accessible. The class compromised only a midterm, final, and final paper, so wasn't a large time commitment. The material is interesting, too. I would recommend thinking twice before taking, however, given the haphazard nature of Merriman's lecture style, and the fact that his jokes get old after the first week.",
    "Take this class regardless of how much you know about French history. It'll help you understand other classes\/revolutions\/modernity\/life\/fun\/goodness",
    "Definitely! It's a classic Yale course with a great professor. The period of history in France, although it seems particular, is so pivotal for future histories in Europe and globally.",
    "Really interesting material and great professor. Normal workload with midterm, final and a 10-page paper. Definitely take it if you're interested in French history or haven't learned enough about the revolutions in 19th century France. A joy of a course.",
    "Fun course! Lecture can be a bit confusing - interesting stuff though.",
    "Take",
    "Take this class to understand more about the French Revolution and what came afterwards.",
    "French History. Big emphasis on social element not really focus on Europe or Napoleon. Taught by a brilliant, mad, leftist. Not a lot of work.",
    "Merriman is extremely knowledgeable and kind. His lectures often become more of a story than a lecture, but I've come to realize that often those are the types of lectures you want to take at Yale. Sure you might be saying to yourself that if you had taken a more straight-forward lecture, you would have learned more. Well, you're probably saying that because you didn't do all the readings in a Merriman-type lecture. If you really want to get a detailed look at a subject, don't kid yourself and take a seminar. With Merriman, you get a different type of education. The man has lived in France for years and constantly offers his own quirky, humorous anecdotes that supplement the course material. When he spoke about the shootings in France, an extremely personal and emotional subject, it only gave me more respect for Merriman as a man while helping me understand just how unfortunately traumatic France's history has been. Merriman, straight-up, doesn't believe in tests. He just wants you to show up, listen attentively, do some readings (nearly all are interesting and informative) and learn something (let's be clear, you'll still take tests). I'm probably in the minority here considering how many turbo Yalies there are (Freshmen you'll change eventually, don't worry), but I believe that there's nothing better than a professor who cares about his students and simply wants them to learn without worry about their GPAs. Whether you need a manageable fifth class or not, take the course."
