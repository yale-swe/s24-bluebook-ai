    "Yes highly recommend because it is a great focus on one artist",
    "Very in depth study of a few (and not necessarily famous) works - I would only recommend to someone very interested in the History of Art.",
    "awful. just lots of looking at a handful of paintings getting lectured at. no discussion.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course even to students who are not particularly interested in art history or Leonardo. The material is accessible to anyone who has even the slightest interest in learning about a key figure in western culture. Both the professor and TA were very helpful and attentive to the students concerns."
