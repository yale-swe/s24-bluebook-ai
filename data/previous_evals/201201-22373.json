    "Yes, I would recommend Music 205 to another student. It gives a thorough foundation in music theory, which is useful for any practicing musician. It was not too difficult of a course, but it definitely payed off to do the readings. Homework was never overwhelming, but proceeded at a steady and manageable rate. I thought it was very well organized and work definitely recommend it!",
    "If you want to learn theory take it.It's not super exiting or captivating.",
    "It's a good basic music theory class. The third unit is hard though and it sneaks up on you. Much harder than Musi 110.",
    "An intermediate music theory class that covers a lot of material. Do not take it unless you are already fully confident with scales, intervals, and chord analysis.",
    "Yes, a terrific introduction to music theory, particularly for those who are familiar with reading music but don't know much about the technical aspects behind it.",
    "It is a useful class if you want an introduction to music theory. We spend a lot of time with \"nitty-gritty\" roman numeral analysis (which can be frustrating at times). We also look at larger structures such as Sonatas and Rondos. We spend a little time with ear training and dictation (I wish we spend more time on that!)On thing to be aware of: the first couple weeks of the class are a review of basic music theory. The assignments are very easy and don't take very much time. It is easy to assume the class will continue that way. Be prepared for it to become more challenging.",
    "The class started with learning how to analyze chords, then phrase structures, and eventually long forms, like ternary, rondo, and sonata.",
    "The course is great and Elizabeth is a great teacher. You will learn how to analyze (and probably appreciate a lot more) the forms and structures of classical music that is mostly Mozart and Beethoven sonatas. If you are looking more for composition than you probably have this stuff down and should try 210."
