   "comments": [
    "Definitely. I don't remember ever having a class as interesting as this one. Dr Possen is a great professor and because students come to class prepared, the class dynamics an discussions are very well-informed and fruitful. It's my favorite class of all 3 DS sections and I always look forward to lessons.",
    "Dr. Possen is the most incredible and charismatic teacher I have ever met and had the privilege of studying under. His dedication not only to imparting his own knowledge of a work but also to allowing students to discover its truths on their own with some guidance makes for a perfect combination, especially in a course that can be as difficult as philosophy. It is the hallmark of a true philosopher that he is able to take a subject blamed for leaving students confused, lost, and hopeless and help them realize that it does none of the above whentaught properly. I am thoroughly convinced that the lessons I learned in this class and, more importantly, the questions with which it left me are some of the most valuable ones I will take with me from my college years.",
    "DS is hard, Prof Possen is fantastic. He spent 5 hours reviewing with our section before finals to make sure all our questions were answered. A really dynamic, enthusiastic teacher. He breaks down the material in very understandable terms, creating analogies that were better even than those of Socrates.",
    "Definitely recommended. Will make you confused, but you will learn to enjoy being confused.",
    "Absolutely\u0097on the condition that the student is interested in reading these texts. The class is certainly a great deal of work, but if you enjoy the texts, it's great! Furthermore, the student would have to be interested in learning the history of philosophy. While emphasis is put on students' reception of the philosphers' ideas, the course requires one has a firm grasp of the arguments in and of themselves before one can start commenting on them.",
    "Yes I definitely would recommend this class, esp. if you have never taken a philosophy class before.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a friend.",
    "Amazing. Take it. Don't think about it; take it.",
    "This was a wonderful course, and I can't say much more than that. By far my favorite of DS and first semester, and a valuable addition to an overall education. It has transformed my way of thinking about the world. I constantly think of references to philosophy in daily life and my friends\/family actually get annoyed now...",
    "A lot of work...only try directed studies if you're sure you can handle it and the people in these classes. The students are hardworking and often seem to have background knowledge so it may be a bit daunting at first but it's really not that bad. Philosophy is difficult to understand so it make take more time to digest what has been read. Students must be prepared to do this, otherwise they will remain clueless. Overall I would recommend the course as long as the student is aware of the work it entails.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. GET THIS SECTION! DS Philosophy first semester is a scary and exciting journey; Most students have never had philosophy (unlike Lit and HP) and though it can be daunting at first, it's one of the most rewarding classes. All of the readings are great--Plato and Aristotle are, of course, extremely important and foundational, but even the lesser known authors are interesting and meaningful. Possen is a fabulous section leader who REALLY cares about students and will make you a better writer, thinker and perhaps even a more thoughtful person. If you get his section, stay in it!",
    "TAKE IT! If you take DS and get Possen as an instructor thank your lucky stars. If you have a scheduling conflict - make it work, it's worth it. This was an incredible class. I am so glad that I got to see Yale at its best first semester."
