   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class. The material is interesting and important, and the professor cares about students.The workload of this class is not high. However, I get the impression that the grading is rather harsh. Most people I know scored in the B range on the paper, though maybe the people I know aren't representative of the cohort.",
    "I would definitely recommend it in conjunction with the Film Studies course Cinema of War with Murray Biggs",
    "Definitely take this course if you want to learn more in depth about the 20th century and how war shaped identities. Very different from what I had learned before, not a lot of work.",
    "Definitely take this. Even though I'm not a history major, I really enjoyed this class. It's probably one of the most enjoyable classes I've had here. The lectures are great and very well organized. The reading material is usually really interesting and enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, but only if you have a solid background of European History, otherwise the pace may be a little too fast.",
    "Experience of War in the 20th Century takes you through most of the major conflicts therein, (from WWI to the Balkan wars) hitting mostly on the way that dehumanization, rape, genocide, mourning and memorials have been interpreted and understood by people of that era and later scholars. The material can be pretty upsetting--I definitely cried in lecture on several occasions--but I came out of this class really feeling like I understood things about the way violence is practiced and the way societies respond to it. Be prepared to do a LOT of work, but I think it was worth it!",
    "NOT ABOUT WAR. ABOUT ATROCITIES (Rwanda, Yugoslavia, Belgium in WWI). Do not take if you don't want to learn about those.Also, spring 2013 have 2 sections with very different work requirements to get those necessary participation points. Choose wisely.",
    "I think it is a very important concept to be familiar with. I enjoyed the class very much, and would recommend it to a friend. There is a ton of reading to do, though. You may not be able to do them every week if you are taking 5 credits!",
    "Great class, although it is very literary and requires a lot of reading. Take it if it sounds interesting to you -- I was worried it would be too depressing for me, but it ended up being quite interesting",
    "Overall this is a good course. It is very interesting and not as depressing as a lot of the reviews make it sound, as long as you go in understand what will be discussed. There is only one paper and a final. However I would not recommend taking this class unless you are a history major.",
    "Interesting class, but be prepared to at least skim the readings ( section is worth 30%) and its tough subjects - not for the faint of heart",
    "If you want to take this class just because you are interested in war, I would say don't take it. This class is definitely a lot of work and it's a lot harder than it seems and the Prof and the TF really expect a lot from the students. So you will definitely have to put in the work and really invest time and energy in understanding and engaging with the class throughout the semester. I would say take it if you are willing to go all the way and really make this one of your more important classes for a semester.",
    "WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. especially not for history majors.",
    "In the first lecture of History 255, Professor Bruno Cabanes described his approach to his work as \"history from below.\" True to this promise, the rest of the course provides a brilliantly nuanced survey of how war was conducted in the 20th century. Moving roughly chronologically, the course starts with World War I, then addresses the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Algerian War, the Vietnam War, the Rwandan genocide, and the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. Through these conflicts the course tracks certain elements of the experience of war, including captivity, bombing, torture, sexual violence, and ethnic cleansing. This is clearly not a light class, but it is a necessary one. Professor Cabanes' approach \"from below\" provides the most detailed and vivid portrait of 20th century history I have found at Yale. This is certainly a course that changes how you view history and how you understand humanity; perhaps more crucially, though, it is a course that changes how you understand yourself. I absolutely recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. While grim, it is very informative and it challenges a lot of the current narratives we have for 20th century wars.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. But only if you're willing to put in the work. There are a lot of readings each week (the same as any History course) but most of them are really interesting and I'm actually going to read the books I didn't get around to reading during the semester in the summer because they are that interesting. The class is not a light hearted class, though, so be prepared for depressing and discouraging lectures about how awful human beings can be - we discuss rape, torture, modern warfare and more and go into great detail (through first hand descriptions), so be warned. There is one 10 page essay and a final and your section grade is worth 30% of your final grade, so definitely keep up with the readings if you can (to the best of your ability), it'll make it a lot easier to study for the final as well - it's not really a class you can cram for - you need to understand the different broad topics and be able to tie the themes together. A word of caution - this class does not discuss the actual wars of the 20th century and how they were fought, instead it touches on the impacts of these wars on humans.",
    "I would recommend this for a student looking for a new way to look at war, but be warned that it expects a LOT of background. Also, the subject matter is exactly as bleak as you think it is.",
    "Take it. It's a very interesting course.",
    "I recommend it to anyone at Yale, even non-history majors. The course material related to many key concepts in 20th century studies. Although the subjects tree is depressing, it's worth it because you learn about the most important conflicts in our time.",
    "Take it, no matter your major, it's literally part of our cultural heritage. But know that you will really have to work if you have no history experience!Go to his office hours, he trulycares about the material and the students. The material is fascinating, the readings are monumental. This is one course that will really open your mind to another way of thinking and to material you wouldn't see otherwise. It's so unique. I can't recommend it enough. But only take it if you'll really contribute!",
    "No. This class should not been listed as a history class. It is more of an examination of the psychology and symbolism behind war. You will be evaluated as if you're taking a lit class. (Except you must agree with the teacher)",
    "So I really Cr\/D\/F this course - although I wish that as much attention had been paid to conflicts outside WW I and WW II. There are two things that I wish were done specifically - a) I wish that the lectures were posted online. Prof. Cabanes is a great lecturer, but there were lot of details, especially when he dropped names or dates or locations in class where I simply could not keep up. He also liked to toggle between slides a lot, and so it made it difficult to get down notes sometimes. Second, I think the class had an onerous amount of reading per week for a lecture, and if that could be reduced, it would be fantastic. I recommend Cr\/D-ing it"
