    "yes!",
    "Take it if you want to learn a target language.",
    "i definitely would. persian is a great language.",
    "This is a great language. I found it very interesting and the professor is really nice.",
    "If you want to start learning Persian, this is obviously the class for you. If you're not sure you want to start learning Persian, some things to consider: Persian is not a tough language for an English speaker--that is, the grammar is quite simple. The biggest obstacle, for me, was learning the modified Arabic abjad in which the language is written, but that's also a major attraction.Mahshad is warm and welcoming and excited to teach you Persian. That being said, I didn't much like the book she used. If you're taking this class, get a dictionary, and definitely organize all the words you learn into a wordlist with all of their forms. The class isn't that disorganized, but sometimes things aren't reinforced too much.",
    "Farsi is a really cool language. Other than the script and pronunciation, it's a fairly simple language and enjoyable to learn. (There's only one or two irregular verbs in each tense!) The class is small - ours had around twelve - and you really get an interesting mix of people. Overall, if you need a language credit, this certainly isn't a bad choice. Great to know for diplomacy, tons of scholarships to study it from the government (it's a \"critical language\"), and never boring."
