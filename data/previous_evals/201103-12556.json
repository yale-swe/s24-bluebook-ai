   "comments": [
    "If you've taken Math 230 you shouldn't have too much trouble with this course.",
    "If you like math and you are really good at it, go for it.",
    "If you did well in 230\/231 you'll be fine in this course. Conceptually this stuff is straightforward (as opposed to say 350), the main part is getting the details and rigor right when writing up proofs. If you have no experience with epsilons and deltas it might be rough at first but you should get used to how those proofs work fairly quickly.The book we use is by Beals, which is not really the best book to learn from. It's very terse, and each chapter covers the very basics with no examples and little discussion. The problems can seem difficult when compared to how little is given in the chapter.I highly highly recommend Calculus by Michael Spivak. It doesn't have the point-set topology but the stuff on limits, continuous functions, and calculus is much better (especially the section on polynomial approximation) and the problems are great. If you work through a few of the main chapters of this book beforehand, you wont need to put much effort into 301.There are two exams, the midterm and the final each worth 45 percent. There is not much to them: just learn the tricks Jones likes to reuse and you can easily do most of the problems.",
    "Math 301 has not so bad homework sets, hard exams, and a not so great professor. Peter Jones would not give lectures that would proceed logically, his proofs and the lecture in general would be all over the place on different blackboards. After having such a great learning experience in math 230-231, I was disappointed with this class.",
    "Take this if you have to, but the class is pretty sloppy. We didn't get any homework back until 2 days before the midterm. Jones never answers his email. I got maybe half of my graded assignments back. Also, Jones refuses to tell anyone how he curves grades. Beals isn't a very good book. Analysis can be interesting, but you're going to have to make it that way yourself in 301.",
    "If you have to take it, go to office hours and get a better textbook to teach yourself the material. You will learn very little by going to lecture.",
    "Sure, you should take it. It's fascinating material and feel like I learned a lot. Be ready to work though...",
    "This class is essential if you wanna get further in math. I would recommend taking this class early on if you can because what you learn in this class is essential and relevant in so many other areas of math. The professor is fine, not great but not bad at the same time. Expect to put in a decent amount of work. Go to office hours if you get lost in the problem sets. The lectures are presented incoherently so it is easier to follow the class if you do some prior reading on the topic."
