    "I absolutely would recommend it, it's a fantastic way to get involved in lab and set yourself up for a summer research position as well!",
    "An opportunity to do what you ALREADY probably do, but for credit. And you have to write a paper and make a poster at the end. It's a bit of extra work, but easy and you do feel a nice sense of closure at the end of it. It's good practice.",
    "Don't stress about the paper\/poster it's just an extra-legit lab report",
    "If you're serious about continuing in chemistry, then you absolutely have to do undergraduate research. However, whether you need to do it for credit is up to you. Working in a lab during the year is significantly less rewarding than during the summer, because progress is painfully slow with only 10-15 hours per week. This is especially true with procedures that take a while, because it's very hard to find a continuous stretch of time during the school day, and hopefully you're not in lab at night without supervision. It never really hurts to start research early, but if you're an underclassman (especially sophomores or below, possibly even juniors without prior lab experience), you'll probably want to spend more of your time exploring other subjects than staying in lab all day; perhaps wait until the summer so that you can move past the learning curve more quickly and get significant work done on a project before chipping away at it little-by-little during the following school year.",
    "You know how it is; you take this if you need it for the major.One thing I will say is that it's very important to talk to your PI at the beginning of the semester about exactly what you'd like to cover in your senior project. This is especially true if you have multiple projects ongoing; when you get to second semester senior year, talk with your PI and ask which project s\/he'd like you to focus on for your senior project. This can bite you if you don't get this straightened out at the beginning of the semester.",
    "Chemistry 490 offers the opportunity to research chemistry for credit. I would definitely recommend it to another student. The spring course requires very little class time, which really gives students the opportunity to focus on research.",
    "Obviously depends on what your project is, but it's great that the course is flexible to your schedule."
