    "YESSSSSS after you go through L1\/L2, L3\/L4 are like your prizes. It's really enjoyable.",
    "even though we learned from sura sura, the teachers incorporated more media and culture aspects in the course. they're sneaky with it too--sometimes you don't even realize you've learned an important aspect of japanese culture until you walk out of class. the grammar concepts got trickier and more complex near the end, though. but the senseis make sure to answer every question thoroughly and carefully. with every semester of taking japanese at yale, my expectations just keep on getting higher for the faculty because it is taught so well. learning japanese from seto-sensei, maruyama-sensei, and mammoto-sensei was truly a joy and an honor.",
    "This is a great course! All of the teachers are very fun and kind people who are interested in helping you master Japanese and learn about Japanese culture. Although there's not a lot of speaking practice as you might have in courses in Japan, you still learn lots of useful vocabulary and grammar. I definitely recommend it.",
    "If I were you, I would continue beyond the L3 class and take this course. While some of the work can be tedious at times, it is a very enjoyable, and relaxing class. You really learn a lot of kanji.",
    "Japanese 140 is great! By this time, you should have gotten used to the work by now. Seto and Maruyama sensei are my favorite professors at Yale. Your knowledge of Japan will come to include more than the language, and will include the Japanese culture and way of life. Definitely take it!",
    "Yes; take it! It is awesome! Great way to learn an awesome language. Class is hard but highly rewarding. Fun assignments!",
    "It gets better than 130, I think. You can say much more and you really improve your reading and comprehension. Sura sura is a great text to learn from once you get used to it.",
    "I LOVED this class. We had a lot of fun, and looking back, my Japanese improved quite a bit. I really can't praise the three sensei enough; all of them were fantastic, funny, friendly teachers who obviously really care about their students. This was my favorite class this term, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.The highlight of this class was probably getting to hear Seto-sensei rap."
