    "Good! The first part of the course is more engaging than the second part unless you're some aficionado of the Middle Ages, which is just kind of rare among the population. You learn a lot about the Near East, which really isn't studied enough, over a very long span of years, and meet all sorts of interesting characters that jolt you out of your somnolent state in a 9am class and actually make you think like, hey this guy who lived 2100 years ago is cool! The exams are good, I think--really not hard and Foster is a fair grader.I enjoyed Foster's slides, but they seem to be projected using some antique machine that makes a loud humming noise. Bad if you're sitting at the back of the class near the projector.",
    "Interesting class. I like the professor.",
    "Survey course of near eastern history. Lecture format. It's early in the morning so you want to be interested in the subject matter. Given that however, it is really a fantastic course. Not many of these broad survey courses exist anymore, everyone likes the specialized 15 year history of Civil Rights in UK type courses. It is incredible to look at everything you've learned in just a semester; I feel like I have a good grasp of Near Eastern history, patterns in political, cultural, and religious development for a span of over a 1000 years of history. Pretty cool if you ask me.Course spans the period of Alexander to Muhammad. You will not get much Islamic history in this course; for that take the other Fall Section (Intro to Middle East or something similar) which goes from Muhammad to present day. Geographic bounds of the course: Rome to the West, India to the East, Egypt to the South, and Bulgaria \/ Russia to the North.Professor Foster still uses old school photographic slides from his travels in the region, which I personally loved. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea however.Some people might try to take this as a gut course; there is no question that the exams are fairly straightforward and you can avoid writing any papers by taking the option section. However I would caution you for two reasons if you are planning to do this: 1) it's a 9:00am course, and 2) history of this sort requires a lot of memorizing foreign names and dates and the like. Intellectually hefty material even if the coursework is somewhat light.",
    "I would recommend this course, though not without reservations. Each lecture is like a class in itself, which comes with the nature of such a large survey course, but nonetheless it makes the course very difficult to digest. While there are narratives and themes in the course, most of the time they are hazy or lost amidst the large amount of evidence that is easy to get lost in. It's hard to tell what is important and what isn't. All that being said, the course does present some wonderful and interesting information that goes unstudied but should be addressed. In order to combat the tendency to feel lost amidst the great variety of subjects, one need only take some time each week and particularly in the beginning of the semester to contemplate how it all fits together, and perhaps to place events and eras in chronological order so it doesn't become an amorphous mass of data. I fear that after reading this a prospective student might shy away from taking the course. I do not intend for that to be the case, as the course was quite enjoyable. I simply think it's necessary to acknowledge these difficulties before one takes the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "You learn a lot about very interesting topics. Professor Foster is very knowledgable and a great lecturer. If this class was not at 9 AM it would be very popular. If you attend 10\/12 optional Friday lectures you do not need to write the term paper and thus the whole grade is just a midterm and final (Beware of this though, as while midterm grades were good, I am hearing that final grades were not as good. Clearly I will find this out shortly). If you go to class and take very good notes then readings are not necessary.",
    "I feel like this course tried to cover too much history in too little time. Being an International student from an Asian country, I didn't have any classical background whatsoever, and the class assumed a working knowledge of at least the events from the Roman republic to the Islamic conquest. I also wished that religion didn't take up as much of the class discussion but perhaps it was necessary to that particular time period. All in all Prof. Foster knows his stuff and I enjoyed it. I just wish I had known to be more prepared.Can be either heavy or light workload.",
    "Absolutely! You will learn an immense amount about the most important events in Near Eastern history; just commit to doing the reading and paying attention.",
    "Yes, take it if you are either looking for very manageable 5th credit or really interested in learning more about interactions between the Mediterranean world and the Middle East since ancient times. For instance, I never knew how interconnected Greece and Rome were to Middle Eastern regions such as Syria. Professor Foster weaves an interesting story in his lectures, though he has a tendency to ramble. The workload is very manageable; if you take good notes, you don't have to do all of the readings. Also, if you attend at least 10 of the Friday review sections (which are not covered on the exams), then you are exempt from writing the term paper (which is a very nice deal!).",
    "Good course. Very interesting!",
    "I will recommend this course to those who are interested in elementary Middle Eastern history, especially its relationship with the Western world (Mediterranean, Greek and Roman primarily). Also you can't do too bad if you attend the lecture well, and know all the basics."
