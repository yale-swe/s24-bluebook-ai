    "PLSC 384 is a great seminar taught by an amazing professor. Basically it's a chance to read and discuss lots of topics related to Indian governance and political dynamics. You need to be interested in the subject, but honestly I think Professor Thachil could strike up a great fascination in even the only moderately interested student. This is a truly a comparative class. You will read many papers on Africa, East\/South East Asia, and Latin America, though the majority will focus on South Asia and India. Topics covered include Indian welfare regimes, caste-based politics, corruption, Hindu national& religious politics, development, role of international actors, etc. The readings strike a nice balance between theoretical and more applied. If you don't take this class, take something else with Tariq Thachil before you graduate. He's one of the best hidden gems in the PLSC \/ SAS departments. He really cares for his students and can take the most lofty PoliSci jargon and makes it applicable to daily life. Great guy, great class, not super super difficult. It's a bit weird to have a midterm and a final for a seminar just as a heads up, but he doesn't try to make it difficult on you. TAKE IT.",
    "Taught like a seminar. You need to do all the reading in order to participate. But you learn a lot and get a lot out of this class.",
    "This class is an excellent intro to Indian democracy and issues in comparative politics. It requires that you keep up with the readings and participate in class, which I enjoyed. There are no papers, but the exams are very focused on the readings. I definitely recommend the professor!!",
    "Absolutely - if you're interested in democracy or human interaction, this class investigates essential questions in an engaging format. Just be prepared to read a massive amount of interesting material and keep a number of conflicting arguments straight over the course of the semester. Great professor, seminar-format even if it's a lecture.",
    "This course was essentially like a seminar because there were only 10 of us or so. Professor Thachil is great and the material is fascinating. Be warned, though, that your grade only depends on three things: participation, midterm, and final. There are no papers, so you really have to study for the exams."
