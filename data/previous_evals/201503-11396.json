    "Make sure you do the readings, pretty interesting lectures, the workload's not bad at all",
    "You're doing it because you have to, obviously, but it is more fun than it sounds like it will be. Go to all the ethics classes - you'll learn some fascinating stuff about how scientists can act like scum. Also, hearing about other students' research is pretty cool. Oh, and you have to do your own research, but you were probably doing that anyway.",
    "Chem 490 is independent research in chemistry. You are probably taking it because you have to and you get out of it what you put in. Find a professor who does work that interests you and build a good relationship with him\/her as well as others in your lab. There is a also an ethics component of the course where you do some readings and then discuss them which is really chill."
