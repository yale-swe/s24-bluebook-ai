   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn Ancient Greek quickly and easily for reading comprehension. The grammar moves fast, which could be difficult, but is in some ways intuitive and taught in a nice organizational structure.",
    "Greek is a wonderful and incredibly useful language to learn. But beware: not easy. I took Intensive German at Yale before taking this class, and it was pretty darn tough because of the sheer volume of things you need to remember. Well, if possible Greek was just as difficult and it only meets for 1 hour a day, rather than 2 like intensive german (also worth 1.5 credits instead of Int. German's 2).Mostly, that was a convoluted way of saying that you should think of this class as an intensive course even though its billed as a normal L1 language class. I'd only recommend taking at most 4 credits total with this class. You will need to give it almost all of your attention to keep afloat, but if you doyou WILL finish the semester with enough grammatical knowledge to begin reading Plato, etc.",
    "It's a definitely an intensive introduction to the language. The workload is consistently a bit above average, and the you really need to stay with the material to understand it. That said, the pace, while fast, is still manageable and the exams are always reasonable. Take it if you have a strong desire to learn greek.",
    "No nonsense: the basics of Greek grammar in one semester. For those without prior inflected language exposure, a challenge. Making a habit out of drilling and serious studying was something I failed to do . . . and something I think is essential to getting the most out of the course.",
    "Ancient Greek is an extremely challenging class if you have no background in either Greek or Latin. The homework is relatively light, but you will have to do a great deal of extra work to truly master the language. That being said, it's a great language to know; if you're up for the challenge, you should definitely take this course.",
    "This is a very intensive course, and requires a real committment and interest from the student in order to have any degree of success. Unless one is willing to spend 1-2 hours outside of class per day (or more) on learning this language, I would not suggest it. Students with a prior knowledge of Latin (which I lacked) seemed to be better equipped to keep up with the course. However, if one is willing to put in the work required of this fast-paced course, he or she will certainly walk away with a solid grounding in Greek grammar and reading fluency. Only recommended for those serious about classics.",
    "Good introductory course to ancient Greek. It moves at a rigorous pace, but in the end you will have a good grasp on quite a bit of Greek grammar. I would recommend this course.",
    "Good course. Goes quickly but you learn a lot of Greek. There is a vocab quiz every week as well as a test on the previous week's material. With the midterm exams, there were one or two weeks that had three tests (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday). You are also not permitted to miss even one class during the course of the semester which seems a bit unreasonable for an intro language class that meets in the morning Monday-Friday."
