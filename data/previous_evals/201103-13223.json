   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Even though the class wasn't tailored at my exact interests, I think the class is good for everyone to take just because it lays the foundation for so many of the behavioral interventions that are being done in public health. That said, I thought the structure of the course was done a bit oddly, and would have liked to be tested on my knowledge and what we learned in class in other ways besides the concept sheets. In all, the lectures were good and interesting.",
    "This course has three components and they do not link well together. There was a theme each week and readings to go along with it but lecture rarely tied those readings in well. Lecture seemed out of place and was not helpful overall. The group sections were very helpful. My TA was great at bringing the readings and the topic together for great discussion.",
    "Scattered.",
    "The topics were interesting, but I think there was just too much overlap and repetitiveness and it seemed a bit disorganized",
    "Strengths: the coverage is very broad, and provide fundamental knowledge of social and behavioral science in public health. The topics are very interestingweakness: the workload is too much.",
    "The best part of the class was the discussion groups. The weaknesses are that we only do a cursory look at each of the topics, but in a survey course that can't really be avoided.",
    "Strengths: none. Total waste of time. No reason to go to class. SBS is nothing but common sense that all MPH students already possess.",
    "It was a lot of work outside of class that was not as valuable as what we learned in class. The class is also very long. There was a lot of reading that was repetitive and the concept sheet assignments where we have to fit around 8 articles that are very different, into a 2 page paper, was difficult and I don't think I gained that much from doing them. I think allowing us to include fewer of the papers would have been helpful and educational. I liked the lectures, and even though we had a discussion section I would have liked more discussion in the class.",
    "strength:overall understanding of the idea of social behavior science and its relevant theories.the course is very theoretical",
    "The course is well-taught and interesting; I enjoyed the subject matter given that SBS is my chosen division.Strengths:- Dr. Ickovic's experience - she is a great lecturer, and her experience in research and academia lends itself quite well to the course; I particularly enjoyed her integration of her own research into the lectures- Diversity of the material\/subject mattersWeaknesses:- Length: I don't think the lectures need to be as long as they are, and I think decreasing lecture length would improve the course by providing a more focused review of the chosen subjects- Assignments: While I did enjoy the final paper, the media analysis and the op-ed seem a little weak. I think an more interesting option for the media analysis would be the ability to evaluate another type of media (radio, television show, news piece) to understand broader translation of health to the general population; In general I did not enjoy the op-ed assignment, but this was largely personal preference",
    "Ok",
    "good choice of topics, covered a broad range of relevant contemporary issues",
    "Important class, useful concepts, interesting readings, good opportunity to improve writing and analytical skills",
    "so much readings, it is terrible",
    "The weekly course readings were too long, and too redundant. I feel as if I would have benefited much more from reading a couple review articles, as oppose to reading multiple overlapping articles.Additionally, the lectures often addressed many examples of local interventions and studies. As a student interested in global health, I would have enjoyed learning more about global and national examples.Finally, the final paper did not seem to align with any particular skill learned in the class. Other than the week spent learning about literature reviews, no portion of the course specifically addressed grant writing. I feel as if I would have benefited and learned more from a paper that addressed concepts learned in the class.",
    "In general I enjoyed this class, but as someone who comes from a social and behavioral sciences background, I did not feel like I learned a great deal in the class or covered types of materials that I was not already familiar with. This was somewhat frustrating, as I would have liked to have been more challenged by this course. I understand that there are challenges related to creating a core class that is beneficial to students from different backgrounds, so I wish that students with more background in SBS were more encouraged to take a different class to fulfill their core requirement in this area.With regard to the assignments, I really enjoyed doing most of them, particularly the media analysis. I liked that there was some flexibility with the final in order to make it useful for people, but I did not feel as though the material covered in class prepared us to write the final. I felt capable of doing the assignment, but did not feel like I was being tested on m understanding of the material covered in class.",
    "It's a survey course and I think the topics are covered well. I find that the 2 hours a week is not really necessary. The discussion groups were the meat of the course.",
    "This course has an astronomical volume of reading and writing that does not necessarily contribute to our learning. The content is highly repetitive, and a lot of the work feels like work for work's sake. I did not feel that what I gained from the course was proportional to the time I had to invest in the assignments.",
    "The topics covered in the course were very interesting and relevant. However, some of the readings were very lengthly and redundant. I felt rushed to complete all of the readings each week and feel that if there had been fewer I would have spent more time thinking critically about their content.",
    "This is an excellent course. It covers such a wide array of public health topics in a very interdisciplinary and thorough manner. I would like to perhaps reduce the number of concept sheets but expand the assignment to make connections between lectures.",
    "Lectures start to sound the same very quickly. The most beneficial part of this course and the most interesting was the dicussion group. We had a great group and Marie was a phenomenal TA. I think we learned the most by breaking down into smaller groups and discussing things. I actually really like having the op=ed and media assessment as well as ther final porject. I thought all of those assignments were fairly practical and useful. The readings for each week were a bit much. Some diversity in selection or point of view would be better perhaps.",
    "The course included too much material. This was not conducive to true comprehension and appreciation for the presented infomation. It felt like every weekend was dedicated to this course, and other courses fell to the back burner. Would recommend considering decreasing the number of concept papers- 3 rather than 5 should be sufficient.",
    "Overall, i thought the course provided a good overview of many of the health problems we see today and the interactions of social and behavioral factors with these problems. For me, it was a bit too broad and general. i would have like to have known more about the efforts that we were taking to help solve them or at least methods we had tried and why they had not worked. It is necessary to know and understand these problems...but as publich health professionals we are also here to help remedy those problems...and while maybe that is why were are here, as students we also do not quite know the practical or feasible methods of doing so. That would have been nice.",
    "Good course.",
    "The material in this class it not conducive to a lecture format. The lectures were too long. Loved section.",
    "This course was an interesting course, but the attendence to lecture was not very high. The course could be improved if some of the lecture material was being tested on, or had to be used in some assignment. In this way, more students would attend the lecture.",
    "This course was a lot of reading. Reading takes up so much of your time especially so that you are able to have input during discussions.",
    "The course content wise was really god. The topics covered were interesting and it gave a good perspective on how SBS can be used to solve various public health issues Although the work load and the readings were a lot for every week and all the readings couldn't be justified.",
    "This was easily my least-favorite class of the semester, and one of my least-favorite classes I've ever taken. I actually enjoyed our discussion section and my TA was very good, but the class structure was outrageous. Worst of all, I feel like I didn't learn anything useful after taking the class. And just so whoever is reading this doesn't think I'm mad because of my grades, I did perfectly fine in the class.",
    "The set-up of the course was excellent; really liked looking at each component of social and behavioral health and then basing our final papers off of a theory\/integrating health models.Discussion groups were most helpful...really learned a lot from peers and from the TA",
    "Overall, this course was very interesting and provided a broad overview of social and behavioral science research. It was the most time-intensive class out of all my courses. Although many of the assignments were interesting and relevant to the course, there were too many of them.",
    "The course itself is focused towards social and behavioral influences on health, of which there are several; however, as the course progressed, the material became incredibly repetitive. I'm not sure whether or not there are other things to include in regards to the overall course material, but it certainly seemed that the same themes were touched upon over and over throughout the semester, to the point where they began to lose their impact.",
    "Lots of outside reading and paper writing is involved. But, with that said, I definitely learned a lot.",
    "strengths- great course for learning broadly about several different public health issues and introducing different study designs to address these social and behavioral health topicsweaknesses- sometimes too general. I did not think the concept sheets were a great assessment of understanding and knowledgean hour and fifty minutes is too long for a lecture on this material- I think it would be more beneficial, if the class was kept at that length, to have a break or to have more guest lectures, or to break off into section for half of each class.",
    "Strength - interesting topic (as in the course topic)Weakness - the issues brought up in class are repetitive and not really solution based thinking as much as a survey of problems most students or people already encounter in their lives before entering this class. Nothing terribly insightful other than hearing other people's opinions are may\/may not be different.",
    "Overall, this course presented a lot of interesting information and takes on complex issues. Due to the course going through a lot of material, there was a lot of weekly work associated with the class.",
    "Strengths: interesting topics that are valuable to public health knowledge\/background.Weaknesses: Way too much work that wasn't of much value to the overall course and understanding.",
    "I learned a lot from this class. It was a great overview of SBS for public health. Not good for those who know what specialty they like in SBS, but okay for a core requirement.",
    "Evaluating this class is painful. This is the most useless class I have to take at YSPH. I know the professor and the TAs tried to make a big deal about SBS, but sadly, it's all common sense; even the behavioral theories we \"learned\" are merely common daily social phenomenons that sociologists and psychologists decided to put some fancy names after. It is unfortunate that you do not have to attend the class to learn the material. As long as you keep up with current health news, read broadly, and have a basic knowledge of how society functions, you will do fine in this class. The weekly concept sheets were completely waste of time, thank goodness that we were not required to write one every week. I liked the Op-Ed and media analysis assignments; they were the only two times that I had to do some critical thinking for this class. The final paper (grantproposal or literature review) was the only practical paper I wrote. I learned the most from writing this paper. It was a great practice for grant writing if you need money for your research projects.",
    "Weaknesses: Too much readings! The quantity of the readings would not have been a problem if the length of each readings were shorter. A total of 7-8 assigned reading articles each week, with each being equally lengthy, made it tough to keep-up with; especially, when this class was not our only class and priority. Moreover, the two hour lecture on Tuesday was too long!Strengths: Interesting articles and ideas were discussed through readings, lectures and discussion sections. The professor appeared to genuinely care about her students. She visited each discussion sections two times during the semester and offered advises and suggestions about our papers and final proposals.",
    "At first, I enjoyed the survey nature of course lectures as an introduction to a subject I didn't know as much about beforehand. However, the subjects became very redundant as the semester wore on--way too much time spent talking about obesity, in particular. Moreover, in the class, it was repeated over and over again how infectious diseases don't matter any more, our primary concern should be chronic diseases\/obesity (again and again), and as an EMD student I felt alienated by this approach. I would have much preferred consideration to the broad range of interests students taking this Core class will inevitably have, instead delving in to how SBS-type concepts and approaches could be applied to EMD-type problems.One last thing is the final paper: a huge portion of our grade is based on something for which there is no in-class support or instruction in its preparation. Please remember that most students have never done anything like this, so it's your responsibility to give us some guidance if you want it to be a meaningful assignment for us.",
    "Strengths:Overall a pretty engaging lectureSection was always interesting because we usually discussed something that was not directly in the readings or lectureWeaknesses:Concept sheets! They do not help you synthesize the readings, and are just a painful assignment generally.Lecture time - 2 hours is waaaaaaay too long a lecture.",
    "The concept sheets is a great idea however because the course is so focused on chronic diseases, it is extremely difficult to relate the topics to infectious diseases. Many of the assignments I did not find helpful. The media analysis was a good piece to analyze how the public media portrays scientific findings. I found the lectures to not be useful. The only piece of information that was truly useful were the theories utilized for studies.",
    "I LOVED the class, but only because of the material and my discussion section- lecture is brutal and boring. I learned a lot more in discussion than two hours of lecture.",
    "The course itself gave me a good understanding of SBS, but most of the information came from the seminars and the weekly readings. The lectures were not particularly interesting, and if you had actually done the readings, very little new information was provided. The seminars were interesting, fun, and informative.Additionally, the course required an unnecessary amount of time compared to other core courses. The three major papers were fine, as we were given rubrics and examples, but the concept sheets frustrated many of the students.",
    "There was an excessive amount of work in this course. The amount of reading created unrealistic expectations, and I am sure that no one actually read every page of every article. With fewer articles that were more focused this may have been possible.",
    "I was excited to take this course, to start my career at Yale in a subject that I am quite interested in. But this course failed to meet my expectations in almost every way. The syllabus has clearly not been examined in quite some time, as evidenced by the fact that many of the readings assigned in this class were uploaded two or three years ago. Additionally, I believe there is just too much reading. To assign 8 journal articles on the same topic shows an inability to prioritize the important themes. The requirement of writing five concept sheets, in addition to the op-ed, media analysis and final paper is a little excessive. Were the syllabus to be pared down to three concept sheets and a max of 5 or 6 articles each week, the workload for this class would be much more manageable and I imagine you'd have far fewer bitter students. Even more, though, I'm not sure why this is set up as a lecture class at all. The topics are much more interesting when they can be engaged in discussion.",
    "Very interesting, covered a broad range of topics. Although a lot of work, the writing assignments were my favorite!",
    "The content was very interesting, but having class for two hours was tough.",
    "The material of this course provided a good background of the social aspects of public health. The lectures were very well thought out and generally fit well with the readings. The discussion section was very effective to reinforce the material. Weaknesses of the course were a huge time commitment to the readings and papers and inconsistency in grading. This results from evaluations from different teaching fellows.",
    "Course was great for providing an introduction to all different emphases and applications of public health.",
    "Too much workload and sometimes unable to learn some really useful stuff.",
    "The course was good for exploring the various aspects of Social and Behavioral health. Some of the topics were very interesting and was not as \"fluffy\" as I had previously heard from other students. Concept sheets are required assignments that gave me a lot of problems. I did not like the requirement to use all of the readings in the concept sheets.I did like the media analysis and op-ed assignments because they were very realistic applications of theories we learned in class.",
    "I thought this was a very nice survey course of SBS. One of the things that was somewhat frustrating was the amount of small assignments (concept sheets, the editorial), that felt like they had limited bearing on or contribution to our learning. I thought the lectures were fun, and had good information, and I enjoyed and got a lot out of the final project.",
    "The reading materials often overlap in content. Should be more selective.",
    "Useless course. The professor is very full of herself, and spends most of the classtime talking about her own accolades. The readings assigned are not useful a lot of times, and are often redundant. The discussion section was interesting, because it allows students to share different perspectives on SBS issues, but I did not learn one thing in this class.",
    "Prof. Ickovics' presentations were easy to listen to in class. The discussion sessions threw more light into the course material.",
    "Great breadth of information, less compelling classes",
    "I loved the course because I could work on the topics that I liked in each assignment. I also liked that we were allowed to choose which concept sheets we wanted to do or not.One weakness is that some readings tended to be repetitive and that lecture had no relation with all other class assignments.",
    "Strengths: The weekly \"current events\" discussion was interesting and enjoyable. The media analysis and op-ed were good opportunities to explore topics I would not have otherwise learned about. The class structure (1 lecture, 1 discussion section per week) was appropriate for the class.Weaknesses: There were no objective measures for grading. The lecture often went past its designated time. The amount of reading and writing was overwhelming some weeks.",
    "Strengths: great learning through the materials, section\/TF, lectures; very open, supportive and accommodating professor, diverse opportunities to apply what you've learned (op-ed, media analysis, nih grant\/lit review)Weakness\/Downside: takes a lot of time and effort (but in the end well-worth it in my opinion)",
    "The course is interesting but there is way too much work and reading. Some of the readings are repetitive. I wish we would read more interesting articles.",
    "A weakness of the course was that many repetitive\/redundant readings were assigned that provided no additional value to the course or my knowledge base."

    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0WOW. I had heard in the past that she was bad, but now I have proof. Stopped going to class after lecture two. Talk about self absorbed. Made some terrible analogy on September 11th about how the number of deaths attributable to (disease x) is equivalent to 4,000 (or whatever) number of 9\/11 attacks. Totally tasteless. Even made some diagram to show us. Almost walked out.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is an engaging teacher, and is very knowledgable. Even though she wanted us to talk more during class, discussion did not come easily, but I think it would add to the class if that was more built in to every lecture.",

    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Professor Ickovics is very intelligent and well connected. It's great to be in her presence. She tends to get off topic sometimes, I think because 2 hours is a bit long for a lecture course.Also, I find it odd that she's not involved in our grading at all. I don't know if the outcome would be different. It just seems like she wants the course to be personal, but she's not familiar with our work at all. I'm sure it's hard with such a large class.",

    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0The TF's carried a heavy burden of the workload for the course(leading discussion, reading and grading assignments, preparing the powerpoint slides for lecture). I did not get much instruction or guidance from the instructor, and she was unresponsive to student emails. I felt very unprepared to write the final paper (a grant) because of how little it was discussed with the instructor. The lectures also focused heavily on the instructor's own work in New Haven, which is interesting, but I would have liked to hear about other projects in other areas by other investigators. The best lecture was by Marlene Schwartz.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Excellent professor! Enjoyed her enthusiasm and her ability to engage the class on such varying topics.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Cleary intelligent and very interesting. I liked it when she came to our discussion groups more than when she lectured in class because it was easier to discuss the nuances of the material.",

Sometimes it was hard to get in touch with her or have her respond back (which we know all teachers are very busy and have other obligations to the organizations they are involved in and with their research, but it is also a duty to be available to students..and while that is why the tas are here, it is also nice to be able to talk to the source).",

    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0To be honest, I found Dr. Ickovicks to be a pompous instructor. Her teaching style seemed to involve bragging about her research and her children, for some reason. As mentioned earlier, I thought my TA was very good and I actually liked the discussion section, but the lecture was a waste of two hours every week.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is incredibly knowledgable, and gives a lot of guidance to her students. However, the lecture was not incredibly interactive, and may benefit in the future from having students ask questions, present their ideas, etc. in class. Discussion groups were very helpful, and it would be nice if lectures were set up similarly.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is a great lecturer, but sometimes her lectures felt too long.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics obviously is very passionate about the material in the course, which is ideal. She was personable and encouraged discussion in class, which helped facilitate learning. However, during lecture, much of the information presented came from her own experiences and research, which, in my opinion, led to a biased presentation and subsequently, an incomplete examination of all potential course material. Again, with the repetitive nature of much of the material, I believe the message became somewhat lost along the way.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She was a dynamic orator during lecture. However, I disliked how we sometimes had to hear her \"dress rehearse\" her NIH grant proposal during lecture.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She's very enthusiastic about what she teaches and and her TAs do a good job capturing this. However, I think lecture format is wrong for her as she wants an intimate conversation, but tries to do it in lecture setting (which ultimately fails for any teacher). I think focusing on positives of interventions in social disparities is the wrong approach as people are destined to repeat the same failures without having any appreciation for the failures in intervention. I think that we all interventions work in small doses..if we are to believe that either innovation or process of elimination is the key to finding a solution, I think the class should focus on the latter. The former tends to come from a few people who think differently and not necessarily the best way to approach every problem. It's just a thought that if the class was taught with the mind that people are going to come out trying to engage in this exercise of closing the social disparities gap, perhaps a little more case based methodology may help.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Knew her material and was passionate about the topics. Class was a little dry and slow however.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Very knowledgeable professor. Lecture was a little long, but interesting nonetheless.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She is very passionate about the material and a great speaker. Watching her on stage is like watching the Oprah Winfrey show. You just sit back and relax.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Strengths: The professor appeared to genuinely care about her students. She visited each discussion sections two times during the semester and offered advises and suggestions about our papers and final proposals.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Prof.Ickovics was clearly very intelligent and knowledgeable, but as I said, lectures became repetitive over the course of the term. Also, please understand that it is difficult for students to remain engaged in a 2 hour lecture; involving us or at least offering us a brief break would be much appreciated. Additionally, please note that class ends at 11:50. If you would like us to be on time for class, please respect our time and commitments as well and end class on time.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Very engaging lecturer. Very well-informed and helpful when answering questions. When she visited section it tended to not cover as much because she got excited about one tangent - not necessarily a bad thing, but something to keep in mind.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0The lectures were long and drawn out and I felt that I wasn't learning that much more. It could have been made better by discussing more about current events and methods in class (not discussion) versus information that the majority of students already know. This class could be so much better given that the topic is an important one in public health and how we implement changes in communities.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0I really really enjoy Professor Ickovics as a person, but her forte is not giving lectures. The two hours were filled of boring, out of date material, and forced participation. I think she really needs to spend time updating the material and including a wider range of new and interesting topics going on around the world today. She needs to learn how to listen to her students instead of bragging about all of the AMAZING THINGS she has done and is involved in.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0To keep more students interested, Dr. Ickovics needs to add diversity to the concepts covered in class. It seemed like although each week had a different title, the majority of the classes covered the same things (health disparities). Also, it seemed as though many of the lectures were rehearsed. It was very obvious when Dr. Ickovics was answering questions or discussing topics she did not have rehearsed answers to, and those parts of class were always more interesting and well received.Additionally, she does not need a microphone; the class was always too loud.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0I was disappointed by the minimal contributions to the course. She only gave lectures, which people rarely wanted to attend because she presented things in a very uninteresting way and was, in fact, somewhat offensive in how pompously she discussed things, sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics iswell-known around Yale, and rightly so. I am sure her contributions to the community and to public health are unparalleled. However, it's clear that teaching is not one of her priorities. She consistently arrives at class late, she is terrible at answering email and she clearly hasn't revised the syllabus recently, aside from adding a journal article or two. By the end of the semester, Dr. Ickovics still did not know the name of my teaching assistant. She met with all of the teaching assistants every Tuesday morning. A small percentage of people actually attended this lecture, and I imagine that is because many people were turned off by her lecture style and learned, early on, that there was little to be gained by the lecture, and that none of their grades would depend on lecture attendance.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Very knowledgeable and always enthusiastic!",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is passionate about the course material. She prepares the lectures very well. She also attended one or two discussion section for each group. However, I did not get the feeling she was very available outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Instructor was great.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Very dedicated to her work.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0I think Professor Ickovics is a fun lecturer- she pulls in interesting anecdotes, and tries for class participation, which can be hard in a big lecture class. I do think that sometimes she tries to cram too much information into each of the lectures, which already feel very long (especially because we're sitting in Winslow, and many of us are also taking several other long intro lectures in the auditorium).",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Unnecessarily loud during the lecture. Clear explanation of concepts.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Not good.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0I was moved by the aphorisms Prof. Ickovics included in her presentations.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Very passionate and excited, but more deep\/complex curriculum would be great.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She is one of the most engaging professors that I had this semester. She shows how passionate she is about her research and work. She was easily accessible for students and seems genuinely interested in our professional development.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0The instructor was always well-prepared for lecture. I think more lectures with visiting speakers would have been interesting.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics was a great professor. She had engaging, interesting lectures. She was supportive of students' interests and accommodated students' particular pursuits\/ideas.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She is nice but does not seem to have enough time to meet with students.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is a very strong speaker, but she appears more involved in her other endeavors and less dedicated to teaching. Dr. Ickovics is involved very little in all graded aspects of the course."

She did a great job of bringing readings into discussion and engaging us in thoughtful and meaningful conversations. She also came up with great activities. I really enjoyed section, it was a saving grace for this class.",
    "Kristen Gilbert. Awesome TA.",

    "Reuben Ng was my TA, and he was absolutely fabulous. I learned so much from him, not only about Public health and SBS, but about academia, and other things that will be important in the future. He is clearly very smart, is so much fun, and is very helpful when we had questions. He fostered a close group in discussion section, and I feel closer to my classmates because of it, we were also to have great discussions because of this.",
    "TA:KirstenNice TA who is well-prepared for the class, careful in grading the homework, helpful to students and able to give a well-arranged discussion.",
    "Reuben - he is an amazing TA! Not only did he make section fun and interesting, as well as laid back, but he is actually one of the best teachers I've had so far. Particularly his explanation of mediators and moderators - it's a confusing topic, and he did an exemplary job. He also managed to foster a community within our section, which just made the experience that much better. Excellent work all around!",
    "Ok",
    "Reuben- very helpful, good feedback, fair grader",
    "Alex Murphy- She was very enthusiastic, worked hard to make discussion enjoyable, and provided good feedback",
    "good",
    "Alex Murphy served as my Teaching Assistant for this course. She was an excellent TA! She provided wonderful feedback, went out of her way to meet with students, and facilitated great discussion during section.",
    "Erikka was my TA. She was generally good and helpful.",
    "Kirsten was a great discussion leader and pulled the discussion group together well. I found her responses to our papers to be vague.",
    "TA: Reuben NgReuben made discussion section a pleasure. He had a way of making information from the readings very accessible and was able to facilitate a lively section with almost 100% participation. Reuben was knowledgeable, competent and prepared, and has a flair for comedy.",
    "Alex Murphy was a great TA. She kept the discussion focused on the topic at hand while also ensuring that we enjoyed the section. The grading, however, was inconsistent between the TA's for some of the assignments.",
    "Reuben was an excellent TA. He thoroughly discussed coursework in an engaging and fun manner. He always answered questions very clearly and utilized public health lessons in his explanations\/answers. Discussion sessions were fantastic. If possible, I would definitely have Reuben as a TA again. I spoke with other TAs a few times and they were not as welcoming or even approachable for questions.",
    "No other word for it: Marie was phenomenal. She was approachabler, really interesting, clearly prepared, took care in grading assessments, provided valuable feedback, was very timely in email and grading responses, etc. She was great at really shaking up the discussion group so we did different things each day, which was great. She is truly a great TA.",
    "Erikka Loftfield- Absolutely great!. Very knowledgeable and informative. Was able to keep discussion groups going very well. Wisdom well beyond her age.",

    "She is hot.",
    "Rueban was the best, not only is he extremely knowledgeable he is a gifted teacher. He was the best part of this course.",
    "My T.A. was great.",
    "My TA was Erikka. She was a good TA. I enjoyed her input in the course and enjoyed her discussion sections.",
    "My TA was Erikka Loftfeild. She was very well prepared for discussion and put a lot of effort in making our discussions productive. She paid a lot of attention to assignments and gave genuine comments and recommendations which I really appreciated.",
    "My TA was Marie Bragg. I thought she was excellent because we always had a lively discussion each week but we never got bogged down by the material of the course. She would steer the direction of the discussion, but she never hindered it if it went off in a different direction. She also seemed to understand that this class required a ridiculous amount of work and reading, so she never forced us to talk about each individual paper or article during discussion section.",
    "TA Erikka Loftfield - wonderful TA, very concise, helpful, and we really enjoyed learning about SBS topics in our group!! Very willing to help in discussion and outside the classroom while working on final papers, Op\/Eds, etc.",
    "My discussion group with Erikka was one of my favorite parts of the course. She always made the discussions interesting and engaging.",
    "My TA was Marie Bragg. I cannot say enough good things about Marie. She had been a TA for this class before, which I'm sure helped her. She was always very prepared for our discussion sections, kept the group focused, and encouraged opportunities for us to continue learning. Marie was not afraid to have casual, earnest discussions regarding the course material, and at the same time, she was able to assert herself as an instructor and bring the group back to focus if we got off topic. I believe Marie was a fair grader and a very capable TA.",
    "My TA was Marie Bragg. Discussion was by far the most informative part of the class. Marie was outstanding at leading discussion and engaging in interesting topics and letting the students have flexibility in what we wanted to talk about. She was awesome.",
    "My TA was very good at facilitating conversation on the assigned articles. Sometimes the section seemed too structured and I wish that we would have had more time to discuss topics that were controversial or of interest among our discussion group (rather than cruising through all of the articles just for the sake of covering all of them).",
    "Alex was a great TA, I have no complaints...only that I wish that she was my TA for other classes.",
    "My TA, Kirsten, was great. She was very helpful in clarifying confusing concepts and was always very well prepared for class.",
    "TA Reuben Ng was Fabulous! Very engaging and knowledgeable. He treated us with respect and answered all of our questions. By far the best TA I have had so far.",
    "They are all stuck up psych majors (except one) trying to engrave SBS into your brain. It was good to hear what they have to say, but definitely keep a critical mind and have opinion of your own.",
    "Strengths: My TA was Reuben Ng. He was a great TA! During our discussion section, he came up with innovative activities which served to facilitate discussion on the questions that were supposed to be addressed during that week. Our discussion section was great! Although laid-back, the environment allowed everyone to be at ease and to voice their opinions.",
    "My TA was Reuben and he made this class for me--every week, he had creative new activities that challenged us to think in new ways and craft comprehensive and enterprising solutions for complex problems. He was funny and engaging, but his stories (though funny enough for him to be a comedian), always surprised us with their final profundity. Other classes have \"Discussion\" sections, but in others students are typically just asked to rehash the readings; this is the only class I was in this semester where students really, truly discussed. Week after week, I looked forward to Thursday and going to section, and Reuben wass 100% responsible for this. Give this kid a bonus!",
    "Reuben was excellent",
    "Marie is awesome! Very down-to-earth, helpful and sharp.",
    "Erikka Loftfield: Erikka was competent however I felt that she treated her section like primary school students. It was less of a discussion and more of a smaller class. It did improve after midterm evaluations but many of the readings are just not very interesting. It also doesn't help when you haven't learned about concepts in Epidemiology and you are suppose to pinpoint the issues with the papers.",
    "Reuben Ng is simply the best TA out there. I learned so much from him and he really made the class enjoyable. The way he conducted discussion section also helped me a learn a lot about my peers and their expertise in different subjects. He had so many interesting things to teach- HIRE HIM AS A PROFESSOR ASAP!",
    "Erikka was wonderful! She always could answer our questions, was well prepared, and was extremely accommodating. She was a tough grader, but she provided meaningful feedback and was always open to our input as to how the class should be run. Honestly, she was one of the best TA's I've had.",
    "Kirsten GilbertFrom what I heard from other students in the course, she was the most intense and dedicated to the course. Early on I found this frustrating, because while my classmates in other sections were given particular articles to \"focus on\" (i.e. only read a couple if not doing a concept sheet), I was expected to be able to talk intelligently about all of them. However, I appreciated this enthusiasm later in the semester (after I started doing concept sheets), as it helped me get as much as I could out of the course. All in all, I thought she served as an excellent TF.",
    "Bright spot in this class, for me, was our discussion section. My TA, Kirsten Gilbert, did a good job fostering discussion. She clearly put a lot of effort into helping us grasp topics that were glossed over in lecture. I was even more impressed when I learned that, at her request, we would have someone observe our class one day because she wanted tips to improve her teaching skills. I imagine she'll be a great clinical psychologist, but I also have confidence that she'll be able to turn that expertise into being an effective teacher, as well.",
    "TA was the best part of this class. Very interesting, as well as knowledgeable! Loved his stories!",
    "Kirsten was always organized and worked very hard to get everyone to participate.",
    "The teaching assistant was very well-organized and prepared for every discussion section. She really facilitated our understanding of the materialand put a lot of effort into her position. Her grading was not very consistent but I believe her intentions were to be fair.",
    "Alex was a wonderful, patient TA that I really appreciated. I would have liked more feedback as to what was lacking in my papers rather than the seemingly abbreviated comments we got back.",
    "TA is so nice and very responsible.",
    "TA: Marie BraggsMarie was an excellent TA. She was concerned with students well-being in the course and often asked for our feedback. She also made the class fun and engaging and provided feedback for us promptly.",
    "Marie was AMAZING. I think she did a great job balancing participation and forcing people to talk, and she was reallygood at keeping people respectful of each other. She was really friendly (she brought us cake!) and seemed like a fair grader.",
    "Patient and diligent. Thought-inspiring",
    "Very easy to ask questions and helpful regarding class material and MPH coursework in general. Best part about this class.",
    "The TA was very lively and led the discussion sessions in a very illuminating manner.",
    "Kirsten Gilbert was excellent in all ways.",
    "Kirsten Gilbert was my TA. I really liked her. She was very accessible to students and was able to answer all my questions during office hours. She genuinely tried to make sections more fun and varied. She was also a very good discussion lead because she got all of us talking each week. She was also open to criticism from students.",
    "Reuben NgReuben did a great job to engage our discussion group. I looked forward to his class every week and am incredibly grateful to have had him as my TA. He was very prepared and tried different types of group activities. He was very resourceful and approachable.",
    "Reuben Ng was an fantastic teaching fellow. He really made learning the material fun and I learned so much during our sessions. It was the class that I looked forward to each week. We had a great group dynamic and I think this started from Reuben and spread to all of us.",
    "The TA was nice but her grading was too strict.",
    "Reuben Ng was an absolutely fantastic TA. Mr. Ng utilized innovative teaching methods to engage the discussion section in lively debates and discussions."

    "This course was a lot of reading and writing. The components of the course are not well-linked and lectures often seemed unrelated to readings we had done. The professor was okay, but could use some improvement. The TAs were the best part of this course.",
    "A lot of reading and writing for little credit. Learned some.",
    "I do not recommend it to the first year students, especially international students. The workload is too heavy. But if you are very interested in the social and behavioral science, this course is very helpful.",
    "It was a required course for me, and while it was a lot of work (papers, reading) it did offer a brief overview of many social and behavioral topics and I took a lot from the course. I would recommend it.",
    "One word: terrible.",
    "It's a lot of work. It will probably dominate your workload, even though you may feel that you get more out of assignments for other classes. It is interesting though and the topics covered are useful for all disciplines. It will give you a well rounded perspective, which will be useful in the future.",
    "i would advice him to take it after adjusting to the environment at YALE especially for students whose native language is not English.",
    "Ok",
    "The course was interesting but much more work than the others I took. Unless a student were particularly interested in social and behavioral sciences then no, I would not recommend it.",
    "a lot of readings, and lots of papers we should complete, and the criteria was not posed on time, so that I losted many credits on one of those papers.In discussion group, at the end of this section, we all have no word to chat, so I think it is not interesting course.",
    "This course very broadly covers the social and behavioral influences on physical and mental health. The instructor incorporates information and data from many areas within the field of public health. The workload is fairly heavy in terms of readings and writing assignment. I would not recommend this course to someone who has a background in SBS.",
    "It's okay. It's quite a lot of reading, a lot of which I felt was given to us just for the sake of having work.",
    "This course benefits from interesting material presented by dynamic, engaging instructors that make both lecture and discussion section a pleasure, but the amount of reading and writing is so time consuming that it detracts from the experience.",
    "I would say it is a lot of work, but you definitely learn about some important and interesting public health topics. A lot of students did not go to lecutre (I did go to all of them) because they felt they didn't get anything out of them. A lot of students also did not do the assigned reading even when we had to write a paper on them (it was easy to pick out importnat points from the abstracts). I really enjoyed the topics the course covered and a lot of the readings.",
    "Great course to take! Covers various public health topics and is good course for practicing critical thinking of public health concepts\/skills.",
    "I think this course is what you make of it. You have the potential to learn a lot about SBS in PH and the opportunity to gain valuable skills if you really take advangtage of the assessments provided.",
    "Would not have taken because of the disproportionate workload compared to other classes. Discussion groups were great (TA led).",
    "This course gives you a broad survey of health problems in the United States and the interconnectedness of these issues with social and behavioral issues. While great at an introduction to these issues, it does not help provide potential solutions or efforts we are taking. Furthermore, I know some people wanted a more global perspective, but this course focuses on US problems. While interesting, this course is very time consuming (perhaps one of the most). It involves a significant amount of outside readings and is very writing intensive.",
    "It's required.",
    "This course provides a general overview of the social and behavioral foundations of health. This class should be a required course for each public health student as it is so important to understand how these social factors influence life or individuals.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow student who loves writing. It has a lot of reading an writing. The course is interesting but at times it gets there is to much work load by this course compared to others. It gives a great overview about the subject of SBS but by highlighting public health issues. Basics or theory of the subject is not covered in that much detail",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone. I know it's a core class but if I was talking to an incoming student I would tell them to wait and take the other SBS class the following semester.",
    "SBS is a quintessential course for understanding the scope of Public Health - however, students may benefit in the future from revision of lecture structure (i.e. less like a presentation, more interactive). With improvements, would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "I would recommend this class, but I would warn students that it is very time-consuming.",
    "I believe that, compared to other courses, this course had some significant weaknesses. The amount of reading expected on a weekly basis (anywhere between 6 and 8 articles\/book chapters\/books) was borderline absurd given that students have 4 or 5 other classes requiring equal attention. Conversely, there was practically no incentive to go to lecture on Tuesdays as there were no consequences for not showing up and none of our grade was reflected by lecture attendance.I would probably not recommend this course to another student, as the workload is much more than should be expected. The number of papers assigned - 8 - was not outrageous, but the amount of reading mandated was quite extraordinary.",
    "Be ready to know going in you will have to devote a good amount of time. But, you can get a lot out of the class if you allow for it.",
    "I would probably not recommend this class because a lot of the conclusion are common sense and no real insight will prove otherwise unless the class focuses on failures that could lead to solutions.",
    "Despite the good information, this class was most often fairly hard to sit through. The work load was also a lot and tedious. Can't say that I would recommend it but can't say that I wouldn't. In the middle.",
    "Very writing intensive and many papers to read. I would advise to do the concept sheets early so that later on in the semester you can focus on the other assignments.",
    "I would not recommend this class for people not in the SBS division. Unfortunately, the two SBS options are very similar, you might as well just take this class and get over with it fast.",
    "If a student is planning to apply for a DOWN's fellowship or any fellowships or grants for his\/her summer internship project, then this class would be helpful. As a final project for this class, one was expected to write a grant\/fellowship proposal. Therefore, if a student elected to take this class, it will allow him\/her to \"kill two birds with one stone\"--fulfill the general public health requirement and to complete a proposal that could be submitted to perspective review committees.",
    "It's a Core class; I don't know what the other SBS class is like, but this is a fine one to fulfill the requirement. It's a lot of work and lectures are sometimes interesting, sometimes not. If you're lucky, you'll get an awesome TA and he'll transform your experience.",
    "You probably have to take this course, but it's pretty interesting(even for an EMD kid like me!) once you give it a shot. Concept sheets will be unpleasant - do them early.",
    "Based on the amount of reading and writing I would not recommend a student to take this course unless they are big into reading and writing and that they should take the other required SBS course in the spring. This course gave me a lot of anxiety despite doing fairly well in the course.Also, it is misleading when Dr. Ickovic states that the final grant paper can be formatted as the Downs since her requirements for the grant extend beyond what the Downs fellowship looks for.",
    "A lot of work. Boring lectures. Quite possibly the best discussion section I will ever have in my life.",
    "It's a lot of work. Many of the concepts discussed are mostly intuitive, but you get as much out of the course as you put into it.",
    "This class is split into one lecture a week and one discussion a week. There is a great deal of reading, and a great deal of writing. Verry little learned. I'd recommend they take the other SBS course offering with Dr. Lewis instead.",
    "Yes, especially if someone wants to improve their writing skills and know about a variety of health issues and how they tie into social and behavioral aspects.",
    "I would recommend this course with a caution about the time commitment it entails. The course covers the social and behavioral issues in public health. Students receive a good understanding of domestic health disparities. The readings and papers do require a lot of hours and thought which can be difficult to balance with the other classes.",
    "This course is a fantastic way to sample the many different areas that public health can be applied and is relevant to. It is a wonderful introductory class into the field of public health.",
    "Would not recommend.",
    "I took this course becauseit was required. Although there were some assignments I found to be difficult (having to use all the readings in concept sheets), it was enjoyable. I especially liked the flexibility of Jeanette and the TAs in terms of the format of the final project. I was able to take this opportunity to explore a different aspect of a larger project I was working on at the time.",
    "This course is a good overview of SBS stuff- I think everyone should take it, especially because this type of information and thinking is often ignored in a lot of the other classes that people might take.",
    "Don't take the class with Ickovics. Nonsensical work, and you won't learn nearly anything. Wait to take the other SBS class that fulfills the SBS requirement.",
    "Yes, but I would ask the student to prepare to do lots of readings.",
    "Very introductory - not all students should have to take this or the other soc intro course.",
    "I would recommend it. A lot of MPH students are mostly focused on \"pure science\" and tend to be really critical of the social sciences. However, every public health professional needs to understand the general context where illnesses take place. This was a very good introductory course for students that have no background in the social sciences. This is also a good course to polish your writing skills since other courses are not concerned with this.",
    "This course provides exposure to a variety of public health topics and related articles. The amount of reading and writing required for the course was very challenging some weeks. I would recommend this class to someone who is comfortable with the heavy workload and who is interested in learning very broadly about many health-related topics.",
    "SBS is a great class. I recommended it. Be prepared though for the amount of work. There are 9 paper assignments due. If you plan out well, it will be easier. Regardless, it'll take a lot of work and preparation but I would say it's worth it.",
    "Be prepared for a lot of readings, some of the readings is super boring.",
    "The course was a strong introduction to social and behavioral influences on health."
