   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student interested in business power, regardless of the discipline in which the individual is studying. The course is great in that its subject is at a crossroads of the social sciences.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "This was a seminar course in which we discussed the different ways that business and politics interact and influence each other through the lens of different political science theory and research.I would recommend the course, but I would caution them on the amount of reading required and the benefits of having more background on the topic.",
    "I would recommend the course to anybody interested in how business acts in the political sphere. The literature is very limited, through no fault of the course, but that leaves a lot of room for independent critical thinking.",
    "Wholeheartedly recommend the course if the student has substantive interests that overlap with the course syllabus."

   "comments": [
    "This course was my first foray into political science and as such was quite challenging. However, it was extremely useful in providing new way of understanding the policy making process and in examining the role different players have in the process. I particularly appreciated the knowledge I gained of some of the history of how power has played out in different political struggles. I definitely learned a lot from this course.",
    "It gave me something to think about, to be sure."
