   "comments": [
    "The course is a lot of work for a seminar, as it is a book a week, and a four hour time commitment. However, it was definitely one of the more interesting classes that I have taken at Yale, with a diverse group of students. It was interesting to have three professors at once - sometimes it made logistics interesting, but mostly we benefited from it. As someone with no background in environmental studies, I was pleasantly surprised at how well many of the topics fit in with other things I have studied in politics and history. The different perspective enriched my understanding of class, the state, social movements, etc.",
    "A series of somewhat disconnected discussions\/studies of issues pertaining to agrarian societies, with focus heavily on modern concerns. I would recommend this course to other students for the breadth of information and methodological approaches contained in the readings."
