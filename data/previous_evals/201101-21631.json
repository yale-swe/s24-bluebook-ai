   "comments": [
    "This class was really fascinating, it is essentially an overview of prof. Kyriakides research. It is largely a biology class but does help you get a better perspective on research since a lot of the material covers specific research approaches. The material is also just fascinating.It's one of the better BME classes, just in terms of how much you learn. A lot of the other classes in BME really let you down in giving you an in depth look at the topic they're covering.",
    "Very good course. Interesting and cutting-edge information. It was unlike any other class I've taken at Yale so far, I found the material very interesting and the workload pretty minimal.",
    "This class is a great way to learn about the foreign body response and also what research has been done to modify it and improve biomaterial implantation. I found the class very interesting and highly recommend it. The class consists of an open note mid-term and final and the final is not accumulative. You also are asked to do a 5 page paper on a current clinical implant, which isn't too bad and can be interesting. Take it!",
    "Very interesting class about biomaterial and tissue interactions. Learn about novel devices and their effects on tissues.",
    "Take it. It is really what upper level bio courses are all about. So much better than an intro lecture course and makes me really excited to take more higher level courses.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to anyone interested in how the body responds to foreign objects such as implants.The class stayed on topic well and the lectures tended to flow well. There's some jargon, but not as much as an immunology class.",
    "Yes. Take it.",
    "This class was extremely interesting. The material made me confirm my doubts about the Biomedical Engineering major at Yale.The biggest disadvantage is that we don't have a textbook, and that the Powerpoint slides don't have too much textual information, so sometimes you miss details in your notes, and those details may appear on the midterm and on the final.",
    "Though this class is about a very specific aspect of bioengineering, it was extremely interesting and definitely worthwhile. Lecture can be a little difficult to follow at first, but once you get used to the terminology and reading papers, it becomes much easier. Studying for the exams made the material really come together and even made me want to do research in the field. Professor Kyriakides is great! Definitely take this class as one of your engineering electives.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "An excellent class with an excellent professor. You'll learn quite a bit about the cutting-edge research in the foreign body response. Make sure that you're interested in learning the material - the exams are open-book, which means that there is little incentive except personal interest to try to learn anything in the course, and that there's nothing but your interest pushing you to get anything out of the course.",
    "This course contains highly relevant information for not only engineering majors, but biology majors as well. The Professor is a wonderful lecturer, the work load is manageable, and you learn a lot from the course. This has been one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and you shouldn't graduate without taking it.",
    "Absolutely - Especially if you are looking for a BME elective.",
    "Great course for Bio or BME or MB&B majors. Provides a great, practical perspective on biology that takes you out of mere memorization of different systems towards a whole new system of biological thought.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student interested in biomaterials. It is a useful and interesting course that helps students prepare for future work or study in the field of biomaterials and MCDB.",
    "Yes. Take it."
