   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I reinforced a lot of skills in this lab which I learned in my own independent research in the Yale BME department. It was cool to have a lab class where I felt already familiar with some of the material and to know that the techniques we were learning are actually applicable in current research that is happening at Yale right now.",
    "This class covers experimental techniques in biomedical research, including NMR, CT, flow cytometry, tissue culture, and polymer design. You don't gain a whole lot of skill in practicing these techniques (how much NMR do you really expect to learn in four hours?), but you get a strong knowledge of the theory behind them which can come in handy in the future.",
    "I didn't learn too much from this class, unfortunately. There were a few lectures but the lecture slides were often not posted or were posted very late (right before a deadline). Most of the material I learned was from looking on the internet myself.",
    "I learned a great deal about drug delivery and imaging.",
    "I learned how to use outside resources to research material.",
    "I learned that the Biomedical Engineering lab course is extremely disorganized and a complete joke.",
    "Learned about NMR, CT, nanoparticle fabrication, general principles of nanoparticle drug delivery.",
    "I learned about the basics of how biomaterials are made and what they can be used for, how MRI scanning works, and how CT scanning works.",
    "I was so excited to take this course initially. Especially as someone on the biomolecular track, the idea of atually being able to create and use our own nanoparticles was exciting as wellas practical. However in the end, I know just as little about any imaging or biomolecular techniques as I did before. The class was incredibly disorganized, poorly taught, and we never received our lab reports back in time in order to make corrections.",
    "Really, I didn't develop any knowledge, skills, or insights, except now I know that a group of twenty intelligent, well meaning students can gather with a kind and talented teaching fellow for 3 hours a week and still learn nothing because of a professor who sabotaged this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Disorganized",
    "Strengths: This material is actually really cool and I was excited to learn about it all. Weaknesses: Organization. Professor Fahmy is an incredibly nice guy, but the class truly isn't structured well. I actually fell into a nice routine by just treating our head TA as the professor. This worked great until he could not get a hold of Fahmy and then we all kind of stalled.",
    "The biggest weakness of the course is its level of organization. Communication between students and Prof. Fahmy is very difficult (nonexistent?)even members of Fahmy's own lab have trouble reaching him. You might also get TF's who decide to reschedule a four-hour lab session to reading period without consulting you first. This is one of those courses that you take aggressively. That being said, the course material is pretty interesting. I found myself thinking about it outside of lab, and if you take the lack of guidance that some TF's provide you with a grain of optimism, it can be rather fun to design your own data analysis protocols (although you'll never find out if what you did was correct).",
    "Organization was abysmal.",
    "Weaknesses: Although we were able to use interesting equipment in the course, since most of the equipment was super expensive, we were not actually allowed to handle the equipment ourselves. For a couple of the labs, there were people in my lab group that did nothing at all and sometimes I would only pipette once in two weeks. I felt like this course was very geared toward people who want to do wet lab work in the future; as this is not the case for a lot of BME majors, I would recommend making this class not required. Another major weakness of the course was organization--communication was poor between TAs and the professor and the professor would frequently not respond to emails. Strengths: TAs",
    "The content of the course is very interesting and I enjoyed the continuity between the modules. However, Professor Fahmy could have done a better job of administering the course.",
    "The professor was late or not present.",
    "This class is incredibly poorly organized. While in theory the topics covered are interesting the students are not really able to engage with them. In two separate lab modules the students sat around a computer while a TA manipulated data. Strengths: Sean Bickerton. He is superb.",
    "This course was very poorly organized. For the first few weeks it was only lecture and no labs, and to those lectures our professor was almost always at least 30 minutes late, among other issues. After we actually started the labs, our professor was never present. Many last minute scheduling changes were made, largely at the expense of the students.",
    "The TA's were the only strength of this course. Sean especially, since he organized everything and was the main point of contact. Prof Fahmy was very disorganized, always came late, didn't have the labs set up (ie Sean had to go upstairs to get things because we realized the lab didn't have pipettes, etc)",
    "Strengths: It has potential to be a good course. The labs were interesting and the reports were hard but manageable. The TAs were great and very helpful. Weakness: Please just get a new professor. Professor Fahmy does not take his job seriously and made this course so disorganized. Just get someone who can upload protocols to classesv2, answer emails, and not forget about the final presentation they scheduled. The baseline expectations from a course instructor were not met.",
    "This course was a little bit disorganized (updated lab reports being assigned ~7 days after the actual lab, inability to contact professor, etc.), but overall had a really nice progression in terms of how the different modules interacted with each other. So the content was great. The only thing is that I feel like I learned 99% of the material doing the lab reports and it would have been nice to have a stronger pre-lab portion. Perhaps quizzes? Additionally, I give it my strongest recommendation that future lab reports are not group assignments. This, at least for me, resulted in a great disparity between the quantity and quality of work done by different individuals.",
    "This was pretty poorly planned, thank God for Sean (the TA) otherwise this would ave been an unbearable course.",
    "Incredibly disorganized and pretty tedious lab reports. The modules got re-scheduled and we ended up having to turn in a lab report during reading period.",
    "It is very disorganized. Professor Fahmy isn't around very much, so the TAs do a great job otherwise.",
    "This course was, from start to finish, a neverending logistical nightmare.",
    "Some of the TFs in the course were amazing and the labs were well designed and interesting, but all of it was much harder to appreciate with Professor Fahmy being so incredibly unresponsive and disengaged. It was very obvious that he did not want to be teaching this course and that he did not care about the class, which made it hard for any of us to want to invest any energy in our work. That was particularly disappointing because the lab material was interesting, but Fahmy's lack of effort made the whole class a joke. Professor Fahmy should either put more effort into the course or not teach it.",
    "By far the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. The professor was consistently an hour or more late, or would cancel class ten minutes before its start time. He never posted assignments or readings, never responded to his email and seemed ill informed about all the techniques we were learning. The only strength about this class was the teaching assistant Sean who really went above and beyond to try to coordinate the entire lab. I ended up spending hours and hour and hours on lab reports due to a lack of adequate lecture, or the availability of the information regarding the lab, such as background readings and protocols",
    "It could be improved by removing Professor Fahmy. He essentially hobbled the TFs, who tried hard to make the course work, but could do little with a professor who insisted on micromanaging everything and yet was impossible to contact. The experiments were also far too ambitious. I don't think we learned much from the NMR and CT labs because we were not given reading materials or procedures until the last minute. The biomaterials modules were more accessible, if only because Sean is one of the best TFs at the university and he worked his ass off. There was almost no feedback given to students during the semester. The highlights of the course were the TFs (especially Sean), and the CT lecture from the professors in the medical school. Everything else was tragic."

   "comments": [
    "There are a few important points you need before taking this class. 1) Yes, I would really only take it if its for the BME major 2) You're going to read all the other reviews and think that nothing could be worse than taking this class. I think the class was fine if you just approach it with a different mindset from most of your classes. That being said... 3) Yes, this class is disorganized. Yes, you won't see much of the professor. However, you've read these reviews and you can now be prepared for that. So, my recommendation would be to go into this class expecting to be very disorganized if Fahmy is still teaching it. If you go in expecting chaos, then you really won't be surprised once you get into the class itself. 4) A lot of this material is really cool and is really applicable to current research being done in the Yale BME department and BME in general. The lectures are dry, but try to actually understand what's going on in the lab modules because that's the cool stuff. 5) Professor Fahmy is a super nice guy. He is not organized and that clouds a lot of people's opinions of him, but he is a really cool person and easy to talk to if you ever find yourself with a chance to speak with him. 6) Your TAs will be your best friends in this course. I think most of our class just started to treat our main TA as the professor and he stepped up to the plate and helped us with almost all the questions we had. tldr; This class is chaos and can be a pain when it doesn't run smoothly, but if you go into it ready for things to be a little crazy then you can get things out of it. This is not the worst thing to happen to you, you will survive just fine.",
    "Alright, here we go. This is everyone's favorite class to complain about. It's actually a pretty interesting experiment in human psychology in its own right. If you want to experience firsthand how horrible Yale students can become, take this class. And wear the appropriate personal protective equipment. Yes, the course is disorganized. Yes, you'll see Fahmy once at the beginning of the semester and he'll promise to come back every week and you'll never see him again. Yes, you'll be told that part of your lab involves figuring out how to process data that you've never seen before using software that you've never used before as a learning exercise and you'll never get feedback on it. And yes, these things are frustrating. But nothing about this course is more frustrating than watching other students complain about how much they dislike the class. It becomes a competition. \"Hey,\" a student says, \"who can come up with the most insulting thing to say about this lab?\" And off we go. The truth is, this lab is fine. Probably 80% of the negative things you hear about it will be coming from self-entitled morons who think they should have science handed to them on one of those fancy Yale College plates they use at freshman dinner. An unfortunate fact is that science can be disorganized and unclear and a logistical nightmare. Whether you like it or not, you'll just have to deal with that and find scientific problems that you're passionate about despite these challenges. This lab is a good way to find out if science is what actually drives you (or if you're more driven by snapchats and anger and saying stupid things). You do need to be pretty forthcoming in the way you deal with TF's in order to have enough clarity to carry out the experiments, but that can simply be a question of sending a couple of emails and asking for deadline extensions. News flash: insults won't help you figure out how to process that data. So go into this lab aggressively and passionately. You might just learn a thing or two that'll get you excited. If you don't feel like doing that, forget about it (and consider switching majors).",
    "Definitely not! This class made me want to quit being a STEM major and I think I regressed a bit mentally. Halfway through the course (before the drop deadline), I contemplated completely dropping the BME major so that I would not need to take the course.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I think there are better and more efficient ways of learning about drug delivery and imaging.",
    "It's a requirement for BENG undergrad. That's the only reason to take it.",
    "If you're taking this class it's because you have to. It's pretty low workload so it's not that bad but it is so incredibly organized you will find that you often have no idea what's going on and neither will the professor. The entire workload boils down to 4 lab reports.",
    "I would never recommend this course to anyone. Sadly it is a required course for BME so there isn't really any choice about it.",
    "DON'T EVER TAKE THIS CLASS! I mean you probably have to because BME... but it sucks so much. Sean (TA) is the only good thing about it. The content would be pretty cool if the lab was organized and actually run correctly, but as is, it just sucks having to take this course.",
    "ABSOLUTLEY terrible. Professor Fahmy treated this class like a complete joke. PLEASE PLEASE get someone else to teach this course. Year after year the reviews for this course are terrible and nobody bothers to do anything about it. If the Biomedical Engineering Department wants to take itself seriously, this class needs a new professor. This class is a mess. It is seriously disorganized and very frustrating for students because we want to have a legitimate lab course but the class is such a joke. The protocols for the lab are posted after the lab is completed. The TAs ask us whether we have any idea what we are doing and it turns out that Professor Fahmy has not bothered to upload the procedures for us to read. Most of the protocols ended up never being posted and the TAs had to email it to us themselves (after we \"completed\" the lab). The lab room is poorly set up. No one makes sure that we have all the necessary materials to even do the lab. For example, there is one single pipet in the entire lab for biomedical engineering. For every single lab, the TAs have to walk us through the entire thing step by step because we didn't have the procedure and many times the protocol is adapted because we didn't have all the materials\/equipment to even do it. I did not see Professor Fahmy at all after February. He just left the TAs to handle everything in the class. We didn't even have the final presentations. It was on the schedule during finals period, but Fahmy completely dropped off the map and 1) didn't tell us when\/where it was and 2) gave us no instructions for the final presentation. He literally just forgot about the final for the class that was supposed to be a large percentage of our grade without telling us!!! This is unheard of and completely unacceptable.",
    "Probably what everyone else is saying too.. Don't take if not BME.",
    "Not at all. The subject matter is pretty cool, but for a few of the labs we didn't eve actually do anything (CT and to a lesser extent NMR)so I felt like the whole purpose of a lab course, to be hands on and practical, was completely lacking. Also, the amount of information required to complete the lab reports didn't always match up with what we actually did in lab, or what any of us had previously learned, so a lot of times it felt like we were just winging it as we went along, not actually learning anything.",
    "Only take if you absolutely have to. The professor should be changed, it shouldn't be someone as disorganized as Fahmy.",
    "This course is only recommendable because it's required. I do not exaggerate when I say that it is perhaps the single most poorly run class at Yale.",
    "I would 100% not recommend this course to anyone not in the BME major, unless there is a different professor teaching it. Our TFs were wonderful and did their best to make up for our absentee professor, but they were not given the resources to make the class as good and as useful as it was designed to be. The labs were interesting, but did not make up for the stress of having to deal with such a disorganized professor. Do not take this class if Professor Fahmy is teaching it.",
    "unfortunately this class is required for BME majors but honestly if it wasn't i would tell everyone to stay as far away from it as possible",
    "This course has earned it's score as the worst at the university. Prof. Fahmy should never be allowed to teach undergraduates again. You will spend hours every week confused about what you should be doing because no one knows the plan for the course, including Fahmy. Everything was done last minute, which made for a stressful final month of the semester. You will get no feedback until your final grade. All I learned from this course is that a group of twenty well-meaning students can gather with a kind and talented teaching fellow for 3 hours a week and still learn nothing because Fahmy is so good at sabotaging his own class. I think it's a disgrace that students at any university would be subjected to a class like this. It reflects poorly on the entire biomedical engineering department that they have allowed him to teach this course for three years with consistently bad reviews."
