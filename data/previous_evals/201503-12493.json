    "Good class. Heavy work load, but you learn a lot.",
    "SPAN 120 is an introductory Spanish course that covers a limited range of vocabulary of the textbook \"Aventuras\" and covers writing, listening, and speaking of the Spanish language at a basic-intermediate level. I would hugely recommend this course to a student wanting to learn or continue learning Spanish. The exposure to the breadth of the course will not only prepare him or her for the Yale Spanish sequence, but also prepare him or her for, more importantly, the language's simple application in today's Spanish-speaking societies.",
    "This is a Spanish course where you need some background in the language, but by no means do you have to be an expert. Yes, especially because of Pilar. She is the main reason for recommending the class beyond just wanting to learn the language.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 120 02 to any other student with a commitment to learning the Spanish language. The daily workload is notable, and the written exams are challenging, so students who enroll in this course must dedicate themselves to regularly studying the material in order to do very well in the course. In my own experience, it was very difficult to raise my class grade above the A- level because there were always enough difficult questions on the written exams such that my exam grades all landed in the A- range. Thus, for all students who expect an A in this course, I recommend that they concentrate a great amount of effort and focus on preparing for the written exams and also for the small quizzes.",
    "Straightforward useful for improving Spanish. I'd recommend to anyone who wants to acquaint self with the language",
    "A fairly easy course with too much busywork; however, I would still recommend it as a good Spanish course because of the amount of speaking that is done in class.",
    "If you have the opportunity, I highly encourage taking the class with Profesora Asensio-Manrique. She is a stellar professor.",
    "Harder than 110- what you would expect for an entry-level language class. That is, lots of repetitive, every day work. But... my Spanish did improve a lot."
