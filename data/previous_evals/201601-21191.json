    "Yes -- not sure how the final will be, but the mid term was very easy. Shankar is awesome but is disorganized.",
    "It's maybe more difficult and more in depth than is worth a non-physics major, and I think physics majors need the harder class for preperation. This is a wierd class, recommended mostly to math majors who want a BS and the like. It does it's job well though, in my opinion.",
    "I would definitely recommend PHYS 402 to a student of the sciences who has an interest in physics. I don't think it's necessarily the best course to take if you want to major in physics, but it offers a fairly comprehensive and understandable introduction to the subject.",
    "This class focuses on Stat Mech and Electricity\/Magnetism. Professor Shankar is definitely helpful if you go to office hours, but if you learn best when lectures are well-organized and deliberate, I would try not to take this class with Professor Shankar.",
    "PHYS 402 is a difficult class, you will have to go over the material a lot outside of class to make sure that you understand it. Shankar is a great lecturer and makes the class enjoyable. Stat mech can be very challenging and annoying, thankfully it's only the first few weeks of the course. Having taken Diff eq before helped a little bit for this course.",
    "Solid class, not the most mathematically rigorous if you are looking for more theoretical background and are willing to invest yourself more. Otherwise, it's a good jigher level science class without too much work if you need the BS in math.",
    "Amazing professor, amazing course, I just needed to study more. You cannot get buy with just doing the problem sets - read the textbook EXTENSIVELY, do lots of extra problems, and then you'll get your grade."
