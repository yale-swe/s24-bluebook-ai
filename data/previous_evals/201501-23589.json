    "Instructor: Marlyse Corallo Duguid \u00a0She was a great botany resource, and ran super helpful review sessions.",
    "Instructor: Marlyse Corallo Duguid \u00a0Not only does she know her plants, but she was also more than willing to help out with any questions. I felt comfortable approaching her with dumb questions and she always answered them with no judgement. Marlyse is the best!",
    "Instructor: Marlyse Corallo Duguid \u00a0Friendly, knowledgeable, very efficient and gave great advice.",

    "This course is essential for students interested in tropical biology and botany.",
    "It would have been great to do one or two of the class sessions at the New York Botanical Garden.",
    "A terrific class that I would recommend to anyone working in the tropics. Though I wont be working directly with plants, being able to identify things will help me with my community forestry work. I went from knowing absolutely nothing about botany to being pretty comfortable working with and identifying plants. I didn't think it was possible, but sometime I learned quite a lot. The field trip was a great great asset. Being able to think botany and have the repetition of identifying plants everyday was a great help."

We looked at 3 distinct ecosystems and learned about the families of plants that occur in those environments. It also was a perfect opportunity to really gain experience with and knowledge about tropical plant identification.",
    "The professors and the field trip. A great learning experience!",

I don't know if that would be feasible, but thats what I enjoyed most about the field trip, having the plant in my hand while the characteristics of the plant were described.",

I did take silviculture with Dr. Ashton and this is a great complement to that. Having this knowledge will allow me to integrate into communities quicker because I will have some knowledge of the flora and fauna around me, always a good thing in rural areas!",
