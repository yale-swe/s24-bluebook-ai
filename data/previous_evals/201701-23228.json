    "This course was invaluable to me in giving me a way to learn about Asian American history that is so often overlooked and ignored by regular history curriculum. I am positive that this will be one of the most important classes I take in my Yale career. Understanding Asian American history is important not just for Asian American students, but for anyone with an investment in creating a better world and better understanding racial history and racial injustices.",
    "A comprehensive survey of Asian American history, migration history, and aspects of U.S. history. Some attention to development of historical skills e.g. oral history, primary source analysis",
    "I developed a much better understanding of what the history of Asian Americans has been and the differences between the histories of different groups of Asian Americans. I started out with next to no knowledge of this subject so it's been a lot of growth!",
    "I learned about the often-ignored history of Asians in America. I drew parallels between their experience and those of other minorities, and watched Asian American identities form against the backdrop of American history.",
    "Great course! This history is so under taught, that is class is incredibly necessary.",
    "This was my first Asian American history class and was a great overview of key topics that I might study in more depth in future classes.",
    "I learned the historical, social, and cultural movements that define the place of the Asian American in American society. I have gained a heightened level of awareness regarding how I am viewed and how to navigate the collective Asian American identity.",
    "This class gives you a fascinating survey of Asian American history.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of my people in America. In high school, Asians were never mentioned in history classes save for one line talking about how Chinese Americans helped build the railroad. I also became a better writer.",
    "I learned about how the model minority myth came about.",
    "I learned a lot about Asian American history and how it applies.",
    "I learned a lot about a history that I have never been taught before. I had no idea that the \"free white persons\" clause was in effect until 1952, which is something that everyone should know. The course covered a lot of material.",
    "Really great insight into own heritage",
    "Learned a lot about histories of American governmental and societal oppression of Asian Americans; focused a ton on resistance to this oppression & the ways in which it's developed over time.",
    "I learned a lot about Asian-American History that I never even imagined existed. It's an incredibly interesting and informative course!",
    "This class helped me learn different things about Asian American History, a topic that is often not taught. It was really cool to see how it fit in with the larger narrative.",
    "This class has given me a much-needed overview of Asian American history. Some major themes include immigration and citizenship, resistance, racial formation, etc. And you learn about major events such as the Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese internment, and the Vietnam War.",
    "I learned about the history of Asian Americans in the United States, and the formation of culture, identity, and resilience in the Asian American communities. The course also taught me how to write an oral history paper, and a better history paper in general.",
    "A greater understanding and nuance of an often underrepresented part of American history",
    "I learned to dissect something called the Model Minority Mythand understand why its harmful, and how it has been used to manipulate Asian Americans since WWII. I learned about historical discrimination, ranging from immigration restrictions ( la Donald Trump), to physical segregation, to job insecurity, to cultural misrepresentation. I learned to cherish by Black, Native, and Latinx kin. I learned about historical resistance, and came to appreciate those who came before me, who have made it possible to be Asian American. I learned about my familys history in ways that have allowed me to be a better son. I grew stronger. I became braver. I know myself more. This course is an experience that every Asian American student at Yale should be blessed with taking before they graduated. Just take it. Regardless of whether youre studying history, or engineering, or pre-med, the big takeaways that Mary Lui and her fantastic TAs teach you will transform the way that you think about you, your family, and your historical and political place in the world.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of Asian Americans and the intersection of oppressed groups through this course. It was really a fascinating class that helped me narrow down what I want to do my research in in the future.",
    "I think the biggest insight I had was into how to apply historical knowledge to artifacts of the past, as I did when I wrote the stained glass window project paper.",
    "Learned how different legal policies and social prejudices toward different Asian groups all combine to affect other Asian groups. Already knew about the Model Minority Stereotype but I feel like this course really helped solidify my understanding of it. Loved that this course started at the VERY beginning of AA history, all the way back to the 1850s. Loved that so many specific case studies were included, since it really helped to humanize the history.",
    "An overview of the history of Asian immigration to America, with a focus on Chinese and Japanese immigrants.",
    "I considered what it means to be Asian American and what the significance and usefulness of the categorization is. I also acquired a meaningful set of knowledge around the immigration, perception, and status of Asian Americans, which is very useful in making an analysis of social conditions and inequity today. The similarities and differences between the methods and motives of oppression of Asian Americans and other peoples are quite illuminating.",
    "I learned how to do an oral history project - had never done it before in college! It was a very fun experience and my TA was super helpful.",
    "Ability to understand processes of migration, labor, discrimination, and social movements and how they relate to today Ability to understand how broad terms like \"Asian American\" are defined by others and the people who identify with the term Relating primary documents to background history and contextualizing them Analyzing narrative histories",
    "I learned a ton not just about Asian American history, but the ways in which history impacts and informs our present day. Lots of good history writing skills, more than I have in other history classes.",
    "This is a terrific survey course that teaches an essential history rarely covered in standard US history. It was the first time that I was in a space occupied by people who predominately looked a bit like me and it was the first time that I was specifically studying those larger narratives that encompass my personal and family history. Both were vital experiences. I especially enjoyed and was pretty fired up by learning about the extensive and various history of activism.",
    "Great survey course in Asian American history. Experience (in lecture, section, exams, and papers) analyzing primary documents and putting them in historical context.",
    "Beyond just introducing me to a new topic, Asian American History taught me the importance of specificity in history. As a declared major, I understand the nuance of the past, but Professor Lui and my teaching fellow emphasized how key it was here and in all such history coursework.",
    "So much of Asian American History I did not know and is incredibly relevant to today",
    "this course provided a general overview of Asian American history, looking into the complexities of these histories and narratives, and the way they have been represented throughout time. This class looked at individual narratives, as well as public and media portrayals of Asian Americans, in order to understand the way that exclusion and discrimination has been perpetuated, as well as the way that Asian immigrants have forged both collective and individual identities in America."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "My only suggestion with this course is that I think it should be a WR credit because of the 3 long papers we have to write. As an English major I'm in another English class that counts as a WR credit and only has 3 papers, each 5 pages each. For AsAm History, we wrote a 5 page paper, an 8-10 page paper, and a 6 page paper. I don't see how making it a WR credit would be detrimental at all in terms of enrollment - I think it would actually boost enrollment. In addition, making it a WR credit would allow students to submit papers they've written for this class to the WR prizes, which recognize excellence in student papers from WR courses across all disciplines. I think it would be really great for AsAm History papers to be eligible for those prizes! This class has also shown me, however, that we need more faculty who do work in Asian American Studies. I have had so many conversations with my fellow classmates and peers who have shared the sentiment that this class was life-changing and offered modes of thinking through history that we had never experienced. I would really like to see Yale offer more classes like this one and support ethnic studies classes.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Lui was a very engaging lecturer, and the TFs were very committed. Readings were manageable and completed the lectures. Everything was tightly organized and ran like clockwork Weaknesses: There were points in which we could have gone in more depth, and there were analytical dimensions which we did not explore e.g. religion, intimacy in as much detail as we could have",
    "Having a final paper and then a final exam (which, since it's just one essay question, is essentially another final paper) felt repetitive. I would have liked to do the oral history project, but I couldn't think of anyone who I could ask - it felt weird to think of interviewing friends' parents, for example. After the deadline had passed a friend of mine mentioned that I could have interviewed our college's dean, which would have been a good idea! But I would have liked some more suggestions about who to interview if you don't have Asian American family. I loved being in a small discussion section - mine was only about 8 people. I think we got to know each other a little more over the course of the semester and that made the conversation better.",
    "The material is very interesting and engaging; I always loved coming to lecture! The readings were also really fascinating works, often by Asian American writers. The only weakness that I see is that the class focuses a lot on East Asia, but that might be inevitable for an Asian American history course.",
    "Great course! This history is so under taught, that is class is incredibly necessary.",
    "Lectures were interesting as were film screenings and readings. But this class was a lot of work each week. From weekly reading responses to a midterm exam and paper and a final project and paper, I often felt like I was never not doing something for this class. It pays off in the end, but can feel like a lot in the moment especially if you're invested in the course material and want to do well.",
    "This class was incredible. Professor Lui is a brilliant and funny lecturer, who had very well crafted lectures and reading sets. I have no recommendations for improvement, I loved it.",
    "Strengths of the course would be Professor Lui's incredible knowledge and dedication to teaching. Weaknesses would be the pretty large writing requirement. A midterm, a 5 page paper, a 10 page paper, and an 8 page take home final. I know it doesn't sound THAT bad, but it wasn't the easiest material.",
    "This class was very well taught. Mary Lui is an amazing lecturer and her handouts with key terms for each class were very useful. The readings also fit together very well with the content.",
    "I think this was a great course and I don't know if it can be improved. It didn't go into detail very often, but that's alright considering it had to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time.",
    "Weakness is too much workload so I feel like a lot of people have to credit d the class. However it's such an important topic and learned so much",
    "This course is fantastic. It could use a little more historiographical exposition.",
    "I think the course taught me to ask a lot more questions and to think more critically about historical narratives. I really enjoyed the books assigned in the class, but I found the other readings very dry. Perhaps, reviewing the reading list would be helpful. One thing I feel disappointed about was the lack of time dedicated to experiences of Middle Eastern Americans and South Asian Americans. I think a discussion on the sidelining of this history should be held at some point of the semester. Also, since there is so much material and so little time, I think the other readings could perhaps fill in the gaps. For example, we talked about the Manong generation, but we didn't really go into the history of Larry Itliong and the Delano Grape Strike. Maybe featuring a documentary on this would be important (this one is really good https:\/\/www.kanopystreaming.com\/product\/delano-manongs). There are a lot of examples left that I feel are really important (the reaction of Korean Americans to Rodney King).",
    "The strengths of the class are the lectures, but the weakness is that there is a substantial amount of class work.",
    "I really liked the final project portion, where we could choose to either a) do an oral history of someone's life and relate it to the big themes covered in class b) write about a stained class window in the East Asia Library in Sterling that depicts an illustration from the \"Heathen Chinee\" The only complaint about the class is that we tried to cover too much in every lecture but I guess that's the case with every \"overview kind of\" history class.",
    "I think this course did a great job of covering Asian American history that we often don't learn about. However, given that it is a survey course, it felt like we only had a superficial overview of a lot of the history.",
    "The course goes over a lot of material which is both a blessing and a curse. It's incredible and valuable to learn so much, but at times there is too much to really process deeply (although section helps with that). Additionally, there was a large focus on the same topics for multiple lectures, and the course didn't cover much from the 1980's onward which would potentially have been more interesting and just as valuable.",
    "Strengths: interesting and engaging lectures, great TFs, overall solid presentation Weaknesses: weekly readings and reading responses may be overwhelming at times and demotivate students from actually engaging with the material",
    "The biggest strength of the course is Mary Lui. She is one of the best lecturers at Yaleup there with legends such as John Merriman and George Chauncey. She also does an excellent job of distilling how topics that you might not thing are related to Asian American history (colonial consumption, Westward expansion, the Cold War, healthcare reform, natural disasters) are actually crucial in a peoples racial formation and cultural history. Her lecture style is warm and friendly, and she definitely cracks a lot of mom jokes. She is extremely approachable even outside of class, and seems dedicated to intentional, transformative learning. The readings and assignments are numerous, but I honestly found them to be really enjoyable. Theyre curated very well. My only suggestion is for Mary to make her lectures a little more taut (they tend to run over a little).",
    "The course is great! Lecture was good and section was too; it worked as advertised and went through Asian American history engagingly and successfully.",
    "This course did a good job of showing Asian American history through different lenses like the courts, general society, etc. Someone might want to re-evaluate which Asian ethnic groups are included in the class, because while it was nice to get an idea about all of them, the focus was kind of uneven. I really appreciated having handouts for this class because otherwise I think I would have been lost. I think that especially earlier in the course, we jumped around through time a lot, which made following the narrative a bit confusing. Having section start while it was still shopping period I believe made more logistical problems than was necessary. I have never had section during shopping period my entire time here. I also believe the midterm exam expected too much of a 50 minute period.",
    "I think that establishing timelines with important dates more often in section would have been very helpful.",
    "Strength: Covered every period, stretching even before the earliest arrival of Asians in America. Painted a very complete timeline of how Asian immigrants began to arrive and how that evolved over time. Weakness: Sometimes units were very brief due to limited time. Lectures moved very fast and there were no notes or slides to review after class.",
    "Prof. Lui's lectures are definitely a strength. They are engaging and informative. I wish the sections could be improved to make them more of a space for discussion with peers and critical thought as opposed to more time to present information. I also wish that the class could focus more on the contemporary situation of Asian Americans, not just distant history.",
    "So many strengths! Prof Lui clearly cares about us and about her TAs, and my TA was also fantastic. Expectations were always very clear, and feedback was always very detailed. An important subject matter and a lot of interesting readings.",
    "The strengths of this course were lectures, readings, and the TFs. The material itself was really interesting, largely primary sources like oral histories and newspaper articles. Prof Lui's lectures were great, though sometimes a little repetitive, and she clearly emphasizes and structures the class so you understand the point of studying this history, which is something you don't always get. The TFs were amazing and made section enjoyable (something I never say about section).",
    "The workload was quite high to the point that I felt a bit stretched thin across the various readings and assignments. I learned so so much in lecture that 1) many of the readings felt a bit redundant, and 2) I was often a bit exhausted just by the intensity\/fast-pace\/amount of information of lecture.",
    "Covering all Asian American history in one course is extremely difficult, and Prof. Lui does a great job of highlighting key moments and illustrative stories. More context in the form of more courses and instructors in Asian American studies would be great.",
    "Professor Lui was a fantastic lecturer and always drew me into what she was saying. However, we had far too many assignments, which made me much less likely to do the reading. If the coursework were a little more balanced, I would've been able to better engage with the actual most important material.",
    "Lectures can be a bit disorganized, also highly centered on Chinese & Japanese Americans (which is too be expected), but while there is some emphasis on Korean, Indian, Vietnamese and Filipino, there's no mention of other populations from Asian countries (such as Nepal) who have large histories of immigration to the US",
    "while lectures were informative, I would have preferred to examine contemporary issues through the lens of history as well. I would have preferred to devote more lectures to more recent history, because this is what touches most students taking the course, Asian American or not."

    "I *HIGHLY* recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning about Asian American history and has a stake in the Asian American community or racial justice as a whole. This is by far the most important class I've taken at Yale so far and the material is life-changing for anyone who hasn't encountered Asian American history before. A fantastic course. I hope it continues to be offered every year.",
    "Yes! And not just for Asian students! Many of the concepts are highly relevant to any analysis of race and mobility in contemporary America, and will reshape your understanding of U.S. and global history",
    "This class was endlessly interesting and always well-taught. I went from knowing next to nothing about Asian American history to knowing at least a thorough introduction, and enjoyed that learning every step of the way.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to all students, whether or not you're Asian. It's a very under-studied field, but there is so much to learn. It's amazing how many aspects of American history actually involved Asian Americans, but the Asian American influence has since been erased. It makes you think more critically about the histories that we learn and the players that might be missing.",
    "Great course! This history is so under taught, that is class is incredibly necessary. Take it take it take it!",
    "Take this class!!",
    "Most definitely. It is very rare to find a class that focuses on the history of Asians in America and rarer still to find one as great as this. If you are an Asian American, have an interest in international relations with China or other Asian countries, or simply have a free class in your schedule, take it! The workload was very manageable, the lecturers were fascinating, and the readings complemented the lectures well.",
    "I would if the student were very interested in this history \/ trying to fulfill foundation classes for AmStud. It's not the kind of class that you go into saying Hey I just want to learn about Asian American history--it's a pretty serious work commitment.",
    "This class was one of the best I've taken at Yale. The material is very interesting - Asian-American history is rarely covered especially in high school but very rich. It was also interesting to see how topics we discussed are still relevant today. Mary Lui is an amazing lecturer and class was always interesting. For context, I am a student in TD who took this class Cr\/D\/F and STILL dragged myself all the way down to LORIA for almost every single class because they were so great.",
    "There is a lot of reading in this class and Mary Lui is a very tough grader. Overall, it was an interesting class and I learned a lot. Though be warned that most of the history will be Chinese American or Japanese American history, not too much of the other ethnic groups. That being said, I would recommend it.",
    "This is a very interesting course, that being said the workload is weirdly distributed (midterm exam and midterm paper, final paper and final exam).",
    "Yes! I would recommend this to any student regardless of their major. It covers material that everyone should know.",
    "Yes, it was such a good course and I feel like I've learned so much about not only my own heritage but also history. I couldn't imagine graduating Yale without taking this course.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning more about Asian American History, regardless of ethnicity. You will never learn anything like this in your other history courses and it provides another aspect to your understanding of America and the way legal laws have influenced the social development of ethnicities in America.",
    "Definitely!! I'm a white girl from California, and was so shocked to learn about all the oppressive legal and social exclusion I DIDN'T learn about in high school. This is seriously a must-take, especially nowadays.",
    "I strongly recommend this course - it's rich in detail and manages to cover just about every important Asian American historical event & process.",
    "Do yourself a favor. TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "This is an excellent class about an important history! Would definitely recommend it!!",
    "Great history class, especially if you want to learn more about Asian American history. There is so much we don't know and it's all so important to American history as a while. Take it even if you are not Asian!",
    "Take this class!!!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Prof. Lui is incredibly knowledgeable about her subject, and she and the TFs are so dedicated to making sure everyone gets as much out of the class as they can. The only bad thing about this course is that it's the only Asian American history course offered at Yale.",
    "I think this would be a really tough course to take for a real grade given that it has a substantial workload that piled up in the middle and at the end of the semester. With a midterm paper and midterm, a final paper and a take home final, it was really tough to get all the work done.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend the course as I think it teaches a history that most people don't learn about otherwise, and knowing the histories of the communities in our country is a fundamental step towards making fair and positive change. Be prepared, however, for a lot of reading each week. Most of it is interesting, it's just not something you can put off until the last minute.",
    "Take this course! I would credit\/D it though. Lots of interesting material but is less stressful if not taking for a grade. The class sort of reads like a prescribed narrative but overall presents all sorts of material relevant to Asian American history.",
    "As a first generation immigrant, I spent a lot of my childhood consciously avoiding being Chinese and Asian. I remember not wanting to be teased for having a particular accent, or eating particular foods, or not understanding certain pop culture references. Being in college gave me time to contemplate my identityand this course was crucial in helping revolutionize my worldview and reconnect with parts of myself. I learned to dissect something called the Model Minority Mythand understand why its harmful, and how it has been used to manipulate Asian Americans since WWII. I learned about historical discrimination, ranging from immigration restrictions ( la Donald Trump), to physical segregation, to job insecurity. I learned to cherish by Black, Native, and Latinx kin. I learned about historical resistance, and came to appreciate those who came before me, who have made it possible to be Asian American. I learned about my familys history in ways that have allowed me to be a better son. I grew stronger. I became braver. I know myself more.

Regardless of whether youre studying history, or engineering, or pre-med, the big takeaways that Mary Lui and her fantastic TAs teach you will transform the way that you think about you, your family, and your historical and political place in the world.",
    "Everyone should take this class at some pointif you have Asian American family or friends or even exist in an Asian American space (@Yale), you should take this class.",
    "This course is definitely necessary and important to learn about a population in America that is often overlooked. If you want to get insight into this topic, then take the class. However, I would also say that this class has a high workload, and expectations can be rather high.",
    "Yes! I knew so little about Asian American history before I took this course, and I feel that Prof. Lui and my TF have helped opened my eyes.",
    "The workload is very high, with large amounts of reading and two finals. Most of the students in the class are of Asian heritage, so the personal connection makes the class extremely rewarding. Professor Lui is a great lecturer and has put together a very compacted survey course that hits every period of Asians in America.",
    "I would recommend this to students interested in investigating oppression, the varying experiences of different racial groups, and what we can learn from these overlapping histories. As an Asian American student, it was also a wonderful experience to see a history I identified with represented in class because Asian Americans are usually neglected in American history classes and racial discussions. The workload is heavy, though, so it would be a good class to Credit\/D.",
    "The organization of this class is very impressive. It's a must take for any of the majors it's listed under AS WELL AS for non-majors!",
    "Take this class!! Incredibly enlightening. You won't learn this stuff anywhere else, and it's so well organized and clearly taught. I definitely gained a lot of useful analytical skills and feel like I can think critically about race and racial constructs now.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course to another student the material is great and super interesting\/something I'd never really thought about before. The final assignments are a little burdensome (final paper + take home final) but it wasn't too bad. ML is great and the TFs were great, I really feel like I got a lot out of the class, both in understanding of Asian American history and in terms of writing and analytical skills.",
    "Yes yes yes. If you are in any way Asian\\American take this course. If you are not, take this course. It was really cool to be in a space with so many other Asian\\American peers and teachers, but I was also a bit disappointed to see how few non-Asian\\American students were taking the class\/demonstrating interest\/solidarity\/what-have-you.",
    "Great survey course in Asian American history. Experience (in lecture, section, exams, and papers) analyzing primary documents and putting them in historical context.",
    "If you are interested in identity-based history, this course is great - I learned so much information that high schools simply never taught. Professor Lui is also a fantastic instructor. However, the course load was incredibly excessive. I wish that I had taken the class Cr\/D because although I'm a history major, I still found the assignments to be not as educationally worthwhile as the effort that they required.",
    "Definitely take it you'll learn so much you never knew",
    "If there is one class at Yale you must take, it's Asian American history with Professor Lui! You won't regret it!",
    "I would recommend this course for students who are studying history, but as an Asian American who wanted to learn more about my individual family history, I found the course to be much more of a history than an american studies class. I would say that the final oral history project was one of my favorite projects that I have done at Yale, so I would recommend the course for this project alone."
