    "If you love adventure, want to broaden your horizon, or are someone who curiously pursues new interests, then this is the course for you. This is a course that teaches you about life through the lens of epic poetry. It's a well taught course with a knowledgeable professor who is clearly very passionate about her students as well as the material. You'll always be waiting for the next class. Take it. I can say that taking this course was one of the best decisions I've made at Yale. That said, you might not want to take it if you took DS since I'm told there's a fair bit of overlap.",
    "This is a great class. As someone who hasnt taken all that many humanities classes the work was manageable and discussion was engaging.",
    "Please take this course. You will not regret it!!! It is so awesome, and you learn about some of the great Western texts in an environment without potentially annoying DS freshman but with a fantastically awesome professor. Prof Levin is simply amazing.",
    "The class is exactly what the title details: it is review of classical to romantic poetry. In the class, you study not only the poems themselves but also their authors and time periods during which they wrote. It is a great class-- take it-- but be prepared to be reading a lot each week."
