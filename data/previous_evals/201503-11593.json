    "Definitely. It's a great painting class to take after you've had some introduction to painting. Not as intense as some other classes. If you want to paint for fun, take it!",
    "I would say this course is largely an open studio for artists with technical skill to enjoy painting and develop their own styles. I would recommend this class to a student who has painted a lot before and who wants to work on plein air painting. It is a very open class, so there is not much direction or technical guidance. This may be difficult for a student who doesn't have much painting experience.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Painting Time. It's a wonderful way to really work with oil paints (though I believe you can use acrylic if you want) in a number of special places; we painted YSO practicing, Commons after-hours, and from the penthouse of the Study. It was a really special experience, and I would recommend it to anyone willing to put in the effort."
