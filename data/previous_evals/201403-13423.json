    "This is a solid introduction to digital photography. It teaches you what you would expect to learn from a class like this. It is, first and foremost, an art class - though it does teach you how to use a camera, edit photos, and print them, you will also have to spend time thinking about what art is. That was a lot more difficult for me, but I do think I learned a lot from it and exposed me to a completely different discipline. It is a lot of time commitment, but I would say it's worth it.",
    "If you take intro to digital photo, you will learn how to use photography as an art form, the technical aspects of operating a DSLR, and a little bit about photographic history and great work by famous photographers. It's a very solid intro class that covers all the basics you might be wondering about. I came in knowing nothing about photography, and after a semester I feel like I have a much greater appreciation for photography, and I feel more confident about my own ability to express myself through taking pictures. I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "well introduction to the basic digital photography from artistic perspective",
    "This course is perhaps the best course I've taken at Yale. There have been more \"important\" ones - the freshman sequence for my major comes to mind - but this course was so totally incredible, in every way, that it blew my mind. In terms of courses that contained material I could not at all have learned on my own, this course also takes first prize. I learned how to actually go about creating art, and just as importantly, how to appreciate and evaluate it. Going into this course I thought I knew something about art, but I didn't, and if you've never taken a class before, this is totally imperative to getting anything out of consuming and creating art. And since art is one of the best ways to learn about life, you'd be terribly remiss to skip this course. For people who, like myself, had never taken an art class before, one of the core strengths of this course is that the mechanics of photography are extremely simple. You adjust three parameters, each of which has a finite number of values, you focus, and you're good to go. This means that you spend almost the entirety of the course focusing on ideas and what you want to communicate, and how (in terms of form and content) to communicate it. In other intro-level art courses, the mechanics seem to take center stage. There were people in my course also taking printing and painting and their artistic development in those mediums was nowhere near their development in photography, for the simple reason that they had to spend a lot of time learning the physics of painting and printing. Ka-Man was my section professor. She is an absolutely incredible teacher - she spent so much time going over our work and talking with us, and (I think) really understood what we were trying to do as artists and helped us do it. The amount of effort and patience invested was enormous. And, of course, she is a great artist and knows a tremendous amount about art, which played a key role in terms of showing us how to appreciate art, and thereby how to create it. She also said that we should keep in touch with her and show her our new work, which I'm very excited about. It's somewhat hard to find those long-term relationships with professors (especially in my home department, which is STEM) but they are very useful and important. Obviously you get out of this course what you put in. I'd say a doable semester with this course is two hard classes, two medium classes, one easy, with this being one of the hard ones. I usually put in 15 hours outside of class each week, but it all depends how much you want to get out of the course. Keep in mind that you get increasing marginal returns on time invested. tl;dr: take this course if you want to be able to appreciate and create art, or are a curious person and want to learn a lot about something new in a short amount of time, or...really just take this course. do not take this course if you don't want to put in a serious amount of time. I could go on and on about this course but this isn't the appropriate venue."
