   "comments": [
    "I think that this course could have more structure to it. While I got a lot of practice, I would have liked more exercises with strict expectations that pushed us as draftspeople.",
    "This course was good simply as a platform for practicing some very specific skills. It was a fun class. We listened to music and chatted, and everybody got along great. But crits were pretty uninspiring, and there wasn't really much criticism or direction from the professor.",
    "Almost every class featured a live model. That was great. But I wished Troy, our instructor, had provided more active oversight and criticism of our work."

   "comments": [
    "Yes because drawing the figure is an incredible experience and an important way to make art.",
    "Yes. Figure Drawing was my favorite class this semester. I always looked forward to going to class and drawing for two hours. I churned out at least one piece a class, and there was usually one homework assignment per week, so I had created a lot of work by the end. I can't say I learned much technically about how to draw the human body, but I do think I improved with all the practice I did. At least for me, the process was therapeutic and the results satisfying. Troy is nice and laid-back, which I felt contributed a lot to the relaxed atmosphere of the class.",
    "This class is straightforward. Take it if you want to practice drawing naked people.",
    "Yes!",
    "With a few qualifications, yes. But as a person who also attends the free, non-academic Monday night drawing class at Yale, I got almost as much out of jsut DRAWING on Monday nights."
