   "comments": [
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Jamie was not my teaching fellow, but apparently I have to select one to submit this form. I've had him as a TF for another class, and he's excellent!!",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0He wasn't but I couldn't not select one",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0I had Ben Gibson as a section instructor. Please see below.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Absolutely fantastic - so knowledgable across the board in theology. Great instructor. Probably one of the best at YDS.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Jamie did a great job speaking with us and encouraging good discussions. I especially liked his diagrammatic explanations. He did an excellent job making sure we explored the material, and he nurtured an environment that allowed us to teach each other. I did find the regular switching of section times to be frustrating given the interactive\/dialogic nature of our section time. His comments on papers were helpful and detailed. A great teacher!",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Jamie was a really good TF. He is exceptionally bright, and very very kind. He worked hard to allow discussions in section to proceed organically, while occasionally interrupting to provide instruction or explanation. He was very accessible outside of class, and always provided helpful feedback for presentations and papers.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Jamie is great. I especially appreciated his help in our section in putting things in perspective and giving us the connective tissue we needed to understand the context in which each theologian worked and wrote.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Jamie was a terrific TF. He was able to give us very helpful background on topics covered in the class, and he almost always facilitated an interesting and thought-provoking discussion. I tend to do most of my studying on my own and seldom find sections helpful, but this section was a real exception.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0I had Ben Gibson who facilitated our section meetings very well. I learned much from him and his enthusiasm for the material.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0James was a great TF who listened to us and taught to what we found interesting about that weeks readings. James helped facilitate great conversation and gave background when needed. I do feel like there were some people who complained a lot in section and I wish that James listened to it (like he did) but also reigned in the conversation so it didn't take 20 minutes of our section like it sometimes did.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Jamie clearly knows and loves the material and makes himself available to work with any student on request. I found his guidance invaluable. At first, he was too tentative with the group, and, as my group had many introverts, it took some time to get the discussion moving. Several weeks into the course, however, he asked whether he should be more directive, and we all agreed yes. From this point on, his comments were really helpful in shaping the discussion. I appreciated the comments on my papers, and found them useful in developing my writing. I got off on the wrong foot in the final exam, and while I knew the material, I never managed to get back on my feet. Don't know how I should have prepared differently, but the material was of such overwhelming scope it was impossible to stay on top of everything unless you already had a background in the subject--and I did not.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Jamie is very clear in both his expectations and his communication with students, which I appreciate. One area of improvement that I will suggest is that he not look so tired. He always seems as if talking with students is wearing him out, which I find a little discouraging. Other than that, he did well.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Jamie is highly knowledgeable and offered short lectures that greatly enhanced the topics we were covering. He also did an excellent job of facilitating discussion. I would enjoy him as my primary teacher in this field.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0I did not have Jamie but the course evaluation cannot be submitted without checking this box. This offers an opportunity for a broader comment on the use of recently-graduated masters-level students as Teaching Fellows at YDS--I mean, Yale's own software is not even set up to allow this--but due to the economics of higher ed, I have seen this in a number of courses and doubt it will change at Yale any time soon.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Strengths: Knowledge base: Jamie had excellent information to add to gain perspective on the topic at hand. For example, the discussion on \"what makes a Hauerwas?\" gave me perspective on this theologian that would have been very hard for me to have mustered up on my own outside of section. Ease with students: Jamie is almost a little shy about sharing his depth of knowledge and command of the material, but a positive outcome of this is he is not intimidating to students but really \"right there\" with the material when he engages with students. Enjoyment of the act of teaching: Jamie clearly enjoys the act of delving into the material and journeying with students as they question and learn the material. This made section both a kind of \"heart and mind\" experience. It was not just a dry intellectual exercise; it was true conversation about the material and how it relates to every day life and our experiences. Weaknesses: I was glad that Jamie responded to the mid-point feedback survey by being more engaged \/ sharing his knowledge with the section. If he had not done so, I would mention \"putting himself out there more\" as a need. It is important to provide students with both affirmation and room to grow in their work. On my second paper, Jamie's feedback included both elements more fully, which is more helpful to me as a learner. Might have been helpful to have the feedback on the second paper prior to the final exam, but emotionally I think for it to only have a positive, learning effect Paper #2 should not be given back too close to the actual exam.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0Jamie was very helpful in section when it came to explaining concepts and the connections between different thinkers. He also provided a lot of help when it came to writing papers and his feedback was always valuable.",
    "Instructor: James Johnstone Dunn \u00a0I didn't actually have Jamie as my TF, but it appears I have to check the box in order to submit my form. The one day he subbed for Ben he was remarkably eloquent and ready with information to fill the gaps in our knowledge. He was skillful at facilitating discussion and getting us to delve deeper into the material."

   "comments": [
    "Ben did such a tremendous job governing section. His thoughts, usually articulated at the beginning of section before the presentation started, were always so helpful in encapsulating the main issues of that week's readings and topics. He was also a great moderator during section discussions. His feedback on my first paper was also insightful.",
    "Great at leading and facilitating discussion. Excellent teaching assistant.",
    "Ben was awesome. Excellent conversation facilitor, respectful of diverse opinions, exceptionally knowledgable, and very helpful when meeting one and one to discuss assignments.",
    "Ben was an excellent TF. Held an excellent discussion section and always brought the conversation to a higher level. Always helpful and accessible.",
    "Ben was fabulous. He was knowledgeable about the topic, and was always able to offer helpful background information and entertain questions pertaining to particular readings. Further, he created an atmosphere in section that fostered group learning and fruitful discussion. Ben was always willing to give feedback and advice pertaining to papers or course assignments, and was consistently making himself available in the form of office hours or by appointment. His willingness to assist student was authentic and genuine, and I greatly appreciate that in a teaching fellow. I greatly enjoyed working with Ben and wish I had had more opportunities to do so over my time at YDS.",
    "Ben is a terrible discussion facilitator. The worst discussion section in all the classes I have taken at YDS.",
    "Ben has offered the kindest assistance and insightful guidance throughout the course. His strengths are his eloquence in writing and speech, and well-prepared facilitation of discussions, and kindest guidance outside the class or even his office hours. Such strengths have motivated me to push myself further and to fully engage with the content of the course. Through his guidance, I believe I further matured not only intellectually, but also personally throughout the last semester. Benjamin Gibson is the best teaching fellow I have ever had in my academic life whose encouragement, consideration, and generosity will continue to inspire me in the rest of my years at YDS and beyond.",
    "Comfortable framing discussions of ethics theologically. Sometimes had the tendency to push his own view in discussion rather than facilitating students' sharing their own interpretations.",
    "Ben is a charismatic and engaging discussion leader, though I don't think he very effectively drew us out in a way that opened up our thinking. There was one particularly memorable day when he was gushing about his love for Hays, and then when it came to discuss Cone, he asked us to point out its weaknesses, straight away, which he did not do with any other author. There was a clear hierarchy of which voices mattered in this section, and it was the voices of the white men. I was also consistently disappointed with Ben's grading, as it did not seem to fairly reflect the quality of work (I say this comparing my grades to my peers and to my own grades in all other courses). It felt like there was a clear bias that was disruptive to learning and engagement in section, which was evident in who spoke during section and how the whole dynamic of the group worked."
