   "comments": [
    "Satisfies a philosophy requirement. Would not otherwise take it.",
    "As a non-philosophy major, I love this class. The style of thinking is great. Furthermore:1. Zoltan makes these hand-outs for each class session. They make the articles really accessible.2. The format is a lecture, but where it is easy and expected to ask questions. Perfect for the subject matter.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I don't think you understand how much you need it. Not a philosophy major? Yes, it won't be easy to follow, but if the topic interests you, you will definitely find it rewarding. AND will end up being way smarter.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class. The lectures were enthralling and the material interesting, though I do think a significant component of that came as a result of the other students in the class and their ability to sustain unusually interesting and intellectually rigorous discussions. This is, of course, contingent, but I hope this is a sign of good things to come in further philosophy seminars and small lectures rather than an anomaly.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "Yes - great class",
    "Take this either if you are an experienced philosophy major ready to study with one of the greats and go into further depth into a deeply important issue in metaphysics, or you are an intermediate philosophy student who is looking for a challenging introduction to real analytic philosophy. Some background is assumed here, and one class may not be enough unless you are willing to put in extra effort to get up to speed. This is a wonderful investigation of that timelessly puzzling question that will continue to confound man until he perishes from the earth.",
    "Szabo is fantastic.",
    "strongly recommend",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, especially to those people who get the most out of classes when they have a chance to participate actively. I would not recommend this as a very first class in philosophy, however. It's certainly not an impossibly hard class, and the workload isn't bad at all, but you'll definitely get more out of the class, and find it more interesting, if you have a little background with metaphysics terminology and logic.",
    "This course is a discussion-friendly lecture on topics in the metaphysics of causation. We spend the majority of the semester on questions regarding the nature of causation. The final third of the course is dedicated to philosophical questions to which causation is relevant - mental causation, free will, reference, and knowledge.",
    "Low-work-load, sophisticated discussion of the metaphysics of causation. Things get pretty complicated, pretty quickly, so this course is not for anyone who doesn't enjoy doing philosophy for its own sake. But if you're one of those people, its a great means to have (or to witness) good discussions between smart philosophers.",
    "Take this course if you are a philosophy major. Professor Szabo is incredibly knowledgeable, and the material is fascinating.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. The content is stimulating, and its presentation in the course was compelling. The workload is very manageable, and the professor is accessible for meeting to discuss the topics of the course."
