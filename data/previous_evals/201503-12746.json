    "I would recommend this class to anyone that is interested in ancient language or Egypt. The class was very interesting and unique. It is especially good if you need a language credit but do not want a class 5 days a week or if you don't want to learn a new speaking language.",
    "EGYP 110 requires discipline and motivation, and is not easy. If you're in it merely for the sake of an easier language credit, you will not find success; if you are in it to learn an interested language, then with the proper amount of self control and hard studying, you will likely enjoy yourself.",
    "The work is very tedious",
    "I would recommend this course. It is one of my favorites that I have taken. But if you don't have the patience to search through a dictionary for 10 minutes looking for a hard-to-find word, this isn't the class for you.",
    "It is fun and requires a lot of work but is overall very rewarding and translating is almost like cracking a code.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys learning about grammar. I took Latin in high school, and I feel the way in which the language is taught is very similar. If you are someone who enjoys looking at the way languages work, this is a very interesting class."
