This course also taught some of the finer points of being a functioning scientist such as communication (both in writing and verbal) and troubleshooting (because nothing ever works)."

    "The relaxed timeline was helpful for me because the lower level of stress typically encourages me to engage in the material. However, this is also sort of a weakness in the course because it slows down the course pace. Overall though, I though the course was well structured and the creative aspects were helpful."
