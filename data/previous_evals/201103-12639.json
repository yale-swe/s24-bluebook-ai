   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to all students. Is it not only for people who want to learn about urban ecology, but also for people who just want to learn more about New Haven.",
    "A fine course that depends significantly on the interest and engagement of its students (Even moreso than other seminars). More class exercises, guest speakers, and readings for focused discussions the following class would be helpful. There is a lot more material that could be incorporated into the class, but it is generally very good for self-motivated students. Watch out for the 15-20pg paper at the end- it is no joke. The rest of the workload is very light.",
    "This course involves writing a 15 page research paper on a topic of one's choice. There is a midterm on the textbook, which is interesting in general, but dense and lacking in examples of applications of the content. The course itself is fun, and involves walks in New Haven, and guest speakers. Doesn't meet any distributional reqs.",
    "Take it if you want to meet interesting people involved with environmental and urban issues in New Haven. The book you read for the first part isn't very good. I wouldn't recommend reading it (especially if he lets you take a group midterm again this year). Classes are awesome when Gordon isn't lecturing. We had at least 5 guest lecturers who were all great. The final paper can also be awesome if you pick a good topic. This class is really what you make it, just count on some days being boring.",
    "Urban Ecology lightly examines how to look at cities from an ecological standpoint, but most of what you learn from this class will be from the final research paper. The textbook for this class is terrible and there aren't very many interesting discussions during class time. However, Gordon is very helpful and genuinely nice, and the class is easy. Shop it if you are interested, in order to see the seminar dynamic but be wary that the course can be frustratingly unfocused.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. Its a course that is both interesting and allows you to become decently versed in environmental discussion. All of the students because really engaged in our final papers and I actually enjoyed doing my research for it. Professor Geballe is also a wonderful man and teacher. He cares about all the students individually and sends you an e-mail if you happen to miss a class.",
    "I would not recommend this class. As cool as it may sound, I didn't learn very much about urban ecology. I think the major fault of this class is that it is neither a science credit nor a social studies credit, and so explore neither side of this complex subject in depth. The class needs to choose one and focus on it! Until that happens, don't take this class."
