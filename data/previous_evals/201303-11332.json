    "I would summarize it as a deep introduction to the foundations of French literature, and definitely recommend it for anyone remotely interested in French literature.",
    "Yes, especially if you're already interested in 17th-century lit",
    "This class is a solid, well-constructed seminar that gives a really satisfying introduction to the subject material and a great opportunity to work on language skills. I would recommend this class highly to anyone with a passing interest in the subject, an enthusiasm for early modern French culture, or even just an interest in practicing French.",
    "If you want a solid introduction to tragedies of this wonderful era of French theatre, and if you want to read some beautiful French, you should take this class. Chris Semk is a great teacher.",
