   "comments": [
    "How to do multivariable calculus.",
    "This class significantly improved my ability to think in three dimensions, and improved my math skills in general to an impressive degree. Its applicability to physics (my intended major) was extremely useful.",
    "I learned how to evaluate double integrals, line integrals, surface integrals, triple integrals, and apply theorems such as Green's Theorem, Stokes Theorem, and Diversion Theorem. I also learned how to optimize in 3D, and calculate 3D limits.",
    "Vectors, vector calculus, and calculus of many variables",
    "Multivariable calculus skills. This was a standard math course, nothing more, nothing less. The content was relatively interesting.",
    "Mathematical skills applicable to more advanced math, economics, and engineering courses.",
    "I developed a better grasp over parametrization of 3D geometric forms, understood the relationships between forces acting over volumes vs surfaces vs curves, and became comfortable with recognizing the types of equations that produced certain graphs in several (two) variables.",
    "I basically feel comfortable doing any kind of calculus in 3 dimensions now, it's pretty cool stuff honestly.",
    "I learned about vectors (also vector fields) and calculations on vectors, optimization techniques (min\/max), basic 3D geometry\/visualization, and many forms of integration."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Reasonable pace Weakness: Exams tend to take so many points off for one tiny calculation mistake (doesn't matter if everything works out and your process is 100% correct!!!)",
    "The course was extremely well designed, I never felt as though I was lacking in options for help if I needed it, and the content was incredibly interesting. The one thing that I have heard from my peers but have not experienced myself is a variability in teaching capability among the instructors.",
    "I thought this was a pretty good course. Especially as we got further into the course, the material got super interesting. On a day to day basis it also wasn't that overwhelming and the psets were totally manageable. However, the exams were super stressful. They were pretty fair in my opinion, but the grading is pretty tough.",
    "The major weakness of this course is that 90% of the grade hinges on 3 exams. This is unnessarily stressful and the grades end up not representing our knowledge \/ the range of skills in mathematics accurately. Thus, grades end up not correlating to anything actually worthwhile such as how much math students actually know, how much effort they put in, etc. The strengths are that the structure and expectations of the course are made extremely clear; there are not any spaces for ambiguity or confusion over the logistics of the course.",
    "The course, frankly, is very poorly organized. There are many parts that are skipped, such as detailed Jacobians, that are necessary to fully understand the course. Exams are tough and excessively computational.",
    "There were small class sizes for this course, instead of a large lecture. This helped us gain more out of it. The weaknesses of the course was the support system--it was very general, and not specific enough to student's individual needs.",
    "Strengths: lots of review material and practice exams with solutions, regular access to instructor and tutor office hours Weaknesses: I thought the example problems worked out in lecture could have been more representative of the \"trickier\" problems on exams",
    "Strengths are that the syllabus was well organized, the work that was assigned kept us up to date without being menial, and there were plenty ways for us to get any kind of help we needed. Great course. No weaknesses I can think of.",
    "A strength of the course is that most professors seemed to be effective and good at presenting the often times confusing material that is taught in MATH 120. Professor Tryniecki was a pleasure to learn from and did a great job at presenting and clarifying the material. A weakness comes from the harshness that is the MATH 120's grading system. Errors on problems meant a large amount of points will be deducted from your exam grades. Take ENAS 151 if you care about your grade and don't care too much about the material you might be learning.",
    "The speed of the course seemed fine, even when the material got more difficult. I thought that the weekly problem sets prepared one well for the exams and the practice exams that were provided were extremely helpful."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes- but only if you absolutely need to take multi to further your major. Don't do this for fun.",
    "If you are looking to improve your math ability in general and gain a rigorous understanding of the mathematics behind physics, I highly recommend this course!",
    "Yes! This was a great class, and while it could be difficult at times, at the end of the day, the topics were very interesting and worth learning.",
    "No. Unless if you are a math\/applied math major or STEM major, stay away from this course.",
    "I'd say give this class a chance. It can start off feeling fast and kind of overwhelming. But I think that if you put in the work and go to office hours when you're confused, you'll be ok. Also, I felt like the class got a lot better as it progressed. The tests are hard, to be sure, but if you really make sure you understand the material and how to do the psets, they shouldn't be too bad.",
    "Yes, if it is necessary for the major. I would definitely recommend taking this course in the spring rather than fall, because the overly competitive students are all gone. This is not to say the spring semester curve is easier or the students are dumber, simply that the learning environment seems more conducive to happiness and cooperation. Also, I would only recommend taking the course with Michal or Miki. Otherwise, go for ENAS 151.",
    "If you need it you'll take it; if not, don't.",
    "Only take it if you need it as a requirement, or if you are interested in rigorous quantitative advancement.",
    "Strengthens understanding of 3D geometry, prepares for physics, will make any past experience with calculus seem more useful and interesting.",
    "Yes, it is actually very cool stuff, which I didn't expect, and it's organized very well and has great teachers. Would recommend even beyond fulfilling a major requirement",
    "I would recommend this course those who have to take multivariable calculus and want to get a great understanding of the material. The course is well taught (Professor Tryniecki is great lecturer), and the textbook is often a helpful tool for clearing up confusion. Grade-wise, I suggest everyone who cares about their GPA to take ENAS 151. The material is primarily the same, although my peers in ENAS 151 seem to have a tougher time with the material than those in MATH 120. Yet, the grading systems and overall difficulty of the courses are very different.",
    "Take the class if you have to for a prerequisite or if you're interested in math, but be prepared to work hard. If you have a good teacher you will learn the material well."
