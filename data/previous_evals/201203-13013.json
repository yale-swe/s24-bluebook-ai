   "comments": [
    "Higher difficulty than 101, learn a lot of new things even if you have taken AP Bio before. PSets are very interesting and encourage critical thinking, and I enjoyed how the class integrated reading scientific papers. About 3-5 hours on Psets, midterm is very doable and final is non-cumulative. Pretty happy with the class.",
    "There is no straight memorization in this course. You have to be willing to put time in to really understand concepts and use them in new situations on tests and quizzes.",
    "It's difficult for someone who really needs an INTRO TO BIO class.",
    "DON'T TAKE AN ARROW TO THE KNEE!",
    "Strengths:Professor Mooseker and everyone else put so much work and effort into this course. They were very responsive to student needs.Learned a lot by reading primary literature.Weaknesses:Lectures were impossible to follow and too detailed. Everything felt a bit unorganized or maybe I just wasn't quite smart enough to put everything together in real time during lecture. Assumed too much prior knowledge...Psets took WAY too long. Pset solution sessions often ended in a collective, desperate, crazed laughter. I shouldn't have to use recent primary literature to solve an intro bio pset.The papers in the beginning were too long to understand and cover in section. 10 page ones at the end were better.",
    "I would not happily recommend it to another student. It was poorly constructed and does not teach what you expect. It is a lot of work that is irrelevant to current biological issues. It is a bit of an unfair grading pattern as this class really teaches experimental methods while it fails to provide any means of being able to fully understand these methods through hands on application.",
    "Don't listen to what all the whiners say: its not that hard and you learn a lot! Take it!",
    "Amazing that you can read some scientific papers and understand what they are saying! I would definitely reccomend it if your ready for a reasonable work load.",
    "Trust me. It gets better after 101. This course looks challenging but it is manageable. You will get through. The readings are tough but by the end of the semester you will get a good grasp of all the readings. Professor Mooseker is extremely entertaining in class. But do remember a lot of time outside class needs to put in order to understand the topics.",
    "yes, take bio 102! Although probably more suited towards science majors, definitely a wonderful class.",
    "if you have experience working in labs and know this stuff already, itd probably be really cool, but if you're just starting out, I wouldn't recommend it unless they need it. its not clear what you can do exactly to learn the material and is pretty disorganized, though will probably be better next year.",
    "Don't expect this to be a walk in the park. You will have to study before exams and keep up.",
    "Bio 102 is extremely difficult and I would only take it if you need it for your major. This is not an intro to cell bio as that was what I thought it would be. You can definitely do well in this class if you study a lot for the midterm and final.",
    "Biol 102 is incredibly difficult to follow without previous biology experience. I would not recommend the class to someone who is taking biology for the first time or without AP biology background.",
    "No, I would not recommend Bio 102. This class should have been cleaned up and planned out more before being offered. There is a wide range of proficiencies in biology among the students in this class because it is an introductor mogul, which does not help the people teaching it. The work is difficult and hard to relate to lecture, the sections are unhelpful, and the class did not help me understand how to do problem sets. As a result of my bad experience with this class, I do not believe that I will be taking Bio 103\/104.",
    "I would recommend Biology 102 to another student. It is challenging, but rewarding in that you learn relevant information at an amazing rate.",
    "I would not recommend this class, but because of the difficulty of the placement test, students are forced to take it.",
    "I came in loving biology and came out of this class hating it. It's ironic how this sequence is supposed to encourage people to major in biology because the predominant sentiment for students who've taken this class is just the opposite. If this course wasn't required for all biology majors (and pre-meds probably), I would do ANYTHING I could to get out of it. Unfortunately, placing out is pretty difficult. If you must take it, adjust your course load accordingly--this is definitely not a class you can coast through. If you're a non-science major, any other science class would be easier. In fact, even organic chemistry might be easier than this bio course (I took both and found bio much harder). I absolutely do not recommend this class to anyone (if you like bio, it will destroy your love for the subject). It was terribly disorganized and ridiculously difficult (much harder than organic chemistry). Even with an AP 5 background, I'm constantly lost in class, despite how much effort I put in. In addition, I feel like it's not a fair course in the sense that the amount of time you spend will not be reflected in your grades. Also, unless you have a strong background in biology, be prepared to do a lot of self-studying outside of class to catch up on concepts that you will already be expected to know in class, more than I think any introductory course should require. This means putting in inordinate amounts of effort outside of class to even understand any terminology used in lecture, much less the actual concepts. As an introductory course, it's interesting how little time we spend on anything introductory. Because we never cover big picture things, you lose the relevancy of the things discussed. Instead, we spend all the time focusing on the microscopic details--it's like trying to understand calculus when you've never learned basic algebra.",
    "I would say that this course requires a lot of self-learning outside of the course because it's very difficult to learn from the lectures and that the course is very time consuming. I would not recommend this course if they did not have to take it for major or pre-med requirements. This course is making me seriously evaluate my major choice because I disliked it so much. As an introductory course, I feel like this course would discourage any potential Biology majors, which is not fair, as one poorly presented and taught course at such an early stage of learning could discourage people from learning biology at higher levels.",
    "Biology 102 is much more challenging than Biology 101 and you should be prepared to put the extra effort in. I would not recommend taking this class unless it is needed as a prerequisite for another class, your major, or graduate\/medical school.",
    "Do not take this course. I do not know a single student who enjoyed biol 102. Most people either despised the course or, at best, were coping with it. This course has the potential to ruin your half semester. Don't take it unless you have to, as a requirement.",
    "Biology 102 is a logical extension of Biology 101; be prepared to give your best and don't get too caught up trying to psycho-analyze Professor Mooseker's skits. If you haven't taken the prerequisites (a year at least each in biology, chemistry, and physics) you're going to start behind; but you are completely capable of catching up with the rest as long as you are willing to actually make the effort.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in biology.",
    "I only took it because I did not test out of this module, whereas I tested out of the other modules. I learned how to very specifically do the types of questions presented in the course, but I think this is one of the worst introductory biology courses ever.",
    "I only took Biol 102 because I didn't place out of the module. I feel more confused now than I did entering the course, and I took AP Biology in high school. In fact, every day in lecture I was confused as to what exactly I was supposed to be learning since the lectures are so poorly organized. Even now, I'm not sure if I learned anything regarding cell biology at all.",
    "Unless they restructure this class completely, I would not recommend taking this class. I thought this material was not at all at an introductory level. There was a lot of assumed knowledge, and I found that really frustrating. Also, this class should really have been called Research Methods in Cell Physiology given the focus on experiments and experimental methods. I did learn a lot, but it was too much in just a few topics and not enough comprehensive study at the same time.",
    "It's tough to get a hang of at first, and lectures are not clear, but between reading papers in sections and going to review sessions (where suddenly the professor's microphone works and he can explain things incredibly clearly without random skits), you will learn a lot. Hated it at first, but so glad I took it now that I realize how much I have learned.",
    "If you are taking this course, you probably have to take it. If you are choosing between this, and say a \"non-science\" science for your SC, take the other one. However, this class could improve a lot in the next few years.",
    "It can be a quite interesting class, but if you don't have a good background, it might be a bit difficult. If you're not that interested in cell bio, some of the topics seem irrelevant, but the lab techniques covered are worth learning.",
    "Biol 102 is a lot of work, but I liked it SO much more than 101. I feel as if I learned more, and on top of that, the content was really interesting. Also, Professor Mooseker is a riot. Seeing him laying on the floor grabbing his colleagues' ankles is worth the pain caused by those aggravating P-sets. Definitely take it if you're interested in science.",
    "Biology 102 is a tough course. It is not organized very well and it is a huge change from biology 101. You need to make sure you put enough time aside to do the problem sets and do all the reading. The problem sets are difficult because they are very much experimentally based like \"design an experiment to...\" I would recommend it only if you have to take it. It does not feel like an introductory course.",
    "A step up from Bio 101, with more in-depth information being thrown at us. I'd recommend it for those who wish to continue down bio\/chem\/pre-med tracks or those who still want to keep these options open",
    "It's difficult and often somewhat exasperating, but once you get it, you really know. Knowledge builds on itself and there are a lot of resources available to help you. You learn a ton and it's mostly very important and useful material. Take it if you're willing to work and want to learn, but don't take it if you're expecting a repeat of AP Biology.",
    "Unless you want to major in biology, need this class as a prereq, or are premed, do NOT take this course. If you simply have a cursory interest in biology you'd like to explore, be forewarned: this class is not taught at an intro level and assumes a lot of prior knowledge. The pacing of this course means you have to learn all the theoretical aspects of the particular unit (aka what exactly is happening in the cell), as well as understand the variety of experimental techniques used to reach those conclusions and be able to apply those techniques yourself. In other words, this class is excellent for training future cell biologists, especially given its focus on experimentation, but many people taking this course are NOT biology majors. If you're looking for a course just to gain an understanding of basic biology, or because you liked biology in high school, this is not the course you should be looking at. As someone put it, \"I need an intro class to this intro class.\"",
    "Lecture is fast-paced, and material is fairly difficult, but very interesting. Problem sets and tests are much easier in comparison to material covered in lecture.",
    "Only take it if you need it for a major.",
    "it is hard as a motherfuck. but, the course is very interesting, I learned a great deal of material in substantial depth. This course would definitely be helpful to anyone considering a major in the biological sciences. but GODDAMN it is difficult",
    "I think so--the material is very interesting, but somewhat difficult to keep up with!",
    "This class was ridiculous. They claim to teach intro bio but I was constantly confused during lecture because the material was so advanced. Prof Mooseker also doesn't explain things well at all.",
    "Absolutely not. I did not like this course very much because of its specificity. Professor Mark Mooseker is very enthusiastic about the type of work that he does in research, and this comes across very clearly in his teaching of BIOL 102. But in that, he completely misses the point of this course being an \"introduction\" to Cell Biology&Membrane Physiology. The bottom line is: before this \"intro\" course started, I expected to be able to answer people cogently when they asked me \"What is a chloroplast?\" Of course, I will be able to since I have learned about it on my own. But, theoretically, a student who has finished this course will not be able to because not one time has the word \"chloroplast\" or plant cell biology even been mentioned, and instead, we have been getting immersed--and lost--in the dense detail of the transport mechanism between the Golgi Complex and Endoplasmic Reticulum.The book readings were way too dense for an introductory course, that a lot of my friends claimed they needed an \"intro\" course to this \"intro\" course. That number of friends was in the dozens, not just a handful.His slides often jumped from topic to topic. There was little writing, so he expected us to write down details. But, the thing is professor, we cannot do that unless you speak louder, slower, and really intonate to emphasize points you would like for us to know. Not say something quietly, perform demos on trivial details that are not on the exams, and then give us problems on the homework that we sometimes did not even talk about in lecture.Unless you are comfortable with being assumed to know a ton of prior knowledge, I would look into Thomas Pollard's Cell Biology course and not this one. This course made my sophomore academic experience a dismal one. I did not look forward to it ever.",
    "good, basic intro to biology. i loved the material and was able to learn it well on my own (i have trouble focusing in lectures)",
    "Take the class if you have to, otherwise not really a fun class or super easy class.",
    "I would recommend this course for another student full-heartedly. They should know before entering it that the problem sets can be very long and confusing, but they are really a very helpful tool in your learning of the subject. For any student choosing to take biology in the future, I think it is an essential course to your career. For students that are not required to have this class for their major, I would suggest not taking this course unless you are very interested in taking it for the material.",
    "Biology 102 is not a very great introductory course. I feel like introductory courses should have less depth and more breadth, and this class is the exact opposite of that. If you take this class, be prepared for a LOT of work and a lot of teaching yourself.",
    "If it weren't required for them to take it, I would absolutely not recommend them taking it. It is not really an intro class (though it tries to pose as one). I feel that there really wasn't a deep conceptual understanding required in order to ultimately do well in the class, but that kinda scares me, especially if this was supposed to prepare me for higher level courses. The professor was enthusiastic and lively, which I suppose would be a plus for this class.",
    "Very focused on critical thinking skills",
    "The class is a struggle. The bio department need to shape up because this class was not a positive experience.",
    "Difficult and very challenging but within reasonable reach. I would only recommend this course to a student who is sure they are going to use biology as a large part of their career (pre-meds, bio-med engingeers, etc.).",
    "Do not take this class unless you're a premed and have to take it, or you're a biology genius.",
    "Getting mixed messages about whether or not to take the class? If you like nature, and by extension biology, do not take the class, which is more about the laboratory, which can be expected of a cell biology class. It focuses on the amazingness of scientists rather than the amazingness of biology itself. It is a lot of work, and is often very frustrating, especially when you think of all the guinea pigs and mice that were sacrificed.",
    "This course is much more intensive than BIOL 101. Far from an introductory biology course, it focuses on a few different topics and presents a great amount of detail. There's definitely a lot of assumed prior knowledge, so if you haven't taken AP Bio you're going to be in for half a semester of pure struggle. Additionally, if you don't wholeheartedly love biology you may find lecture rather uninteresting. Homework and assigned readings are time consuming, but you can usually complete the homework with only the information given in lecture (albeit with a lot of critical thinking). Also, be sure to read the textbook. It helps loads.",
    "I would not recommend 102 to another student.",
    "Biology 102 should be named microscopes, membranes, and methodology. It's not mucho bueno.",
    "A lot harder than Bio 101; Should do reading - unlike in bio 101 where you could get away with not doing it; psets every week; must read a journal for section every week. I learned a lot more new things but had to spend extra time outside of class to really digest concepts. It was cool that we learned about how biologists actually do research and the tools they use.",
    "If someone has the option of placing out of BIOL102 but is considering taking an Intro Bio Course to understand the basics well, then DON'T take this class. The material presented in this class is upper leveled and not introductory and you mineswell get credit for taking an upper leveled course if your going to be learning upper leveled material. If you have to take this class, it is difficult. This class requires extra studying and reviewing of material. However, if you put the time into the class, your grade reflects every amount of effort you put in. Professor Mooseker is fair when he says that problem sets are the hardest types of problems you will see. The tests are very fair and although you'll get bad grades on the psets (hopefully the class is curved), they adequately prepare you for the examinations.",
    "I would take it if you like biology.",
    "Biology 102 is not a course to take UNLESS you NEED to. Don't take it for a science credit, don't take it if you're contemplating biology or premed (if you're unsure, save yourself half of a semester): ONLY take it if you are SURE about being a premed student or if you want to major in biology and work in a lab. The problem sets are really confusing, the papers don't really support the concepts (50 minutes of section is used to discuss a confusing paper when it should function as a Q&A considering how many questions there were), but the tests were surprisingly manageable.",
    "Lots of work, lots of looking up questions on piazza, lots of wikipedia involved.However, this class has taught me a lot in biology. The amount of information you learn is incredible.",
    "Bio 102 is an introductory science course and should only be taken for a requirement. Professor Mooseker is entertaining, but often times very difficult to understand. Because of the lack of comprehension, lectures are often times very difficult to get through. Sections were completely useless but they were a requirement. The final was hard, the midterm was easy. Take this class if you have to, but not if you don't.",
    "I think this class is a great, rewarding class. Although there are some kinks that need to be worked out in this new class, Professor Mooseker and the TFs made the class so rewarding. The material and the tests are challenging, but I think the class is worth the challenge because of the amount of material you have to learn.",
    "NOOOOOOOOO! It was terrible. Feel like I haven't learned anything important. The material we did learn was too specific for intro bio. People need more background! like in biol 101, that was waay better!",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It is way more interesting than an intro to bio course especially if you already have a lot of background knowledge like I did.",
    "I would recommend it. It's going to frustrate and challenge you, especially if it is one of your first science classes at Yale. You will, however, learn a lot if you stick with it. I feel like it's good preparation for the fact that sometimes you will get 60% on a test, and that will be a good score--there are few classes like that here. Prof. Mooseker makes the material fun; definitely try to reach out to him and go to his review sessions. Not only are they helpful, but knowing the man behind the material will make you appreciate it more.",
    "You will learn a lot in this class, but it will be a struggle. Regardless if youplace out of this course, take it. You'll learn a lot about cell biology. The class itself was organized very poorly, but I expect that to change as Biol 102 gets refined. Take it if you have good self-study capabilities and are looking for an in-depth course in cell biology.",
    "Challenging--definitely doable, but be prepared to spend a lot of time on it! Well beyond the level of AP biology in terms of the depth of material covered, but concepts aren't too bad.",
    "Tough class with supposedly generous curve. Do not expect an A.",
    "Biology 102 was a class that received a lot of bad rep., but I thought it was a great biology class! Of course, like any Yale class it was difficult and it made you think. But would you rather memorize a lot of random facts? At first, I did not enjoy studying the different experimental procedures, but it made more sense and became more interesting as we started applying them. All this being said, the weekly problem sets were close to impossible for me. I always relied on the peer tutor to get them completed! On the other hand, the weekly research papers were not at all bad. They became easier as the semester continued (I love the fact that now I can read a research paper without being intimidated by all the jargon). And the exams test your understanding and thinking capabilities as opposed to your memorizing skills (which I think is great!). And finally, professor Mooseker is THE BEST! He made the class so much more fun and interesting and he actually cares about the students! He has held so many review sessions (actually every week) just because of all the students' complaints about not understanding the concepts. He even held a final review sessions with 101 degree fever! He is also very passionate about his research, but this can sometimes make the class kind of confusing. It is also sometimes hard to hear what he says, maybe because there were almost 400 students in my class. I would definitely recommend this class to those who have taken AP Biology, but it will be really difficult for those who have not. At the end of the semester though, you'll feel really great for having survived such a class!",
    "It's a challenge. I wouldn't recommend this course to someone who really wasn't considering majoring in biology or going into premed.",
    "Don't do it if you don't have to, certainly if they keep it as such a huge lecture. If they change it into smaller classes, then give it a shot. But really, go take a freshman seminar instead.",
    "The most poorly taught course I have ever taken. Lectures are disorganized and targeted at an audience that has a strong background in biology. Even though this is supposed to be in introductory course, the professor assumes you already know everything intro and goes straight into detailed studies. I found it ironic how he would talk about the pancreas and how it secreted enzymes when half of the class had no idea where it was or what its function is. The problem sets are overly difficult and often very poorly worded. The midterm was easy but the final killed everyone. Chances are you have to take it if you're reading this is just make sure you have a good study group and try to keep up during lecture. I will warn you that lecture is difficult to understand and incoherent.Sections are interesting because you have to read a scientific paper for each. They may seem difficult at first but really are not that bad. I actually enjoyed section a lot.Don't take it if you have the choice.",
    "It's hard, but manageable if time is put in. Take it if you need to.",
    "Wait a year before taking it so that hopefully they can lend better balance to the class in terms of material.",
    "HARDEST CLASS EVER. Do not take unless you're absolutely positive you want to be pre-med. It is not an intro class and will be very discouraging.",
    "Unadvisable. Although it is a prerequisite for taking higher level biology courses, I would avoid taking this course.",
    "rigorous and challenging introduction to experimentally-based biology; hones critical thinking",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I learned SO much.",
    "Take it if science and the course material amaze you and you care to understand it as fully as possible. Avoid if you want a good lecture.",
    "Biology 102 is a tough intro course with a decent amount of reading, but it will give you the skills you need to understand experimental methods and research and how they apply to current views of cell membrane physiology.",
    "This class was terrible, do not take it if you can avoid it. It was a horrible, horrible experience. It was way too hard for an intro level course on cell bio (which should assume no prior knowledge) and causes no end of stress, anxiety, and anger every lecture you attend. There are supplemental lectures on the weekends because the regular lectures dont make sense to anyone. The problem sets are hard and take forever. There is no set text so the reading is always scattered and doesn't even help. It's not worth it, it's really not worth it. Don't do it.",
    "I would recommend Bio 102 to a prospective science major with interest in biology. It is pretty challenging and definitely not a good course for any non-science majors.",
    "Biology 102 is an extremely interesting and extremely difficult class. Most of the material was based on laboratory protocol. It would be helpful to have lab experience before entering the class. Take it if you need to or are interested in biology and prepared for a class of this level of difficulty.",
    "Not for nonscience majors AT ALL but it's required so....",
    "Bio 102 was both my best and worst class of the semester. It was good in the way that it really trains you to think about the concepts in biology and how to design experiments based on those principles. However, this class was also incredibly confusing at times, and the problem sets are incredibly hard and time consuming. Also, the curve isn't expected to be great due to the number of pre-meds in the class. If you have to take the class, take it, but I wouldn't recommend this class for anyone who doesn't need it as a prereq.",
    "Unfortunately this class is required for many majors, and though it is manageable, it is a poor introduction to cell biology. Most of the class is focused on learning lab methods for specific experiments. There was a huge amount of detail given on these experiments, but very few major concepts were covered.",
    "Wouldn't recommend it unless you have to take it.",
    "Much harder than you would expect an intro level biology class to be - I would only recommend it to students who definitely want to pursue biology",
    "Bio 102 is an incredibly challenging course that will be painful while you go through it but in the end you will be more than glad that you did it. If you are up for the challenge then definitely go for it.",
    "Hard, but it will make you learn a lot.",
    "Biology 102 is a tough but manageable course. It goes way beyond most high school biology, even AP. You learn about different experimental techniques used by biologists and then apply them to different parts of the cell. This class requires a lot of work and studying to keep up.",
    "Yes! Take it if you need it. It's dry if you looking for an elective, but it's a great class if you need it!",
    "If you have to take this, then you've got no choice. Otherwise, this is not an easy science credit.",
    "Biology 102 is Cell biology. If you have a good background in high school biology and can think about science, you will love the course. You will learn a lot even if you have had AP Biology before. Be prepared to work. The problem sets can be challenging as they really require you to think. This is a great course for someone who is truely interested in biology.",
    "Personally, I really liked the way this courses teaches biology, that is, through experimental analysis. However, it definitely needs to be reworked. The class is way too large. The slides are poorly put together and a struggle to decipher.",
    "Fairly difficult for an Intro bio course, but covers a wide variety of material in a way you probably haven't seen before. The class is more focused on critical thinking, thinking like a scientist, scientific papers, and applying your knowledge to hypothetical experiments and less strictly regurgitating facts.",
    "Terrible class; do not take it until the organizers of the course make dramatic changes and reassess their philosophy regarding this course.",
    "This was a challenging class for an introductory biology course, but the material is very interesting. You learn not only the facts, but also the experiments that lead to their discoveries. The assessments are all very much applications of material learned in class, as opposed to simple regurgitation of information. Problem sets and mandatory section also factor into your grade, meaning it is not totally dependent on tests, which is nice.",
    "I would not recommend it simply because I think taking Cell Biology itself would give students a better basis than this class, which focused on research techniques in the context of cell biology more than I would have like.",
    "I would say the Biol102 is not a intro cell bio course. It teaches one specific concept throughout the semester, rather than giving a broad overview of the cell. I would not recommend it.",
    "this course is too hard and not an intro course",
    "Hard but doable. Take advantage of the resources given to you (i.e. piazza, peer tutor, post doc, prof, etc.)",
    "This class approached basic concepts of molecular Bio from an experimental-process\/problem solving angle, and so was a good follow up to AP Bio. However, It was certainly not your standard introBio course. At moments the class lacked organization, making it more confusing that necessary, but what Professor Mooseker lacks in organization he makes up for in amusing class demos.",
    "Biology 102 is definitely more challenging than 101, even for students with a background in high school biology. That being said, if you study hard, you'll do really well in the class, and there are a lot of systems in place to help you succeed. Overall, a class that is great for people who are just interested in biology or who want to actually pursue it.",
    "The lectures are not very helpful and you have to do a lot of self-taught learning.",
    "Biology 102 was one of the strangestcourses I have ever taken. Looking back on it, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really learn that much cell bio. Pretty much all of the time was spend on experiments, experimental design and reading papers. These are helpful skills but not really cell biology. Professor Mooseker is a very nice man. He put in a lot of effort into trying to make the class the best he could make it. However, it was just disorganized. We covered 100 slide powerpoints in one class. Most are just pictures of cells, with no explanation or real significance.",
    "Only take Bio 102 if you need to. It's sooo much work so please be prepared.",
    "Biology 102 is a difficult class with a somewhat overwhelming workload, but it's also a course that will teach you a lot if you put in the time to read the textbook, be attentive during lecture and use all the resources provided by the professor, teaching assistants, peer tutor and Piazza. I found cell biology very interesting once I actually learned to appreciate the concepts, and while this course is more focused on research and application than it is on concepts, if you find a way to teach yourself the concepts it's really very valuable. Of course it's frustrating that lecture itself doesn't teach concepts, so that's something to keep in mind when you weigh the strengths and weaknesses of this course against each other.Still, I'd recommend this class to a fellow student. It's an interesting approach to cell biology, and you get to learn from a brilliant professor. You also get to read advanced scientific papers, which is a rewarding experience, and at the end of the day it feels really good to challenge yourself to grasp advanced science concepts. Of course if you're someone who needs a good lecturer in order to succeed, this probably isn't a good class for you, because you have to really self-advocate and do a lot of the learning on your own.",
    "I would highly recommend bio 102 if you're interested in bio and want to pursue a career related with bio. Even if you're not sure, I think this is a good test to see how vested you are in this subject and a possible career related to this field.",
    "I really enjoy biology, especially cell biology, and while the material was interesting, we didn't focus very much on the actual cell. It was mostly experimental method and research papers. While I learned to think critically about the experiments, I wish I had learned more about the cell. It wasn't until the second half of the class that we actually learned about things inside the cell, like the cytoskeleton and golgi; however, Mooseker would jump into a lecture about the ER resident proteins or lysosomal proteins without actually explaining what the organelles involved did in the cell. People who hadn't taken biology since 9th grade were lost. Mooseker's lectures jumped around and he always had slides in the lecture that weren't on the handout. None of his slides had captions, so I never knew what was happening. The homeworks were nearly impossible because he didn't explain the material. Although he improved his lecture style as the class progressed, you have to be prepared to learn the material on your own.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I felt that I had learned nothing from lecture and had to read over the textbook and notes to learn all of the material. I had not taken AP Biology before, and in this introductory course, they assumed that many people had a high level of background knowledge.",
    "Good class but a student needs to keep organized and use the texts tremendously to complement understanding.",
    "Only if you have to. I felt that I didn't learn that much from this class and thought we went into too much detail about not very useful topics. I'm still unsure of how what I learned in this class relates to real biology and science, and how useful any of the information I learned actually is.",
    "This class is very experimentally driven, a characteristic not seen in most bio classes, but one that is very helpful moving forward. For any one one who wants to work in a lab, you should take this course! The homework was challenging for me, but I thought the exams were fair.",
    "I would recommend Biology 102 only if the student needs it for a requirement.",
    "BIO 102 probably should have been a better class, considering the enthusiasm of the professor and the fact that it's supposed to be intro bio. Unfortunately, the class was really disorganized in the order that material was presented, making it really difficult to keep up\/understand material as it came. It was also a struggle because it seemed that most of the class - which was huge btw - was freshmen who got 5s on the AP while I had no bio experience besides an awful teacher freshman year of high school. This made the class frustrating because I felt like no one - the Professor or other students - even realized how much work\/how difficult this class actually was in practice. We didn't focus much on normal intro topics - i.e. 10 minutes of the last lecture on mitosis - which was also upsetting since that's really what I was hoping for\/expecting. Maybe in the future they'll try to improve this class..",
    "Biology 102 provides a very in-depth curriculum that doesn't shy away from the details. While it is a manageable course, it's difficult and requires a lot of studying even for those with much previous experience in biology. For those without past experience, it is probably immensely more difficult. While you do end up learning the topics covered inside and out, it covers information that is perhaps too specific for an introductory course. If I did recommend Biology 102 to another student (given it's half-semester nature, most students will have to take this course anyway), I would let him\/her know that it requires much time and that a study group is incredibly helpful, if not necessary, to be successful with this course.",
    "A lot of people complained about the level of difficulty of Biol 102, but the truth is that the homework, midterm, and final were quite reasonable. Compared to some of the ridiculous problem sets that other courses at Yale, the questions on the problem sets for Biol 102 were extremely reasonable. The exams were completely doable for anybody who studied the material and understood it. This course is not a course that you simply memorize the material for; Prof Mooseker really gives you the tools to do some of your own thinking.",
    "If I had the option of placing out, I would. This class focused on incredibly in-depth details that non-bio majors probably won't need to know in the future. You will find this class frustrating unless you keep up with the reading and stay on top of the material. Prof. Mooseker's lectures go at a fast pace and are often difficult to understand unless you've read the textbook beforehand and synthesized the material on your own. But overall, this class is definitely doable and not as challenging as other science classes I've taken.",
    "Just like Biology 101, don't take this course unless you need to in order to be a bio major or for pre-med. This class was extremely boring and most people never even went to lecture because it was souseless.",
    "NO! Do not take this class, Mark Mooseker is a complete sham and a terrible man. To explain why you shouldn't take this class, I'll attach my review of him, as a professor!Mark Mooseker, read my lips: You do not belong in the classroom. Go back to the biology laboratory that you crawled out of and leave undergraduates alone. You truly do not understand the concept of teaching. Your job is to convey new knowledge, you must teach undergraduates in a reasonable, and comprehensible manner. You did none of this.You taught us what your laboratory did, you placed emphasis on your incredibly small fraction of biological knowledge, without addressing the greater issues of membrane physiology, which is the class I THOUGHT I signed up for.Additionally, this class was an INTRODUCTORY course. Learn to define new terms with terms your students understand. I found myself scrambling for a textbook to learn the terms you were using to define other things we HADN'T learned yet. In other words, you left us in the dark.Furthermore, your in-class demonstrations were literally meaningless. They were funny yes, but we were laughing AT YOU! You failed to comprehend that we were laughing at the aloof wild man who had NO idea his students had NO CLUE what was happening in the class.Thank you Mark Mooseker, for wasting eight weeks of my life.",
    "If you wantto learn some of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasics\u00e2\u0080\u009d (I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a ground point for comparison of what \u00e2\u0080\u009cbasic\u00e2\u0080\u009d is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6) of Cell Biology and Membrane Physiology, then this is the class for you. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a biological science major and\/or are pre-med, then you kind of have to take this course anyway. Approach it with an open mind and a thirst for learning, otherwise, yea, this course might be hell for you. BIOL 102 had weekly psets and a weekly scientific paper to read and discuss during weekly discussion section. There were two midterms.I felt like I learned a lot in BIOL 102 (though many will probably differ from my opinion), but not necessarily what I thought I would be learning about. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly an \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntro\u00e2\u0080\u009d course. What I expected to learn from the class was presented in a different approach. I expected them to tell us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is what this organelle does, and this is what this other organelle does. Memorize.\u00e2\u0080\u009d. They ended up teaching us what each organelle does in a more experimental way, i.e. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can use this experimental approach to find out that this happens\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh and did I mention that this is what happens?\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It was an unfamiliar way of teaching and learning, but I enjoyed it: it made my brain think and really absorb the information.Professor Mooseker was quite the character. His class organization was not as clean as Professor Koelle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (BIOL 101). I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite sure what he wanted us to learn from lecture. Nevertheless, Professor Mooseker was extremely dedicated and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t express how thankful I am for all the review sessions he took the time out to do for us. His somewhat silly in-class demos livened up the crowd. Sierra was an amazing postdoc to have for discussion section.",
    "Cell bio is cell bio, so be prepared to drown in a sea of information. This class is much more challenging than Bio 101. However, the stuff you are learning is, in my opinion, far more interesting and engaging. Professor Mooseker loves his experimental methods and expects you to think critically about how certain aspects and functions of the cell have been characterized and studied. Mooseker himself is literally the best. You will never have a professor who hosts supplemental review sessions himself, so appreciate him to the fullest while you can. Quirky and genius, not to mention hilarious. It's obvious to see that he cares about his students knowing the material and doing well, but he won't coddle you (which he shouldn't, welcome to Yale).",
    "I would recommend the course to a student if they were sure that they wanted to take biology as a major. If they were unsure or did not have a strong biology background I would not recommend the course.",
    "This course seemed to be slightly more difficult than an introductory biology course, especially for students who did not have experience with experimental methods. However, now I am excited to carry out the methods and try the different microscopy techniques that we learned. I would recommend it to a student that is interested in the cellular aspects of biology, and who needs the course as a prerequisite.",
    "I would reccommend it for anyone that has to take it, wants to move to higher science classes, or who loves lab experiments, but otherwise I would not.",
    "Biology 102 was a disaster of a class. I would tell the student to wait as long as they can to take it so some of the kinks in the style of teaching can be worked out.",
    "It is a worthwhile class to take and if you are reading this, chances are you have to take it anyways. It can be dry and boring at times but pay attention and you will be able to understand Dr. Mooseker soon enough.",
    "Bio 102 was poorly taught. Take if Mooseker is NOT the teacher. Did a terrible job and info is way out of a 102 class.",
    "Bio 102 is a good class, but is a bit disconcerting in that it focuses very specifically on a few topics of cell biology without discussion of the larger ideas.",
    "It's a lot harder than BIOL 101. Requires understanding of experimental concepts that are unfortunately hard to grasp if you've never worked in a lab setting.",
    "I absolutely HATED this course.Strengths: NONEWeaknesses: Professor Mooseker, in my opinion, cannot teach. He does not properly enunciate, he is very disorganized, he has horrible PowerPoint slides that only have images that you are left to decipher on your own, he conducts demonstrations during class that most people do not understand, and he makes a lot of assumptions about previous knowledge that he should not make. Although it is clear that Professor Mooseker does care about students understanding the material, as he had weekly Sunday review sessions, I was still not able to learn ANYTHING from him.Doing the homework in this class was a weekly ordeal. The questions asked were all structured in the form of experiments and very difficult to answer. The tests in the course were structured similarly. Instead of testing for your knowledge of the material, ALL the test questions seemed to be looking for students who had a certain thought process and were able to be presented with complex experiments and somehow use their knowledge of that experiment to fix it. This was very difficult to do and it did not seem fair to me that no questions asked for simple understanding of facts and concepts in a straight-forward manner.Section was also a waste of time in that it did not help much with the material learned in class. Every week, for section, we were asked to read complex scientific papers. I did not find this helpful because on top of learning difficult material in lecture, even more difficult material was thrown at us on a weekly basis in the form of these papers. So instead of having section be a time to clarify the material learned in class, it was a time to learn new, more complex material. I think that time in section could have been spent MUCH more constructively if it was used to clarify the material learned in class and go over Key Concepts.Overall, taking this class was a terrible experience. I felt directionless and lost throughout the whole course. Everything I learned in this course came from my own reading of the textbook, despite attending every class, and even then, I was not able to perform well in the course.I would NOT recommend this course.",
    "Don't take this course if you've only had high school biology and Bio 101. It is so difficult. The syllabus needs to be drastically altered.",
    "If you can avoid taking this course, avoid it.",
    "Don't take this course. It is not truly an intro course, and you will be doing a lot of rote memorization.",
    "I would recommend taking this class as long as you are sure to focus in class and be very attentive to what the professor says.",
    "Biology 102 has a heavy focus on research--how researchers discovered different transport methods in the cell and how you can apply research methods to different problems. For me personally, i do notgenerally find that particularly interesting since I am not interested in research. I also found lectures a little hard to follow during class. However, you will learn a lot about cell biology, particularly from a researcher's perspective, if you take this class.",
    "Biology 102 is not an easy course. I recommend forming a study group with other students taking the class and meeting at least once every week. Although section is helpful for understanding the lectures, truly understanding all the information requires more time with the material and working with other students really helps. I would recommend this course to any student who is no taking more than one other science or math course because this course requires a lot of time outside of class.",
    "No, only take this class if you have to. The material is much harder than expected. Focus on experimental analysis makes the material even more challenging.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "I definitely did not like this course as much as BIOL 101. It did go in-depth into certain areas of cell biology and made me think more critically in terms of designing experiments. However, I think the sacrifice of breadth for depth was a bit too drastic; I didn't learn that many different components of cell biology and membrane physiology. Also, the class was much more disorganized than 101 and was a bit confusing at times and often assumed students knew certain biology terms even though this course is meant to be accessible for students who have no biology background other than 101. The problem sets were difficult and graded harshly; it was basically impossible to do well on them without a large study group to discuss with, the internet, and several hours. Even so, with some work, the course is solid and definitely manageable. If you're going to be a biology major\/premed, you have to take this course, so you probably don't have much choice!",
    "I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend this course. Only take it if your major requires it. It's a VERY disorganized course. The powerpoint slides don't make sense, and it often takes a greater amount of time to decipher than to understand the material. The course material might be interesting for a smaller setting, but is unsuited for a large INTRO lecture course. It really isn't a intro course, and it really help if you have some sort of AP bio background. Prof Mooseker tends to mumble and not articulate his words so even if you do stay awake\/go to lecture, it's unlikely that you can understand>60% of the lecture.Also, don't buy Sadava (a complete waste of money).",
    "This was the first year of this class, so take all these reviews with a grain of salt - a lot could be done differently by next year.If you're just thinking of taking this class for fun, I'd say don't take it. If you have to take it, just go ahead and take it. I wouldn't say its fun, but it's not terrible. It got a lot better as the quarter went on, and I imagine it will keep getting better through the next year.This class is not a ton of work - just 1 problem set per week, reading (no one did the reading though), a midterm, and an exam. The important thing to understand going into this class is that P. Mooseker is trying to teach you to think like a scientist more than what scientists have already discovered. This means a lot of lab techniques and questions about how you test for a certain thing, and not as many about the known facts of biology.P. Mooseker is not a great lecturer. There was a lot of sleeping going on, and he does not speak clearly. But he does provide the lecture slides online, so you can just go read them on your own time. Unfortunately, they actually made more sense to me alone that with the accompanying lecture.",
    "This module is definitely harder than 101! Professor Mooseker has a lecturing style that is often difficult to follow. However, the homework really help and I felt that I understood the material better after doing them.",
    "Bio 102 is a good course in membrane biology. It goes pretty in depth and most people are unlikely to know most of the material (as opposed to Bio 101). 102 is less memorization and spitting back facts and more logic and understanding broad concepts. I would recommend this course to students. In my opinion, it is much better than 101.",
    "Not if you have not done any biology before. Very tough course. Almost felt like a 300 level course.",
    "I would recommend it because it's an interesting class and professor Mooseker is a great professor an the papers were interesting to learn about.",
    "I would definitely recommend Bio 102 to other students. It was a great course that offered a very good introduction into cell biology and the study of cell membranes. It really got me interested in the field and taking more courses of this kind.",
    "Better than BIOL 101, but this one is a bit more difficult because the info is so far spanning. Not easily summarized in key points.",
    "This is a good class. It is incredibly large (hundreds of students) and the experimental techniques in the beginning of the course can be a lot to remember, but the course material is interesting, and the Professor and TAs really tried their best. Also, this particular module is definitely not a repeat of AP Biology at all. If you take this course, my advice is to sit near the front, because sometimes the instructor is rather hard to hear, and to definitely attend all of the Sunday review sessions.",
    "Take the class if you're interested in biology; definitely take the class if you are interested in research. The class focuses heavily on the analysis and interpretation of experimental results and relating those results to concepts in biology.",
    "It is an intro course but does count on you having a general familiarity with the biological sciences.",
    "Yes, it's an easy intro course",
    "Bio 102 is a huge lecture that is pretty boring to go to. You probably won't want to go and will be checking the clock after about 15 minutes in class. However, the reading is pretty interesting, sections are great, and the tests are fun to take, too.",
    "This is a great class! Professor Mooseker went to enormous lengths toengage the students and to clarify the material. I have rarely seen such a dedicated teacher.This was the first time BIO 102 was offered, and as a new class, there were obviously a few kinks in how the material was presented, so if you see some negative reviews, please keep that in mind.We learned cell biology using a lot of landmark papers, which was incredibly exciting. I gained a new found appreciation for the power and beauty of scientific research.",
    "Biology 102 introduces students to experimental techniques in cell biology and uses these techniques to explore several organelles in exquisite detail. After starting with an overview of microscopy, immunoassays, and biochemical methods relevant to cell biology, this course examines the properties of the plasma membrane, the exocytic and endocytic pathways, the cytoskeleton, intercellular junctions, and mitosis. Although it is a great deal of work, Biology 102 teaches students to think in new ways and enables them to interpret experimental data in cell biology.If you are considering this class, you probably have to take it to fulfill premed requirements or prerequisites for your intended major. Although I suggest that you begin the biology modules as soon as possible, having a thorough knowledge of general chemistry will make this class significantly easier. In addition, this class is exceptionally difficult and entails a great deal of work, so make sure that you have enough open time in your schedule before you commit to this class.",
    "Bio 102 is a hard 'intro' course. The professor did try to make it easier to understand by trying to explain more of the terminology he was using, but it was often hard for me to understand him (I couldn't hear\/recognize as words what he was saying sometimes), and I feel that he was simply trying to teach too much material in too little time. I feel like if You didn't have a strong biology background or studied hard on Your own You would not fully understand what was trying to be taught in this class.",
    "I would but I would warn them that it is going to be more challenging that they thought it would be. This is not just a normal intro course where you don't have to attend the lectures and still get an A in the class.",
    "Very difficult and way more in depth than you want for an introductory course. I would recommend it only because it is a requirement for most other biology courses.",
    "Are you going to be a Biology major? (No, really, are you?... After Bio 101 you still are?) Okay, then take it. No? Are you pre-med? Sorry... But of course take it! Any other reason? No. Don't do it to yourself. Even though you'll know way more biology than you thought possible to learn in a quarter, it still is not worth it. It's very difficult, a huge lecture, and moves very quickly. It isn't as horrible as pictured above, but make sure you're going to use this Bio for something before diving in.",
    "Its not that hard of a class if you study, but there is a lot of stupid memorization.",
    "It is a decent class that is extremely difficult but poorly structured.",
    "It's very difficult to understand content wise and sound wise. It's way too large for a lecturer who mumbles and the homework is extremely difficult. It takes me 3-4 hour to complete 3 problems.",
    "Decent course. More challenging that Biology 101, but still should be taken by anyone interested in biology.",
    "Because bio 102 is part of the intro bio series, which is a prereq for so many classes, there really isn't much of a way to avoid it. But if you could, I would say avoid it! The class was exceedingly difficult, daunting, and intimidating. Although Dr. Mooseker was super knowledgeable, kind, and hilarious, the material covered in the class was so detailed and in-depth that problem sets seemed practically impossible, and I felt super overwhelmed all the time.",
    "OK module of the intro Biology series 101-104. Hopefully they will be more organized next year. Would not recommend for someone that doesn't need to take it unless they change the format.",
    "This course was much more an exercise in learning to think like a biologist than an introduction to basic concepts. It is difficult if you (like me) haven't had that introduction already. Once you get your bearings it is enjoyable.",
    "Bio 102 is a necessary evil.",
    "A necessary class for any biology major that has to take intro biology. If you have the option to opt out of this class, do so. Not much more is taught than AP Biology.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. But it's something you have to take to move forward. This course was horribly designed and in no way introductory. It assumes background. It used multiple textbooks meant for an advanced cell biology course. The depth of each lecture was so immense for an introductory course that it was so easy to get lost and not find your way back. For those students who did not take AP Biology, catchup was difficult. It was too advanced to be an introduction to cell biology. The lecture slides were not really helpful either because if someone couldn't understand what the professor was saying, then they could not write down notes to supplement the pictures on the slides. Be aware that at every time of the day, there is someone in the class studying the material for the exam. Evidence is on Piazza.I also noticed that the professor deliberately tried to make the students' lives harder by never mentioning a more relevant textbook and instead assigning readings from a more inferior one (relative to the specific content of the course material). The lecture material was mostly taken directly from the unmentioned textbook but readings were assigned from an entirely different textbook? While I learned a lot, trial by fire is not enjoyable.",
    "Yes, it is an extremely interesting class, however be prepared for a lot of work outside of class.",
    "Enrollment was way too high. Mooseker tends to infer that we know a lot about biology and the topics he presents in class, when in reality most of us are lost throughout his lectures. Titles on the slides would help to organize the data much more. He sacrificed covering certain topics for depth of topics, but this is an introduction class.",
    "This was the first time the course was taught so I believe that certain improvements\/changes will be made. However, looking at how the class was taught this semester, I would not recommend the class especially if you have not taken AP bio.",
    "I would recommend this course, it's a great class on cell biology and I feel that I understand everything much better!",
    "The questions and class is really experiment based focusing on reading the original literature and on learning a few aspects of cell biology in-depth. I would recommend taking it if you like this type of learning and make sure you get a good T.A. who knows what they're talking about.",
    "102 is a bit difficult for an introductory class, but it inspired me to pursue science at Yale because it goes beyond the typical AP Bio approach to cell biology topics. There is real exposure to the research and experimental techniques underlying what we know, and less of an emphasis on memorizing the material itself. In that sense, the class was an exercise in logic and application of knowledge, which is far more useful for those not interested in pursuing the specifics of cell bio. There is an enormous amount of support through Piazza and weekend review sessions, and the discussions are actually very helpful if the TA helps explain the lectures. That being said, lectures can be frustrating because the slides are out of order and post-lecture slides often contain supplementary slides that are unexplained in class.",
    "Biology 102 is a very intense class that focuses on the inner workings of the cell. It is not,in my opinion, an introductory biology class; however, if you have an interest in cell biology, I would recommend the class, because you definitely learn a good deal.",
    "Read the textbook, it really helps a lot.",
    "102 is a lot better than 101, simply because of the professor. The material is hard, but Professor Mooseker works hard for the students, especially those who need it the most. This class greatly increased my knowledge of biology, after having none at all. If I could have taken this class before 101, I would have. Professor Mooseker is the reason to take this class.",
    "Biology 102 covers a great amount of material in very fine detail; therefore, attendance is vital for good performance. Furthermore, since much of the material covered focuses on application and experimental design, approaching the material in a rigorous and analytical manner is crucial.I would recommend this course to another student on the grounds that the student is prepared to invest a lot of time and energy into studying this material and that the class size is shortened to a manageable capacity.",
    "Biology 102 is a shock coming from 101. Its messier, with more complicated biology and a lot of assumptions about your prior bio knowledge. Brace yourself, but definitely take it.",
    "Bio 102 is an in-depth look at cell biology. Professor Mooseker really works to help his students.",
    "Biology 102 01 may, at times, seem daunting. The material is often difficult to comprehend the first time through, and there's a lot of material on top of that. But if you keep up with the work, you'll find that the stuff we cover in class is VERY interesting. If you're willing to put in the work, you'll find this course very fulfilling. I would recommend this class!",
    "No.",
    "Biology 102 covers some really fascinating topics, but the class does not seem like an introductory biology course. The professor goes into great detail on very specific subjects. You will come out of the course more knowledgeable about cell biology, but the couple months in the class will likely be rather stressful and frustrating. Still, I would recommend the class to any student who wishes to study biology.",
    "It really is an interesting course, but it might be really difficult if you haven't taken AP Bio or an equivalent already in high school.",
    "If you are any kind of Bio major, you'll have to take this class. The homework was normally easy, and the reading assignments and the midterm were not too difficult. The final exam was extremely difficult, though.Professor Mooseker is a good lecturer and he put in a lot of time to helping us review at extra lectures on weekends.I would not recommend this class, though, unless you want to be a bio major.",
    "Bio 102 was more challenging than 101 because the material was covered in more depth. The Karp reading was very helpful and I found it essential in understanding the course. The papers were difficult, but following section made much more sense. I would recommend this course as it is a prerequisite for many science majors.",
    "It's necessary for any bio major or premed if you can't test out of it. That being said, I don't feel like it prepared me for upper level bio classes at all. The material it covered was advanced and specific. Don't take it if you can avoid it and just move to other bio classes. Mooseker is a great guy, but his lectures are difficult to understand and he just goes on and on about the cytoskeleton and electron microscopy. Your success basically depends on your section leader and your ability to teach yourself.",
    "The class was interesting and there was a lot of information to learn, but the difficulty was a bit high in my opinion. Take it at your own discretion.",
    "Don't take it unless it's required for your major orpre-med, because that's what the majority of the students in it do. It's way harder than intro-level, and not really fun even if you've already taken biology. Although I learned a lot, it was mostly self-taught and the lectures weren't really helpful (actually the week before the midterm and the final, wikipedia was my best friend). It's good in theory but good luck if you're taking it out of interest.",
    "Interesting but did not provide as good a basic foundation in cell biology as preparation for future classes as I had hoped. Would probably recommend anyway.",
    "Biology 102 is a very challenging \"introductory\" biology class that holds students accountable to a lot of information that did not even begin to be covered in AP Biology. It's a worthwhile class if you're taking it for your major or as a premed requirement, but I would caution against taking it for fun unless you're (a) very much prepared to put a lot of effort into the class (or have an advanced background in biology) or are (b) very much interested in Biology. Use resources such as Piazza and Prof. Mooseker's review sessions (despite the difficulty of the class, Prof. Mooseker is wonderfully kind, intelligent, and open to help his students as much as he can). The class bore its flaws on its sleeves the past semester because it was the first time it was being offered, and I imagine it will be improved over time--speaking only to my experience, though, the class requires a lot of effort just to stay afloat if your background in biology is not very extensive. It can be worth it though. Just be prepared.",
    "Despite the complaining from other students about this class, I felt like this class was much better structured and better taught than bio 101. I found the course to truly teach more, since it teaches you how to logically come up with experimental ideas based on previous methods of experimentation rather than entirely memorize things. Professor Mooseker truly cares about his students, and he made an effort to get to know people. He was also willing to admit his mistakes, which I found admirable.I would cautiously recommend this course for anybody that does not intend to need it for a requirement (which is the minority). There are still quite a few kinks that need to be sorted out in the biology module sequence, and the feeling of not understanding anything persists throughout the year.",
    "It was tough. Take it if you have to.",
    "This class is a ton of work. Answers on Piazza gradually got worse and worse b\/c TAs were tired of answering them. Also, questions are sometimes skipped on Piazza, so your question could be on the board for over a week. Psets are super super hard and the professor is hard to hear in lecture, even if you sit in front so don't bother sitting in front b\/c if you do, you'll have to tilt your head way up the whole hr and 15 minutes in order to see the projection and you'll just come out of that class with a painful neck and confusion. It's very easy to fall asleep in that class, no matter what you try to do, just b\/c there are so many people and it's hard to hear the professor sometimes. Section is not helpful at all but you still have to go. Section is like another class where you not only don't have time to ask questions about the course material (like other classes' sections do) but you also have to read a 20 page research paper and be able to discuss it in front of your classmates. All in all, this was a very stressful class.",
    "It's significantly harder than Bio 101. The material is more advanced and seems more abstract. You gain alot at the end though.",
    "Biology 102 is significantly harder than 101, but still manageable. Be prepared-- the lectures aren't easy to follow, and you'll need to analyze the material on your own time to get a firm grasp of it. I recommend study groups; there's a lot to cover, but if you stay on top of the lecture slides and have friends to work with, you can certainly learn a lot. I'd recommend it, but not if you're unwilling to put in the time.",
    "Biology 102 is a difficult class, but it can be very fun and interesting if you are up for the challenge! Professor Moose is a fantastic lecturer who is very interested in what he teaches and provides awesome demonstrations. Cell biology is covered but so are important experimental techniques used to study the cell. The problem sets are difficult and so are the required readings, but by the end of the course, you feel like you have learned so much!",
    "A difficult but rewarding introduction to cell biology. Mooseker is a wonderful professor and cares a lot about his students. He is passionate about his teaching and his research. The material is exploratory and you'll find yourself saying \"cool\" at times. It's hard, no doubt, but putting in the time to review post-lecture slides to fully understand the content is key. Recommend.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS if you simply need a science credit. It's a horrible survey of cell\/membrane physio and delves into really high-level, obscure topics that should be reserved for upper level classes.",
    "It's an intense course that will turn your hair gray but you learn a lot and it's accomplishment to pass it.",
    "I guess there are only 3 possible reasons for you to take this: you're considering premed, you're considering a bio major, or you just want to understand biological concepts. My evaluation shouldn't change your mind for the first 2 and actually shouldn't for the last one either, but here are my thoughts. I had an excellent preparation in biology in high school, not just at the AP level but with problem solving and research prep close to the level required in this class so I had no problem picking up the concepts. However, this class is certainly no cakewalk. The lectures feature so much unnecessary material and it was often frustrating to have to sit through everything, especially for 70 minutes at a time. If you have little experience with biology and really would like to learn to round out your liberal arts education, go for it. But if you are at least at the AP level, I don't think there's much use.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. Upper level courses are probably less of a waste of time, though. Material was interesting though, don't get me wrong- it is really what has inspired me to major in MCDB.",
    "I would recommend it with a grain of salt. This class is hard because no matter your background, you probably will not have even seen this material before. I came in having last taken biology in freshman year of high school, so the class really challenged me.The key is, DO THE TEXTBOOK READING BEFORE LECTURE. Especially coming off of BIOL 101, I thought that I could get byin BIOL 102 just by going to the lectures, but I am warning you, you will not understand what is going on if you have not read the textbook reading first. It's painful, but so helpful when the midterm and final comes around.Take it, even though its a struggle. Mooseker is the man. He wants to help you understand the material, so take advantage of the extra review sessions and Piazza question answering.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who has a strong background in biology. The material is fairly advanced and can be difficult to manage without prior knowledge in biology.",
    "If you don't need to take this course, don't take it. Lectures are very boring, and do not help understand the material. Overall, this gives a very poor introduction to biology.",
    "Bio102 was very in-depth and detailed. Do not attempt to show up at lecture without first reading the appropriate lecture reading in the textbook.",
    "Biol 102 was very frustrating at times -- the lectures were impossible to follow, the professor was unclear (he mumbled a lot and assumed that we knew MUCH more than we actually knew -- in part because he was only hearing from the few people in the class who actually understood the material). The material was also not well organized. The problem sets are also impossible to understand, so make sure you're working on them with others and asking the peer tutor. On the other hand, because it was so challenging, it really opened up a whole new concept of biology. It forced us to really think and get into a scientific mindset. Now, thanks to this class (if you put in the effort to try and understand it on your own time), I see that biology is much more than memorization -- it's a fascinating field that requires deep thinking.",
    "As with 101, this course would have been better if it were a little smaller, but overall I enjoyed this course. I say that despite feeling as though I was struggling rather frequently. It is detailed and challenging if you have limited background in biology (as is my case) but if you put the time in it's manageable and you can learn a lot.",
    "Would not recommend it. Though this class is not that hard, it's much harder than it needs to be due to the way it was taught. The information could have been much more clearly presented and discussion sections utilized better.",
    "Interesting discussion of cells, more advanced than you think.",
    "It's a good, though not entirely comprehensive, intro to the topic. I would definitely recommend it to any student who wants to pursue medicine or natural sciences, but I would caution any student without a strong high school biology background as a lot of prior knowledge is assumed.",
    "Even though this class is meant to be an introductory biology course it is a ways from it. There is an overwhelming amount of information that can be hard to digest. Most of what we learn\/are expected to retain relates to experimental procedures. I would recommend this to a student who has a high school biology background and is interested in the experimental methods of biochemistry.",
    "I would only recommend taking this course if it is required for a major or the pre-med requirements. The material and homework assignments were too in-depth for the introductory level, and the course was very demanding. It was difficult to pay attention in such a large lecture, and most kids would doze off, play on their phones, or check their emails at least once a class. If it is necessary to take this course, do the readings, because otherwise I would have been completely lost in lecture instead of only sort of lost.",
    "Biol 102 is much more difficult that 101. The material is more obscure and difficult to follow. The homeworks are very conceptual and difficult to do with just the information presented in the lectures. The class isn't necessarily bad, it isjust difficult to comprehend at times. I would recommend this to students who will put in the effort to do the extra learning.",
    "I love biology and I would reccomend this class even though it was hard to understand sometimes.",
    "Take it, but prepare for the first half not to make any sense until an hour before the midterm.",
    "Biology 102 was a lot of work but it was definitely worth it. I left the class knowing not only more biology but also having the mindset and the skills of a science student. I learned to think like a scientist and study like a science student. The class was challenging in a way that made me personally work harder and learn more. Dr. Mooseker was consistently more than willing to go above and beyond to help students understand. I would highly recommend the class.",
    "I'd say BIOL 102 is a great way to learn more about research and laboratory in the biology field. I'm grateful I took the course because I learned how much I despise those things now and it made me look over what I want to do in life. BIOL 102 was a pretty underdeveloped course and I felt like a guinea pig throughout its entirety. If you're a premed, you'll have to take it. Maybe you'll reconsider your plans for the future. Just be prepared for a lackluster course.",
    "I would whole-heartedly not recommend it, but since it is a requirement I suppose it is just something that you must trudge through. Just be prepared to spend hours on the problem sets.",
    "(Disclaimer: I took AP biology in high school, which undoubtedly helped me in BIOL 101\/102.) This course focuses on experimental techniques, membranes, endo- and exocytosis, filaments (e.g., actin and microtubules), and intercellular junctions in some depth. It clearly builds on the themes of 101 (especially the fundamental forces of biochemistry, transcription and translation, and ribosomes) and requires a greater degree of scientific thinking. The PSETs are considerably more difficult than those in 101 (granted, the 101 PSETs were usually very easy). The section papers require time and effort to understand (what did you expect?) but the process of becoming literate in primary scientific literature is very rewarding. Most importantly, this course will improve your ability to think scientifically (provided you spend enough time on the PSETs and papers). As an added bonus, Professor Mooseker is fun and energetic, and he cares about his students.",
    "Biology 102 is a clearly a preparation course for other courses in the Biology department. If you do not plan on taking other bio classes then you could probably find a more fun biology class. However, if you are serious about studying bio this is a good and informative class.",
    "Take this course. Even if you think you're good at biology, this course will teach you valuable skills. Professor Mooseker is AWESOME!! He really makes the extra effort with resources such as Piazza and extra review sessions (so helpful!). If you want to succeed, the tools are there for you.I didn't do any of the reading, and did ok on the first test.",
    "Bio 102 is difficult in the sense that the information is a little disorganized and difficult to synthesize, but the course is informative overall.",
    "It was a lot of work especially for the problem sets and exams.",
    "Biol102 goes more in-depth than your standard intro bio course. There was plenty of new material for me, having taken AP Bio in high school. I would recommend it primarily for the pre-med student or potential biology majors. It may help you decide whether or not you want to be a bio major.",
    "Only take it if you have to for major or premed requirements and can't place out with AP credit\/placement exams. I'm pretty sure that's the only reason most people were in this class.",
    "Though this was an introductory course, I often felt that it was assumed or expected that we had taken AP biology in high school or had significant previous knowledge of biology. I found the class extremely difficult. I would not particularly recommend it to other students, although it is a prerequisite for the biology major and most higher biology classes.",
    "Overall, this was a challenging Intro Bio course and would only be recommended if needed for premed or a major.",
    "The class was very detailed and went over aspects of the cell membrane and its associated proteins and functions. The class went over a lot of detailed information, but provided a great base for future bio classes.",
    "I recommend.",
    "Biology 102 was a huge disappointment after Bio 101, which I loved. Professor Mooseker was completely out of touch with the background knowledge of his students as well as very disorganized. For each unit he gave us three different text books to read, which was so confusing. I am usually a *very* organized person, but found myself studying in a very disorganized way for this class because of how disorganized the course was. In contrast, I loved Bio 101. Professor Mooseker should take teaching lessons from Professor Koelle!",
    "A warning to all is that Biol 102 does not at all feel like an introductory class. Most students in the class have taken AP Bio in high school and it seems like a majority are interested in majoring in the subject, so if you have done neither it will likely give you a hard time. Mooseker is really engaging and interesting and knows what he's talking about but he goes overwhelmingly fast in lecture. The p-sets are challenging but the peer tutor was amazing and helps you through them. They really prepare you for the exams. The papers you have to read are hard and come every week, but it's easier to understand them once you go to section. The exams, however, weren't as bad as you would think when you're first taking the class and were somewhat manageable with a lot of studying.",
    "I would not recommend this course. It did not feel like an introductory biology course. In addition, it is a huge lecture and sometimes you feel inhibited to ask questions because there is such a range of knowledge and abilities in the class. The sections were not to reinforce what we learned, they were to learn new things (papers). I constantly felt confused in class. While some of the material is interesting, it did not feel like an introductory course.",
    "Terrifying, don't take it unless you need to or are a total masochist.",
    "Unless they make some major changes, I would not recommend Biology 102 to anyone. This \"intro\" biology course was certainly not taught at an intro level. The material was extremely challenging, much like something you would see in an upper level cell bio class, not the intro course that virtually everyone is required to take. Pretty much every lecture went completely over my head, and I had to read over the lectures and my notes many many times on my own before I even had an idea of what Professor Mooseker was talking about. The problem sets were extremely challenging as well, and each one took several hours, even when collaborating with peers. Overall, it was extremely frustrating to feel so incompetent and lost after every single lecture or assignment. Also, the fact that the discussion sections were each focused on a new paper, rather than going over the material covered in lecture made it very difficult, if impossible, to get help regarding the material from the TA's.",
    "Bio 102 was... a decent course. As someone who had experience working in a research laboratory, I still found the information to be new and interesting, but also very specific and a little eclectic. Still a good course, though, that teaches you how to think experimentally about topics in cell biology.",
    "Biology 102 is more in-depth than Biology 101, but still serves as an introduction to its field. I think it could be a solid class, but I would avoid having it with Professor Mooseker. The size of the class (we filled an entire auditorium) did not help.",
    "Biology 102 is an excellent introduction to cellular biology. You will absolutely learn from the material, and the instructor and teaching fellows are excellent. It is on the difficult side, and you will need to work. In addition, the course goes in depth on some topics and leaves others a little unexplained. But the teachers do a great job of explaining, so the material is easily understandable. Furthermore, the problem sets do genuinely help you learn the material, and you will feel able to apply it in your work. In addition, the scientific papers you will read for your discussion sections are very good. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone with an interest in biology - it's worth your time and effort.",
    "A challenging, thorough introductory inspection of college level cellular biology. Definitely not an easy class, definitely very rewarding and chock-full of new information.",
    "Avoid this class like the plague... Unless you have to take it, like I did. Even still, do everything you can to avoid it. I'm not a science major, but I had taken a fair few \"hard science\" classes at Yale, and this was by far the most difficult. The material is presented as if students have extensive prior knowledge of biology. The lectures are written for biologists. Don't understand lecture? That's your fault, here's some extra readings to explain what wasn't explained in class. If you do all the reading, attend lecture, and complete the problem sets, this class could amount to 20 hours per week of work. Discussion section is an opportunity to layer on more work, stress, and reading, rather than to enhance understanding. Problem sets are extremely difficult and composed entirely of \"tricky\" questions. The pre-meds and the kids who did a ton of bio in high school absolutely destroy the curve, and this class was an inhuman amount of work. Seriously, don't do it.",
    "I thought Professor Mooseker was great. Other aspects of this course were not so great. Section was pretty bad, and it was mandatory. Piazza--an anonymous website for questions\/concerns regarding the course--became a war zone between struggling, frustrated students and defensive instructors. And there was always an assumption that the class had more experience in biology that it really did. That being said, Mooseker put in a lot of effort to improve our understanding of the material, including weekly review sessions where he went over key concepts for students who were still confused. Overall, not a bad course, and Professor Mooseker makes it worth it.",
    "It was difficult, too much so for intro bio. You are expected to already have a strong base in bio. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to take it.",
    "DISCLAIMER: This is NOT an introductory course. While the philosophy behind the module (depth over breadth) is interesting, the module itself did not cover Cell Physiology adequately. I still don't really feel like I can explain how a cell works. Prof. Mooseker dives right into the nitty gritty of famous experiments without really explaining the basics behind them. If you haven't taken AP Biology, you will have to work very hard to do well in this class. If you have, you should be fine.",
    "It definitely is a pretty challenging class especially for an intro Biology course, however it does teach you how to think and analyze, which isa great skill to have. I recommend this course if you are really passionate about biology. If you are trying to find an easy science credit, this is probably not the course for you.",
    "This class is definitely easier than what existed before it and it provides a good amount of information about rudimentary biology. However, I would not recommend this class until it is more organized in terms of a syllabus.",
    "This course is a major step up from 101. The concepts, the homework, and the tests are all much more difficult. However, as someone with a lot of background in Biology, I thoroughly enjoyed the course. Professor Mooseker was engaging and clear, and he really elucidated some of the more difficult concepts in the class. This class is essential for a proper grounding in experimental techniques and concepts, as well as the experimental origins of many of the things we know about cells and membranes. I would recommend this class to another student who has taken some form of Biology, be it101 or in high school.",
    "There are resources available to you (review sessions, piazza online forum to post questions, peer tutor, TFs) so take advantage of them. Bio 102 is a lot of figuring out things on your own. I'm not pre-med; I just took the course because I like biology, but the vast majority of this class is pre-med (it's a pre-req). I don't think I would recommend this class whole-heartedly to someone who is not pre-med, because the course is new, the class size is large, and I'm not sure how accessible the course is to those who have not been exposed to biology before (though they held enrichment sections for this purpose. I was not in them, so I can't comment on how helpful they were).",
    "A pretty tough module, which I learned a lot in. Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Biology 102 is a biology course in which you learn cell biology and membrane physiology through studies of the an acinar cell. Students read scientific papers that directly deal with and reinforce information taught in class. Problem sets challenge students to come up with experiments that relate to techniques learned in class.",
    "Take it but expect a few lectures to be utterly confusing. This course makes you think--in a good way- but be prepared.",
    "Biology 102 01 is a good introduction to cell biology and an interesting course. It is quite challenging because there is a lot of material covered. However, if you study hard, you will do fairly well. I would recommend the course to another student if they have distributional requirements\/pre-professional program requirements to fulfill. That, and if they are very interested in biology.",
    "Biology 102 is very different from 101 because Prof. Mooseker's style of teaching is vastly different from Prof. Koelle's. The class is much more loosely ordered, with lectures skipping around from topic to topic. Lectures are often hard to follow because they deal with extremely detailed and specific information without much background info. You may need to spend a significant amount of time reviewing the powerpoints with your classmates. If you do so, however, you should not have a lot of difficulty getting a good grade on the problem sets and assessments.",
    "Gives you the basics of cell biology, just like it says. Sometimes pretty boring, but important stuff for bio majors to know. Professor Mooseker is not the best at explaining things, but he is a funny, enjoyable presence.",
    "Challenging yet interesting. I would recommend it.",
    "This is an endlessly fascinating, very challenging, often frustrating course. Hopefully, by the time you're reading this, many of the most serious problems with the course's administration and its design will have been resolved -- hopefully you'll be permitted to use a laptop to take lecture notes effectively, hopefully you'll have complete access to the textbook you need, and hopefully you'll benefit from a more concerted effort on the part of the professors and Teaching Scholars to explain more clearly and in plainer language the complicated principles this course expects you to master. I'd recommend this only to prospective science majors -- though non-science majors like myself who loved 101 should be able to muddle through.",
    "If you have taken AP Biology, perhaps. If you haven't, and you're just exploring a passing interest in science, then be wary. This course changed my life in a way I wish it hadn't.",
    "Don't take this class unless you know they're making major changes. The professor and TAs don't seem to know how to teach Bio on an introductory level.",
    "In-depth summary of Cell Physiology and Membrane study. Focused heavily on experiments within the subject, unnecessarily.",
    "In this class you do learn a lot but if you do not review the material after lecture you will not be a happy camper when it is exam time. Lecture could have been much better. The powerpoints given were often confusing, so those could certainly be improved upon.",
    "Very hard, particularly if you don't know anything about biology. Requires a lot of time to be invested into review. However at the end of the day it equips you with a fantastic knowledge of cell biology, the methods that this course uses to do so however are a little bit strenuous\/demanding.",
    "Very hard. If you are willing to invest fully in all of the readings, both required and not, and are willing to spend hours on the problem sets, then go ahead, but I would not recommend taking this class unless you really have to.",
    "It's the second part to Yale's new intro Bio sequence, and covers many cell biology topics. As taught by Professor Mooseker, the course moves a bit quickly, and the homework gets extremely confusing as a result. Additionally, section is mainly focused around reading research papers that relate to the current topics being discussed in lecture. I wouldn't recommend this class unless you are seriously interested in biology as a major or a career, or unless it's a requirement (premed, etc.), or unless you very seriously enjoy biology concepts -- otherwise, I can't see how it would very enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It was interesting, engaging, and ultimately you get a lot out of it. However, don't let the fact that this is an intro class fool you; it is somewhat of a challenge.",
    "this is the kind of class where if you choose not to do the reading, you might as well not go to lecture, and probably should just not take the class",
    "I would recommend Biology 102 to students interested in research. The course was an in-depth exploration of cell biology with a focus on laboratory procedures. It covered different material than the usual cell biology class and therefore may not be of interest to pre-med students.",
    "This class is for students that are very interested in an intense Biology class or need to take biology for a pre-med requirement. It is a very challenging subject with a large workload. I would only recommend it to students who are very interested or need it for a pre-med requirement.",
    "Biology 102 covers membrane biology and is quite easy to follow. I would recommend it if a student is a science major even if it is not required. I think the information would be worthwhile to learn. Because it is quite time-consuming, I would not necessarily recommend this course for a non-science major unless he is very interested in biological processes.",
    "I would not recommend this to another student. This is not an introductory class.",
    "Nothing like AP Biology, with a lot of focus on real-world lab solving on p-sets. I don't recommend it if the student has no bio experience because it is hard to keep up.",
    "If you enjoy biology, you may not like this class. If you do not enjoy biology, you will not like this class. In general, I feel that this class, at the stage that it is in right now, is definitely more difficult than the introductory level that one assumes Biology 102 to be. Perhaps once the syllabus for the Biology 101-104 modules have been more set in stone, this particular module will be easier to follow.",
    "It is a very in depth course on cell biology that requires more critical thinking and less rote memorization than other bio courses you may have taken. I would recommend it if you have taken ap bio, otherwise you may struggle.",
    "Although it is difficult, the course promotesCreative thinking and is also a prerequisite, therefore I would recommend it.",
    "If you want to take any further biology or some upper-division chemistry courses, you'll need to take this sequence. Don't let it frighten you or put you off of biology! The first half of the course focuses on research techniques, and much of the second half deals with the cytoskeleton and membrane proteins. I would not recommend this course if you're a non-science major, but I hope that those considering biology will not let a bad experience in this class stop them from continuing.",
    "BIOL 102 was NOT an introductory biology course, and I would not recommend it to students until it has had time to improve. Obviously pre-meds and biology majors can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t avoid taking it, but I would strongly suggest waiting to take it until it has run for a few semesters and undergone serious changes. Students who have a lot of experience with lab work will probably do well, but students who do not have this experience should try to get it before taking this course. BIOL 102 requires immense amounts of studying and, at present, an ability to understand things at an extremely rapid pace otherwise lecture will feel like a massive patch of quicksand.",
    "The class overall was quite good. It was a very detailed study of a variety of cell processes and it covered new material that most AP Bio students won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have seen before. Professor Mooseker is a good lecturer and you discuss published journal articles in discussion section, so you get to learn about how the cell processes you study were actually discovered in labs. The problem sets can be challenging at times, but the two tests are typically easier than the problem sets. It is a required course for people who plan to take future courses in the sciences, so you need to take it if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your plan, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the end a very informative and interesting course.",
    "For an introductory course, it was pretty challenging and a lot of work so if you don't need to take it or have a great interest in biology, I would not recommend it. However you do learn a lot. High school biology was nothing compared to this course. The psets were also challenging.",
    "Material is very difficult and requires more critical thinking than anything - either you understand it or you don't",
    "Biology 102 was a relatively rigorous introductory biology course with a focus on cell biology. Many of the typical subjects such as cell division were not necessarily covered in this course. Professor Mooseker opted to go very much for depth versus breadth. His main goal was to inspire students to develop problem solving skills in biology rather than memorizing plain facts.",
    "Avoid it if you can.",
    "Biology 102 is a pretty standard set up for an intro-bio class. It solidly covers the basics of the cellular behavior, though the size will probably decrease in future years. The class is really designed to be much more bare and bones foundational biology than enjoyable and fulfilling by itself, so I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really recommend it if you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t planning on taking further biology classes."
