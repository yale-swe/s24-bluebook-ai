   "comments": [
    "Learned about key tools used to advocate for human rights and an array of issues. Also had to grapple with major human rights dilemmas.",
    "I learned so much about tools for combating human rights and about various human rights violations in the world. This course reaffirmed my passion for human rights and my choice to go into the field of human rights law.",
    "After taking this course, I gained a more comprehensive, holistic perspective on human rights, and more specifically human rights law. Through case studies of the different areas of human rights law, to tools used in advancing international human rights, I learned much insight about the obstacles towards human rights and how we can further advance the discussion.",
    "Understand how difficult it is for international human rights law to safeguard human rights",
    "This class does a good overview of topics in human rights and the different approaches to promoting human rights.",
    "A thorough background in human rights issues, treaties, and policy, and a challenging opportunity to try and draft some solutions in the final paper, which was a great synthesis of the central questions of the course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great beginner course, however, the power point presentations towards the end should be much shorter.",
    "This course covers huge topics in human rights (how do we stop genocide, violence against women, etc.), so discussions often went in circles without a lot of direction because we really had no answers to these big questions. I often found this frustrating, and it made it difficult to contribute meaningfully to discussion because I didn't think I had anything particularly insightful to say. We did learn about some interesting topics, and the presentation and final paper were an opportunity to do interesting research into very specific human rights issues in particular regions\/countries, which was cool. However, the format of the final paper was confusing and could have been made clearer much earlier in the process.",
    "Great course, good survey of a lot of contemporary international human rights challenges. I like the final paper prompt at the end as well. I did think the presentations over the second half of the course could be shorter to allow for more discussion, and I thought there should be more of an emphasis on solutions, however hard they are to achieve. Especially during the presentations, I thought students got away with just discussing the problems and human rights violations and saying that solutions seem impossible.",
    "This course, as a seminar is great in that it yields discussion amongst students with a good variety of background in human rights and human rights interests. I thoroughly enjoyed the presentations on case studies of human rights violations and areas of improvement. One suggestion for improvement is to use some of the seminar time for a mini lecture, giving students a solid foundation on human rights tenets and human rights law, something I felt I lacked and had to research on my own. This would have made for more organization and structure to the course.",
    "Great topic, good balance of student and professor's input in discussion",
    "I would have liked to get my grades ahead of time. I received over 50% of my grades during finals period, and I did not have a way to gauge how I was doing in this class. I also felt that we would stray from the readings during discussion such that the readings almost seemed unnecessary. I loved the content of this course and the passion that Professor Sanchez teaches but in terms of the course layout and planning, it could have been more rigorous and thought out.",
    "The readings and progression of topics are well-chosen, and the split between tools and issues is a great choice. I really feel that as the semester went on, the progression of learning was both organic and challenging. In the second half though, I would have been glad to see more discussion in seminar. The group presentations sometimes went a bit long, though they were absolutely informative."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if they wanted to get a comprehensive understanding of human rights and the challenges of promoting them.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone vaguely interested in human rights. The first half of the course is focused on learning about the various tools for combating human rights violations, and the second half is focused on various human rights issues. This course provides a good base of general knowledge but also allows you to focus in depth on your interests for your presentation and final paper. The discussion in the course was very interesting and I always looked forward to showing up for class!",
    "This course covers some really interesting topics, and the presentation and final paper were an opportunity to do interesting research into very specific human rights issues in particular regions\/countries, which was cool. However, because this course covers huge topics in human rights (how do we stop genocide, violence against women, etc.), discussions often went in circles without a lot of direction because we really had no answers to these big questions. I often found this frustrating, and it made it difficult to contribute meaningfully to discussion because I didn't think I had anything particularly insightful to say. Also, the format of the final paper was confusing and could have been made clearer much earlier in the process, so watch out for that.",
    "Good course if you're interested in human rights, if a little depressing",
    "I would recommend this course to other students who are genuinely interested in human rights, and wants to know more about the current scenario for human rights in the international community, and how discussion can be improved and advanced. It's a good class that takes a look at the tools for human rights, and case studies of human rights violations. Skills learned also include legal research in international law. It's a captivating class, and there's much to be learned through discussion of current obstacles we face in human rights, and how we can overcome them. It may be a little depressing, as some seminars may end with a sense of hopelessness on human rights, but you definitely come away with a sense of motivation and deeper sense of investment in this area.",
    "Great course to understand the brutal reality of human rights in the world",
    "If you are interested in human rights and want a good overview of issues and the different mechanisms for enforcement - international law, sanctions, advocacy - this class is good. It can also give you an idea of whether or not you want to approach human rights from a law perspective or otherwise. It's also an easy writing credit. I enjoyed discussing issues important to me with my classmates and expanding my critical thinking on human rights.",
    "YES! Professor Sanchez is amazing and the class is incredibly interesting. I originally took it just for the writing credit and it quickly became one of my favorite classes at Yale. You learn so much about current events, but can still tailor the majority of the work toward your interests to keep the class relevant and interesting for you. Definitely a must take class at Yale!",
    "A great introduction to contemporary issues in human rights, to the difficulties of policymaking, and potential solutions. Very much encourages you to try to continue thinking of solutions."
