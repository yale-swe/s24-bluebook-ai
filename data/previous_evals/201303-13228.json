    "This class is important because it forces you to engage with work outside your normal sphere of learning.",

    "A low-intensity seminar designed to introduce graduate students to the various methodologies and themes in Political Science by examining recent work done by Yale faculty members.",
    "I certainly would; It is a good way to meet and learn about Yale's faculty, and it is also a requirement for the doctoral program.",
    "Nice slow introduction to the department and various professorsAlso great to provide opportunity for entire cohort to engage together"

    "A few topics were very, very relevant and gave me excellent background and ideas to ponder.",
    "I was exposed to subfields of political science that I otherwise wouldn't have been. This was useful.",
    "My term paper allowed me to explore issues that I intend to continue with further research in the coming semesters!",
    "The openness of the final assignment provided an opportunity to pursue independent research interests and possibly embark on projects that students could continue engaging on in the semesters to follow.",
    "This course helped expand my understanding of what major topics are in each sub-field, who is in them at Yale, and different approaches to writing, researching, and publishing. I felt that was a worthwhile contribution.",
    "Certainly broadened my knowledge of the disciplineProvide some parallels to my current interests that I may branch out to studying in the future"
