   "comments": [
    "A bit underwhelming. This class, though smaller than the lecture, doesn't really have a seminar feel. The professor was not very good at following a structured teaching method for the course, making it difficult to stay up with the material. You will learn about mathematical and graphical applications of microeconomics and not much about their real-world applications.",
    "Only take it if you want to major in econ or for some reason like harder curves. I felt about the same percentage of students came out of 115 with a solid understanding as 110.",
    "I would recommend it if you are a type of a student who enjoys an interactive class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I think that it gets a bad reputation because people think that it's much harder than the lecture simply because it's a smaller class. But I didn't find this to be the case at all. For one thing, this class only has 8 problem sets as opposed to 11 and 2 exams instead of 3. Additionally, the small class format means that you get to know the other students in your class and the professor better, which ultimately helps you learn more. I felt like I really learned a lot in this class--I would walk away every time feeling as though I had really learned a lot. Definitely try and get into this class if you can!",
    "Intro econ. Somewhat more difficult that 115 but if you enjoy the small lecture setting, it is definitely the better option.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. I found it to be challenging and competitive, but very informative. A good introduction to micro-econ, the beginning concepts were easier to understand than the latter material, but the class as a whole was well done.",
    "ECON 110 is a seminar focused on introducing students to economics in a hands on approach that challenges the student to understand the deeper concepts behind microeconomics. I would recommend ECON 110 to any student who wishes to thoroughly learn economics in a small, engaging classroom setting."
