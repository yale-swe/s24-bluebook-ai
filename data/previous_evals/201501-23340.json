    "While the group readings prompted some interesting conversations, I don't think that students really got much out of that exercise. Considering that took up the bulk of 5 class sessions, it feels like there was a lot of time wasted on that activity without much benefit to students. Conversations usually centered around the media article topic rather than the research methods from the studies. I enjoyed hearing from guest speakers, however, I didn't realize this course would be such a shallow overview of many topics. I came away feeling like I didn't learn much about anything, rather only a little about a few things. I thought the group assignment was ok, however, data collection, analysis, and preparing the paper was extremely time intensive during the end of the semester. I would have appreciated more guidance as to what was a feasible project to undertake. The planning stages of this assignment were not nearly as time consuming as the later portions. If basically every group just does a survey I think that misses the point of the project --and isn't there a whole course on how to make good surveys? I thought the midterm and final were definitely fair. I think some students with a lot of research experience found some things to be elementary, but that is just the nature of the program. I think it is necessary to have a place where students without that experience can learn the basics.",
    "Strengths: It offers you an overview of different research methods in social behavioral sciences. You also do a research study, which was amazing!! Weaknesses: No weaknesses",
    "I think that this course suffers from having to present material that most\/all of the class knows already, while not having sufficient time to explore more difficult concepts. For instance, the lectures on dyadic analysis and multi-level modeling were interesting, but it would have been nice to have more opportunity to engage with the material.",
    "Weaknesses: Many of the lectures were abstract and above the level of an introductory methods class. The group readings were redundant after the first two. Strength: Final project",
    "I strongly believe that every student who took this course this past semester should be provided with a refund of the tuition. Absolutely nothing was learned from this course and it is a a shame that students were made to actually pay for such a travesty of a course. No clear focus. No sense of objectives on what each class was supposed to accomplish. Utter waste of life.",
    "I thought overall this class was ok but could use some re-structuring. Instead of having every other lecture (lectures 2 times a week for 1.5 hours) be a group discussion on articles related to SBS, there should be more focus on the different Interdisciplinary Research Methods available. I would much rather have more meaningful lectures that focus on say multi-level modeling for about 2-3 lectures than to use up a class period to go over articles students have chosen and do \"book club.\" I thought the project component was great! We were teamed up with 1-2 other individuals and basically created a study from start to finish regarding getting IRB approval, coming up with the methods, doing the lit review, carrying out the study and then doing statistical analysis on our results before presenting to the class. I thought that part was a good practice-based learning experience.",
    "Dr. Monin is a great person, but this course was terrible. I'm disappointed that I did not learn tangible skills in interdisciplinary research methods. The course superficially covered different areas of research without providing in depth knowledge or practice.",
    "I think this course has potential but to be effective should be restructured. It is difficult for a methods course in SBS to fill a niche considering that SBS students are already enrolled in Biostats, Epi II and Advanced Analytic Methods. Between those three courses, there is seemingly little left to cover in a methods course. I think the most useful aspect of the course was the group project wherein we really had to construct a research project from start to finish. That is a great experience that really provided me with useful skills that will be applicable throughout my academic and professional career. I think one way to improve the course would be to expand upon the new often complex methods introduced (e.g. multi-level modeling, qualitative methods and community based participatory research) and teach them over the course of several lectures. For example we had one lecture on multi-level modeling; instead we could spend two weeks (four lectures) on the concept to really ensure that we leave the course with an understanding of the methodology. This would be logistically more difficult as it would most likely require several professors to co-teach the course, but it would ultimately serve the students better to spend more time on these complex methods in the long run.",
    "Fine, bit scattered. No more group readings: we talked about the content more than the research methodology."

    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0I thought Joan did a good job at presenting material during days when she lectured and facilitated discussion well. I think she could have communicated more with the guest lecturers to make sure that they were focusing on their topic at an appropriate level and with information that was clearly presented. She was sensitive to students' needs and pushed the deadline of the final paper back for everyone, which was appreciated because there is no way my group would have had time to finish otherwise.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Professor Monin is a great instructor!! She is very clear in her lectures, and she is a very nice person!! She was always very willing to help her students at any time!",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan is a sweet professor! She grades a little hard but she is fair and intelligent. It would be better if she spaced out the assignment deadlines a little more because at times, my team and I felt like we were being rushed to fix things immediately and were overwhelmed. For example, the day before the IRB applications were to be sent in as a class, she had us do extensive edits and my team and I had to meet up and basically work on fixing our IRB application, disregarding the other classwork assignments we had to also complete for other courses. I think there should be less class discussion on random articles and more time to work on the assignments and\/or our understanding of the interdisciplinary research methods.",

    "It was a great course. It was a general overview of research methods in social behavioral sciences. The best part was the development of a research study, and actually doing the study, gathering and analyzing the data. It was the first time I felt I integrated everything I was taught, from SAS to SBS theory.",
    "Please get rid of this class.",
    "This class was good but could be better. I sometimes felt like my time could be better used doing something else but I did learn from this class. Most things were intuitive to me but I wouldn't expect them to be intuitive to other individuals who may not have had the same background as me.",
    "I would recommend taking another course if this is a requirement and you have another option."
