    "The Director& the Text explores how directors respond to and work with texts of plays. The first part of the course focuses on how directors break down plays into \"Directors Beats\" by analyzing a play almost like a machine. How does the play work and move from one discovery and event to the next? The next part of the class allows students to apply their new analytical skills to scene work. After this, students explore collaborative, devised autobiographical works. Lastly, students examine how to visualize their responses to plays through various mediums. I recommend this course to someone who is interested in learning about the art of directing, creating some original work, and exploring how plays work through a director's lens.",
    "A great way to grow as a director. The assignments are frequent and challenging, but all have different rewards. Text-based exercises like partiture and finding the action of a play hone your skills of reading as a director. Vissualization exercises are a place to go crazy in finding innovative ways to recreate an experience in response to a sometimes cryptic prompt. And scenework with actors puts all your directorial know-how to the test. Expect lots of discussion of plays, not only ones read in class but also ones seen around campus. Students in this class seem to be some of those most excited to be involved in the theatre scene at Yale, although some like to frequent its most experimental fringes. For me, it was a really good experience."
