   "comments": [
    "This class is great! A must take! Both professors are amazing and the material you learn is fascinating.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a non sceince major. It covers important and interesting information without ever getting too difficult. The instructors never really focused on the little details of everything, they just wanted to make sure that the students understood the overall concepts, which was great.",
    "For a non-science-major science class, this was as good as i expected and probably better. it was much easier for me than IB or AP biology in high school and, possibly the best feature of the class, after the second midterm, reading is unnecessary since there are no more assessments!",
    "Take it for an easy science credit.",
    "TAKE IT!! so good. great, painless way to get a science credit. Lecture might be a little long and a drag at times, but the material is so interesting and so relevant (after all, it is your body). Make sure to study for the exams, keep up with the reading (there really isn't a lot), and go to the extremely helpful but also optional review sessions. The paper at the end, if you pick an interesting topic, is actually fun to write. and you write a final bio paper instead of taking a cumulative, comprehensive bio final. big plus.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It i precisely what it says--a science course for non-science majors. I really enjoy biology, and I really appreciated the structure of this class. We focused more on the big-picture ideas instead of getting caught up in the annoying little details, and I felt like this gave me a much better picture of how human biology works.The teachers also emphasize class discussion and current events, something not typical to science classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student, especially one interested in science, but not a hard-core science major.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, but warn them simultaneously that it will be a little boring. Check and see if there's truly nothing else that will earn you a science credit.",
    "My favorite element of this class was the focus on physiology and the adaptations to exercise. A great course for an athlete or any health-nut.",
    "Excellent nonscience major class. It explores any and every question you may have about human biology, such as tickling, blushing, and laughing-- which can be a problem because it overrides the actual lecture and you don't end up learning anything. The professors are the nicest, friendliest, most approachable professors I have ever had.",
    "Take this class if you have an interest in human biolgy but do not wish to pursue it as a major futher on in your academic career at yale.",
    "It's a way to get a science credit out of the way, but it's not too much fun, and with the tests it's not difficult at all. The most difficult part is trying to figure out what the question is asking.",
    "This class gives a good overall view of the human body. If this is the type of biology you enjoy, this class is great. The reading isn's too much at all, and the optional sections were very helpful.",
    "Human Bio is more than just an anatomy course; the professors challenge us to apply the concepts we learn to current issues in science. I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about the human body or biology in general.",
    "I would definitely recommend Human Biology to anyone interested in the applicability of human anatomy to current issues and the relationships between form and function within the human body, as these are the major interests of the professors. This makes the exams a little more difficult to study for, since they're based on hypothetical situations and how knowledge acquired in lecture and the readings might apply.",
    "Human Biology is a blitz survey of some topics in human anatomy and physiology, more based on 'how the body works' which a strong emphasis on the complex interactions between bodily systems. The primary advantage of this course is its approachability to non-science majors. I would recommend it to anyone that has an interest in the subject matter but wants to avoid heavy chemistry.",
    "Great class to take if you have a limited background in science and you need to fulfill a SC requirement. It is popular, however, so its difficult to get a spot in. The material is very interesting and useful--learning about the human body. The workload is not bad at all--a chapter or two\/week. You have two tests that are very fair and a couple of quizes. The final is a 6-8 page paper that is fun to write since you get to choose the topic. Take this class if you can! Professor Kundel is great!",
    "MCDB gives a broad outline of issues pertaining to human biology. It is a discussion-based course, with opportunities for meetings with the professors outside of class both at office hours and at class lunches. Dr. Kundel and Dean Segraves really care about the material and about their students. I would recommend MCDB 107 to other students if they want an interesting science class--but not if you are looking for a rigorous Science class.",
    "I would recommend the class because you learn more about your body and why exercise is important. Both professors are very engaging and make class interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for a non-science major. It's interesting, relevant, and the tests are pretty easy. For the final paper -- yes, non science majors, YOU can write a final science paper-- you research a topic of your choice and are given a tremendous amount of freedom, which was pretty fun. You learn abouthuman biology - none of that plant, AP Bio stuff - which makes the class relevant to you. Bones.. reproductive system.. heart... respiratory system.. etc. It is a biology class, but it's more about putting the science in context than memorizing a bunch of facts. That being said, you do have to do a fair amount of memorization. If you're lucky enough to get in, take it for that science credit."
