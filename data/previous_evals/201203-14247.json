    "This lab is so chill! There are no lab reports or weekly assignments. There's an 8-10 page paper at the beginning and a very long 25-30 page paper at the end, but Barry makes us start everything in advance, so the workload is very manageable. Barry is also awesome. Definitely a great bio lab to take to fulfill the major requirement, and you get to learn how to use a transmission electron microscope which is very cool.",
    "Be sure you know what you're getting into! 90% of your grade will happen during reading week with a final presentation and paper. Of course, you're preparing for both of these things the whole course and if you put in the time, they should both turn out ok, but it still is a little scary. I would definitely recommend the course though. It is unlike any other course at Yale, and it doesn't mess around with useless assignments. You know that everything you're doing has a purpose and is important.",
    "You get assigned an organ to study and, during the semester, you learn how to prep EM samples and use the EM scope as you investigate your organ.",
    "FAVORITE BIO COURSE BY FAR AT YALE. You do real science in this course-- there's no right answer to what you're doing, and you have to learn to deal with the uncertainty that comes with doing research. The instructor:student ratio is fantastic (1:6!), and Barry is always available to answer questions. This course is a must take, just be sure to sign up for it far in advance-- spots fill up fast for a reason!! It is a pretty big time commitment, especially towards the end, but it's absolutely worth it.",
    "EML is an independent lab course that gives Bio majors the chance to study an organ for the semester. I recommend it to Bio majors who are interested in learning to use microscopes and who have the time to commit out of class hours."
