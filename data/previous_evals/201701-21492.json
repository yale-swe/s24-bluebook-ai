    "The readings in the course gave very good overviews of the week's theme. Some of them were a bit dated but interesting nonetheless. Because the topics were all so different the quality of discussion varied from week to week.",
    "It really is wonderful to take advantage of the collection on a weekly basis and engage with peers on various ideas and aspects of artworks. It would be nice to hear from everyone more consistently rather than spending more time on two works.",
    "The professor and the weekly writing assignments made this class very unique. The one thing I would add was to have more time spent in the gallery itself looking at the art. This is where our best class discussion occurred."
