    "Would not recommend. Maybe take if taught by Scaz",
    "This is an interesting, fairly easy comp sci elective. Take it if you are interested in AI, but if you want to really get something out of the class, READ RUSSELL + NORVIG. The combination of the book and drew's lectures is actually pretty good coverage of the subject material.",
    "Pretty awful class. I thought since I enjoyed CS112 (or whatever the intro CS class is) with McDermott, I might enjoy this. Boy, was I wrong. Basically, lectures are a drag and a waste of time, the material is really boring, and the textbook is the only thing you need. If you want to learn AI, I recommend you just buy the textbook or learn it online from another University. Seriously, don't take this class. It's just not worth it.",
    "Terrible Horrible No-Good Very Bad Semester. Tremendous waste of time. I literally learned nothing, let alone anything interesting or applicable.AI could be such agreat class, but Yale CS once again drops the ball by focusing on the theoretical and letting this class be taught by Professor McDermott. Bring back Scass, or this class will remain a embarrassment to Yale Computer Science.NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.",
    "Certainly, if you are looking for a fifth course and you are a CS major. But if you want to learn practical AI implementation, then I suggest looking elsewhere (Stanford has a nice online theoretical AI class that's probably better organized; MIT and Brown have great AI classes with actual implementation homework--look into those instead.)",
    "If it's with Professor McDermott, no. I might have learned something from this class if lectures ever made any sense, but they never did (to anybody). Overall, a very frustrating class. Bad lectures, unclear expectations, and confusing assignments. Sometimes the problem sets would make sense after re-reading them many times, and in those cases they were reasonably instructive. Sometimes they never wound up making sense, though, and Professor McDermott was not very good atclarifying them. The exams are just as confusing.",
    "Don't take it with McDermott. It's supposed to be better with Scaz. Not too much work. It's mostly about search algorithms and logic, not robotics. Know what you're getting yourself into!"
