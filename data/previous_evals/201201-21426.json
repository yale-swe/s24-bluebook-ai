   "comments": [
    "I liked the films a lot, but lectures were pretty disorganized. I wasn't exactly sure what I was supposed to take away from each lecture.",
    "I would not recommend it simply because I found the material pretty boring.",
    "Take it. Incredibly fun class. I totally got into films because of this course, and will continue to love world cinema because of it.",
    "it's a great way to get a guided tour though world cinema. you pick up a lot and I loved a lot of the films shown!",
    "This class is a broad survey of how film means all over the world. The movies form the core of this class, and they are a wide ranging group of films. Take this class if you are interested in expanding the horizons of how you think about foreign films, and really, other parts of the world.",
    "This is a great film class for both majors and non-majors. The films were so fascinating that I wish the reading had been more intensive. Anyone would enjoy this class, I wish I could take it again!",
    "I would. I felt like I gained a very comprehensive idea of the various kinds of cinema from around the globe, but how those forms of film-making are different from films that function on a global scale (that can be marketed to film festivals). Plus, we got to see a lot of great movies.",
    "Great class to take if you're interested in the history of world cinema, especially since the professor links the films t socio-politico-cultural and economic developments in the regions we study.",
    "World Cinema was a thoroughly enjoyable class. I was a complete beginner at film studies, but it was a gentle learning curve, pretty easy on the novices. Professor Andrew does tend ramble at times but our TAs definitely helped make sense of the points he was raising. Definitely take this class if you want to learn to talk intelligently about film and\/or encounter other cultures. Also I would highly recommend it as an enjoyable WR that you actually learn new skills from, yet isn't too much work.",
    "This course is a great introduction to world cinema. I had never taken a film class before, and felt I learned a ton about film analysis and cinema infrastructure around the world. The films are all amazing and you'll want to talk and write about them. Even though there are a lot of assignments, they do not take long and are enjoyable to write, and so the workload is not very heavy. Highly recommended."
