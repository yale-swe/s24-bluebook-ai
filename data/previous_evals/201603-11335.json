   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot of music history",
    "Learned how to identify aspects of pieces of music that link them to specific periods of music. Learned basic terminology.",
    "A good working knowledge of classical music.",
    "I learned more than I've ever understood about all kinds of classical music. It has helped me differentiate between different musical styles and ideas. I loved learning this material.",
    "I have learned a great deal about the general history, theory and different styles of Western music.",
    "In Listening to Music I learned a history of music in the world and its different styles and iterations through time, as well as the scientific and theoretical reasons that we find music pleasing.",
    "Provided a vocabulary to analyze and better appreciate classical music.",
    "I learned how to listen to and evaulate music with the ear of a composer, specifically classical music, but also modern music. I now have a basic understanding of theory and an overall awareness of the history of music in the Western world and what leads different people to appreciate different music.",
    "I learned more about music history which was really valuable to me.",
    "Understanding of different forms and periods of music, understanding of language used to describe music, and able to identify individual instrument types.",
    "By taking this course, I gained a broad knowledge of the periods and styles in music history, and a greater appreciation of specific composers and compositions. As someone who has played a lot of music before but not had a lot of historical\/stylistic context, this class was immensely rewarding. After taking it, I want to attend more classical concerts and feel that I can engage more with music as a high art form.",
    "This class equipped me with the skills and knowledge to think about and appreciate music on a deeper level. I can now listen to music and appreciate it on many levels- historical, musical, scientific, etc.",
    "By taking this course, I developed a new appreciation for the music I have listened to for years, in addition to expanding my taste in music.",
    "I learned very much about how to analyze musical critically - especially in regards to what terms should be used. When I listen to various pieces now, it is easier to understand the intentions of the composer. I also have a better understanding of why I feel the way I do when I hear certain chord changes, rhythms, etc.",
    "I learned how to be a more knowledgable consumer of music. I learned a library of terms and concepts with which to understand classical music. I also learned how to differentiate between music from different eras (classical, romantic, baroque, etc.)",
    "This class was immensely useful for learning how to make sense of classical music.",
    "I learned a great deal about the history and development of music over time as well as developed skills to hear certain aspect of music.",
    "In this class, I furthered my knowledge of music and its history, as well as the skill of listening, analyzing, and understanding musically what exactly I am listening to.",
    "I developed a basic understanding of the history of Western music, the greats of the Western canon, and the relevant terms.",
    "I learned about the forms and qualities of different genres and eras of Western instrumental music in a way that's helped me to be able to appreciate, enjoy, understand, and not be bored by more types of music than I ever thought I could!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The online problems kept us busy",
    "The midterms are memorization based, which is weird to me. The workload is much greater than anyone would hope for, making you truly regret taking a class that was supposed to be enjoyable. I would suggest trying not assign more than 3 chapters per week and, if an essay (even if short) will be assigned that week, try to lower down the number of chapters we have to cover. The listening guides and the TAs were really helpful to understand the material and, if you've never taken any music classes or have never been exposed to it, you will indeed learn quite a bit.",
    "Strengths is that the content is clear but weaknesses is that it is often didactic and any deviation form format causes grading penalty. They do not have consistent tools.",
    "Listening to Music is a great class for individuals who wants to learn about music but have little understanding of the subject. Course is structured well and facilitates learning.",
    "Very organized, workload was distributed very evenly throughout the semester. Sometimes we rushed through important material in lecture.",
    "Strengths: Great subject and teacher Weakness: Homework assignments become repetitive.",
    "The class's biggest strength was the amount of engagement offered. Lectures were very interactive and sections were relaxed and informative.",
    "The strengths were how accessible it was and the engagement of the lectures. I do wish other types of music were covered like jazz or blues though.",
    "The course is a great introduction to music appreciation. The weekly listening exercises online really help you to understand the concepts for each chapter. Professor Wright and the TAs are also all very understanding and patient!",
    "At times, the course was a little disorganized, and navigating through both Canvas and the Mind Tap system could be tricky. Overall, however, the work expected was clear and consistent, and the lectures were enjoyable and engaging.",
    "The strength of this course is absolutely in its teaching staff. Professor Wright and the TAs (Laura and Kamala) are clearly passionate about the material and this is reflected in their enthusiastic, thoughtful teaching. Lectures and sections were both immensely enjoyable and informative. The course has few weaknesses, but if there were one area I think could use improvement, it would be the format of the assignments, particularly at the end of the course. We had a final paper and a final exam just a few days apart at the end of the semester, which made for a stressful finish to the course. The prompt for the final paper was unnecessarily complex and a bit overwhelming.",
    "It's an amazing course! No complaints!",
    "The strengths of this course lie in the fact that the weekly listening exercises force you to engage with the material for very class. Although this is expected in many courses, actually having assignments that must be completed before each class help keep up a high level of engagement. In addition, section is useful and the choice of pieces that we listen to is great. The main weakness of this course is the online platform MindTap - it is slow, sometimes doesn't load, and listening guides do not always work. This should be fixed.",
    "Strengths: Craig is SUPER knowledgable. Lots of listening, which is likely very unique among Yale college courses. Definitely didn't assume prior knowledge, which was a plus. TAs were great -- from the music school. Learned about a topic I otherwise would know very little about. Weaknesses: This course was a bit soft\/gut-y. It was not ZERO work, but I felt like Craig babied the students. The textbook felt like something out of high-school and the teaching was VERY straightforward --> here's what you should know about this piece; not very open ended. Not a very intellectual journey, this course. Assignments were sort of frivolous: worksheets and a very formulaic final paper.",
    "Can't really think of any ways to improve it. Excellent course and one of my favorites at Yale so far.",
    "This course could be improved by giving the students more activities and assignments to practice analyzing pieces. I felt that the concert review was especially difficult, because, while we had developed some techniques for analyzing music through the listening exercises, they were always multiple choice questions and guided us through music pretty closely, whereas at the concert we were left on our own to try to digest 90 consecutive minutes of music.",
    "The Mindtap online platform was sometimes difficult to keep track of alongside the new canvas assignment modules. A list at the beginning of the semester of what assignments are due at which date in the syllabus would be helpful to avoid missing any assignments.",
    "Strengths: clear curriculum (I never was confused about what would be on the test, e.g.), awesome TAs, interesting material. Weaknesses: sometimes felt like assignments and study guides were spoon-feeding me the information I needed to do well on the test or paper. It was great that it was easy to do well, but I didn't feel like I did much thinking about the material on my own."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah sure",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "It isn't a bad class to get a humanities credit. Generally a pretty chill class with not too much workload. Exams aren't too hard either.",
    "Maybe. If you're willing to let this course take over your life because of small assignments that you're not even waiting for (like extra papers to read or even write), 4 chapters worth of reading every week on top of listening guides and exercises, go for it. I mean, you'll learn quite a bit, but you're also going to be cold called by the professor to answer questions in a morning class in a dark room where you'll be falling asleep. I also didn't like how memorization based the exams were. In any case, I learned a lot, the TAs were awesome and the professor was good. I just wish this course had been less time-consuming, because I was taking much higher-level\/harder courses at the same time that didn't take me half as much time per week.",
    "Absolutely. It's a great class and I loved it.",
    "I would. It is a fun but challenging course that introduces oneself to what was for me a completely new topic.",
    "This is an overlooked class. Really excellent, and Professor Wright is just delightful.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Anyone that likes music should take MUSI 112. Sad that it won't be taught anymore.",
    "Absolutely! Craig, Laura and Kampala did an awesome job teaching.",
    "Highly recommend although this was Prof Wright's last year teaching it. This is a classic Yale course that lived up to its name. Take if you want to be able to fully appreciate classical and analyze it to a large degree without a strong music theory background. Lectures were relaxing and enjoyable, expectations for the two tests and short papers were clearly laid out.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, the course offers a very relaxed and engaging environment (however it will no longer be taught in this current format).",
    "Yes, a nice relaxing course.",
    "Highly recommend, but Professor Wright is retiring :(",
    "If you are interested in going deeper into how classical music works, and in learning who the music greats were, take this class! It's life-enriching.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Unfortunately this was Professor Wright's last year teaching it though, so hopefully the next professor is as good as he was. The semester begins with the fundamentals of music (tempo, pitch, key, etc.), so if you have any experience with music the first week or two will be review. But even if you have never played music before, this course provides tons of resources to help you learn and keep up. After you cover the fundamentals of music, you work your way through different eras of music, from Middle Ages to Postmodernism. Lectures consist of some historical context around the important composers and pieces of a given era, and of course, listening to some great music. Professor Wright often played sections of pieces on the piano or had guest performers play for us, which was immensely enjoyable. I wouldn't call this course a gut, as it does require a nontrivial investment of time to do well, but if you keep up with the reading (which is very light) and actually do the Active Listening Guides when they are assigned, you should find this course easy to excel in.",
    "Yes.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student - especially if the student is passionate about music. This course teaches you how to understand the ways in which music affects you. I know those skills that I've learned will be useful in me for the rest of my life when I engage with music.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it -- not a great use of a yale course credit. Not really intellectual or exploratory enough. You get told what to think and then you regurgitate it, mostly. Craig is lovely and really smart, but he's doesn't give us tools to really think for ourselves.",
    "Absolutely. Wonderful class.",
    "Yes this was a very intriguing class if you are interested in music, particularly classical music.",
    "It is a good course for students who are interested in music but are looking for a fundamental introduction to the Western canon. However, this class does require consistent work and careful attention to the writing assignments.",
    "Yes! For anyone who thinks that classical music could be cool but doesn't know enough about it to not be bored, this course gives you exactly the right info to fix that. It's designed for anyone, even if you don't know a lot about music, although some people in the class do know about music and therefore start a little ahead. Takes attendance at section and at class. Very reasonable workload (midterm, final, review of a YSO concert in November, and short paper with easy-to-follow specific guidelines) Don't take it if you want to learn about anything outside of the musical Western canon, though."
