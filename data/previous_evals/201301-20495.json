    "This class will give you a fresh perspective on how you understand Asia and the globe. It can be quite tough in the beginning especially during the deconstruction phase where we challenge our deep seated assumption about categories. However, as long as you can survive that phase, you will reap the rewards for your hardwork for the rest of the semester.",
    "I would summarize this course as a deconstruction of both a region-oriented and a Eurocentric vision of Asia, pushing towards a new conceptualization of the culture and markets in Asia. I would recommend this course for anyone interested in trade in Asia, especially China but also the Middle East.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The readings are fascinating, and Professor Siu is brilliant and easy to talk to."

   "comments": [
    "This course expanded my knowledge in a direction somewhat outside of my own field, but in a useful way which allows me to reconceptualize my notions of regions, cultures, and markets, which is particularly useful since these things are often accepted at face value for analysis in social sciences, when in fact they should be approached much more cautiously!"
