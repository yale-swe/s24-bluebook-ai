    "If you're interested in sports, YES. If you're interested in drugs\/ethical implications\/legal implications\/etc, YES. If you're not interested in any of these things, probably not. The class was about 1\/2 athletes, and all but 2 enjoyed playing\/watching sports. I absolutely loved this class, manageable work, and I looked forward to it each week even at 7pm.",
    "Best science credit out there if it is offered again - Dominik is really caring and nice, and the workload is very manageable. You learn cool things about anti-doping efforts too!",
    "A fairly easy, really straightforward, incredibly interesting class. The seminar is set up as either a guest speaker or student presentations each week, there's easy homework, and a final paper. Really chill way to get a science credit and talk about sports in the process. Learned a lot with little workload and maximum science credit. Let's go! Also, steroids, baseball, doping, Lance Armstrong, yes!",
    "Performance and Performance-Enhancing Substances was a comprehensive lecture that covered the science, effects, ethics, issues, and real-world examples of performance-enhancing drug use. I would definitely recommend it to someone who wants to try something different and thinks he or she would enjoy it. It was awesome!",
    "A fun and interesting science credit but we didn't get any real grades over the course of the semester which was somewhat disconcerting.",
    "Great course. Manageable work load. Very relaxed learning atmosphere. Take this of you are an athlete.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. There were weekly assignments, but they were never too difficult. In addition to the weekly assignments, each student had to do an in-class presentation and write a final 15-page paper. It was not an overly demanding class, and the discussions were always interesting. It's a great way to get a science credit.",
    "Amazing class. Take it",
    "This class is great to take, especially if you are looking to get a science credit out of the way. I would highly recommend it to athletes because the topics are exactly where our interests lie: in sports. Mr. Pesta also has some very good connections and got very interesting speakers to come to our class to explain the topics even further. The workload for this class is light and the topics and presentations are fun to complete and listen to.",
    "Structured seminar. Very chill week-to-week but big presentation and big seminar paper that you should be on top of."
