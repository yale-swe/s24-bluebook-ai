   "comments": [
    "I gained knowledge and skills in the domain of conducting qualitative research. This was especially important for me right now in my doctoral career as I am designing a mixed-methods qualitative study.",
    "I feel like I was able to hone my critical thinking skills in this course. I was also able to put names to many concepts I've experienced and\/or engaged with in the past. Overall, it was a great way to truly get a deep dive into the qualitative research method.",
    "I learned a lot. Amity walked us through each step of developing a research proposal and I came away with a concrete skill set.",
    "Formulating Research proposal",
    "In this course, I learned a tremendous amount about research -- how to do it, how to do it ethically, why it's important, what not to do, etc. We addressed many different topics through many different mediums, including in-class discussions, readings, lecture, guest lecturers, and more. As a result of this class, I now feel more prepared to enter the field and do qualitative research that can make a difference and be academically rigorous. Because of Dr. Doolittle, I am better equipped to conduct interviews, do participant observation, analyze documents, and much more.",
    "I learned about the tools for qualitative research. I developed a perspective on how different tools are used for varying situations, and the steps to developing a well thought out project proposal.",
    "qualitative research methods, the ethics and politics of conducting research, how to develop a meaningful research proposal, presentation\/pitch skills, analysis of literature, components of a research proposal, analyzing research studies, balancing qualitative and quantitative methods",
    "qualitative research methods, practice and skills in forming my own research questions.",
    "In this course I developed a strong understanding of qualitative research techniques, and obtained experience thinking through the design of a qualitative study. I have obtained a strong understanding of the strengths and value of qualitative data, as well as critical considerations and critiques of the practice. In this course I have received the space and guidance to consider new ways of exploring my own research interests."

   "question_text": "How well did the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class align with your expectations?",
   "comments": [
    "Very well!!! It was an amazing introduction to qualitative methodologies and approaches.",
    "The knowledge gained in this class aligned well with my expectations -- though, as to be expected from a cross-disciplinary standpoint, the readings were mainly geared towards forestry and environmental science and not many other fields; however, the concepts were universally applicable which is what I appreciated about this course.",
    "I expected this class to be helpful but a little dull and it turned out to be one of my favorite courses.",
    "Very well",
    "At first glance, I thought the class would be dry and dull, but I was gleefully mistaken. Dr. Doolittle's course ended up being my favorite course this semester. I learned so much about research, and I was able to apply things learned in this class to my other courses. While I initially thought that thing this class would just satisfy a degree requirement, I walked away at the end as a much better researcher and student than I otherwise would have been.",
    "The class aligned with my expectations, and I am very glad to have taken this class in my first semester at FES.",
    "I did not have many expectations of what this course would cover coming into it, but I found all of the lectures, discussions, and course materials so valuable not only to my work as a researcher but also to my life.",
    "they aligned well",
    "The conversations and readings that took place during this course included considerations of justice, the greater role of the academy, and the type of researcher I hope to be this far exceeds my expectations for any research methods course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I was thinking we could do more discussion in pairs or groups in order to encourage more participation?",
    "Very informative sessions and practical assignments. Again, perhaps the reading materials could be widened somewhat in terms of scope of focus, but that's not really a huge weakness. It inspired me to seek papers from my own field to supplement what we were doing in class.",
    "I thought the assignments were excellent. Class discussions lagged at times. The instructor could have asked more pointed questions to keep the conversation lively.",
    "If you failed to do the readings, then quality of discussions suffers, and obviously you aren't able to meaningfully contribute. The readings are great. I wish I had been able to do all of the readings for every class. Maybe it would be good if each student was assigned one reading to present to class the main takeaways and concepts. I loved all of the assigned readings. Not too much either, so it's not overwhelming.",
    "Systematic approach to research was great",
    "The course covered a lot of ground, which was great. At the same time, the course does not overload students with information. The lessons we learned were digestible, and they didn't overwhelm us. One suggestion is that there be more discussion in the course. I felt that some of the best learning moments arose through unplanned conversations between students and the professor, so enabling these moments to flourish more -- which is largely the responsibility of the students themselves -- could be beneficial.",
    "Strengths, I liked that we practiced out interviewing, and transcribing. I am so think the peer support developed was a huge benefit for me. I only wish there was more time to practice more tools within the class.",
    "Strengths: great course material, very well organized, strong lectures, great accessibility of the professor, Professor Doolittle--amazing (supportive, honest, helpful, insightful), fair and meaningful assignments, good feedback given. No real weaknesses to report!",
    "the times when we got to think about our own research question together and go over practical aspects of research were great. having more of that would be useful.",
    "The course was a great pace and structure. I enjoyed how clear our objectives were for each week, and how we were able to get feedback on our work from my classmates at the end of the week. I truly can not think of weaknesses to the course. There was immense collaboration between students (who were often large resources for each other) and our instructor was well organized and supportive."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "To have a specific proposal in mind they want to develop throughout the course",
    "If you are at all interested in qualitative methods (and even if you are unfamiliar with them), this is a great place to launch your understanding. It will give you an appreciation for the methodology, and, more importantly, help you frame (and re-frame) your own research interests and scope of work. Going into this class with an idea of a research project you want to launch, though, will be of critical importance.",
    "A great opportunity to pursue your own interests, research, and skill development.",
    "Take the class. If you want to be a critical problem solver and believe you might find yourself in any sort of research position, this class is a must. I was challenged in my limited ways of conducting research, ways of thinking through evidence, and ways of measuring and analyzing \"data.\" I wish I had taken this class my first semester of my first year. That would be ideal.",
    "This course is much more than what you would expect in a \"methods\" course. You will engage with complex ideas and real-world research scenarios, and you will be a better student (and person) as a result of this course. Dr. Doolittle genuinely cares about her students and makes your learning a top priority. Yes, there are several assignments -- most are small -- but they all work toward the end of making you a better researcher. I would recommend this course, even if it isn't required for your degree.",
    "I think this class is a great intro into qualitative research.",
    "I definitely recommend this class, regardless of your research and academic background. Understanding the practice and value of qualitative research is so critical and valuable, and Professor Doolittle does a wonderful job (supported by many great resources and materials) in exploring qualitative research methods and approaches. You will be pushed to really reflect on yourself as a researcher and what you bring to the table, as well as the ways that you can perform your research in the most effective, insightful, and ethical ways.",
    "Ask questions specific to your interests as they relate to the class discussion.",
    "I would say that this is certainly a course that involves a lot of self-exploration and communication with classmates and the instructor. This course encourages individuals to bring and contribute their personal insights to the classroom."
