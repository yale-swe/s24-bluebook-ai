   "comments": [
    "I gained a thorough understanding of the orders and families of woody species in temperate forests. I also gained the necessary skills to do any forestry related research that involves species identification.",
    "I had never had any exposure to botany or plant systematics, so the skills I learned in this class were entirely new. I came away knowing absolutely so much more about trees - not only being able to ID over 100 species by sight - but also about where species grow and why and their adaptation and resilience strategies, etc. This is such an amazing course for anyone remotely interested in understanding plants and just getting to spend time every week learning in the field.",
    "I learned so much about trees and the forests around me."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is amazing if you're looking for something different from the rest of classes at Yale. It is always outside and you have an opportunity to engage really intimately with the material. It is a lot of memorization, especially if you are entirely unfamiliar with the trees around Connecticut, but it made my semester so much better by providing something different and fascinating.",
    "This course is absolutely fantastic. It is logistically challenging because it is field-based, and we had a lot of bad weather this semester. It was a little bit challenging to navigate not knowing what was coming the next week (quiz, no quiz, field, classroom, etc.) but that's sort of just the reality of a field-based course. Marlyse was very good at communicating with us, and good at understanding when we needed a week off from learning species. She was very flexible and communicated well with us. It was also cool to feel like we had input in how the course progressed, getting to choose which field trips we wanted to go on. Overall such an amazing course and Marlyse and Laura were amazing teachers.",
    "Marlyse mentioned at one point that she has toyed with offering the course in the spring instead of the fall so that we would be forced to learn buds\/bark\/etc. before leaves appearedI think this would actually be a great improvement because the course gets remarkably harder as time goes on. Not only are you learning more species, but you're also having to constantly re-learn difficult portions of old species as the main marker many of us rely on, the leaves, fall off.",
    "Prod Duguid is a great and patient instructor. My only regret is that it rained so much so we couldn't go on all of our field trips! I really appreciated the emphasis on in-the-field learning."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! But only if you are interested in trees and being in the field. If you are not, it is not for you. If you are, it's the best class you can take in my opinion",
    "Would recommend very highly. If you are willing to work hard, spend time outside in the cold, and study a lot, you will get SO much out of this course.",
    "Yes! If you want to learn about trees and shrubs in a supportive but challenging environment."
