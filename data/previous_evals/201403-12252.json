    "Psych 190 was a mix of psych and science that was entertaining and interesting for the most part. Be prepared to work, even though there aren't too many assignments.",
    "Very interesting walk through basic clinical neuroscience (spanning many psychological conditions) that non-science people can appreciate without the enormous stress that would come with a course designed for people in the field. As long as you study the PowerPoints thoroughly (forget the textbook!), you'll be generally OK for the exams, although more than a few questions were either worded unclearly or were designed to \"catch\" a student: You knew A was right, C was possible, and then there was an \"A and C\" option....ughhh! Would be good to see tests incorporate what was taught more comprehensively (every time, I studied a lot that didn't end up being on the exam) WHILE providing some more choice (\"pick 20 of the 25 MC questions\" or \"pick 5 of the 7 open response questions\"). Professor Cannon had his own kind of charm, even though his lecture voice is a bit monotonous. No section and only 4 straightforward 500-word responses over the whole semester. It's not Issues Approach to Biology, but it's not bad either - a science course for humanities students could be much, much worse.",
    "Interesting, but certainly difficult if you do not have a science background. I found myself helping my friends who were taking this for a SC credit a lot, and they regretted taking this for the SC as it coudl get quite technical. If you're interested in the topics though, Prof. Cannon is great at presenting the material. And his guest lecturers are great as well. Not too much work either, just four 500 word essays and 3 midterms.",
    "A very, very interesting course. Probably not the best class to take if you are looking to fulfill the distributional requirement, unless you have a strong background in biology. The lectures are great (aside from the guest lectures), Professor Cannon is funny and entertaining, and actually interacts with the class during lecture, which was refreshing.",
    "Ehhh take abnormal psychology if you can, unless you're really into neuro.",
    "3 midterms (60%), 4 papers (40%) - lectures can often be dry and there is no curve---you know that all the science majors are getting As. I took this for a science cred. not too bad, but I was also interested in the course material.",
    "This is a very dense class. There aren't any pre-reqs, but I would definitely recommend at the very least taking PSYC 110 before this one, and taking 160 (Human Brain) would do you a lot of good (it's a good class, too). There's a lot of material and it's definitely interdisciplinary. I took this at the same time as Genetics (MCDB 202), and there was more overlap than you might think between the two. This is definitely not a gut, and it's a bit of a misnomer to call it an introductory course. Prof Cannon assumes no prior knowledge, ostensibly, but he'll often refer to a brain region or a neurotransmitter, explain it in two or three words, and then never explain it again. Considering how much material is presented in this course, it's easy to miss these explanations and then not understand half of what he says for the rest of the lecture. Content-wise, it's a very interesting course. If you're interested in clinical psych, mental disorders, neuroscience, or genetics, you'll enjoy the material. If you don't need the distributional requirements, I'd say take it Cr\/D\/Fail because the exams (there are three) can be a little hit or miss.",
    "Great course! No readings (don't buy the textbook), the lecture slides are all you need for the exams and to get a great grasp of the information. The first exam is more difficult than the later two because it is the base for everything else you will learn throughout the semester. The papers are short and SUPER easy. I DEFINITELY recommend this course. Only three exams and four 500-word essays. Not the easiest science credit, but definitely worth taking.",
    "Interesting material, no sections, no final--what more is there to say? Professor Cannon is like that uncle who tells you interesting stories by the punch bowl at parties and chuckles pleasantly at his own jokes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for people who need a science credit. For the first third of the course I was pretty overwhelmed and confused but once I spent the time to figure out and understand the basics, the rest of the course came much more easily to me and I was really able to appreciate all the material. I wouldn't let yourself get scared based off the first few lectures, it is worth it to put in the time at the beginning because I ultimately got a lot out of the class by the end. I gained a lot of respect for everything the brain has to do and have a much better understanding of complex mental disorders.",
    "This course is good for anyone interested in the biological processes that go on in the brain. It is heavy on biology, and while it is not necessary to have prior knowledge, it is for someone who enjoys learning biology.",
    "yes, absolutely, if you're interested in the subject matter",
    "This class is basically an examination of mental illness from a biological perspective. Decent introductory psych class, and easy science credit. 3 non-cumulative tests and 4 one page \"essays\" over the course of the semester. Reading is completely unnecessary - don't even both buying the book. Interesting material, but Prof. cannon isn't particularly engaging.",
    "I recommend this course with reservations. Anyone who already knows basic neurobiology or basic information about the etiologies of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia should not take this course because it probably won't expand your knowledge too drastically. The main problem is that, given the major overlap in neural processes behind each disorder, I really can't remember specific information about the etiologies of any of them. It's really good that this class had three non-cumulative midterms instead of having a final, because learning all of the lectures' material for a final test would have been one of the most labyrinthine, frustrating tasks of anybody's academic career. The grading of essay assignments was a little arbitrary, and midterms did not always feel like they rewarded extensive studying since multiple-choice questions can also be arbitrary. Nevertheless, Professor Cannon is a good lecturer.",
    "Intro to Clinical Neuroscience is a really interesting course. The lectures are straightforward and interesting. There are four 1-page papers and three moderately difficult exams. The course is pretty heavy on genetics and neuroscience, so if you just want a course about symptoms that occur, you should probably take a different course. If you do enjoy learning about the connection between genetics, neuroscience, and mental disorders, you should take this course!",
    "A great way to learn about the brain from a very real-world-relavant perspective. It's a good course to take if you're interested in learning about mental disorders, although be warned that it involves studying the brain itself, sometimes more so than diagnosis or case studies. Lectures can be dryly scientific at times, but Prof. Cannon makes a strong effort to liven things up throughout, and the takeaway after learning the little bits of biological info are vastly more interesting than any little details you learn. Prof. Cannon always brings each disorder into the context of a psychiatrist's judgment and how society should treat and approach sufferers. The workload is minimal: I stayed up 3 times studying for the mid terms and spent a couple hours writing the short papers on 4 evenings (also not a lot of work for a Sc).",
    "The material is fascinating and useful. The workload is reasonable and manageable. The exams are tough but fair. Professor Cannon is a good (though at times dry) lecturer, but the material is more than enough to sustain deep interest. As to whether or not this is a \"gut\": probably not. As a non-science person, I struggled with the more science-heavy portions of the class. It was doable though. Honestly, if you decide to take this for your science credit, you *will* learn and be fascinated by what you're learning; the class just might require a little more effort in studying than other classes.",
    "Psych 190 is an incredibly interesting class that explains the neuroscience behind mental disorders. I'm a humanities person, and this ended up being my favorite class. Cannon is amazing. TAKE THIS CLASS! I've been telling everyone I know to take it. Yes, you have to study for the midterms, but there are only three of them. It's really not that bad. This class is THE BEST!",
    "Take it. You don't have to do the reading and the tests are easy and fair",
    "I would recommend. The workload isn't too bad (4 very short essays and 3 unit exams) and the material is interesting. Keep in mind it is a science credit though so it does get more in depth than other more social science oriented psych classes. I would definitely recommend it to people who aren't necessarily science majors though because the material is interesting on its own. Lectures are pretty dry though to be honest and its definitely a struggle to stay awake in class or go to class. All the slides are put online though which are very useful for the tests. Assignments are all pretty straightforward and tests, though aren't easy, aren't extremely difficult either. Study for the tests and follow along with lecture and you should be fine.",
    "Professor Cannon is pretty engaging and passionate about his topic, but it is a new class and that really showed. The due dates of papers and exams were changed a few times, which is a pet peeve of mine. Grading did not seem to be fair or demonstrative of the major themes taught in the course. I still got a C on a paper even after meeting with a TF about the paper. The content is pretty interesting but is not an intro course. I ended up taking a W for the course it was so bad.",
    "Really interesting. Would definitely recommend.",
    "PSYC 190 was a wonderful course. I highly enjoyed the class. The lectures were clearly presented. There was not much work involved except for studying for exams and writing short 4 one-page essays. The readings are not at all necessary.",
    "NOT A GUT. If you are not a science major take this CR\/D.",
    "Great course!! This class is basically the bio\/neuro version of Abnormal Psych. Very informative-- you really get a good understanding for the neurological and biological bases of major mental disorders. Weakness is lack of graded things...there's only three exams and four reading responses.",
    "If you're a psych major, it's a walk in the park. Here's your science credit. If you're not, it might be more of a struggle. You end up learning a lot though about a subject that most people are misinformed on.",
    "A really interesting course. Harder than I expected, a bit dry at times, but with a lot of great material.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. Its not an easy course at all, but if you're interested in the topic you will get a lot out of it, and the TAs are very willing to help and listen.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. A can't-miss course for psych majors. It really helped me to conceptualize and communicate how mental disorders develop and spread. Ty is an excellent lecturer, personable, and gladly welcomes comments and questions from students.",
    "A good straightforward survey class for people interested in the neuroscience underlying abnormal psychology. Not overly difficult, potentially helpful to have taken a brain class previously.",
    "Stick with the first few lectures as they have to get through some of the overarching basics and then it will get really interesting once you start learning about the specific disorders.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It's an incredible introduction to a variety of psychological disorders and their basis in the brain.",
    "Excellent class, especially for a non-science person looking for some science credit. Ever wonder what they were talking about in the pop-science sections of the New York Times? This class will make you understand. Relatively interesting every lecture, easy assignments (just memorize slides for the tests and summarize the readings for the papers). Not hard to get an A. Seemed like the class was made up of a lot of psych majors and humanities people looking for sc. Professor Cannon is pretty funny and his slides are very well written.",
    "A decent overview of psychopathology from a neurological perspective. Totally doable for non-science majors, but you do need to study for the exams to do well. Though there was some interesting material and Dr. Cannon's lectures are sometimes interestingly analytical, we often spent too much time understanding concepts and not enough time applying or discussing them.",
    "This is a pretty difficult science credit for non-science majors. You will have to study a lot for the exams, and even then, you might not do that well considering that the exams are scored out of 70 points instead of 100 and getting 4 multiple choice questions wrong out of 20 multiple choice questions (with 100% on the short answer portion of the exam) puts your exam at a B+. There is really no curve for the class, too, because enough people still do well enough on the exams, but those people are mostly the science\/psychology majors. Professor is good, TFs are good, course content is interesting enough, but exams are a pretty difficult to get As on. There are also 4 1-page single space essays for the class that aren't too difficult to do, but they do become a nuisance after a while, especially if you're a humanities\/social sciences major already writing a lot of essays (like me...). Basically, take this class at your own risk if you're a non-science major looking for a science credit. It's a pretty good class, but you'll have to work quite a lot to do well against the science\/psychology majors in the class. There are probably easier science credits out there. Nonetheless, if you're genuinely interested in the course material, then this should be a good class for you. It's presented really well I think.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, both as a great science credit for humanities-oriented people, and as an overall extremely interesting class. You'll come away with a comprehensive understanding of mental disorders, which are really fascinating. The class isn't much work at all, and the tests are reasonable. Must take.",
    "Essentially a neuroscience\/biologically oriented version of abnormal psych. Relatively accessible but will not bore students who have a lot of pshch knowledge already. If you want to understand your brain, take it.",
    "PSYC 190 is deceptively difficult, and I would steer clear of it if it's either your freshman year or you're taking it just to get a science out of the way. Though Prof. Cannon is incredibly kind and knowledgable, the course has three exams and four papers, and that's when stress starts to ramp up. Additionally, there is no material from the reading presented on the exams or essays, which makes it superfluous to do.",
    "Psyc 190 is a cool intro psyc course that focuses on different common mental disorders. I would recommend it.",
    "If you're interested in studying clinical psychology through the lens of neuroscience, then this class is perfect! As in Abnormal Psych, you go through a number of specific disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar, antisocial personality, OCD, eating disorders, depression, substance abuse and others), but the focus is less on clinical presentation and treatment - you also learn about the genetic and evolutionary factors that influence these disorders, the neuronal and physiological mechanisms that drive them, and how pharmalogical treatments actually work. If you've taken a lot of other neuroscience\/psych classes, the first few lectures will likely be review for you, but you'll still definitely learn new things once the class really gets going. Some of the lectures - especially on evolutionary factors and genetics - really changed the way I think about the neuroscience of mental illness. Professor Cannon is a leading schizophrenia researcher and really incorporates the latest research (and latest questions\/problems in the field) into his lectures. He also makes the lectures interactive and is really open to questions.",
    "PSYC 190 covers the major psychological disorders including theories of etiology and treatment as well as background information on genetics.",
    "It's not a hard class but it's also really interesting. Take it if you want a fairly easy science, and if you liked PSYC 110. Most of the material is intuitive.",
    "I'd recommend psyc 190 for sure. It's a not very difficult way to get a science credit, and you learn a lot about the brain and mental illness. It's nice to have a brain-based course that is directed at a particular topic, especially one that is interesting (ie mental illness). The 3 midterms are somewhat challenging but the 4 short papers aren't, also there's no final and no long paper. It's not necessary to do readings. Slides are online but you should still go to lecture to understand them. Tyrone Cannon isn't the most engaging lecturer (it's easy to fall out of attention) but he is lowkey very funny. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in neuroscience. The material is very interesting and you definitely learn a lot. Although this says it is an intro course, I would not reckon end if you do not have any science or psych background.",
    "Incredibly interesting science course but definitely not a gut!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. If you are not a Psych major, it will be a decent amount of work (especially prepping for tests), but it is a really interesting class.",
    "This is not an easy science credit. Expect a lot of memorization and guessing on multiple choice tests. Only take this class if you are truly fascinated by neuroscience.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in pursuing psychology or neuroscience but not as a gut science credit because it is not easy.",
    "take this course if you're interested in further understanding mental disorders.",
    "Great course if you are a humanities student who needs a science credit but wants to work and actually learn about the brain.",
    "SO hard. So hard. So hard.",
    "Take this course!",
    "Yes, it is a good science credit for non-science people. The material is interesting and the workload manageable. The essays balance out the exam. The Piazza is helpful. Professor Cannon is wonderful--makes lecture interesting, answers any questions you have, and understands that most people might not be really familiar with the science involved in the course. I thought that the guest lectures were interesting, and it was cool to hear from people who work in particular fields.",
    "An excellent, semester-long lesson in why lectures are the most inefficient form of communication that humans have ever invented. You would think that, of all people, brain scientists would know this. I think a lecture is the absolute worst way to learn about neuroscience. After two semesters of neuroscience, I don't feel as if I actually know anything about the brain. Sure, I know about hypermethylation and the amygdala and whatever else, but if you gave me an actual brain, I would have no idea what to do with it. I know a lot of names and labels and theories. But they are only words. Repeating\/memorizing vocabulary != understanding."
