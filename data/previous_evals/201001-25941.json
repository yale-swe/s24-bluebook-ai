   "comments": [
    "NOT a class on how music affects the brain. Lots of time spent on very boring, irrelevant material such as Mozart's use of text setting or on how to conduct experiments in music cognition. Very little is known about this field of study, so there's not much to teach - just a lot of speculation. Take only if you're obsessed with finger-tapping experiments. During reading week there was a lot of listening to music excerpts which was very interesting - this happened ONCE after reading week.Professor is very nice but expects a lot. Expect to devote a lot time to this class with not much to show for it.",
    "I would hesitate to recommend this class to another student. It sounds great in concept, and itlures you in with a fascinating first couple of classes, but it gets bogged down in thick music theory and a heavy reading load rather quickly. It ended up being much more work than I thought it would be, and keeping up with all the reading was a constant struggle.",
    "As a musician I assumed this class woudl be relevant to my interests, but that turned out not to be completely true. The discussion was really technical, not so much in a music theory way, which I have knowledge in, but in an experimental, scientific way. If that's your thing then go for it. I'm actually a science person, but I still found the discussion to be dry sometimes.",
    "It's interesting, at times, but largely not a worthwhile course. I hate to say it, but as smart as Poudrier is as a person, she really didn't organize the course in a way where we actually learned a lot. There were many theories that some people didn't understand, too much reading at times, and rushed essay deadlines. I wouldn't recommend taking this class, although there were elements of the course that I did enjoy. More music theory than psychology. Poudrier is very nice and is receptive to student feedback.",
    "Music 009 is a course for someone who is interested in music history and how it has developed over the years and shaped our perception of rhythm. It is not for someone who is interested in music cognition and the general neuroscience behind music; though we did touch upon that a bit, it was very minimal. I would recommend it to someone who is interested in analyzing the rhythms of certain pieces of music, such as symphonies and operas. It is intended more for prospective music majors as opposed to prospective science majors.",
    "Only take this class if you know a fair amount about music theory. It is also a lot of work for a freshman seminar; I wouldn't recommend taking it as a fifth class.",
    "If you're interested in psychology, then this would be an interesting class to take. The class was very heavy on reading, although I think it will lighten up next semester. If you've taken a psychology class before, you might find the readings a little lighter, since some of them were technically dense. Overall, if you're a fast reader, you shouldn't have too much of a problem, and the class is actually pretty interesting.",
    "As freshman seminars go, I would probably say that this one has a very specialized target group of people. If you are extremely interested after shopping this class, then the class will be good for you. However, the field of musicology is not very developed, and so I feel that the course lacks a broad appeal to even generally science or psychology-oriented people, meaning that it will be hard to remain interested in the material over time. It could be difficult to tie everything together or determine the significance of the material presented in class as well. Professor Poudrier is new.",
    "I enjoyed this class at the end and beginning more than in the middle. Some of the discussion was just a little too theoretical for me, so it was hard to contribute in class."
