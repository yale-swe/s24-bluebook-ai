    "Yes, definitely.The most efficient language course I've ever taken.",
    "JAPN 130 is a very work-intensive course that is rewarding at the same time. The course is probably not as rewarding as the L1 and L2 courses (you do not become as close with the professors). There are many moments when you feel you would learn the language better if there were less homework. The course packets is very scattered, and it frequently takes fifteen minutes just to understand which homework assignments need to be completed for the next day. Other than that, the class definitely teaches you the language and you are always challenged.",
    "A very challenging course that effectively teaches you Japanese. I would suggest this class to anyone that wanted to learn the language because it seems to be the most effective way outside of studying abroad.",
    "This is an excellent class. Japanese is definitely intense, but it is worthwhile if you are determined to learn the language. This class requires a lot of studying and work outside of class, so if you are taking a heavy course load, you should either rethink taking it until later or taking it credit\/d. The professors are great and class is usually pretty fun. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to learn Japanese."
