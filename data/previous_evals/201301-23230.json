    "Yesfun class",
    "I had to take it for a requirement, so I didn't have much of a choice, but it actually wasn't as bad as I was expecting. A lot less boring than 125's material. I guess if you really love poetry it would be worth it.",
    "Wordsworth and Pope are boring, Milton is interesting and Eliot is phenomenal. If your teacher is dry, good luck getting through the class (Wendy Lee is NOT dry- she made it fun)",
    "Definitely take this class! Even if you don't want to be a major, it's just an enjoyable class with important texts.",
    "Excellent overall. As long as you have Professor Lee, you will have zero complaints. The material can be fascinating with the correct instructor.",
    "I think this is an important course to take for English majors, but I don't think I would recommend it for anyone who is not an English major. I think other courses are more accessible\/interesting for someone with just a passing interest in English. However, for those who are majors, the course will give you important background for later study. It's actually kind of fun to read these diverse poets and get a chance to discuss them at a fairly relaxed pace. Professor Lee is great, too, and you can't go wrong with her!",
    "I would recommend English 126 with Prof Lee to another student. The reading assignments are light, but the essay assignments are intense. They are infrequent, but when they occur, they take up a lot of time because they really force you to think. A lot people have to take this class because it is a prereq for the major. I myself am not sure I'm going to be an English major, and I enjoyed the class nonetheless. I would recommend this class to just about anyone.",
    "This is an English prereq, so if you're considering this section, you probably have to take this class. Given that, DEFINITELY try to take this class with Professor Lee. She is so much fun to have in class, and really does everything to make sure people are not only understanding the material, but actually liking it. Honestly, she's just adorable, super nice, and really really smart. A gem!"
