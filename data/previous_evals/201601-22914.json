   "comments": [
    "Great course, highly recommended, especially for those interested in applying game theory in their research",
    "PLSC 802 introduces you to formal models in American politics. We begin by understanding how voters think and act, how government works and acts, and then we learn about how voters and government interacts. This course is incredibly important for those interested in American politics or interactions in government.",
    "Yes, would recommend this course to a student interested in political behaviour and institutions, particularly the intersection of these subfields. It is mathematically challenging - involves considerable formal modelling - but the instructor is very proficient in explaining them. If you invest the time to read carefully, this seminar will be very rewarding - Professor Beim will help you read and analyse formal models; apart from discussing the main texts and recent scholarship on collective action and choice.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who was interested in American Politics. It is an opportunity to read and discuss foundational work and it's modern extensions.",
    "The course considers models of collective action in various arenas: the selection of representatives, the production of policy, and the interaction between the two. The course provides substantive insight into principles of democratic institutional design and political accountability, as well as demonstrating the implications of methodological choices in formal modeling. Highly recommended."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely a good course for a first-year phd student - helpful in learning about the review process, practicing for comp exams, and generally learning about an interesting literature",
    "This course introduced me to aspects in the discipline that will be essential as I begin my own research.",
    "It really helped me, particularly with understanding formal models and the expansive literature on collective action and choice.",
    "This course provided an extremely helpful orientation in understanding the uses of formal modeling in political science. Its contribution to my understanding of political science was invaluable. Reading recent or current scholarship was helpful for orienting students to norms in current scholarship, and the course took a useful critical perspective. The reviewer report assignment prompted students to think about the practical aspects of producing political science research.",
    "It has been very useful in understanding a subfield that I knew little about: American Political Economy"
