    "I gained a deeper understanding of the intricacies of Spanish grammar and gained a greater ability to speak Spanish in a presentational setting. I also learned about Latin American and Spanish culture, in the form of films, literature, and art. I also learned more about the differences in different dialects of Spanish."

   "comments": [
    "This course maintains a relatively steady pace throughout the semester, which is a strength. However, the abundance of busy work was a bit unnecessary.",
    "There were some times in which the homework felt like a lot because its daily. I understand that the course is 1.5 credits and will therefore have more homework than a typical class but sometimes it did feel overwhelming. I do not like how the Supersite only gives us 2 tries now because if you misspell a word by accident and totally unrelated to the topic of the homework, then you are already down one chance.",
    "Strengths are the professor",
    "Strengths: excellent professor. Weaknesses: departmental organization. The exams and pruebas were horribly written, on multiple exams I found myself and other classmates confused as to what the questions even wanted us to do. Also does not have to be five days a week.",
    "Weaknesses: Almost all the elements of this course are terrible. First, it is every day, which is unnecessary and mean spirited. What is also mean-spirited is that all the exams are on Fridays. Third, the class is all about unusual grammar tenses, which doesnt seem to translate into any functional fluency.",
    "The syllabus organization was strong, as was my professor (Deborah Symons). The readings, textbook, homework, and test structures were all confusing, weak, and not conducive to learning.",
    "Way too much work and almost daily tests and quizzes.",
    "one strength is the wide variety of assignments",
    "I do think that the course is constructed to ensure you have enough practice and full immersion to learn the language well, and it is well rounded enough that you are not only learning about the language but also about the culture behind it. One thing I would change is how strict the grading can be, in terms of both the writing and the online questions. More often than not I was more worried about how many points I got taken off than what the actual subject was, and I believe that can be a hindrance to learning."

    "I would only recommend this course if they could take it with Profesora Symons. The highly structured syllabus is constraining, but she always made it engaging and focused.",
    "Sure, but just because of Professor Symons.",
    "NO, UNLESS IT IS ABSOLUTEY REQUIRED DO NOT",
    "Only as a requirement. If you take L4, seek out Profesora Symons!",
    "for language requirement, yes. also GREAT teacher!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student trying to learn Spanish because I believe if you truly want to learn the language you need to learn everything up to and including L4. On the other hand, if you just need the language requirement, you do not necessarily need L4, but it is structured in a way that it is simply a continuation of L3."
