   "comments": [
    "L1 French has a quiz, test, and composition due every week, but the work is completely manageable. We played games all the time, and there was a lot of food involved. I loved going to class every day. Take it!!",
    "Take it. And if you do go to all the video showings, do workbook everyday, be creative in compositions, and just try not to get behind cause youll be hearing strange words that sound the same and wont mean anything to you if you fall behind (which is hard to do)",
    "Mlle Graves is inspiring, intelligent, and really knows how to get a class involved. Everyone in the section loves her, and it helps you to bond with your class when that happens.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I would recommend it to another student if they actually want to learn the language. If you just want to fill your language requirement, take something easier.",
    "French I is an AWESOME course. It's VERY difficult and frustrating if you have not already had French before and even more so if your section has people who drop from level L2 or L3 (since L2 is not offered fall semester); however the course has a natural progression toward understanding (eventually). The focus on small groups of related and useful vocabulary and idioms paired with a large quantity of grammar provides a comforting structure to the course. Beware the 30 minute tests every monday night [of which 50% of each is listening and speaking into a microphone]and the homework every night (or a LOT on Sunday night or worse monday night after the test).There's definitely a reason (workload) it's worth 1.5 credits (other than meeting every day). Also, Prof. Graves is AWESOME.",
    "It's much more work than other L1 language classes (chinese and arabic excluded), but it's very rewarding in that you learn a lot of french. I'd definitely recommend it!"
