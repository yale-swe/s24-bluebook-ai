    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, interesting topics and not too difficult",
    "A very basic class on some really cool ideas in Astronomy and Astrophysics. Most of the class is taught through discussions between \"buzz-groups\". The professor at times treats you like high schoolers but I still thoroughly enjoyed lectures.",
    "An excellent course to begin to explore the interesting facets of time and space, looking at relativity, dark matter and the expansion of the universe. I would recommend this to anyone that has an interest in astronomy or astrophysics.",
    "This was a solid freshman seminar. The workload varied, but often consisted of several pages of writing per week (in reading responses and summaries), and in 10 or so pages of reading. One of the sessions was a discussion, and the other was a lecture. There is no quantitative work, so everything done in class is about understanding concepts of astronomy in a qualitative sense. Professor Edwards is accessible and helpful.",
    "Wonderful class!!",
    "ASTR 040 may have its weaknesses, but at the end of the day, it's probably the most do-able intro to astronomy at Yale for non-STEM majors. I would recommend that only non-STEM majors take it so that everyone starts off at the same place and half of the class is not confused while the other half is bored. Still, this does not take away from the fact that Dr. Edwards is brilliant and extremely energetic. She will make you want to be an astronomer. TLDR; non-STEM majors: I highly recommend this class! And if you do not take this seminar, please consider another of Dr. Edwards' classes!",
    "This seems like a super easy interesting class to take. I did enjoy the class, but I don't know if I would take it if I had a chance to do the semester again. I am a STEM major who did not need the science credit, I solely took the class because I thought it would be informative and interesting. It is all of these things, but not to the degree that I had hoped. I think I may haven been happier using the credit for either something more interesting or another prerequisite. The grading at points did seem slightly arbitrary also. This class is recommended to non-science majors, but science majors might want to find something else.",
    "ASTR040 is a pretty casual survey course on current topics in astronomy. Classes alternate between lectures and group discussions. Work consists of reading and reflecting on Scientific American-style articles every week, a group midterm presentation, and a final poster project prepared with a partner. With the exception of the midterm and final, the work is predictable and very manageable. You get out of this course what you (and your classmates) put in. If youre especially interested in astronomy\/cosmology\/modern topics in physics, the topics we cover in this class (e.g., dark matter, dark energy, inflation) might be of particular interest to you, and youll probably get more out of the readings and lectures. That said, this class is very accessible to non-STEM majors and people who have limited interest in the field, which means the course doesnt feel especially rigorous or go in-depth with high-level scientific or mathematical foundations for the topics at hand. This has some advantages: its a solid science credit and an easy way to learn about some high-level science in a low-stakes environment. Thinking about the beginning\/end of the universe, the construct of the time, the possibility of a multiverse, etc. is also pretty fun. But if youre looking for an astronomy course that digs deeply into the meat of the science, youre better off in another class. If youre looking for a gut science, I wouldnt recommend this class, either if youre not excited by the topics, the readings and discussions will be underwhelming, and so youll be underwhelmed, and youll just end up with what feels like a self-perpetuating waste of time. Ultimately, if Id known what I know now, I wouldnt take this class I wasnt interested enough in astronomy to motivate myself to engage with the coursework in a meaningful way, and so I dont feel as though I got a lot out of the course. The best students for ASTR040 would be a mix of STEM and non-STEM majors who are fascinated by the topics outlined in the syllabus but not necessarily interested in pursuing astronomy seriously in the future."
