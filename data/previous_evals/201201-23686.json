    "This \"class\" is a joke. I understand why Yale requires it, but the material could have been presented much more succinctly and in a much more relevant way if it was combined with the first semester doctoral seminar.Further, having the class on 3 Friday mornings meant that half of us either had to leave this class early or miss other classes because of the conflict. Better scheduling is a must.",
