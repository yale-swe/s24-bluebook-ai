    "An engineer's approach to E&M. Slow to start, but eventually reaches the interesting bits: dielectrics, wave guides, and transmission lines.",
    "This is a course on the nitty gritty of electrostatics and electromagnetic waves. It's like AP Physics C (part 2), but with vector calculus, dielectrics, and then new stuff like transmission lines and wave guides. It's an interesting course on the physics EE majors take for granted.",
    "This class gave a good overview of introductory E\/M, with emphasis on newer concepts, such as circuit theory and E\/M in materials. The material is not as advanced as what might be covered in, say PHYS 430. I think that the circuits\/transmission lines are practical for an applied physics major or an electrical engineer. The midterm was a bit difficult, but the professor gave us an opportunity to make up for it."
