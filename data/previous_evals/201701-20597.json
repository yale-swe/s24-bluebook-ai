    "Broad overview of the history of study of global warming. Very little deep understanding of physics.",
    "A survey of key scientific concepts which underpin the evidence for climate change and how they developed over time",
    "Rigorous study of climate change, its history, and its implications. Thorough research on the papers and experiments since the 1800s that have collectively created our modern understanding of the subject.",
    "We learned all the basic scientific principles of the climate system and the consequences of anthropogenic carbon dioxide.",
    "I learned about the history of global warming research and basic, salient points of climate physics.",
    "I went from just knowing the basic greenhouse effect to a solid understanding of the subtleties and difficulties related to the science of climate change.",
    "The lectures were very engaging and interesting. I've taken a few classes on this topic but still learned really important concepts in lectures in atmospheric science and the trajectory of climate change. I found that the class moved at a reasonable pace, but I've heard many other students who struggled to keep up with the material because they were non-science majors. I did not find the paper discussions very useful.",
    "Great course! Taught me all about climate change and the science behind it. None of the physics concepts were hard to grasps, and Professor Storelvmo did a great job explaining everything.",
    "I learnt to interoperate complex scientific paper and make connections to present and past outlooks on science.",
    "I learned a good amount by climate change and the scientific processes behind it",
    "Ability to read scientific literature from the past and understand current scientific literature regarding climate science learn about the discipline of climate science how to pick out inaccuracies from papers how to pick out the most important points from papers How to present on scientific knowledge",
    "I gained a better understand of the climate system, climate change and how we have come to know about and understand climate change. The lectures were really helpful and I learned the most from those.",
    "I learned specific about the earth's climate system and gained a better understanding of the causes of climate change. Additionally, I learned how the climate system evolved over time and the complexities of global climate modeling.",
    "Great background on physics of climate change.",
    "I learned about climate change and its causes and effects in the form of debunking common myths. I learned a lot about how to read and evaluate scientific papers. This information seems especially relevant in today's society, and knowing the basis of global warming is great for developing my own opinions on what is being said in the media."

   "comments": [
    "Very interesting content with the potential to be a great course. As this is a science course, I really wish it had been more scientific. Instead, it felt largely like a history course to me with superficial scientific understanding required. Discussion sections were not a good use of time at all. It would be more helpful to have another lecture prepared by the professor where confusing aspects of the papers studied were clarified, errors were identified, etc., in addition to the student presentation, as most discussion sections were used for clarifying questions anyway. I really thought the discussion sections were a waste of time, and breaking out into groups unnecessary. Another major weakness was that the professor was very unclear about what material would be covered on the first quiz. It was much more conducive to studying when she provided a list of major topics. Grades were not updated in a timely manner and confusing to interpret as they were out of 0 points, so it seemed like every student had >100%. Lectures became more engaging when Kahoot was added.",
    "Strengths: very strong premise we read seminal papers which demonstrate the evolution of climate change over time. Weaknesses: discussions were not always well-focused given the size of the class. the class should either have been a large lecture or it could have been capped at about 18 students",
    "I found the concept of the course appealing because I wanted to be able to understand scientific papers on global warming. I thought the lectures would help prepare me to read the papers, but they did not. I found that the lectures were only tangentially related to the papers and did not prepare me for the concepts that someone with little exposure to scientific writing would find confusing. This resulted in an inefficient use of class time on Thursdays, when most of the time was spent clarifying factual elements of the paper that could have been explained beforehand.",
    "Rigorous study of climate change, its history, and its implications. Thorough research on the papers and experiments since the 1800s that have collectively created our modern understanding of the subject. Would appreciate more lecturing on the papers than class conversation, but overall no major things that this course should change.",
    "Strengths: the combination of various majors and genuine interest in the class, as well as Professor Storelvmo's obvious knowledgeability and passion Weaknesses: nothing really",
    "It should definitely not be an intro level class. The material is challenging and with too many novices in the group, the discussion is almost entirely clarification instead of interesting analysis.",
    "The course uses a historical perspective and slowly builds our understanding of climate science by adding complexities to the model, in the order they were understood chronologically. This is actually a pretty effective approach, however I wish more time was left at the end for a good overview of the overall current state of global warming research.",
    "The lectures were great! I would slow down on the materials relating to greenhouse effect, radiation, the atmospheric window, etc. I loved the kahoot!!! I believe the biggest weakness of the course was the paper discussions. I didn't think the student presentations were clear enough to explain the concepts from the papers. The clarification questions were good but still didn't really elucidate the concepts. I think this part can be improved by having the students going over the basic ideas of the papers better, the presentations can be longer if necessary.",
    "Strengths: Interesting subject matter, consistent classroom discussion, variety of backgrounds in physics Weaknesses: Some of the readings were too dense and boring",
    "The strength of this course is that you are able to present a paper to your peers and tackle the presentation hands on. The weakness is that sometimes it is difficult to discuss the papers due to their complexity and I sometimes felt lost with grad students in the discussions.",
    "The discussions could have been less focused on questions and more focused on talking about papers",
    "Strengths: Interesting papers and I liked how papers built on each other; the syllabus was well designed. Weakness: I think the class this year tried to accommodate too many students, so the discussion after papers were often lacking in direction, or disorganized. I wish the discussions were more structured. Really liked the lectures and wish there were more of them.",
    "strengths: lectures were really great and I learned lots. Prof is very gracious and knowledgeable and answers questions well. The material is really well presented. Discussion section (second weekly lecture slot) was a weakness. Discussions were never very productive and I did not learn too much from them.",
    "A good introduction to the study of global warming, and the history of climate physics as a field - namely, this course will teach you not only the science behind climate change, but highlight the way in which the scientific community has come to understand this phenomenon. The class is organized into 2 parts: one lecture during one class meeting, and a student presentation on the weekly paper(s)and discussion the other class meeting. The lectures were good for providing the basics; the student presentations (being student presentations) were hit-or-miss. As a result, I left the class sometimes feeling as though I didn't get anything more out of the presentation and discussion than I did from the paper itself.",
    "Strengths: Really thoughtful and smart teacher, lectures were really interesting, discussions were pretty interesting, readings and not p-sets Weaknesses: Unclear about expectation for most work. The final paper was also 10 pages single spaced instead of 10 pages double spaced. Watch out for that!",
    "This course was clearly meant to be a small seminar (~15-18people) as it has been in past years. This year, it had 40+ students, and that really slowed it down during the Thursday paper presentations. Instead of having a meaningful or even interesting conversation about what the importance of each paper was, how it contributed to scientific consensus about global warming, and strengths\/weaknesses, etc. we spent the entire time answering clarification questions. Clarification questions and their answers are incredibly boring to listen to if you are not the one asking for clarification. Often we would listen to a solid 35 minutes of clarification questions, on obscure bits of methodology or other aspects of the papers. Not only was this highly uninteresting, it also made participation difficult. Participation was a substantial portion of our grade, but it is hard to make sure you are noticed in a 40 person class. It is more difficult when most of the \"discussion\" time is just students asking irrelevant questions. You are forced to choose between waiting it out and hoping the class will briefly discuss the importance of the paper so you can make a comment, or finding your own random thing to ask a question about and hope that counts. The games we played in the last few lectures were a strong point. They really motivated me to listen closely to lecture material.",
    "Strong focus on paper discussion!",
    "This class was a really accessible course for getting into climate science as someone who has really wanted a chance to dig into the scientific grounding of climate change, but has been intimidated by harder classes, it was perfect for me. It is both rigorous in terms of getting you to understand the scientific concepts and also not punishing if you haven't taken calculus in a while. This class warmed me up to science again after being out of it for quite a while.",
    "This course simply had too many students and they were not divided evenly between sections. It was difficult to have small group discussions and the opportunity to participate in the conversation because there were too many people in the classroom. The class time was also not evenly divided or regulated, and often we were not able to have complete discussions on the value of a scientific journal because we spent too much time talking about the specifics of the science."

    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless major changes are made to its structure. The course description was so promising, and it had very interesting content which gave it the potential to be great. However, it was not. As this is a science course, I really wish it had been more scientific. Instead, it felt largely like a history course to me with superficial scientific understanding required. Discussion sections were not a good use of time at all.

I really thought the discussion sections were a waste of time, and breaking out into groups unnecessary. Another major weakness was that the professor was very unclear about what material would be covered on the first quiz. It was much more conducive to studying when she provided a list of major topics (as she did for the second). A warning: the workload is light but at the end there is a \"10-page\" SINGLE-SPACED term paper, or 20 pages double spaced. That's basically the length of a 1-semester senior thesis, and that was not made clear until very close to when the paper was due. Plan ahead!!!!",
    "Yes. Important topic and a good science credit accessible to non-science majors but which will stretch you intellectually.",
    "Take this course! Super relevant for science and policy people. Rigorous study of climate change, its history, and its implications. Thorough research on the papers and experiments since the 1800s that have collectively created our modern understanding of the subject. Professor Storelvmo is an absolute gem and will make the class so enjoyable and accessible.",
    "Yes definitely! There are so many misconceptions about climate science and this course provides a way to clear them all up.",
    "This is an absolutely fantastic course - I truly believe that a class like this should be mandatory at every school across the country. It's especially helpful for non-STEM majors, but even graduate students at the School of Forestry found it fascinating. Not much work, Professor Storelvmo is wonderful, and the readings provide an interesting overview of the history of climate science. Final paper is a bit tough but worth it.",
    "Not really, if it remains an intro class and has as many people as it did.",
    "This is a great course. Pretty low workload throughout the semester, but then a 10page single spaced paper at the end. Start it early! Trude is great, you learn a lot from this course. If you want to actually know something about climate change other than that \"97% of scientists agree,\" this is the course for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to all students -- science or non-science majors. This class covers over very relevant and important topics relating to climate change, which is sure to affect people and ecosystems in significant ways. The lectures are engaging. The paper presentations really challenges students to examine scientific papers and grasp complex concepts in atmospheric science.",
    "Yes! Highly recommend as a science credit if you need one.",
    "Yes, this class is very applicable to the modern day and very current. Regardless of what degree is being pursued this class teaches presents invaluable information on climate.",
    "A great course for non-science majors about climate change",
    "Would recommend to another student, especially if they are looking for a science credit that would not require psets. I think my case, it was very helpful to be able to understand the charts, graphs, and general science without doing calculations or additional homework. I enjoyed practicing my presentation skills, but knew that I would need more science background to get the most out of the class. Is accessible to non-science majors.",
    "Yes. It's a good science course, you'll learn a lot about the climate system, climate warming, the actual mechanisms by which that is happening, even geoengineering. Hopefully the format changes a little so that discussion section is more guided and productive.",
    "A good science credit - and a topic which more people (Yale students and the general public) should know much more about. I'm not a science major, so am not sure if it would be worth it for someone with deeper knowledge of related fields to take this class.",
    "Yes, absolutely! It was a wonderful class.",
    "I would recommend this course. Trude is a really great professor and as a science class it is pretty low key. Be prepared for a large final paper. Some of the readings are also pretty dry, but overall its a good science credit!",
    "good class for a non-science major to really learn about the science of climate change! you will learn a lot, you will not have to do a lot of work, do keep in mind that the ten page paper at the end of term is actually single spaced.",
    "Definitely recommend",
    "I definitely recommend Professor Storelvmo's class! This class was a really accessible course for getting into climate science as someone who has really wanted a chance to dig into the scientific grounding of climate change, but has been intimidated by harder classes, it was perfect for me. It is both rigorous in terms of getting you to understand the scientific concepts and also not punishing if you haven't taken calculus in a while. This class warmed me up to science again after being out of it for quite a while.",
    "This is a great course for both STEM and nonSTEM majors. The information is clearly presented and it is a great way to read, evaluate, and understand scientific papers. Never did the course feel particularly overwhelming for a nonSTEM major. The course is relevant, interesting, and easy to follow. The paper was a great way to adapt the course to my specific interests."
