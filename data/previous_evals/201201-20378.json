   "comments": [
    "Depends on the student. I would only recommend this to students highly interested and proficient in programming and computation.",
    "This class is essential to Computational Biologists. I would encourage students to take it, and to stay in close contact with the TAs to ensure comprehension of homework and assignments.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is a good way to learn about SVD, next-gen sequencing, proteomics, RNAseq, ChIPseq, alignment, and molecular dynamics. However, the better lectures were those that provided an understanding of a technology in a survey manner.",
    "Not easy if you don't know much about programming and SVD. But you can learn a lot if you stick to it.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who have already taken introductory bioinformatics courses and are previously familiar with the topics covered.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class is basically a survey class of various bioinformatics subtopics. I would recommend it.",
    "Not in it's current state, even though I think some of the lectures were very good."

   "comments": [
    "It very slightly de-mystified the inner workings of bioinformatics programs for me.",
    "This course gave me a comprehensive introduction to many topics I will need for research. I certainly learned much in this class.",
    "I think I mostly learned about bioinformatic technologies that most people just pick up from being in a lab. However, this course provided an overview that is very accessible. I now feel prepared to read papers on a variety of bioinformatic areas and have at least a basic grasp of the methods that are commonly used.",
    "Because the course covered a large variety of topics in various subfields of bioinformatics, I thought it was very helpful.",
    "The course helped me decide what topics I like and dislike in bioinformatics, which helped me make my decision about which lab to join."
