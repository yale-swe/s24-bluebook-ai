    "nice overview of how memory is stored, how to interface electronics and computers. picked up some coding skills, greater familiarity with circuitry, mathematical descriptions of controls as far as insights, i thought a lot of great intuition was given for the math we were doing, i.e. the motivation for laplace transforming and what it is physically",
    "- How to program Arduino in assembly - How to use stepper motors and op-amps in useful circuits - How to predict basic behavior of motors and op-amps - How to deal with basic control systems - Increased ability to read spec sheets for instruments and hardware",
    "Not only just specific material (circuit dynamics, micro controller operation, PID control, how motors work), but approaches to problem solving and debugging in instances where there are a lot of variables to consider.",
    "Controls and motors.",
    "Some electronics and mechanics skills (lab and theory)"

   "comments": [
    "strengths: engaging, well taught, covers a nice variety of subjects weakness: lab portion is done with only one partner, so people divvy up work early on according to their strenghts and aren't forced to expand skills base as much. In my case, that partner was extremely familiar with arduinos and kind of took over the coding. i would have learned a lot more if I had more time at the computer",
    "Instructor is a strength: he is clear at delivering lectures, and engages the class effectively. Please provide a few more advanced labs. Maybe have three sensor-focused labs early on, then move to systems.",
    "Strengths: Amazing\/brilliant instructor lecturer. Very helpful TA's. Also, wide swath of material covered made it interesting each day. Weakesses: by the same token, I would've like to go into depth into certain areas (ie. control) a bit more.",
    "Professor was very willing to change course according to interests of the students. He adapted through time, and taught very well.",
    "Weakness: not structured properly, lab reports are too long and confusing The professor must explain the syllabus properly"

   "comments": [
    "Depends on the student, but generally yes. Might be too simple for most engineering grad students, but provides a nice overview for those less familiar with the concepts\/aspiring electronics hobbyists.",
    "Definitely recommended. Enjoyable, useful material, engaging instructor, meaningful assignments.",
    "Take this class. Each lab is structured so that it contributes in some way to the final project. We built a sun-tracking robot by the end, and I was quite proud of it. Also, Professor Madhu is very smart and brings expertise to every in-class conversation.",
    "Yes. Great course if you are interested in controlling any sort of system. Madhu is very insightful.",
    "No, a student would learn more taking a regular mechanics\/electronics class"
