I really really liked the opportunity to talk with professionals in the field at NYBG and through the teleconferences.10. The class was very basic. It might not be recommended for people with an already solid grounding in ecology."

Some people who already know much about the tropics may find it boring or superficial, but it is an intro course, and it's supposed to be general. People need to adjust their expectations."
