    "And you thought the way WE dealt with celebrity was weird sometimes.",
    "You study 18th century theater and its applications to modern stardom\/celebrity.",

    "It's not a hard course, and it's really fun if you love pop culture of the past and present.",
    "This is a class that connects current celebrity culture and 18th century celebrity culture. I would recommend it if you are interested in celebrities and the idea of celebrity. It's not too much work, and class time is usually pretty fun and interesting. The readings are kind of random, but always good.",
    "Seminar in pop culture. A mix of intensive theater history of Reformation England and Perez Hilton. I would definitely recommend it, although know that the class is what you make of it--if you put in a lot of effort, you will get a lot out of this class intellectually."
