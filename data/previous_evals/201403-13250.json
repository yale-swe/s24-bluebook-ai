   "comments": [
    "I learned so much in this class and some of my classmates also ended up being some of my close friends. Since this is an intensive course, you do need to put in work every day, but it's worth studying for every day so that you don't need to spend too much time studying for unit tests. Don't worry about not being good enough at Chinese to take this--I started off basically illiterate and now I feel that I can read\/write at a pretty high level.",
    "Very good class. Starts out easy but gets pretty intense by the end. Be prepared for daily quizzes and a long homework assignment once a week. Most students were freshmen if that matters. Xu Laoshi is quirky in some ways and it appears that she is yelling at you at times, but in actuality it is just because she is a very straightforward person who cares for your learning. She's actually really nice!",
    "Good class for heritage students to catch up in reading, writing and grammar. Requires very little initial knowledge as long as you do the work each day. Teacher is very nice if you give her a chance.",
    "This class is challenging but helpful. I would recommend this to a heritage speaker who is a fluent native speaker.",
    "This class is a great way to improve your Chinese, through daily practice. It requires a solid, consistent time commitment (from about 20 min to an hour a day) but it pays off if you put in the work. Xu Laoshi is great and very understanding and helpful."
