   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you're interested in law and are ready for the heavy workload.",
    "A really powerful and wonderful introduction to children's law and policy. Professor Dufresne is a terrific professor and though the work is rigorous, she's incredibly helpful and kind to students. The syllabus will seem intimidating, but once you get used to the amount and pace of the work, it becomes very manageable (even if you have no background in law). I was never bored in this class or while doing my homework. Take this class!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It's a lot of work - 150-200 pages of reading every week plus at least two among the following: 3-5 pages of writing, a 1.5-2hr group assignment, or an oral argument. But this class is worth it all. You'll be motivated to do all the work because it's so interesting.",
    "Take it!",
    "Challenging but rewarding class for students who want to learn more about legal reason and child's law",
    "Yes. This is one of the best courses at Yale. Child Law and Family Law are such assumed foundations of your daily life that you will learn from this class even if you don't want to. It touches on everything from gender relations to socioeconomic theory to normal Constitutional applications. But since family issues are such a burden on the judicial system and legislature, it's a clear field where our government tempers idealistic legal goals with the reality of legal application. All of that is great, and if you are interested in law or any of these things, then this class is a must-take.But the real reason to take this class is Professor Dufresne. She puts more work into this class than any other teacher at Yale. She cares about you, and you will learn. That's the end of the story.",
    "Take it! This was a wonderful class that gave a great background to many areas of child law and got me interested in policy and law beyond that regarding children. The assignments were thought-provoking and challenging, and I learned valuable skills while writing for this class. If anything, I wish this class met more often or for a longer period of time so that it could cover more material. Classtime as well as readings were very enjoyable and applicable."
