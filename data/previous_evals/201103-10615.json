    "Definitely recommend. It is a must have for any graduate student with any work related to statistics or econometrics. I hope professor Andrews keep teaching it for a long time.",
    "Depends on the student and their needs. The course doesn't teach you anything about how to apply econometrics to the real world.",
    "It is a very helpful course to understand probability theory and the foundations of econometrics and its asypmtotic results.",
    "Ideal intro Metrics course.",
    "i would recommend this course since is a nice way to review the basic econometrics in a mathematical formal framework.",
    "- I would recommend it if they are interested in metric theory",
    "It is difficult mathematically, but the material is very interesting."
