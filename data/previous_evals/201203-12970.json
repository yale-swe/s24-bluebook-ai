    "This course will challenge you to think about opera (and theater and music and performance) in new ways. You will develop new vocabulary, concepts, and ways of thinking that are not offered in any other class. Take this course if you are interested in opera, performance studies, theater, English, literature, history, or film. I greatly enjoyed it!",
    "Really difficult class. Your lovely sparkly bullshit sculpture will be immediately shattered by Professor Kreuzer's laserbeam questions. Come prepared to rise to the challenge, thinking hard about what you've watched and read--you'll learn a lot!",
    "If you are at all interested in opera, you should definitely take this class. It's likely that you haven't studied opera in this way before and while studying musical structures and theory of opera writing is important to understanding it, understanding its performance and realization on stage is just as important. It's realization is what, in the end, musical study is about.",
    "Take it!!! It's fantastic whether or not you're an opera person, as long as you're interested in music and literature. The readings are heavy but almost always interesting."
