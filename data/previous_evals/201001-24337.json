    "Yes, if you want a well designed but programming intensive class.",
    "CS 478 is an overview of computer graphics. Topics are not covered in the depth that they should be covered in, and the rigor andattention to detail that one would expect from a computer science course are missing. Some of the programming assignments expect a level of understanding beyond what the course provides and sometimes beyond what the textbook provides. There were also some issues with grading. I don't recommend taking the course unless you're looking to be frustrated.",
    "It's mostly what you expect. You go over basic techniques in modeling and rendering. My biggest criticism is that the work\/learning ratio is fairly crappy. I spent most of my time figuring out how to implement fairly simple ideas in C++, but I also didn't have a great background in C\/C++."
