    "This course is a gem; Ali is fiercely intelligent and invested in the material, which makes for extremely lively and provocative seminar discussions. The interdisciplinary nature of the course is great -- it's such a wonderful thing to approach this topic from anthropological, law, and public health standpoints. The assignments are also very good -- they really make you think about the material in critical ways. Overall, this is an EXCELLENT course and Ali really is a fabulous instructor.",
    "Fundamentally the course is very relevant to public health. However, in application the course focused a lot on gender theory and didn't really relate to health. While the material was interesting, had i known it would have a much small focus on health I probably would have taken a different course. It was a new perspective but I dont think I got as much out of the course as I could have had it been more related to public health rather than gender theory.",
    "This was one of the most intellectually stimulating classes I've ever taken. I wish the discussion was a bit more organized because I tended to get lost and then have to wait a few minutes before finding my way back in. The interdisciplinary nature helped tremendously and made for amazing discussion (and often disagreement, which was wonderful). I wish the readings would have been slightly less theoretical, and more relevant (public health, news articles, etc) to help teach us applicible analytical skills for \"going out into the world.\"",
    "This course is an incredible exploration of sexuality, health, and human rights. While the health component is sometimes overlooked in the face of sexuality and human rights, Ali does an excellent job tying these together.",
    "Although cross listed with Law and Public Health, i didn't really feel like I was getting either in this course. The readings were helpful, but impossible to complete everything within a week given a normal course load. I wish Ali would pick 1-2 key pieces that we should really focus on. I also felt it was difficult to keep up with some of the students in the class, and it seemed more like an anthro class at times. Overall, the topics and discussions were interesting. I wish we had more legal case studies, that were directly related to Public Health.",
    "Great introduction to the intersection among health, sexuality, and human rights. This course looks at various interesting topics throughout different time periods and countries. I would often leave the class in awe of the interesting facts I had learned. Strengths- Professor, Interesting topics, good historical background, small intimate class Weaknesses- The readings are so long (200 pages a week usually) Improvement- Less readings or make more of the readings optional. It is very difficult to actually do all the class readings.",
    "The course was very good! I learned a lot about subject matter than I knew little about before the course. The course is reading intensive, but discussions are interesting and engaging. Book review and Op-ed assignments were fairly enjoyable and not overly burdensome. I thought Ali did a good job tying in the sexuality, health, and human rights components into most lectures. Would have loved even more health!"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Ali is WONDERFUL. She is one of the smartest professors I know -- she's extremely articulate and really critical of law and society, which makes students more critical too.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Alice Miller is incredible. She has done so much. However, she often dominated the conversation. Further, she let the course focus heavily on theory and didn't often relate to the public health perspective even though there were a handful of public health students enrolled in the course. Also, she took a very long time to provide feedback and it was often vague so it was hard to know how to improve.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Amazingly wonderful and intelligent professor.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Prof. Miller is whip-smart and thoughtful with her years of experience discussing issues of sexuality, health, and human rights. She's wrapped up in a lot of things so as a students its difficult to get a hold of her outside her office hours, but she is responsive and encouraging in those opportunities where she is available.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Prof. Miller is brilliant, thoughtful, experienced and kind. She guides you through a tremendous number of readings each week with efficiency and stunning familiarity. She is uniquely able to speak to real issues in international human rights and advocacy and identifies movements and trajectories with cool reflection. Don't miss a chance to take a class with her if these topics pique your interest at all.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Strengths- engaging, very knowledgable, excellent at providing feedback (one of the best I've seen), she is great at pushing us to question our assumptions and I appreciate that she always makes us define important terms, she's very willing to provide constructive criticism, sweet Weaknesses\/Improvements- I can't think of any",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Ali is an impressive lecturer. She is incredibly smart and fluid, and she knows the content extremely well. I enjoyed learning from her. I think tying sexuality, health, and human rights together is a tall task, but she does it well. Her feedback was always very useful and well thought out!"

   "comments": [
    "Best course I've taken in YSPH!",
    "This is a gender theory course. If you're interested in gender theory and law you should definitely take it. If you're more interested in how sexual and human rights issues relate to health I would recommend you find another class or do an independent study under Alice.",
    "Intellectual exploration of rights through a sexual and health international lens.",
    "If you're interested in discussing issues of sexuality, health, and human rights critically in a small seminar - take it. Theory-based, but never too theoretical. Law-focused - but never too legally complex. The three assignments - the book report, op ed, and final reserach paper all force you to explore different mediums. An incredible seminar.",
    "I recommend highly.",
    "Excellent introduction to the field of human rights. The course is great if you have little knowledge on this topic, however be wary of the readings which are so long and many people had difficulty completing all of them.",
    "This is a great course for a diverse perspective on public health. The format of the course allows for a rich learning environment with students from various schools. The diversity of the perspectives was my favorite part of the course. The reading assignments are intensive, but many are interesting. This is a great course for those wishing to venture from their comfort zone as Public Health Students. It was a nice deviance from the Epi-heavy norm."
