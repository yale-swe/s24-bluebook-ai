   "comments": [
    "For some reason, Yale pretty much locks you into this course to get credit for 110. That being said, you know what 110 was like, and it's not getting any easier!",
    "Very good course, you learn so much every day and improve a great deal by the end of the semester.",
    "I would fully recommend it, with the side note that it is a lot of work compared to any other language you could take.",
    "Very fast paced. It requires a lot of memorization, dedication and practice. You leave feeling very accomplished though! I would recommend but only if truly interested.",
    "If you took 110, take 120 next. There is a pretty dramatic step up in dialogue length, but it's definitely manageable. The tutorial is much better now that you know enough to actually have conversations, though you still have to do a recitation every week."
