    "A good class, but it can occasionally get dull. Prof. Scheve is very helpful and supportive, especially for the final project. Readings are excessively long, which was really frustrating when we wouldn't talk about all of them.",
    "If you REALLY like taxation, take it. Otherwise, the readings are too heavy and you'll fall behind and not get that much out of it except for the memos.",
    "Take it only if you are really interested in political economy.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student only if he or she is willing to put time and energy into it. It was a solid course and I learned a lot about the fairness and political debates surrounding taxation. Do not expect an econ class though. It is Political Science."
