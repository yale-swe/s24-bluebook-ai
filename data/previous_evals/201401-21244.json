   "comments": [
    "This particular course is intriguing, but not for everyone. I feel like it really helped me understand some of the implications of scientific practice from a more fundamental standpoint. There may be problems with writing essays and understanding philosophical terms if you haven't taken a philosophy course yet, but I didn't have too much trouble with the latter.",
    "three papers (2 7-9 pages, 1 10-12 pages), section, reasonably readings. fun and interesting! a mix of science majors and philosophy majors.",
    "I would recommend Phil 269 to anyone who likes to think, it was amazing and I will now take many more philosophy classes because of it.",
    "Philosophy of Science is a very interesting course, and quite accessible as well. While you don't need to have a philosophy background to appreciate it, I do think having taken previous philosophy courses helps. In terms of it as a PHIL class, Dan Greco is an excellent instructor who is very good at explaining what can be rather complex issues. Be ready to focus more on the broad, epistemic issues in science as opposed to specific scientific practices - but those are covered to a certain extent.",
    "Don't make the mistake of thinking of this class as \"Philosophy for Scientists\" like I did. It will not meet that expectation, and probably be more frustrating than enlightening if you approach it that way. It really is just a philosophy class, that happens to be about science. That said, the actual philosophy is interesting as a whole, though some of the material is pretty dense and I didn't really know what to take from it. Definitely be comfortable with philosophical approach to questions before this class. There are two 7 page (2000-2300 word) midterm papers and a final 10 page (3000 word) paper, though it's not a writing credit. Shop this, and take it only if the concept really does inspire you. Otherwise you might get more out of something else.",
    "I highly recommend PHIL 269 to students interested in logical thinking and philosophy in general. However, there is a lot of metaphysics in the middle sections of the course. I'm not personally a fan of metaphysics; either way, it might help to know that before deciding to take or not to take the course.",
    "PHIL 269 goes over mostly recent musing in the philosophy of science. I grew to really dislike this subject because all of the theories are generally unsatisfactory and nothing ever gets answered. I took this as my first philosphy course, though many others had already taken other PHIL courses. Prof Greco is a fantastic lecturer, and maybe if you like philosophy already, you'll get more out of this class. Summary: If you like philosphy, DO take this course. The workload is minimal, the subject is engaging, and the prof Greco is great. If you aren't sure about philosphy, the subject matter might disillusion you."
