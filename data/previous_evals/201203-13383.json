    "I recommend it to all who are interested in the subject matter and are willing to put in time and effort to read\/write consistently!",
    "English 129 is a course that covers most important tragic plays. There's a lot of reading, a manageable amount of writing, and interesting class discussion. I would recommend it.",
    "Take this class if a) you want a solid foundation in Western dramatic literature; b) you were close to committing to D.S. but found yourself interested primarily in the literature component, and\/or c) you want a discussion-based, small seminar and are interested in written drama. You should definitely be comfortable writing literary papers; there is little discussion of writing style per se during class, where you mainly focus on historical influences and literary components of the works you read."
