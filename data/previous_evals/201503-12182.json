   "comments": [
    "There is a decent amount of reading, but the workload is otherwise managable. The class covers interesting discussions about the legal system and its role in creating change in a wide variety of eras and locations.",
    "Take the course. The course really fundamentally changes your view of the legal system and of law itself. Before this class, I generally only understood and studied American Law, which according to this class is exceptional. The exploration of different legal systems around the world is instructive both by making connections to different legal and political regimes around the world. The course opens your eyes to a larger perspective on law and the world.",
    "I would summarize it as an amazing class that allows you to understand the history of cause lawyering, which is when a lawyer uses law to fight for a civil issue. I would recommend this class to any student interested in law, morals\/ethics, history, subjects that do not just involve white men.",
    "I would recommend this class to any person who goes to Yale. The material is approachable, interesting, and timely.",
    "This is a great course, but be prepared to do a lot of reading (150 pages usually) and quite a bit of writing (6 short essays and 1 final research paper). It definitely took up a lot of time. Also, you have to participate in class, as it is a seminar after all.",
    "This is an ideal course for anyone interested in thinking critically about the law as a construct and a historical instrument. Professor De is really nice and knowledgable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course and professor to other students. I learned so much and gained a lot of experience in writing and discussing. The material is interesting and the professor teaches in a way that constantly encourages you to work hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I learned a ton and the seminars were really engaging",
    "A very interesting and unique history course designed for those who love reading and are interested in history, law and the intersection between that and politics, religion and other fields of study.",
    "A lot of work. A lot of fun."
