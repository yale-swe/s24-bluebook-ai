    "Chances are good that if you're taking 116L, you're doing so because it's a premed requirement or because it's necessary for your major. You're going to take it anyway, so just take it and stop reading other students' recommendations. If you have a choice, however, avoid this class. I took this lab as a sophomore and, after having a year to experience how good Yale classes can actually be, can accurately say that this is one of the worst Yale offers. It adds no knowledge beyond the use of a buret and pipet to what you'll learn in the lecture course. Furthermore, you'll be frustrated with pre-lab quizzes, inconsistent grading on lab reports, and sacrificing your afternoons to performing tedious laboratory tasks to extract obvious results (in fact, sometimes you'll even be told what results to expect!). Chem 116L could most closely be compared to the worst busywork high school class. It's extremely easy, but because you inescapably have to spend so much time on the labs, it is also extremely horrible.",
    "A great parallel to Chem 114. The concepts covered are exactly what you study in 114. With that said a robot could do this course. It is all about executing the instructions in the lab manual. If you are able to turn off all independent thought and mindlessly follow instructions, this course will be an easy 100.",
    "A lot of work for just half a credit. but thats lab life at yale.",
    "If you've never taken a chem lab, you'll learn some useful techniques here. However, the labs are boring and repetitive and it's FAR too much work. Only worth it if you need it for pre-med or a science major.",
    "Only take it if you have to. This course taught lab techniques, which I suppose was useful in some ways. I wish a bigger focus had been placed on the concepts that the labs were covering, rather than the details of the lab write-up. I don't think points should be taken off for neatness when we are required to write in pen.",
    "This class is very indicative if you are meant to major in the sciences or be pre-med. I loved lab. The experiments were interesting and you learn so much by the end of the year. However, some people just don't like lab in general. If you are that person the wonderful professor and interesting labs won't change your mind. I would certainly recommend this class to anyone who thinks they will take a science course at Yale. The skills you learn in lab will be crucial in the future. Be aware that most labs involve a full lab report. They are hard at first but you will get better at writing them.",
    "Take it only if you have to. Like any other lab course at Yale, it's more time consuming than a one credit course.",
    "Chem 116 is a rather frustrating course.On the one hand the course could be considered a good introduction to the laboratory. Basic laboratory skills (pipetting, how to do a titration, etc) were covered in-depth. I can confidently say I know my way around the laboratory much better than when I began the course.That said, you learn very little in this course. The actual concepts of the experiments are very much glossed over, and because each experiment is simply following a number of steps, there's really no active learning of scientific concepts. Chemistry 116 was merely following printed directions, and while I will leave this course with more confidence in my practical lab abilities, I don't really know the why's or how's of any of the experiments.",
    "A necessary course for a pre-med student taking 114. This Lab is a lot of work, but is a good introduction to the basics of laboratory skills.",
    "Chemistry 116 is a tough class. There are quizzes every week and a lab report due just about every week. Roughly half the labs are by yourself and the other half are parter work. Don't be intimidated by the lab manual, which analyzes the course down to very very very fine details. Dr. G reviews the labs during pre-lab lecture which is really helpful.",
    "Chem 116L is super educational if you did not take AP chem and have not done much lab stuff, but it is super stressful at the same time. Only take this course if you are premed or insane.",
    "Lab is lab. It's long, but it's more fun if try to make it fun. I really enjoy the actual lab and Dr. G does a great job of explaining things. Start lab reports early and go to him for help during the week from the very start. It will greatlyincrease your chances of getting a good grade and allow to avoid that last minute all-nighter on the lab you didn't realize was that complicated.",
    "I would highly recommend the lab to go along with the lecture because it greatly enhanced the material presented.",
    "I would strongly recommend taking Chem 118 if possible because this lab is tedious and the lab reports are a pain. Dr. G is very helpful though, but your grade is very dependent on your TF.",
    "Labs to go along with Chem 112 or 114.",
    "Chem lab was a big surprise to me. I'd viewed it as a necessary evil, but it ended up being one of my most enjoyable classes. Even if you don't have any need to take a lab course, if you have even the faintest interest in science I'd recommend this course!",
    "Take it if you need to, but don't take it for fun.",
    "116L is a very useful course, especially if you haven't had much lab experience. It introduces you to the basic lab skills and the style of lab reports. I still wouldn't recommend it though unless you need to take a lab for pre-med, etc., because it's very tedious and time-consuming.",
    "Chemistry 116L was very straightforward; the labs were not too difficult, skills built on each other. I felt that I came out of each lab with a better understanding of the unit and its concepts. Pre-lab lectures were clear and TAs and Dr. G were accessible and helpful. Good lab.",
    "Yes, it's tedious and only worth half a credit, and you don't do the most exciting experiments in the world, but it's a good class to see if you have the patience and skill set required to continue on in a chemistry or science major.",
    "Lab is time-consuming and can be tiring because it takes up a four-hour span of time once a week. Additionally, lab reports are difficult, particularly if you start them the day before they are due. However, lab taught me a lot about applying chemistry 114 concepts, and helped in learning how chemistry is used in research. It was good to see the practical aspect of chemistry, rather than just the conceptual aspect that is taught in the large chem lecture class.",
    "If you're thinking about taking Chem 116L, it's probably because you're required to take a lab with a general chemistry course. In that case, I highly recommend this class. All lab classes take up a big chunk of your time, but I really didn't mind going to this one every week (the shortest lab took ten minutes and the longest the full four hours, while on average I spent about two and a half hours in lab.)Don't be intimidated by all of the people that say the lab is a lot of work; it's not. Part of the reason I decided to take Chem 114 was that the lab is so much easier than the lab for Chem 118. Your basic workload is going to be pre-lab quizzes (Dr. G gives you all of the answers in the pre-lab lectures, so just pay attention to those and don't bother studying), lab reports in which you're already given the structure and just have to fill in the details, and the labs themselves.My best tips for the lab itself are: pay attention to what you're doing and get a good TA. Chem 116 is not a high-stress, nerve-racking lab course; my lab group used to sing as we worked and I still wound up with an A.Also: if you have a question, EMAIL it to Dr. G, don't ask him. If you talk to him in person, he'll blow you off, but if you email him he'll explain the answer to your question nicely and fully.",
    "Lab's kinda rough. It takes a lot out of you to do 4 hours of semi-high pressure work, and I never felt like doing anything afterwards. That's why I'm really glad I had it on Friday. Dr. G. is pretty good at warning you which labs you shouldn't attempt to do entirely the night before, so listen to him. Prep for lab ahead of time so you have a general idea (Don't be afraid if you don't understand the setup), but Dr. G does a good job explaining the lab beforehand.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. If it weren't for pre-lab stressful quizzes and the looooooong class period, I actually really would have enjoyed the class. You learn a lot in terms of lab procedures and if you have good students in the lab with you and a good TA, you can have a lot of fun. However, it is a lot of work, especially for a half credit.",
    "I was one of the few who liked lab, but for me, I would much rather be working hands-on than listening to a boring lecture. I would recommend the lab if you are taking CHEM 114; you never know if you will want to use it for a major of premedical program.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a requirement that is necessary for many, but I would not recommend it for anyone who does not have to take it.",
    "Chem 116L is a manageable course: One quiz and lab report per week. Depending on your preparation, the quizzes would range from medium to hard. I recommend this course because Dr. G is extremely enthusiastic about experiments. Even if you have no clue on what you're doing (I experienced this several times), your T.A. or Dr. G would help you understand what you're supposed to do.",
    "I would recommend Chem 116. It's good for your lab req's if you need any and it's overall a pretty good class to take. Although it's only half a credit it's not too bad.",
    "Can be fun, actually! More work than you might think, for just a half credit. It's a full credit-worth of work, if you want to do well. Recommended if you have the time and patience.",
    "I would recommend it if you have to take it. It's a huge time-commitment because it's four hour lab, then much more each week to write the lab report and the pre-lab for the following week. This course really focuses on developing technique in the lab, not necessarily primarily on the science behind the experiments.It is a well-organized course.",
    "I would recommend it because it is relatively easy (even if labs are time consuming). But most of you have to take it, so there's no way of getting out of it. Still, be reassured that it is helpful and you do learn a lot.",
    "Variety of experiments that correspond to general chemistry topics, emphasize basic lab skills; take this course with a corresponding chemistry lecture",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The concepts are ones that correspond well to the chemistry lecture course and will be good to know if you plan on continuing with higher level chem classes.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to, because you won't learn anything interesting. If you dohave to, however, don't worry. This class is pretty easy and occasionally kind of fun.",
    "Very well-run, straightforward lab. Not like MCDB 121L which sucks, this is reasonable for a half credit.Pretty boring lab reports, but they're simple. Quizzes are also straightforward.Outside of class, probably 4 hours of work\/week, which is pretty good for labs.",
    "Chem 116L can be intensive, but by the semester's end, you feel quite comfortable in a lab setting. Reports are long but not too difficult and plenty of assistance is available if you need help.",
    "It is a good review of standard laboratory procedure. However, some experiments seem pointless, as though we just go step-by-step through the manual for no reason.",
    "I would recommend Chemistry 116L for another student if they want a great introductory course forChem lab. However, if you're looking for a more relaxed lab I would suggest Chem 119L. I know that students in this course often did not need to write full lab reports and their professor made it so no one received lower than a B on a lab.",
    "If you need to take 116, then take 116. It's that simple. It's not a fantastic course, but it's not horrible. The labs are sometimes time consuming, but they're all very straightforward, and not too difficult. Just take it, do the work, and don't think about it too much. You'll be fine.",
    "I would recommend taking this course, especially if you're new to college lab work. It's challenging, but also very manageable. This is a great intro chem lab.",
    "I would recommend it as a good requirement lab, but not as a \"free option\" class just because of the lack of credit value vs. how much time it requires.",
    "Sure! You have no other choice right? and it's not so bad at all....even for those of us who are one of the few that did NOT take AP chem.",
    "Dr. G is a great teacher! His class lectures are very useful and help one understand the lab a lot, regardless of whether you read the manual for the experiment previously. He is also very clear when it comes to giving instructions. Although the experiments are a bit repetitive, they help one learn a lot of basic lab techniques that one not having taken a lab before will be thankful for.",
    "Chem 116L is a rather tedious introductive lab course, but it is still extremely useful for sciencemajors. It entails a weekly write-up (lab report) and a weekly quizz for students. I would recommend it of course to a student, because this lab course is fun and very helpful for people to understand how science works in a university.",
    "It is necessary for pre-Med, so you might as well get it over with.",
    "If you don't have any solid lab experience, this is it right here. You're probably taking it to meet a pre-req so it's not necessarily a \"fun\" class, but it does its job. You learn the techniques well if you follow the instructions. Four hours can be a long time, but it'll only be terrible if you have a bad attitude about it going in, so try to stay somewhat positive. It can actually be pretty interesting if you get past the four hour drag thing. Also try not to take Friday lab! Lab day will most likely be the designated \"hump day\" of your week, so earlier in the week is better (Tuesday\/Wednesday are probably most ideal).",
    "It was a good lab that went well with Chem 114, but a little boring at times.",
    "Chemistry 116L is your typical lab, not too difficult, yet I would only recommend taking it if you are required to.",
    "Pros:--Dr. G is pretty awesome. He's easy to approach and happy to help. He also has an interesting sense of humor.--You usually get out of lab a little early.Cons:--Lab experiments are usually pretty boring although straightforward.--Lab reports can take a long time to write.It's pretty formally structured so it's not that hard but it is boring.",
    "Don't take the course unless you have to.",
    "Be meticulous with your measurements and write your lab reports carefully. I recommend this class to anyone interested in the sciences, because it is an important stepping stone to other, more advanced labwork.",
    "Professor G is really cool. Make sure to take lab with him. Otherwise, lab is lab... of you're thinking of pre-med, you have to take it. And try your best not to take it on Fridays.",
    "If you need lab experience, this is a solid class to take. If you just need credits, this is a big time commitment for .5 cr.",
    "You have to take lab for pre-med.",
    "I recommend it if you are required to take it but otherwise I wouldn't take it. The workload is extremely heavy. It's only half a credit and definitely not worth it. The workload for this class is definitely disproportionate to the amount of credit we get.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they were trying to complete distributional requirements or pre-professional program requirements.",
    "Chemistry Lab 116L is more work than the 0.5 credits that it is listed as. I would recommend it only if you are taking Chem 114 and you need a lab credit. That said the class is graded pretty fairly and the final examination is not terrible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to major in one of the sciences. It's required for pre-med and most science majors anyway, but I genuinely found it to be an enjoyable and educational experience. I became much more comfortable with a variety of experimental\/lab techniques, and many of the experiments enhanced my understanding of topics covered in the Gen Chem lecture course. Dr. G is a great lab professor; the lab manual was always clear and useful, as were his pre-lab lectures. This is a well-organized and well-taught course. Most of the time, I didn't even mind spending 3-4 hrs in the lab every week because the experiments were engaging and interesting (except for a few tedious ones).",
    "So of the labs are a bit tedious but overall its not a bad class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in getting started in chemistry. The labs were interesting, however the lab reports were very time consuming and seem like too much work for a half credit class.",
    "I took this class because it was required. However, I am glad that I did. The concepts covered were well worth my time.",
    "Basic lab technique is taught and applied.",
    "Chemistry 116L is your basic chem lab; it's interesting and a lot of work, being a lab, but it's nothing impossible.",
    "Chem 116 is a lab course every Monday. It is not difficult, but you spend a lot of time writing up lab reports. Some labs are quite boring, but overall its a good class and I would recommend it to anyone interested in chemistry.",
    "I loved this lab. I would have done better if I had organized my time better and read each lab in the manual before coming to lab. It is very easy.",
    "Yes. It's a relatively easy lab. Go in with a positive attitude and you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a very interesting and challenging course: it is very important to read the lab procedures ahead of time in order to be able to perform well on the weekly quiz and complete the lab with the great accuracy and precision required. Nonetheless, it is a very well taught and enjoyable class, which will give you the chance to acquire many useful skills for future studies.",
    "The work is a bitch, but you have to take it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It is great for all the basics.",
    "A solid, very straight-forward introduction to chem lab techniques. I now feel comfortable in lab. It's easy to do well if you read the lab manual before class, come prepared for the quizzes, and pay attention to Dr. G. However, you don't really learn much about the broader significance\/general concepts behind the specific experiments, so I would probably only recommend this class to science majors and pre-meds.",
    "It was sometimes tedious and the amount of work I put into lab was definitely more than I put into some of my full-credit courses. But it is very satisfying!",
    "The only reason to take Chemistry 116L is if you need it as a prerequisite. Professor G is nice, but the class is incredibly time-consuming, and it's only a 1\/2 credit. I do not recommend it.",
    "The lab is a good start for freshmen who are interested in the sciences (and even those who aren't). I would reccmmend the lab because the student will find it enjoyable overall.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It's too much work for only a half credit.",
    "This can be a pretty time-consuming course, especially if you leave the lab report for the night before every week (like me!). However, it's definitely very manageable, and kind of fun, and helpful in solidifying understanding of the material learned in the 114 chem lecture.",
    "If it's required, otherwise there's not much other reason unless you like doing titrations.",
    "Only if you absolutely have to...",
    "It's a basic lab course. If you need to take it its not that bad.",
    "Recommend if you're interested in chemistry\/are taking chem 114 or 112. A good supplement-takes up a good portion of your lab day though, so plan ahead.",
    "Once you get the hang of it, labs aren't too bad, but there are a few that are really time-consuming and tedious. You definitely get the hang of titrations by the end of it. The lab writeups are extremely time-consuming so get started as soon as possible. Just try to be efficient both during lab and while doing writeups.",
    "I thought the labs themselves were interesting, but the reports were horrible. It was very nice of Dr. G to make templates of all the lab reports, but they were very time consuming. I would recommend this lab mostlybecause it is a good, solid introduction to lab work and lab procedure, but I would only recommend taking it for requirements, not for fun.",
    "Chemistry 116L 01 was a fun course. Although it was stressful at times, looking back I realize that I really learned a lot and got a lot out of the course. I would recommend this course to a fellow student for sure, because it teaches students the basics of the laboratory and you really learn a lot about how to undergo an experiment.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a good intro to chemistry lab work and techniques. There is too much work for a .5 credit class and labs are a little stressful at times, but overall it was interesting. The final was especially stressful as accuracy was 75% of the final grade. I felt it didn't supplement the general chemistry course as much as I would have liked, but it was generally a good course. Dr. G is very helpful.",
    "generally an easy class if you read the lab manual and come prepared. lab lectures really clarify the concepts. the lab reports don't take too long.",
    "You do a lot of titrations, but some of the labs were pretty interesting. You learn the basics of working in a lab. If you're planning to major in a science, this course is helpful to have taken.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "I would recommend this class because it's fun even though it's challenging. Also it's a requirement for many majors and tracks so you should probably take it freshman year.",
    "Chem 116L is a basic introduction to chemistry lab that teaches various tools necessary for completing chemical experiments. I took Chem 116L along with Chem 114 because chem lab is a premed requirement. I would advise it only if your major requires it or if you are premed.",
    "A great course for those whom never taken a lab class in high school. It definitely helps students who take Chem 112 along side with Lab 116. Dr. G is a great prof and he provides you with all the materials you need to get an A. There really is no excuse to get any lower grade in this class.",
    "It's a lot of work, but I would recommend it. I wouldn't take the regular class without the lab. The lab makes it feel more official, and it's a good way to apply what you learned in class.",
    "I think that it is useful for teaching the basics of chemistry, but not very practical for everyday lab settings. Also, the labs we perform are usually uninteresting and not mentally stimulating. I would not choose to take this course if it was not a prerequisite.",
    "Take it if you have to or if you're curious about what labs are like.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a laboratory course in which we do experiments pertaining to the topics which we learn in Chemistry 114a. Yes I would recommend it to another student",
    "Lab is tough. But Dr G makes it as good as it possibly can be. Only do lab if you're really interested in science\/chem though. Its a ton of work and time and is horrible at times. But if you like that stuff I'd recommend it.",
    "Chemistry 116L goes well with either Chemistry 112 or especially 114. It is required and basically only taken to fulfill the requirements of a chem lab for the premed track. Overall, this was a fine class. I was expecting the worst from all the horror stories about lab at Yale, but Professor G was amazing. He gave wonderful prelab lectures, the quizzes were fairly easy, the grading was fair, and the lab reports weren't that bad, especially since the templates are given to you! I actually really liked the course!",
    "It is a necessary task even though it is exhausting at times. It can be boring, but you can make it interesting with the right attitude.",
    "Chemistry 116 is a great course to introduce students to the basic skills necessary to conduct experiments in a laboratory and to reiterate the concepts of chemistry. I would recommend chemistry 116 to a fellow student as it is a great course to to take in order to learn the essentials of working in a chemistry laboratory.",
    "This class was pretty good for a general chem lab. The labs were not all that exciting, but it was helpful in learning about lab equipment and getting good practice with the chemicals and equipment. The four hours goes by surprisingly fast and you usually get out early, which is nice. And there are pre-lab quizzes every day, but if you pay attention during the lab lecture, they are not difficult.",
    "I definitely recommend for pre-med and\/or enjoy doing Chem lab work.",
    "I would only recommend that a student take this course if he or she had to for a requirement. Lab is extremely long and requires a huge amount of work for only a half-credit, although it is not that difficult to do well.",
    "Most people take this regardless of evaluations, but as labs go it's very good. Dr. G is great at explaining and is very accommodating to any student concerns. TAs vary, but most are decent. Having a four-hour lab can near ruin any day, but they don't always take that long and, depending on how you feel about chem, be pretty interesting and even fun. The lab reports can be hard to understand and are tedious (like taking a temperature reading every 15 seconds for an hour, then putting this all in a computer). It's pretty clear what you have to do, though, so if you read up on the lab before you'll do fine on the quizzes.",
    "While chem 116 doesn't really help with understanding concepts in chemistry 114, sometimes the topics overlap, which is interesting. Take the class if needed for med school or a major that requires it, but you're not missing a whole lot if you don't wish to take it. Be prepared for far more time spent on labreports that you might think.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. Its nice to see that the concepts we learn in 112 are actually applicable. This lab is a good supplement to the class. It can be really intense just because you have to focus for such a long time but you'll feel a great sense of accomplishement at the end of it.",
    "If you are pre med I would take this class, if not, not worth it.",
    "This was a very interesting and useful course. It was also a good introduction to laboratory work and solidified many concepts from the Chemistry 114 lecture course. I would recommend this course to all interested students.",
    "If you enjoy hands-on chemistry I would definitely recommend this class. It is not necessary to have any major background in chem in order to succeed in this class. I actually found it quite interesting and enjoyable.",
    "This lab was not as bad as it could have been. If you're going to take this, I would definitely recommend not waiting to do your lab write up until the night before (although it is entirely possible). Otherwise, the class wasn't too bad overall.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who needs it for pre-med\/major requirements to fullfill, but it's not worth the half credit otherwise, particularly because you're not really even learning anything.",
    "Nearly everyone who takes chemistry 116L does so because the science majors that require its associated chemistry lecture courses also require the lab. As Dr. G. says, you will have a better experience in lab if you try to think of it as something you enjoy rather than something you are forced to take. If you are not obligated to take the lab for prerequisite purposes, however, I would not recommend it. The amount of work it assigns is immense.",
    "Yes! Especially if you're going to take the lecture class. I honestly looked forward to lab because it gave me a chance to experience science in a more research-driven way, which kept me inspired and interested.",
    "Chemistry 116L was a great supplement to Chemistry 114 because it enabled the students to take the information learned in Chemistry114 and apply them to interesting experiments. Although some of the experiments became very tedious with data-collecting and such, I never really felt anxious about Chemistry 116L because the instructors were so helpful and the steps for each experiment were clearly defined in the manual.",
    "If you don't have to take this lab for a major requirement or pre-med requirement, then I wouldn't recommend it. It is a lot work for a half-credit class. If you do, prepare for four hours of lab and two to three hours of lab reports weekly.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a good introductory course for students who don't know much about chemistry laboratory procedure. It relays critical information well, in a straightforward answer. If you take the class, however, be prepared to do just as much work as you do for other classes, even though it is only a half-course credit. I spent a lot of time on my lab reports, and the four hours of class time is also consuming.",
    "Chemistry 116L 01 is a general chemistry lab with a lot of titrations. I would recommend you take this lab, especially to take advantage of the lessons of Dr. Ganapathi.",
    "I would only recommend it to those who are pre-med or else need it for a major. Otherwise, it's way too much to handle for fun etc.",
    "I would recommend this lab course for another student only if he or she was truly interested in the lab work",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students who do have no or little experience in Lab.",
    "It is time consuming but not too difficult, and gives a good instruction of introductory lab techniques. There is not much to improve upon. A student has to put in the work for this course, however.",
    "I'm not sure why anyone would take this class unless it was for a requirement, but I can see someone coming in and taking this lab just for fun. So yes, I'd recommend it because it's an enjoyable experience. I just wish I'd gotten to know the people in my lab better!",
    "Chem116 is fairly boring. The prelab quizzes are bad, and get worse as the semester progresses. They count for more of your grade than you think. The labs themselves are uninteresting, except for a few exceptions that are colorful and involve more novel reactions. The reports themselves are tedious and take hours. You will spend hours doing reports.",
    "Lab for general chemistry. Get ready to titrate. Not fun, but necessary. You'll get through it.",
    "Yes. Great introduction to chemistry outside of the textbook.",
    "A good introductory lab.",
    "I recommend this class because of its usefulness in learning and applying laboratory techniques.",
    "This class was a great introductory laboratory class and very informative with techniques and concepts. I would recommend this if a science major or pre-med is desired.",
    "The labs are long, but not too difficult. The lab reports definitely require some time and effort, but as long as you plan ahead and don't procrastinate, they are not that bad.",
    "10 labs that are chemistry related",
    "Chem Lab 116 is a rigorous course that requires a lot of time and effort, and still only equates to half a credit. However, the labs (if preformed properly) are graded easily and Dr. G is a hoot! The labs can often be extremely tedious and frustrating, but for the most part, they are fairly straightforward.",
    "The course was a typical lab course. It was useful in some respects for Chemistry 114, in terms of visualizing and observing chemical processes and concepts. I would not necessarily have taken it if I was not pre-med."
