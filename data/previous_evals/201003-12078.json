   "comments": [
    "Take it if you are reallty good with statistics. I was easily the top percentile in Econ 131, but Econ 132 was a big shock to me( not the class, but e homework)",
    "Take this class only if you are interested in writing a senior essay or if you like econometrics a lot. Otherwise, it's not worthwhile- there are a lot of easier, more interesting economics classes out there.",
    "Yes.",
    "It's like eating your vegetables. Not a lot of fun, but you are much better for doing it.All-in-all, Prof Lange is a solid teacher dealing with some very dry materials. The textbook is OK, but the real core of the class lies in the lecture notes (which you in turn will struggle to understand without reading the lectnotes).My advice (which I didn't take as well as I should've). If you read before class and pay attention when you are there (as I sometimes did), you'll get a lot out of the class (as I, well, sometimes did). If you don't read and aren't fully there at 9AM, don't waste your time... it's not much fun.",
    "Econ 132 is a necessary second step for anyone who wants to write an empirical paper. As far as regressions are concerned, Econ 131 only covers the first week or so of the course. The workload includes 6 problem sets, which are all pretty straightforward, and two tests. Both the tests are fair (entirely contained in the lecture slides i.e. you don't need to read the book) and the curve is extremely generous. Between lecture and office hours, if you need them, you should be able to understand everything in the course. Professor Lange sometimes does not appear to spend much time on the class, but otherwise is a solid professor. Take it.",
    "It is a good class, and very important to take if you really want to do economics. Econometrics I is just not even close to sufficient. It is very difficult however.",
    "no.",
    "Take it if you want to pursue research in economics or understand academic papers. Great foundation.",
    "Looking out for fellow econ majors, trust me when I say do not take this course. Yes, econometrics is extremely important for papers and econ projects, but you certainly won't get the tools you need from this class.",
    "This is a good course in Econometrics. ECON 131 isn't sufficent for understanding how Economists due research, and it's important to have this course to see how good multi-variate regression is done. It's not a huge amount of work (p-sets every other week, midterm and final), but the material is very challenging and relying on the book to better understand certain topics is necessary. I took the course Cr\/D\/F which made things much less stressful.",
    "Good course. Very clearly taught. Its good because it is not that theoretical but rather very applied to actual economic papers.",
    "Great course A+++++ would take again. Professor Lange explains key concepts more clearly and methodically than any other econ instructor I've had.",
    "If you are writing a senior essay, you won't find a much better option for learning this material than Fabian. I'd take the class again in a heartbeat. If you aren't writing a senior essay and\/or don't have a deep love for the subject, I don't know why you'd take it.",
    "Great course if you really want to learn more about Econometrics.",
    "Yes. Prof Lange is a great professor. The problem sets are not too bad."
