    "Johannes is hands--down the best instructor I have had so far. Even though the material he presented was mostly standard, he managed to provoke interest and point out issues he lacked the time to discuss. While I think it was apparent that the instructor does not genuinely enjoy teaching first--year courses, his class was the best I have taken this semester --- by far. He was available for questions that went beyond the material he covered in class.",
    "The course should recruit better TAs. Weicheng doesn't seem to understand the material very well. Anna only writes dry equations in her session. She is boring and necessarily harsh, therefore unsurprisingly considered to be the worst TA in the first-year courses by most of the class.",
    "Good class, but early in the morning",
    "A lot of materials have been covered, which is good. Yet, motivations for each topic are needed.",
    "Good course.",
    "I would love to see the course materials written up and posted online to help with revision. The lectures are great but it is hard to keep up with all the details without slides or notes.",
    "I believe it could be improved if lecture notes were provided and if it was taught at a slower pace with a more detailed exposition.",
    "I found the material of this course very interesting, and found it very challenging"
