    "Incredibly interesting subject matter at times, but the class is very disorganized so you don't get to dive into it as much as you should. A weird mix of grad students and undergrads coming from really different directions this year seemed to make people kind of scared to engage with each other. But this could easily be different another time. Learning about Islam and religious identity questions in general should be eye-opening especially for those who have generally heard bad things about Islam\/religion in the past. Professors both talk WAY too much.",
    "in-depth theory class on sociology of religion. (it's called \"sociology of Islam\" but really the focus is on religion more generally and uses Islam as more of a case example.) Good class.",
    "Great class, would totally recommend. Reasonable amount of reading.",
    "I would say that the class taught sociological theory in relation to discussing Islam as a categorical religion. It was a very informative course in how it dealt with Islam as well as very successful in helping me think about Islam in a new way. I'd recommend it."
