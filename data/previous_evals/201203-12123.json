    "Your experience with in theatre 210 depends a lot on which professor teaches your section. My section with Connie Grappo allowed me to develop useful acting techniques, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help me to develop my sense of play. Theatre 210 will introduce you to some concepts about performance, but not a variety of perspectives on acting.",
    "I would recommend it because it teaches you to appreciate acting as an art. I learned so much from this class and it pushed me more than I ever expected it would.",
    "Absolutely worth taking. Don't be fooled, this is a lot of work outside of the class room though. It also really depends on your professor, they can really alter the class's work load.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, although hopefully the class size will be smaller -- we had 14 people in our class, which meant most of our time was spent just sitting around watching, which was frustrating. Connie teaches Uta Hagen's method of acting, which is focused on precision in setting, props, and character background. It's a very useful, very realistic method of acting. You do a combination of scenes with one other person as well as one person acting exercises from Uta Hagen's book. The class requires plenty of outside rehearsal time, so it's not a joke in any way. But well worth it!",
    "From what I've heard, not every 210 class is a real acting class, but Connie's definitely is. She works from Uta Hagen's technique, so we did a few exercises from Hagen's book, as well as two scenes and a couple other projects. Connie is great-she really knows what she's talking about, and she really cares about helping each and every person in her class. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "I absolutely loved the course. The coolest part about the course is watching everyone become a much more honest actor. You really do learn just as much from watching other people as you do from performing. I would reccommend the course, but you should know that the course varies a LOT from professor to professor. While seems that even students in the other classes really liked the course too, I can't imagine anyone who would better than Connie Grappo. If you really want to delve into scene work she's the one. Whatever work you put into it is what you get out of it. I would meet with my scene partner multiple times to rehearse before we performed for the class. Then we would meet again afterwards and try to consider Connie's comments. So it's a lot a work in that sense, because you have to coordinate with your scene partner on a time to meet etc. But you don't do a scene every week so some weeks you'll have no work, and most of the time it doesn't really feel like work anyway.",
    "I feel like I learned a lot, but the amount of time sitting was quite a deterrence.",
    "Connie's 210 class is a great introductory acting class, primarily built off of the methods of Uta Hagen. The course includes scene-work, poetry performance, and various exercises, in each of which you will receive individual attention and you will improve as an actor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 no matter how good you may think you are. Take this class if you're looking for a solid intro-ish level acting technique class; Connie will see that you improve regardless of your skill level."
