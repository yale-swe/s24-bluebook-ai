   "comments": [
    "Very useful course. Material was very helpful.",
    "The course was good and thoroughly went over many biostatistics topics. Sometimes the workload felt a bit unnecessary, and I felt like the labs and homework assignments should have been alternated instead of having two assignments due per week.",
    "I do not feel that I had a strong grasp of biostatistics until I took this course. I feel that clicker questions, Dr. Ciarleglio's attention to detail, and ability to succinctly tie in the big picture to what we are learning on a daily basis made this one of the best courses I took this semester by far. I was challenged and loved going to class. I feel like I can say without any hesitation that I am a master of introductory biostatistics now.",
    "This course had a lot of busy work and a lack of student focused learning. I understand that this is a large lecture class, but the overall lack of caring about student success is problematic.",
    "Maria did an excellent job of presenting the material in a clear and organized way. The homework and exam questions were always clear and never ambiguous. The homework was a bit more than I would have liked, although I'm sure this made us better prepared for the exams. Perhaps next year, the lab and homework assignments could be combined into one shorter assignment per week, or the homeworks could be given every other week. If there is going to be so many of them, they should also be a bigger percentage of the overall grade. I also resented the pop quizzes - if students feel confident enough to learn the material without going to class, they should be free to do so.",
    "Strengths - great slides, good labs and problem sets. Weaknesses - none.",
    "Great course. Much better than Biostats I.",
    "Strengths: The class is really well-taught and the provided notes are thorough. Weaknesses: Too many small weekly assignments",
    "great course for an broad view on biostatistic. Homework is too much! There is no need for one problem set and one lab assignment per week. There are many overlaps between the problem sets and lab assignments. We could definitely combine the 2 homework into 1 assignment per week, just note which problem should use SAS\/R.",
    "Too many assignments leave no room to study for other courses, or even this course. 2 long assignments\/week is just too much. Spacing it out over two weeks would help. There were so many assignments, the TFs couldn't even provide valuable feedback on any of them, because it was so much to grade.",
    "This course is a lot of work. There is a lengthy problem set in addition to a lab assignment due every week.",
    "The only thing for this class is its workload. Way too much. Just tooooo much. I understand that this is a course that needs practice but 10 homework sets and lab assignments are just too much.",
    "I felt like I have a solid understanding of biostatistics. For the amount of time\/work involved, I would have expected the homework to be worth a greater percentage of our final grade. Additionally, I felt that while the problem sets\/labs provided a fair assessment of my understanding of the material, I thought the exams were on a much more challenging scale than the homework problems, and at times I felt ill-prepared. The labs were my favorite part of the course - I really enjoyed learning how to use R!",
    "this course is excellent, very helpful for the analytic skill.",
    "strength: clear weakness: no much",
    "Strengths are the instructors powerpoint slides - they are very detailed and provide an excellent summary of core concepts. Weaknesses - the homeworks and labs don't count for enough of your final grade, especially considering how much work you put into them!!!! The \"pop quizzes\" for class were worth 5% and the homework\/labs 10%. Really unfair in my opinion since the homework and labs were not items you could just do quickly.... The final was also much harder than the 2 midterm exams, and it was worth 35% of our grade. You only get to bring 1 cheat-sheet into the exam with you, which is a tall order when you are trying to summarize a semesters worth of formulas and materials for a comprehensive exam! For someone who has a H\/HP in the class to be worried that their grade might drop to a P after the exam seems unfair. I hope that even though she doesn't allocate many points to the homework, quizzes, and earlier exams...that she will look holistically at how the student has been performing and then make a determination about their grade. Because to base almost everything off of that last exam would be unfair.... Also, get rid of the last lecture topic. It was uninformative and unnecessary.",
    "Very helpful course for gaining a foundation in statistics!",
    "This course was extremely practical and extremely well taught. Material was presented in a very clear and well-paced manner, however the amount of extra work was too much. Especially second semester of first year, YSPH students are taking a very demanding set of data-heavy classes. To complete both a lab and a homework assignment each week, although helpful, was too demanding. Maybe alternating a lab or problem set every week would be better.",
    "Having a lab and problem set due every week that were both usually quite time consuming led to this semester being a real test of mental strength and time-budgeting skills. To have ALL hw and psets combined only worth 15% of our grade is a real insult considering the insane amount of time they took. At the same time 3 measly clicker quizzes were 5% of our grade...just doesn't make sense. Also there's a rumor that the grades will be curved down if students do well --why on earth should my grade be lowered because other students do well? I'm not aware of some policy that says grades need to be evenly distributed... Strength: Slides are great and thorough --don't need the textbook for the course. Weakness: My TA. --It can be improved if there were some sort of vetting process for TAs rather than just the fact that they're a PhD student.",
    "Strengths: Very organized. Slides were very clear and easy to follow. Weakness: There were times when the homework and the lab were both long and took long amounts of time to be completed. If the homework is going to be long, then the lab should be short and vice versa.",
    "This course definitely provided me with great fundamentals of biostatistics. There was a lot of homework sometimes...which I don't think it a weakness, but is definitely challenging. R lab on Wednesday at noon overlapped with a lot of lectures and lunches which made it difficult to prioritize.",
    "I think the course was very well organized and that the assignments were well coordinated with the lecture material. My only real issue with the class was that there were no preparation materials provided for the exams. I am not a great test taker and would have appreciated additional practice exams, since they sometimes differed from the homework\/labs in that there were multiple choice questions and a higher expectation of being able to synthesize the material. Maybe past exams could be used? Additionally, I think that the teaching fellows have an amazing opportunity to be closely involved with the learning experiences of students--but they currently do not grade the assignments of those in their labs, and I think this leaves them slightly out of touch with student issues, questions, and progress. While this might have to do with funding\/payment...I felt that having a grader who is separated from students made it difficult for me to get adequate feedback on my work and progress.",
    "The course was well structured, and I learned a lot of material. With weekly lab assignments and problem sets, as well as 3 exams, I don't think the clicker quizzes were necessary.",
    "It is a great course, we learn a lot at a slow enough pace.",
    "Good.",
    "Really solid course.",
    "The constant homework assignments were useful in making me keep up with course content, but having separate lab and homework assignments due in the same week sometimes felt excessive. My recommendation would be to have both assignments due together on the same day on a weekly or biweekly basis, which would allow students more flexibility in their ability to complete the assignments. Additionally, while this did improve toward the end of the semester, there was a good amount of repetition on the types of problems included in the homework--if we're able to interpret the odds ratio for one variable in a regression model, chances are we're able to interpret others without further practice. I just say this because sometimes the homework assignments felt unnecessarily time consuming. The organization of this class is a true strength. Additionally, it is very clear what is expected of students, and Maria is a thorough lecturer. The majority of the time (with the exception being the longitudinal analysis lecture), the connection between what was taught and what we were expected to be able to do was clear. The exams also seemed fair.",
    "Learned lots",
    "There was way too much work. Having lab assignments and problem sets due every week was a slight overload. Maybe alternate lab assignments one week and problem sets another?",
    "Having weekly homework assignments, in addition to weekly labs, made the work load for this course very heavy.",
    "This course is very organized and well-taught. I appreciated the structure and the reinforcement given to the material by the homework. Professor Ciarlegio put so much time in preparing the slides and labs, and it really made a difference in terms of elevating the standard of what I was able to take away from the course. I thought the only weakness was that sometimes the homeworks and labs were repetitive and would take a long time to get through. The one weakness I thought was not being able to take away more R coding skills since the codes for the analyses we conducted were often given to us.",
    "Very clear and informative. I would have liked this course over the entire year and cover even greater amount of material.",
    "I entered this class very scared of biostats--I haven't had good experiences in the past with anything related to stats. The structure of this class, the approachability of the TAs and professor, the psets, and the labs made this, hands down, the best stats class I've ever taken. I now actually enjoy the topic and am much more comfortable doing statistics in my projects.",
    "The notes and slides are very good. Professor Ciarleglio is very nice and explains most things well. The psets and labs help teach the concepts and the exams are fair and all seem to be at a good level. The sections and labs helped me learn SAS very well. However, the lecture itself can get EXTREMELY boring and can be at an EXTREMELY low level. Way too much time is spent explaining basic concepts, such as what a \"count\" is, or how to divide one number by another in a formula, or that if a line is horizontal then the effect of something is constant over time. I seriously think tons of time in this class is spent re-explaining things that most people learned before 9th grade. Then, because so much time is wasted explaining easy stuff, less time is spent on more complex topics, such as the Negative Binomial model, or survival analysis, or longitudinal analysis. It seems almost like the professor wants the class not to seem too difficult, so she spends tons of time on easy stuff in a given lecture and glosses over anything more difficult. I suppose maybe the lecture is taught at a sort of low level because people come in with varying backgrounds in math. However, hopefully everyone has at least a college math class, so there is no need to spend this much time going over super basic concepts. Also, I really hate how clicker quizzes are used to enforce attendance. This is graduate school, not middle school. There should not be pop quizzes to enforce attendance.",
    "Learned a lot.",
    "The course was strong in that it correlated with concepts we learned in Epidemiology (i.e. survival analysis), but brought a quantitative perspective to it. It was also useful learning multivariate analysis, and built upon the basic concepts learned first semester.",
    "Biostatistics II was taught really well this semester. The material was at the right difficulty level and the class provided a very useful overview of the variety of statistical models we can use in epi studies. My only complaint is the overlap with AAMIE and Epi II.",
    "It was great to have constant practice and feedback about what we understood and didn't. It was a lot of work because of that, but I think it was worth it. I definitely feel that I have gained a much better grasp of statistics thanks to this class.",
    "It was awesome that an option to learn R was provided. The main weakness is that answer keys weren't provided for the homework or exams. I know we could go in ask, but that's not always convenient. The comments on the tests were generally helpful, though often not enough to fully understand where I went wrong. And there weren't any comments on the homework so we didn't know exactly what we did wrong unless we went to ask. Also, I would've liked to spend more time on homework and less time on labs. The homework is a lot more helpful for the exams and I learned a lot more from it. The labs were good and I appreciate the need for them, but the homework is so much more helpful in terms of learning and grasping the concepts.",
    "This course can only be put into perspective if you take into consideration the first semester of biostats we took last fall. Taking Dr. Ciarleglio's course was great and was a huge relief for me since the first part of the course series I took in the Fall made me reconsider why I had come to Yale. Dr. Ciarleglio's notes are great, we can go through the course and lab notes and know exactly what is going on and what we need to do. In that sense the format she uses could be taught to other professors that teach programming so that they may be more effective professors. Last Fall was really bad. A student that came from a country that is rapidly developing once told me in lecture. \"How does this happen at Yale?\" The course we took in the Fall did not prepare me at all for Dr. Ciarleglio's course and needs to be changed. The greatest strength of Dr. Ciarleglio's course is its structure and meticulousness. Its greatest weakness is not the fault of the professor but is a systemic problem in teaching a course that aims at getting students to develop problem solving skills. In this scheme of things Dr. Ciarleglio is merely adhering to the general structure of education used by all professors. Having students passively sit and listen to lecture during this course is not the best format to teach it and it fosters student disengagement with people going on Facebook, buy shoes, ect... during lecture. I believe the answer to this is to have students read the slides the day before the lecture and then have class time be a time where students are actively engaged in solving problems and challenged instead of passive and disengaged. It would be the responsibility of students to read the slides before the lecture and the professor would use problems in lecture to tie it all together. That is my advice and I believe it should be taken into serious consideration instead of just dismissing it as too complicated to implement. The advent of MOOCs is revolutionizing education and Yale should be at the forefront of new methods of education to foster the next generation of public health professionals who will be empowered with the tools they need to use their passion, intelligence, and talents to save lives. I also really loved R. Thank you for teaching it to us.",
    "The course went through each subject with great detail, which was one of its major strengths. The work was a bit tedious, but I do understand that it was necessary in order to learn the concepts.",
    "Decent course Learn the basics Material gets repetitive fast, especially wrt to regression Homework feels like busy work Tests are fair MW 830 is brutal Attendance should be optional since the slides are good enough",
    "The course was really great! I learned to use R, which will be very useful for the future. The only weakness was that sometimes the homeworks were quite long, but they improved towards the end of the semester. Clicker questions should be in the middle of the lecture, so that people arriving a little late to class can still answer it.",
    "Clicker quizzes were dumb. I think that if you want to have them, they should be at the end of the class. It is difficult to get to class especially in the winter. The shuttles do not operate on time and slow due to the snow. I remember one day, there was a snow storm, and many expected there to be no clicker quiz but there was. If you want to keep them, this is fine, but I think it would be easier and less stressful if they were moved to the end of class. There are a lot of homework assignments and a lot of labs. They are worth very little of the overall grade. I suggest that you make them worth more as we spent a significant portion of time on them. Around mid semester you asked how everyone felt about the workload. There were some people who suggested that it was way too much, and you made a comment about slowing down\/eliminating material. I am not sure if you actually did do this or just made the comment to appease those who thought it was too much. I think that looking at the overall grades in the course though based on the beautiful summaries you send out, slowing down\/eliminating material should not be necessary. We are in grad school. We should be able to handle it. I am paying a lot of money, and I want to be able to get as much out of the course as possible. R was a great addition. Watch some of your exam questions, and make sure they make sense. On the first exam, there was an ANOVA question I think. I don't have the exam with me. If you filled out the table based on the blanks in the summary table (just simply adding and subtracting), there was one answer. However, if you did the math and actually calculated everything out using the SSb SSw formulas, the numbers did not align. Watch this in the future. We are anal over-achievers, and I know I am not the only one who noticed this.",
    "The course is conducted much better than 505a but both courses should be completely reworked. 505a teaches us none of the basics that were covered in the introductory lessons of 505b. It seemed like many of the questions you asked on the exams did not come directly from the course but from some other understanding we had of statistics, knowledge which we would have had to have gotten somewhere outside of the course. That was not fair for those of us who have never taken statistics before. The course workload was way too much. Having two assignments per week and having them count for so little is an insult. Many students ended up not handing one or two assignments in because they just couldn't keep up and found it to be inconsequential. The exam \"cheat sheets\" while helpful are a distraction from studying. It would be nice in the future if you included a sheet on the back of the exam that included all formulas we would need for the exam. You could even include some formulas that were not needed to make sure we weren't just using a process of elimination. Attempting to fit every equation on one sheet of paper can backfire if the student doesn't have one equation and the question is worth a lot of points. The lecture would be greatly improved if it were more interactive. I think the students would grasp concepts better if we helped solve some of the example problems in the lectures. The clicker questions are good and could be used more often. Lastly, I think the course covers too much material and it would be beneficial to remove one or two lessons and have review sessions before exams so we understand the material better.",
    "I feel that this class truly enhanced my understanding of biostatistics, and am much more confident in my knowledge and skills. I think the option of taking SAS or R lab is great, and think this should be an option offered in future semesters. I chose to take the R lab and thought it was very well taught, and was glad to learn another statistical program. I felt that the labs and homeworks were helpful in learning the material, but having weekly assignments was a bit much since the other classes I took this semester also had weekly assignments. So I would suggest spacing out either the lab or homework assignments a bit. I think the clicker questions during lecture were useful, but could have been more challenging to see if students were really grasping the concepts. Clicker quizzes weren't that useful since they were so infrequent. I would suggest either having a couple more clicker quizzes per semester or not doing the quizzes at all.",
    "This course provided an excellent introduction to different types of data analysis techniques. My only suggestion is to lighten the workload- two weekly assignments took a long time to complete.",
    "I felt like this was a good class but it was definitely a lot of work with the weekly problem sets and R\/SAS lab assignments. There was basically 2 assignments due every week for this class. However, Maria did take into account our feedback to make the assignments shorter which was very considerate and nice of her. Overall, I thought this class was good.",
    "A lot of work and overwhelming initially but eventually became more manageable.",
    "Maria's powerpoint slides are magical.",
    "This class was fantastic. I really can't begin to extoll it enough. The topics covered were pertinent and expertly presented and explained. The slides were well-crafted and always accompanied by good explanations. Overall, the pace was probably what Dr. Ciarleglio was aiming for; Math has always been a strength of mine, so I felt like the pace of the class could have moved a little bit faster, to cover another topic or two, but I am sure there are others who thought the pace was already a bit fast, especially since this was a required course. Beyond that, I don't see anything glaring that could be improved. The grading was very, very lenient throughout the entire class, on the homework assignments, labs, and exams. While this is nice from a grade-wise point of view, it may have lulled me into a false sense of understanding of the material, which I won't truly know exists or not until I try to do some independent applications of these methods.",
    "This course was infinitely better than Biostatistics I. Maria provides clear and concise slides, thoroughly explains the material, and provides homework problem sets that reinforce materials. However, having 1 problem set and 1 lab due per week was excessive given the weight of homework on our overall grade. The lab does not provide a lot of help in learning the material and felt like busy work.",
    "Maria is an excellent instructor and really does care about students. Powerpoints are very useful in learning the material. However, the problem sets and labs are a little unnecessarily long and repetitive - the work load could be cut down a bit.",
    "This course is a lot of work, but one of the most valuable. Maria is the best instructor that I have had at Yale.",
    "Well organized and logical presentation of material.",
    "The exercises are very thorough but some seemed repetitive. R lab was very interactive and the assignments were straight forward. Lecture was also thorough and the clicker questions were engaging. Grading criteria was unclear and seemed to be inconsistent.",
    "I feel like I learned a tremendous amount in this class. I thought the homework and lab assignments helped to reinforce the material well. My only critique is that these assignments weren't worth much of our overall grade, which I understood and appreciated as our opportunity get comfortable with the material and make mistakes, but I felt were much easier than the tests.",
    "I liked the design of the course - it was very well structured, with the two midterm exams so that neither covered a huge portion of material. Having the cheat sheets is also very helpful so that time doesn't need to be wasted memorizing formulas. I think that the homework problems are helpful to understanding the material, and I much preferred that they were written by Maria then the textbook problems in first semester, especially since it is how they will be written on the exam. There were a few homework assignments that I felt were repetitive to what we were doing in lab. I really liked that R lab was offered as an option this semester as well. I think clicker quizzes should be done in the middle of the class instead of at the very beginning in case people who come to class are running late, especially in the winter with bad weather!",
    "Required a lot of work, very demanding, but also very rewarding in terms of the amount I learned.",
    "Biostats II is much better than the first semester. Maria presents the material in a way that is very accessible and easy to understand. Her lecture slides are incredible and could easily be made into a stats textbook. I sometimes think the clicker questions in class were a little too easy and obvious and didn't really give me a sense of whether I understood the material. I think at times they gave me a false sense of security about my level of mastery of the subject. While probably an unpopular opinion, I liked having homework every week as it gave me a lot of opportunity for feedback and to see how I was grasping the material along the way. It would also be helpful, if possible, to coordinate the material with some other classes such as Epi II and Advanced Analytic Methods as we covered much of the same material from different perspectives. It would be ideal if these courses could align in some way.",
    "Maria was an excellent professor. Her notes were thorough and the examples were well done. She did not make the course easy, but she was willing to be flexible. The in-class clicker questions were particularly useful as well, as you could test, in class, whether you had a gap in understanding. Also liked the option to do R or SAS, and for those of us doing R, it was helpful that she included the SAS code in the slides. Overall, excellent course. Learned a lot and appreciated that Maria took time to explain the concepts behind the math very well. Thanks Maria!",
    "The main strength of the class was the teacher. Maria was very organized and had great slides. It was also great to have an R lab. The course could be improved by having a different time (i.e., not so early in the morning). It would be great to have the homeworks due on Wednesdays and add more TF sections earlier in the week so we can actually consult the TFs after having done the homework.",
    "the best class i took so far, however the weekly two assignments are long and time consuming",
    "Wonderful course regardless of your level of understanding of basic biostats. Strengths: extremely comprehensive lectures with very clearly related homework and lab assignments, clear instructor who successfully articulated complex concepts. When the class articulated concern by the workload, Maria adjusted the workload without compromising any concepts or application. I was so grateful for the R lab--very interesting.",
    "Very good course and quite thorough but quite a heavy workload."

She was always available to answer questions and was more supportive than most professors at YSPH. The only negative comment I have for Dr. Ciarleglio is that I wish she taught more classes.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0I think Maria was an OUTSTANDING professor and I truly felt like I learned and understood biostatistics from taking this course. It has been rumored that she will not be teaching the course next year but I think that it would be a real shame for next years students, and future students as well if she did not teach this again! I know it was a lot of work for her to prepare all of the amazing material she used but at this point, it is all prepared so she should consider teaching it again :)",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Her slides are absolutely excellent, and a great resource for studying. It would be very helpful to do sample problems where the answers are not provided on the slide. Working with students on practice problems so an greater understanding of expectation and how to do the problems would be advantageous.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Biostats is a naturally dry subject, but Maria has a great personality. She presented the material in a perfectly organized fashion and it was really easy to follow her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Strengths - great explanation of concepts and statistical models, well-prepared for lectures. Weaknesses - none.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Excellent instructor. Well organized power point slides, provided helpful theoretical background information. Work load was high but the assignments were helpful and I didn't not mind completing them, as this helped me to understand the material. I would take another course by the same instructor in a heart beat.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Great professor. Really focused on the big picture and I learned biostats like never before.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Professor Ciarleglio is great! The lecture slides are really helpful.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She genuinely wants her students to succeed, and cares about their concerns.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She is a great instructor and very agreeable to student feedback. There should be fewer deliverables required of students each week, however.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria did an excellent job explaining the course material. She was always willing to answer students' questions. Her lectures were very organized and easy to understand.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Excellent! The structure and logical thinking is very good.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Great instructor! highly recommended",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She is very sweet and patient while she explains the course material, but she can be rather inflexible on other things. Don't even try to earn points back on an exam or something, she won't hear it... I don't think I'd have any problems with this course if she would allocate points differently and actually rate people on the quality of work THROUGHOUT the semester, and not on an exam that happens at the same time as every other exam, when students won't be able to perform to her really high standards.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Excellent instructor-- Dr. Ciarleglio's slides and lectures are so appreciably thorough, detailed, and clear.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria's bright personality was perfect for teaching an 8:30 am class. She encouraged questions, took her time teaching complicated concepts, and was receptive to student feedback. I'm very thankful to have been able to take a course with her!",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria makes AMAZING slides.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr. Ciarleglio is very organized and well planned out for the semester. This is evident in her clear notes and clear explanations to material that is taught. Even the topics that were labeled as \"other\" were organized within the course topics. It is also great that she makes herself available for questions before and after class. There are two things I would hope she would improve on: 1) Her office hours were held right in between her class and the epidemiology class. This is not convenient for students who take both of the classes. Perhaps office hours can be held in the afternoon or another morning (like Tuesday or Wednesday) when this issue is not bound to happen. 2) It would be great if Dr. Ciarleglio taught fall classes. I think this would be a way for her to share more knowledge with students.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is very capable and was really good at teaching a potentially complicated subject.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria was excellent, she seemed meticulously organized\/timely and while I mistakenly didn't take advantage of her office hours, she seemed very accessible to students if they needed help or had questions.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Lectures are well-formatted and easy to follow.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr. Ciarleglio is fantastic ! Her explanations are easy to understand, she is very accessible and answers all your questions.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Good.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr. Ciarleglio is a good lecturer and created wonderful course materials to reference and learn from.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very clear.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very intelligent and sweet",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very nice instructor and explained things well. I think if she provided more worked-out examples it would be helpful for students.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr. Ciarleglio cares about her students and has very detailed class slides. The examples from class were helpful for grasping the material.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very, very sweet! She works so hard to make complex material accessible to students and puts so much effort in making the course organized and structured.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Excellent and clear",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She's the best stats professor I've ever had. She's approachable and knows how to teach a generally unapproachable topic. I've learned so much from her. The way she structures the lectures (with an example and step-by-step instructions) has made stats much more understandable, and I credit her to helping me get over my fear for this subject.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Professor Ciarleglio is nice and I love that the lecture notes, psets, and labs are so well organized. However, the lecture itself feels pretty useless. It seems like the class would almost be better if we just had no lecture and just did section and psets using the lecture notes.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She is likable. BUT she penalized me for an error she made that I brought to her attention. This was unfair. What did I learn? If your test is misgraded be quiet.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is an excellent professor, her slides are extremely comprehensive, and she is very receptive to student feedback (i.e. reducing the length of homework assignments). She is also very fast at answering questions via e-mail. Maria is enthusiastic and keeps students engaged at 8 in the morning.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is a fantastic professor. She has the best slides of any professor I've had at YSPH. She is very clear and detailed in her lectures. She provides ample examples and is very specific about what is expected of us. I really appreciated how much work she put into the course.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Professor Ciarleglio was great. Her powerpoints were extremely well put together- very clear and methodical. Despite that, I always felt that it was worth my time to be in class, because she did a great job of explaining everything and making the information understandable for us. She was great!",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0I think the in-class presentation was fine, but, again, it would have been helpful to have answer keys posted on classesv2. I know that's more work, but that's helpful for studying.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0See response to question 6.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Professor Ciarleglio was very organized, precise, fair, and overall an incredible professor. Her slides are incredible and she gives plenty of adequate examples in lectures. I do wish she provided practice exams or reviews for tests however.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Seems nice",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria was very receptive and responsive to feedback. The class was very organized and well taught.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She is good and provides good examples in class but could be over interactive and more available outside of class to her students for help. The amount of paper that she wastes on exams is irresponsible. Except for Michelle (who is amazing), the TF were pretty unknowledgeable and unhelpful.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr. Ciarleglio is an excellent professor. Her lecture and lab slides were comprehensive and so useful to use for studying or completing assignments. And she always made a point to give the larger picture of when to use which statistical tests, which has really helped me to have a better grasp on the subject. She puts a lot of work into teaching this class and I am really glad to have had her as an instructor.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr.Ciarlegio was a great instructor who provided comprehensive lecture slides and lab instructions to aid in learning the material.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is such a great professor! Her slides are beautiful, well-detailed, and she lectures well. I was surprised I was able to come to class every morning at 8:30AM but she makes the time fly by quickly. I learned a lot thanks to her.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Very very thorough but may need improvement on connecting the lectures a bit better.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0The instructor was very thorough and clear in her instruction. She seemed to genuinely care that students understood the material. Her slides were extremely instructive.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She is very good at teaching the material in a clear and effective manner. The notes are fantastic.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr. Ciarleglio was undoubtedly the best teacher I have had at YSPH thus far. She very rarely went on tangents, a seemingly rare skill in teachers. Her slides were well-constructed and understandable, and she always gave good explanations to accompany the visuals. She chose good examples and answered questions well when they were raised. The only possible source of improvement might be in the handwriting she does on the slides. I do not know if it was the iPad hookup or particular setup, but often the writing on the slides was somewhat unintelligible. This rarely impacted my comprehension, but it may have affected others in the class.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Professor thoroughly explains material.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is fantastic, very thorough, and it almost seems like she cares too much sometimes. She is very knowledgeable about the material and attentive to student needs. She's great!",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She is the best instructor I have had at Yale. It would be great if she could have the random quizzes in the middle of lecture instead of the first 10 minutes.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Enthusiastic professor who is always delightful, I loved attending her classes despite the material. She's also very approachable and willing to explain material until we finally understand it.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0I really enjoyed Professor Ciarleglio's teaching style. Her lectures were thorough and easy to follow. I would have preferred though if the lectures were broken up by class rather than by the overall topic, it made it a little difficult when studying to go back through some of the slides to figure out where certain information was.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is very thorough and her slides are great! She is very sweet and cares about how the course is going and how everyone is handling the material.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Excellent ! She is the best. I feel like I now really understand biostatistics.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria was amazing. She is extremely knowledgeable and prepared for each lecture and is able to explain the material both conceptually and numerically which helps deepen understanding and the ability to apply what we've learned. She's also very nice and has a lovely open personality which made her very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Strengths: Great at really breaking down the math and the concepts to make them understandable. Weaknesses: Perhaps lack of eye contact with the students? Sometimes led to questions going unanswered in the larger auditorium.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria seemed really nice. She was very organized and had really great slides. I can't think of any improvements, aside from logistical changes.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Prof. Ciarleglio is a great instructor. Her lectures are well organized and extremely clear.",

    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Dr. Carleglio is one of the best instructor I know. Her lecture is very organized, approachable and explicit.",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0Maria is extremely clear, completely comprehensive, and works incredibly hard to make sure not only subjects, but also the flow of the class is clear. She is one of the most approachable professors I've ever had. Her notes were flawless and lectures were engaging without needing excess frill. My favorite professor thus far!",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She is an amazing instructor! Brought the concepts of biostats to comprehensible terms. Amazing note slides too!",
    "Instructor: Maria Michelle Ciarleglio \u00a0She was quite amazing as a professor and I wish she taught the 1st semester of this course as opposed to the second."

   "comments": [
    "Good course that covers many topics in biostatistics without getting into the theory behind the methods. Essential to many careers in public health and research",
    "Without a doubt, everyone at YSPH should be required to take this course. I could not say with confidence that I could summarize Intro Biostats I with Dr. Claus to anyone who just asked me, but I can see this whole semester in my head and explain how we went through it all and what we learned. If you want to be able to speak with confidence about statistical analysis as an MPH student, this class will help you do that. A must take for sure.",
    "I feel like I learned a lot from this class about statistical modelling. However, it is way too much work for someone who is not required to take the class to take it. If you don't have to, do not take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It provides a very good overview of statistical models used in public health research as well as essential SAS codes to conduct more sophisticated data analysis. This course was much better than Biostatistics 505a, not only with lessons but also with class materials, such as slides and click quizzes.",
    "This course was challenging but very educational. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a solid foundation in statistical methods.",
    "Great way to really learn stats and a good foundation to continue with more in-depth courses.",
    "Great course for an broad view on biostatistic. The R labs are really helpful! However homework is too much!",
    "You will work many many hours on the homework assignments, and this course will take up a large portion of your time. You will have a marginally better understanding of statistics after, and the slides are good, but the effort you put in will not reward you with a great understanding of the topic.",
    "A lot of work but the instructor is great and you will learn a lot.",
    "Too much workload. But an important course.",
    "recommended to all the students",
    "Definitely I would recommend this course to other student, not because it is a core course, but because it's really useful and well taught.",
    "Most of us have to take it...but overall it is a reasonable course. The topics build upon each other nicely. Based on my experience, try on the homeworks and the labs because they give you insight into how the exams will be structured (you get no practice exam), but don't kill yourself over them because the final is what really matters...unfortunately.",
    "While statistics is not a particularly fun or interesting subject, Dr. Ciarleglio does an excellent job of making the content for this course clear and equipping students to use it for real public health applications.",
    "For many this class is a requirement, however I think that the skills and material are extremely valuable for those that do need to take it and those that do not. My only hesitation about recommending it to someone who is not required to take the course is the amount of work involved. If the work were not as much I would absolutely recommend it to everyone!",
    "This course solidifies what was learned in the fall. It is a class that all should take.",
    "The workload was high, but I think that this kind of material cannot be learned without a lot of problem sets and practice. The class helped me gain a much more comprehensive understanding of biostatistics and how you perform analysis on different types of data. The opportunity to learn R was also exciting.",
    "A very useful course where you learn a lot of new biostatistical skills",
    "Good.",
    "Good class, you learn a lot.",
    "An overview of important types of biostatistics methods and modeling concepts.",
    "Satisfied. it was great to learn how to use R software-- definitely keep it for next year",
    "Very useful, will recommend",
    "This course does a great job of making difficult material approachable and building on the fundamentals taught the semester before. It can be a lot of tedious work but it pays off in the end!",
    "Be prepared to spend time every single week working on material for this course. But it will be very valuable teaching you the fundamentals of biostatistics for your public health work.",
    "I came in being scared of stats and now I actually quite enjoy it. The professor does a great job of demystifying the topic and the psets help me understand the material even better.",
    "The class isn't too hard but psets twice per week are a lot of work. You will learn stats but lecture is pretty boring.",
    "Required course but useful when taking EPI II",
    "This course is much more interesting than Biostats I, and I would recommend it to any student who seeks to understand the quantitative aspect of public health, or students looking to go into research.",
    "This course provides a strong overview of multivariate models and goes into far greater detail than Epi II or AAMIE. I would recommend this course, especially if Maria is teaching it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It was a lot of work but we learned A LOT. The course material was understandable and the expectations very clear. Maria is a great teacher,as are the TAs. It is a great overview of statistical methods.",
    "Yes. It's a lot of work, but you do learn a lot.",
    "This course was way way better than the first one in the Fall. Go to Dr. Ciarleglio's lectures and learn. She is brilliant, humble, and kind. You won't regret it.",
    "You go through all of the basics of biostastics, focusing on regression modeling. The course fits in well with the require Epi course.",
    "if you have to take it, there's nothing you can really do it gets repetitive fast. try to skip out and take GIs or survival or categorical if you can so you can really apply skills i did appreciate learning how to use R",
    "The course is a lot of work, but you will learn a lot from it. Maria presents the statistical tests and models in a logical way and really does explain why and when we use each test. This course exemplifies the definition of a \"corel\" course because you just learn so much fundamental biostatistics that people from nearly every department will use in the future.",
    "Good course. I learned a lot!",
    "I did not feel like I learned much after Biostats I because the material didn't stick with me, but after taking Biostats II everything came together and I learned so much more. Yes, I would recommend this essential class to other students because having a solid knowledge of biostatistics is so important for public health, and for so many other fields of study.",
    "This course provides an excellent introduction to many data analysis techniques, and I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "A necessary, moderate-workload kind of class.",
    "Useful course just be sure to stay on top of all material because there is alot covered in a short amount of time.",
    "The course is a good, easy overview of biostatistics. The first few weeks are somewhat redundant of the fall biostatistics course, and the overall pace of the course is rather slow.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The methods we learn in this course are necessary for understanding and implementing public health research in nearly every discipline. On top of that, the course was presented well, which really makes this an easy recommendation.",
    "Solid foundation in biostatistics. I felt like I learned a lot.",
    "Great course, but you do need to put in the work (and sometimes it can be a bit repetitive and tedious).",
    "This course is a lot of work but is excellent. It is a loss if you do not take this course.",
    "Coming from Biostatistics I, this course will make everything more coherent and help you build on the basic foundations you learned in the first course.",
    "Very demanding but you will learn so much, so I therefore recommend it.",
    "Would absolutely recommend the course. Great way to take a survey of ANOVA, regression modeling, and working with diverse data endpoints, especially before the summer internship. Will appreciate this course for some time, I'm sure! Besides, Maria is great :)",
    "Yes, because it's required and the materials is pretty important if you are doing epi.",
    "I think everyone in the school of public health needs to take this course. Only after taking it do I feel like I have an understanding of what biostats is and have a toolbox of its concepts at my disposal."
