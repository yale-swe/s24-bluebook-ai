    "Huyssen is the bomb. Not too much work, but he makes you think and knows how to lead a great seminar. Like many classes at Yale, you get out what you put in. Huyssen will motivate you as a good teacher will, but given just how good he is and the class will be -- no matter what you take with him -- you're going to get even more out of it if you recognize that fact. Huyssen has an incredible mind and any student would be silly to miss the opportunity to take a course with him.",
    "If you are interested in New York history, take this class. Even if you aren't, it is worth it to learn about the process of building the greatest city in the world (or at least one of them...) from a variety of perspectives. The professor is one of the best I have found at Yale, interested in students and willing to devote time to everyone in the class. Take it!",
    "Yes of course! This course has something for everyone. Politics, history, urban studies, race relations, it is a total grab bag and completely relevant. I loved it.",
    "It's a great course, but be prepared to do a ton of reading. You end up learning not only about New York, but about time periods in the U.S.'s and world's history that have kind of been overlooked."
