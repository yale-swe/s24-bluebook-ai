    "ART 003 is an intro art seminar for anyone who has ever been interested in blue, color in general, or even just modern art as a concept. I would recommend ART 003 to a student who found the course description to be delightfully strange or offbeat; a class unlike anything one expected to find. I would not recommend ART 003 to a student looking for a gut humanities credit.",
    "If you can get in take this class!!!!",
    "If you can get into this class, take it. Don't be afraid of the fact that it's in the Art department - it's not about drawing and painting with the color blue. It's super interdisciplinary, and every week is an exciting new challenge. You'll never know what to expect, you won't receive grades on assignments, and you sort of just have to go along with things, but you'll be glad you did. Professor Helfand is great. She is clearly very smart, is a very talented designer, and is able to push you toward bettering your own work and your own thinking. She's funny, helpful, and not afraid to be critical of your work when it's warranted. She doesn't sugarcoat things, but it's incredibly clear that she cares about her students and wants them to succeed. Don't be afraid to push back on things, and don't despair when it seems like nothing makes sense and you can't figure out what \"abstraction\" means. It will not only be OK, but it will be amazing. A perfect class to take your first semester at Yale.",
    "You won't see a course like this anywhere else, at Yale, or anywhere in the world. This is the type of course that is best taught at Yale, and especially by Professor Helfand. I didn't know what I was getting into when taking this course, and I think it's best not to have expectations because the concept of taking a class about a color is so abstract. We explored blue in any and all forms: pictures, video, animation, prose, collage, writing, you name it. We used a class blog where we'd have one weekly writing assignment (200-300 words) and a weekly visual assignment that could range from taking photos to making an animation. The best part about this class was visiting museums and just appreciating what we got to see. I don't want to give away where we went but I promise you it was incredible. I really enjoyed this class because it gave me the opportunity to be creative in a welcoming environment. My class became family and we all ended up creating art that showed intimate parts of our lives. The assignments were what you made them; I ended up putting a lot of time into them not because I was required to, but because I thoroughly enjoyed the process. If you are lucky enough to win the lottery and gain enrollment in this class, take it. You don't have to have any experience with art. It actually pains me that I won't be able to be in this class again, or take anything remotely similar to it.",
    "It's categorized as an ART class for a reason; if you're really not into art, you probably shouldn't take this class. It's very hands-on and lets you be creative! Although it can be redundant at times, it's definitely worth taking!",
    "I would recommend the class for someone that was interested in exploring their artistic interests. It's true that you \"don't have to be an artist\" to take the class, but you should expect to have a visual and written assignment every week. I expected more of a philosophical exploration of the color blue, but my expectations were wrong. The class was more about exploring our own creativity.",
    "Yes! This is a terrific class because you not only learn a lot about a bunch of different subjects, but also about how to think about art! Definitely take it if you're fortunate enough to get into the class!",
    "Blue is an exciting course that touches on art, biology, poetry and technology. Assignments are divided evenly into visual and written categories; each assignment presents unique challenges, whether determining camera placement for a video or responding to a quote on blue's rarity in nature. Class trips to various resources at Yale - the University Art Gallery, the Peabody Museum, the Arts Library and the Beinecke Library - were refreshing and revelatory. Guest speakers offered particular insight to other areas like game development, contemporary music and film-making. Professor Helfand makes this class a wonderfully complete experience. She gives feedback on every assignment, creating a classroom environment in which ideas are freely shared. Without a doubt, this is a must-take class.",
    "This class will drive you crazy, in the best way possible. It is a gift to Yale. You'll experience so many things and so much emotion and really see what Yale has to offer (museums, libraries, other experts besides Helfand). Take it.",
    "Blue is a study in color, in art, and most of all, in creation. I would recommend it to anyone (and everyone), no matter what his or her intended major is. It willwithout fail, it seemsmake you look at the world in a different way. The class fosters poetry (and, by extension, art) as a state of mind, as a way in which one can make sense of the world. So yeah. Take it. Be blue.",
    "It is a class that makes you think about many different ideas and impels you to reconsider your understanding of some that you take for granted. I would totally recommend this course to anyone at Yale, no matter what their main interests are. Curiosity and an open mind will make the class more enjoyable at the beginning, but they will also be developed throughout the course. Even people who do not take this class know about it and get excited about the assignments. Blue is great.",
    "Interdisciplinary but primarily philosophical and artistic examination of Blue. Many field trips to cool places on campus. Super knowledgable experts in various fields gave presentations.",
    "This is an amazing class! It is very explorative and will open your mind to new ideas and new ways of thinking about things! Perfect class for a freshman seminar.",
    "Dear future freshmen, When you come to Yale, you will quickly realize, if you haven't already, that being at a school like ours grants you access to privilege of a degree that most of the human race cannot even imagine. Our libraries hold millions of books and historical treasures, our course listing includes nearly 2,000 entries, our institution's coffers hold more than $25 billion, and our institution's name carries a significance basically unparalleled by the name of any other institution anywhere else in the world (especially but not exclusively Cambridge, MA). None of us can yet understand how significantly going to Yale will shape the course of our life, but suffice it to say that to be here is to be ridiculously, stupidly lucky. You will realize all of this quickly, but it will remain in the abstract for you until you take a class like Blue with an instructor like Professor Jessica Helfand. You can read the syllabus and course description for all the technical information, but my basic summary of the course is this: If you are able to get in, it is a course you must take if you want to know why people come to Yale.",
    "Blue is the class for you if you want to think in a new way. Even if you're not planning for an art major, you will gain so much from a supportive environment to bring your own passions into. In Blue you will write with no prompt, create with only a few brief criteria, and you will explore ways to think, research, and investigate by visiting Yale resources spanning from the ornithology collection to the Museum of Art's vast collection of blue photographs from the late 1800s. The class had assignments, a few more time consuming than others, but it's the best work you'll do for a class all semester and the work is what you want it to be."
