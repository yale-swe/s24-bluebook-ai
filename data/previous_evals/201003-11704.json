   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is not necessary to constantly profess that social and behavioral sciences are worthy of attention, and it is not necessary to do so by debasing other fields in public health.",
    "Gives a solid, general overview of SBS as a discipline. One critique is that some of the readings got to be pretty redundant.",
    "strengths: discussion section where we actually got to think about the issues. SBS is a nebulous topic, and sections helped to solidify it more.Lecture: I felt assaulted by too many slides and too much information crammed into 2 hours.Suggestion: break the class into 2, hour-long sessions. and get more participation from the class. The instructor was just forcing too much info into 2 hours and it turned a lot of people off from lecture.",
    "The course was good, informative, but most certainly a breadth not depth class.",
    "I didn't learn much from this course. The information was not pertinent to me.",
    "The strengths of the course were the readings and the lectures. Although there was a lot of reading, I feel like I now have a basic familiarity with the important researchers in the field and a knowledge of the fundamental concepts in social and behavioral determinants of health.Weaknesses would be the grading. The grading for the course seemed to be based on how well the readings could be synthesized into papers. At times the grading seemed to discourage lecture attendance and deep reading. Perhaps there could be more specific writing topics, as opposed to open-ended concept papers.",
    "I really liked the course overall. I feel like I learned a lot of things that I did not know before. The only problem was that I did not feel like going to class was important. Although I found it interesting and attended, many people did not because they felt there was no reason to go.",
    "Although the material was interesting, I did not enjoy lecture very much. I enjoyed learning the material through reading and discussing the articles in discussion instead.",
    "Useful but limited take home points since the subject contains so many disciplines.",
    "Good intro course for those who do not have social science background. Might consider making a more advanced course for those of us with this background; there were a lot of repetitive themes for anyone that was a sociology and psychology major",
    "I had taken courses like this before, so it was a lot of review. The strengths were doing the oped and media analysis, which made you think outside the box. The final paper, a grant proposal, however seemed unrelated to the course. An entire course could be taught on grant writing so the fact that we were expected to write one on our own seemed strange.",
    "The course does a good job of explaining the interdisciplinary nature of the subject matter. It also provides a lot of evidence as to why social and behavioral influences on health are so important. The structure of the class is very good. I like the discussion groups a lot!",
    "It's good but the work load needs to be eased.",
    "No contact at all with Dr. Ickovics, no incentive to follow lectures. But assignments allowed for exploration of your desired topic, which I appreciated.",
    "It might be helpful to have more reinforcement of the terms and theories discussed in the lecture. The lectures are two hours long with a lot of information, but there is method for reinforcing that this information is learned. It would probably be possible to participate in discussion and write the concept sheets and papers without attending the lecture at all.",
    "A good introduction to the topic from a variety of perspectives",
    "The lectures are good.However, instead of following a main stream to give a systematic illustration, they jump from topics to topics, giving us fragmented knowledge.I hope the course could cover some general concepts and basic research rational on which the research topics based, so that we could have a large view of how psychology and social sciences were integrated in public health.",
    "real life applicationlots of valuable learning",
    "The once-a-week lecture was totally pointless. Very few people paid attention, and each week's lecture seemed very repetitive. It's very hard to listen to someone talk for 2 hours. There needs to be much more student interaction, or at least a short 5-minute break after one hour. Truthfully I felt like there was no need to come to lecture at all, since we are not tested on the material.Nobody does the readings unless they're doing a concept sheet. Doing the reading and writing the concept sheets are a chore.I enjoyed the 3 major paper assignments and feel that they are the best part of the course. I also enjoyed the discussion section and I got MUCH more out of the discussion sections than I did out of the lecture.",
    "it's a lot of readings and writing for this class.if you are taking this class, try not to take another class with much writing ~",
    "I enjoyed the topics covered as well as the assigned readings. I did not, however, understand in all instances how the assignments reflected an understanding of the material. Though the assignments were for the most part interesting, I felt like you could complete them without understanding or (sometimes) even covering the material presented.",
    "Boraden your scope and thinking in the field of public health and human health",
    "Too much workload, but admit that some of them would be very helpful for my future.",
    "I enjoyed this course. Although somewhat redundant, I feel like I learned lessons that I will remember forever.",
    "The amount of reading required for this class is, frankly, ridiculous for students taking 5 graduate courses. I feel like it would be possible to convey the same messages and\/or teach similar topics without 100+ pages of reading in a week. Also, for a graduate level course it doesn't seem appropriate to having TFs being responsible for the majority of our grades. Someone whose main qualification is that they took the course the previous year does not seem like someone who should have as much power to determine our grades as they do. Otherwise, the material was interesting and the breadth of topics covered was good.",
    "Strengths: the op-ed paper, the media analysis paper, and the final paper were wonderful. I learned a lot during the process of writing them.Weaknesses: Lecture was exceedingly boring. Every class can be summed up in one slide! (\"Black people have worse health outcomes than white people.\") Also, two hours is a LONG time to sit and listen to a pretty dry lecture. At least give people a 5-minute stretch break at the hour mark!",
    "This course lacks coherence and clear expectations. The lectures are not tied to the assignments, and students are not accountable for mastering any clear set of information. Although this class discusses a series of interesting topics in Social and Behavioral Health, I left this class with only scattered information and the inability to use this information in a useful way.",
    "Overall, this class was a good overview of social and behavioral influences on health. I learned a great deal about the behavioral aspects of health and how they are crucial to the implentation of public health interventions. However, I felt that the lectures were randomly put together and a bit repetitive.",
    "I really liked some of the topics covered in class this semester, but I thought the structure of the class did not match the length of class time. 2 hours is a long time to go over slides on the same topic. I really liked the 2 classes we had guest lecturers because that changed things up and they were both excellent.",
    "This class is very good but be prepared to take on serious amounts of reading that cannot always be entirely completed. Your overall grade is based somewhat on how well you are able to participate in guided activities and group discussion or debate. Depending on your personality, you may love this or hate this component.",
    "This is an excellent SBS intro class. Every week consists of a different topic, and the reading assignments were intriguing and informative. The paper assignments were challenging and interesting; All of our assignments gave us enough flexibility to choose a topic of our interest, which I appreciated.",
    "This class was excellent. It was a good overview of SBS, and the material was very pertinent to all divisions. I always enjoyed hearing and sharing current events as well.There were some weeks when the reading was a bit overwhelming, and I felt I could have read the articles more thoroughly had they been fewer (or shorter). That said, it was interesting to read many different perspectives on each topic.",
    "The workload in this class was very heavy. Understandably, in graduate school there is more work, but I felt like the expectations for the concept sheet assignments were far-reaching. We were assigned 5 concept sheets throughout the semester, which were meant to touch upon all of the assigned readings for that week. However, there were usually approximately 7 articles ranging from 10-30 pages, all of which were meant to be synthesized in 2 pages double-spaced, which is virtually impossible. So instead, the two page concept sheets turned into 5 page concept sheets (single or 1.5 spaced, otherwise they'd be up to 7 pages), and you were penalized if you didn't include one of the articles, even though they werent always directly related to one another, and you could be formulating a powerful argument and a well-written paper nonetheless. These were very time consuming for such a small portion of the grade. Perhaps it would be better to either reduce the number of concept sheets, and increase the weight of each and the length, so as to accommodate so many readings, or slacken the requirements of including each article or reduce the weekly reading assignments.I liked the media analysis, the op-ed, and the final paper.The lectures weren't very useful, in the sense that they were example after example of how certain social factors are associated with health outcomes, rather than showing much theory. there was a theory lecture, which I thought should have been one of the first lectures, rather than in the middle of the semester. I would've liked the course to be less of a review of current concepts in SBS, and more of a practical course that teaches the theories behind SBS in public health research, some of the methodological challenges, and examples of how these are overcome in the field, who some of the major players are in this field, etc.",
    "I really liked the course, and despite having many years experience in practice I found a learned an enormous amount.The amount of material covered was huge, but the instructor did a great job of selecting out a variety of readings that provided different viewpoints on the core issues each week. The assessments were really helpful, encouraging students to think for themselves and express themselves, and the level of feedback from the assessments was excellent.I wasn't so convinced about the discussion groups. They were a good idea in theory, but with so many students who either had no practice experience, or only had very narrow experience, the discussions never really seemed to get down to the key contentious issues. I don't think the TA was doing anything wrong, I just think the format wasn't working. Maybe a group project would have worked better, though I hesitate to suggest that because group projects are so time consuming, and that's hard to reconcile with the huge span of material the course needed to cover.Overall, though, very positive indeed.",
    "This course was a broad introduction to public health from a social and behavioral perspective. While an introductory course such as this might be useful to students with absolutely no background in public health, it seemed very repetitive for someone with undergraduate coursework focusing on the social determinants of health. The course seemed to touch on too many topics in too little time. In particular, the lecture on theory contained too much information in too little detail and was more confusing than useful as a result. In addition, the assignments did not seem to correspond with the topics covered. For example, the course material did not seem to prepare students to design a social or behavioral intervention yet this was the main assignment. Also, for a course with very subjective assignments, I felt that it was problematic to have peer TAs. The assignment expectations were not clearly explained in lecture or in section and the TA's expectations for assignments did not seem to correspond to the assignment descriptions in the syllabus.",
    "Strengths: Great readings and I really enjoyed the discussion sectionsWeaknesses: We received very little feedback from the primary instructor because our teaching assisstants performed all of the grading for our assignments including our final paper.",
    "I enjoyed the course layout, such as the concept sheets, they definitely helped me with understand the topics covered. I also enjoyed the discussion sections.",
    "I enjoyed all the topics we covered and the resulting conversations. I thought they were thought provoking and important issues that need to be addressed. Sometimes the lectures were really long, but I'd rather go once a week to a two hour lecture than twice a week.",
    "Course is interesting in principle. Topics are relevant, but the class itself is way too ambitious to cover everything under the sun, that I felt like I really didn't learn anything practical or substantial. I could have learned more from just reading the NYTimes Health section.The lectures were not useful or informative.Sections were so excruciatingly painful to sit through - hearing people with no real practical experience, talk about how their lofty policy ideas would work because of anecdotes from relatives, etc.",
    "needs updating!",
    "The lectures should be more focused.",
    "Jeannette is phenomenal! The readings were interesting and she is so passionate about her work that you can't help but be engaged. Assignments were thoughtful and practical.",
    "The content is interesting, but too much assignment.",
    "The course is good at stimulating discussion and collaboration among peers. It feels a lot like a teach it yourself kind of course, The concept sheets, papers, and readings take a long of time but get easier as you start to establish a writing style.",
    "Interesting topics and readings.",
    "Decent lectures, excellent TA (Jeremy Steglitz), interesting readings and assignments, workload a bit too great",
    "i loved this course.",
    "Great lectures and section topics. Also, a variety of assignments kept it interesting",
    "The course is a great overview of social and behavioral influences on health which incorporates a lot of great weekly scientific articles to help introduce the material.",
    "SBS is a great class. However, I think the workload needs to be reduced. The class should change to \"qualitative learning\" rather than \"quanitative learning\". The homework assignments are extremely time consuming and distressing.",
    "I think the course material\/topic is interesting, but the way it was taught was a disappointment. Going to lecture was fairly useless. I think the delivery really weakened the content. Jeanette seems very passionate about her work, but isn't a very good lecturer. I felt she was delivering an acceptance speech every time she spoke. The two best classes were the two guest lecturers we had.I think if there was more theory behind SBS taught, that would strengthen the course. The week of theory I thought was interesting, but it was taught half way through the semester. I think if you started with theory and used it as a foundation to teach the other concepts the material would be more useful and the structure would be easier to follow. As it is today, it is more of a hodgepodge of concepts with no real flow one week to the next.",
    "I thought that the structure of the course was very well designed-- all the assignments, papers, etc. integrated course material well. While it is obvious that the instructor has perfected this design over time, her lack of updated material and less than thorough knowledge of each section of material really made the course frustrating. The lectures were jam-packed with information. At the end of each lecture, I was left confused as to how it all connected.",
    "Great introduction to area that I was not particularly interested in coming in. However, coming in from a pure science background, the amount of reading and writing required was particularly high.",
    "The course material didn't delve as deeply into these issues as it could have. The professor had an engaging lecture style, but I felt like every week could have been distilled into a couple sentences, which made lectures and discussion sections drag on.",
    "Overall its a good course, though intense in terms of homework(concept sheets). But the environment was always made very conducive for learning. Interesting course overall.",
    "strengths: material is interestingweaknesses: professor ickovics manner of speaking is difficult to listen to for two hours (feels like she is campaigning). would recommend that she introduces the 'theory' aspect first. the content gets repetitive as well. would also suggest that the subsections emphasize the methodology of the studies we read."

Even for concept sheets, there are ways to do them without reading much. you're allowing people to get away without learning about the social\/behavioral side to health...they need to know it; it's important, and this class lets that knowledge slip through the class.

Probably my biggest criticism is that she tends to go on 'soapboxes' and talk about her personal research or opinions on subjects, but otherwise everything was fine.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Jeannette's slides could be overhauled. Could someone give her a workshop on using visual aids effectively? Way too many words and details. Reading off of very dense slides is not a good way to teach. Fewer words, more pictures, and less reading off the slides = way more dynamic and engaging.",

    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics had good support for interesting statistics and great examples in her slides. However, I felt that I didn't learn as much as I would have liked from the lectures. On the other hand, the readings for class were extremely interesting and I enjoyed writing the concept sheets, media analysis, and the op ed. I did not enjoy writing the grant proposal as much because I think we didn't have enough guidance in writing it. An overview or example in lecture would have been nice so we knew how to go about starting one. I also would have liked more of Dr. Ickovics feedback on papers and concept sheets since the majority of the assignments were graded and reviewed by the teaching fellows.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is very passionate about her work and it definitely shows in this class. Although I think she tried to break up the class a bit by discussing relevant news articles at the beginning, I think doing a few different things besides just lecturing with slides would have helped the two hours go by a bit faster.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Jeannette is an exciting and thought provoking lecturer. She loves to engage students by bringing in current events and leading an open discussion at the beginning of each lecture. She genuinely cares about students and their success in the class based on the knowledge and experience that they take from away it.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is a great lecturer. It is evident that she spends a lot of time preparing for her course and that she cares greatly about her students' feedbacks. She is also very engaging in class, and encourages students to ask questions. I appreciate her trying to learn everyone's names despite the class being so big. I also think it's great that we go over current events that pertain to what we are learning in class. I strongly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in SBS.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She is great. Her passion for the subject matter is contagious.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Jeanette shows an obvious enthusiasm for teaching and for the subject material. She's a good lecturer, and an enthusiastic mentor who is always available to help with questions.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0I felt Jeannette put a lot of herself into the course and her enthusiasm and passion illuminated every class. Her slides were well organised, though it would have been helpful if they were always ready the night before - students with computers were able to flick backwards to review slides that were passed over quickly in class, but the rest of us couldn't and I occasionally lost the thread a little.Once or twice passion seemed to overtake reason, and there were some assertions made on the basis of limited evidence. I was not particularly convinced by the Rudd Center way of presenting evidence, for example. It just seems imperative to me to make sure behavioral and social influences are treated as rigorously and scientifically as any other factors in health, otherwise some important work gets undermined.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0She was great in class discussion and I enjoyed learning from her. However, I didn't appreciate that she was not involved in the grading or review of our assignments which included 5 short concept papers, 2 longer papers and a final 20 page paper. All of this was done by the teaching fellow.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0I really enjoyed Dr. Ickovics lecture style. Although, I think with such a big class it was hard to get people to participate all the time. I liked having guest speakers and I liked the variety of assignments.I think it would have been nice to have the option of doing more than 5 concept sheets and more deadlines for the final paper (like a deadline for draft sometime in November).",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics is very impassioned in her work and obviously extremely experienced. I like how she tries to promote class participation, but the atmosphere of the large class can be intimidating and I found it much easier to talk in the discussion groups.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Sincere person, very knowledgeable, but her lifetime of experience and wisdom didn't really come out in lecture. I kept wanting to hear more about her actual advice about how to tackle problems rather than hearing just general theories\/principles. Her lecture style is sometimes overly dramatic and easy to tune out.",

    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics cares very much about her students and is very sensitive to comments and suggestions. She is also a very articulate and dynamic lecturer. The lectures are sometimes a little long and lose focus. The guest lecturers throughout the semester were all very interesting and refreshing.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Helpful instructor, didn't see her as often as I thought I would.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Great professor. Needs to respond to e-mails in a more timely manner. Sometimes doesn't respond to e-mails, and when she does it is terse and insufficient.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Excellent",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Professor Ickovics is a great lecturer who really likes SBS, which makes for a great class",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Ickovics is a great lecturer. She like to keep everyone engaged in class and discussions by brining up real world examples which come up in the news weekly.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Great instructor. Very helpful and decicated. Best professor I had this term.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0See above notes...not a strong lecturer. I didn't get anything out of her course. It would be interesting to take this course with another lecturer and compare. I am actually shocked she has been allowed to teach the course this long, because the consistent message I have heard from other students is she is not a great professor.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr. Ickovics seems like she would be a professor better suited for smaller course sizes. She seemed more amiable and engaged in what she was talking about when sitting in TA sections. During lectures, it felt as if she were just reciting a well-rehearsed lectured once again-- with no real investment in the material, as evidenced by the several occurrences when she had to refer to TAs to clarify questions about recent studies, etc.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Jeannette was great in lecture and seemed genuinely excited about her subject areas in chats and discussion sections.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Prof. Ickovics really made an effort to get to know students and engage with everybody, despite the fact that it was a large lecture. She also had an engaging lecture style.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0Dr Ickovics is a great instructor, has amazing teaching skills and makes learning very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Jeannette R Ickovics \u00a0professor ickovics manner of speaking is difficult to listen to for two hours (feels like she is campaigning). would recommend that she introduces the 'theory' aspect first. the content gets repetitive as well. would also suggest that the subsections emphasize the methodology of the studies we read."

    "My discussion group TA was excellent. She was well prepared, keen, and a fair grader of written assignments.",
    "Felicity was great - she knew the material inside and out and was an excellent facilitator of discussion.",
    "Lindsey was excellent! Sometimes a bit harsh as a grader, but appreciated her attention to detail and dedication to the course! She'll make a great PhD student!As for consistency among TA's: some let their sections turn in assignments on Thursdays instead of Tuesdays or extended deadlines for assignments when other sections did not have that luxury. That's also not ok for grad school. keep expectations consistent!",
    "TAs were good. Ability to facilitating discussion should be examined better prior to selection.",
    "I felt that the course was unfair because it was the TAs that were grading all of our assignments. I felt that my TA, Lindsey Smith, graded harder than the other TAs.",
    "My TA for the course was Felicity Lenes. She was an outstanding TA. She had an incredible knowledge of the subject area. She definitely did not have any weaknesses.",
    "Jeremy was a great TA. He was always there to help with lots of feedback and he made section very interesting.",
    "Our TA was very knowledge in this subject and led the discussions very well each week. She was very helpful in answering questions outside of the classroom and with providing comments for our final paper.",
    "Emily: Led the discussion well,and graded homework carefully. Problem is that she couldn't attend the class till the end often, which may be a disadvantage to lead the discussion session relavent to the class topic. Also need to be more careful not to loss students' homework.",
    "Jeremy Steglitz; best TA i've ever had. Extremely engaged, energetic, and SO positive. Was very comfortable with talking in front of class, was well organized, and always made everyone feel very welcome",
    "My TA was great! She was well prepared for class, had engaging conversation and gave us plenty of feedback on our assignments. She also always available for questions.",
    "Felicity was fantastic. She made discussion very interesting, thought provoking, and facilitated a comfortable environment. Her criticism was always constructive and so positive.",
    "My TA was great.",
    "Jeremy-- did an EXCEPTIONAL job. Gave meaningful feedback, and led meaningful discussions. Very impressive.",
    "Emily Buchholz. Emily was always helpful and available to answer any questions. Discussion sessions were interesting, though might have benefited from just a little more structure or learning objectives.",
    "Lindsey P. Smith is considerate. She gives me lots of help and encouragement.",
    "very helpful and organized I think he's the best Neel",
    "Jeremy Steglitz was a great TA. He was intelligent and engaging; he asked great thought-provoking questions, and was always willing to offer his help when needed. I learned more from the discussion sections than I did from lecture. He was very knowledgeable and because of him, the discussion sections were interesting, illuminating, and fun.",
    "TA did not run it well.But he's nice outside of class.",
    "My TA (Lindsey Smith) was very helpful, and she did a great job leading weekly discussion sections. She provided pretty good feedback on assignments, and overall I enjoyed working with her.",
    "Felicity Lenes is one of the best TA's I have ever had in my entire life, knowledgeable, approachable, and bring up interesting discussions to allow us to learn more beyond the class materials",
    "My TA was Jeremy, and he was a great TA. As a TA, he was almost always prepared, carefully listened to participants of each session, willing to be help when we were struggling with discussing hard issues, and smoothly conducted meetings. However, I was not able to get his grading criteria sometimes, and why TAs primarily do the grading job instead of the professor.",
    "Felicity Lenes was a great TA. She was very flexible and seemingly very knowledgable.",
    "Neel Butala - Neel was a nice guy and kept conversation going well in our section. He gave good feedback on concept sheets\/papers.",
    "Neel Butala is, without a doubt, the absolute worst TA I have ever had the misfortune of meeting during my five wonderful years at Yale (four undergrad, one MPH). Class after class, he proved completely incapable of a) sparking debate, b) guiding a discussion in a certain direction, c) responding to completely off-topic or plain wrong comments, and d) supporting his students at all. Neel literally started every section with \"So... what'd you guys think about the readings this week?\" EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. He responded to every single comment with either \"Right. So... what do you guys think about that?\" THIS IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO FACILITATE A DISCUSSION. This led to completely off-topic comments and inane statements that went unchecked or unchallenged. Legitimately interesting topics went undiscussed. Section was brutal and infuriating. I wanted to bang my head against the wall every single section because of Neel's complete inability to lead a discussion. I dreaded this section every single week. This is SUCH a shame because I heard from many people that some of the other sections were fabulous and really expertly facilitated. Jeremy Steglitz in particular got rave reviews from everyone I talked to! I'm jealous, and actually quite frustrated that I missed out on the opportunity for a stimulating and engaging conversation. I'm almost in tears as I write this because this was such an injustice that the 15 of us had to sit through such a teeth-pulling, nails-on-a-chalkboard experience every week when our peers had the pleasure of an engaging discussion about important topics. Please do not ever let Neel TA for another class. I will personally email any professor that decides to take him on as a TA to explain exactly why that would be a colossal mistake.",
    "Emily Bucholtz was a fabulous TA. I have nothing but good things to say about her.",
    "My TA was Neel. I think that he was a good teaching assistant. He was very knowledgeable in discussion. However, I think that our discussions could have been organized better with questions and concepts to think about beforehand so that we could prepare notes. Overall, I liked the discussion class and he was a fair grader. He also was very willing to help and discuss questions regarding any assignment.",
    "Jeremy Steglitz was a phenomenal teaching fellow. Jeremy was very interested by the material and did a great job trying to tie each week's topic to our discussion section. He encouraged everyone to participate, but didn't force anyone to speak who did not feel comfortable. Our section was very open and we had some interesting conversations due to Jeremy's preparation and guidance. Jeremy also provided positive and constructive comments on graded assignments. He was very accessible via email to discuss assignments, which helped greatly especially on the last paper.",
    "I think that the majority of one's experience in this class is dependent on your TA. Once a week during lecture time the class meets in a discussion group. Sometimes the nature of the discussion is politically or emotionally sensitive. I was lucky to have a wonderful TA who always kept us excited about the discussion topics by invoking responses and opinions from us in creative ways.",
    "Lindsey Smith was an excellent TA. She has an incredible amount of knowledge, and is very good at leading discussions and making sure that everyone participates.",
    "Lindsey Smith was a great TA. She was always prepared and knew the articles thoroughly. She successfully engaged everyone in discussion and time usually went by quickly. My favorite discussion sessions were the debate on healthcare vs. primary prevention and the presentations on obesity prevention strategies.",
    "Emily was phenomenal!!!!!",
    "The TA's had a lot of work for this course, and I thought they did an excellent job.",
    "Lindsey Smith was a great TA, who know the material very well and made a great discuss leader.",
    "Emily BucholzBest marker I've ever had, by a long way. Emily gave helpful, detailed and encouraging feedback on every assessment, and I feel my analytic and writing ability has really progressed as a result. Everything came back very promptly, which was extremely helpful.I've mentioned earlier that I think the discussion group format needs some rethinking, but I think Emily did the best she could.",
    "Lindsey Smith was was great at leading discussion and created an atmosphere that was conducive to good discussion and student participation. She also provided useful feedback and guidance for term papers. An area where she could improve is in more fully explaining assignment expectations and grading criteria. While she provided comments on papers, she did not give an explanation of her grading criteria, which is important to include when assessing subjective work.",
    "Jeremy S. was an absolutely incredible teaching fellow-he was wonderfully engaged in discussion and always willing to work with students if they had questions or assignments. He definitely went above and beyond his role and brought very interesting ideas to our group discussions.",
    "My TA was Jeremy. He was an amazing TA. Very knowledgeable and engaged in the discussion groups. Our class activities were very well thought out and he was always prepared. Outside of class he was very accessible by e-mail, if we had questions.",
    "Felicity Lenes. Felicity is an excellent TA and very well spoken. She is very good at leading discussion groups, keeping the topics interesting, and helping everyone to get involved. She is also a very thoughtful grader and read each paper with care. I found her constructive criticism to be very helpful as I develop my scientific writingskills.",
    "While Neel Butala was kind and intelligent, section was an absolute failure week after week. I have never been in a more underwhelming 90-minute section before. Neel started each discussion with: \"So... what did you guys think of lecture?\" There was always uncomfortable silence. He never came in with specific questions that worked off a theme or really got us thinking. Instead, he let people talk about whatever they wanted (which was always anecdotal or off-topic) and he never engaged with people's comments. He could have challenged people to further explain their positions or linked people's comments to themes in the class, so that at least other people could gain some broad understanding of social\/behavioral issues. But instead, ideas were raised and dropped. Questions were posed (and poorly so... thus the frequent, persistent silence) and no one felt engaged enough to really participate! It was a 90-minute weekly reminder of how forced conversation about topics that are not cohesive or clear is an awful way to spend one's time.",
    "Jeremy- Very thoughtful and articulate though at times instead of leading and facilitating section discussions, he got a little caught up speaking his own opinion. Grading of assignments was timely and fair, though feedback was not very detailed.",
    "Ms Felicity Lenes is a very good TA",
    "Neel Butala is good at stimulating discussion and offering his viewpoint on the issues discussed.",
    "Neel Butala- Helpful TA, answered questions well. Spent a lot of time with our class and was patient.",
    "The discussion group sometimes seems redundant and unnecessary.",
    "Jeremy Steglitz was a fantastic TA -- prepared, intelligent, engaging, supportive, dedicated.",
    "Excellent",
    "Neel Butala was an ok TA. He was interested in the topic, but this rarely came out in section. I also think he could have better facilitated the discussion by participating more.",
    "Emily was a great TA who helped to clarify topics discussed in class and helped to keep the sections fresh with new news topics.",
    "Emily Bucholz. Great TA. Very dedicated, nice, competent, helpful! Enjoyed being in Emily's discussion group.",
    "I really liked my TA, but not the design of the section.",
    "Emily was great!",
    "Lindsey is incredibly astute. She was great at keeping the conversation going in an engaging and intellectual manner (as opposed to allowing the discussion to move into tangents). Her grading seemed much tougher from that of other TAs.",
    "My TA was excellent in leading discussion, especially in the trial 90 minute section which inevitably lead to some awkward silences.",
    "the weekly discussion sessions are not very helpful",
    "My TA was Felicity Lenes-She is an amazing TA, has great dept of knowledge about the course. She was always very helpful and responded very quickly to the queries. She did a great job!!",
    "Emily Bucholz was great!! would recommend!"

    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it to other students, especially those not in the SBS concentration who want an introduction to the issues covered.",
    "great information, but no incentive to go to class.It's a lot of work.If you're truly interested in SBS, take it. Otherwise, no.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course - it covers a wide range of information and the professor allows you to tailor all the projects to your specific interests.",
    "I would like to recommend that this class not be required as one of the core classes.",
    "This course was a great introduction and survey course to SBS. I would recommend this course to everyone. Although this course does requires a lot of work, the knowledge that I have learned in this course is extremely valuable and will be relevant to other courses.",
    "A broad overview of behavioral science and public health. Very interesting course.",
    "Much workload, various assignments to deal with. but very useful",
    "Good overview and introduction to social science",
    "Yes. Among the required core courses this one certainly stands out. Dr. Ickovics is a lively presence and provides a wide-ranging overview of several important topics on the subject.",
    "It was a good course-however a lot more work than others. It was also repetitive to me in a lot of ways, and would've chosen something a little different.",
    "I would recommend this course to students of all disciplines because it connects so many different elements and puts into perspective the realities of health.",
    "It basically talks about anything that's not biological but still a determinant for public health outcomes.",
    "Not the greatest course, but you can get out what you put in. Ability to focus on topic(s) of your choosing. If you're hard-science minded, the content may not do it for you.",
    "I would recommend this class because it provides an essential background to studying public health and because it enables more creativity and critical thinking than the other first-semester courses.",
    "Really enjoyed the course and would recommend it to anyone interested in social and behavioral influences on disease",
    "Since the informationof this course is scattered, I do not recommend it to other students unless they have very clear concepts on psychology and other social sciences, and have the passion to go into this field.",
    "I would not recommend it. I learned very little from this class. I enjoyed the assignments and discussion, but not the lecture.",
    "it's much reading and writing for this class.you dont have to go to lectures, just focus on your writing.",
    "This course was interesting and engaging. It was charged with opinion at times, but the perspectives presented were interesting and diverse.",
    "Very interesting course, works your brain alot and applicable to life",
    "I would have not taken the course unless it was one of my requirements. Some assignments are worth doing them. But overall, the course was painful and there were few gained.",
    "The course was a quick look at the social and behavioral factors that influence health. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "This class is a significant amount of reading and writing. Some weeks I think we had more than 100+ pages of reading, and had to write 'concept sheets' to synthesize it. As a non-SBS student, the subject matter wasn't always that useful for me, but most of the topics were interesting.",
    "No. I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "This course was an overview of the social and behavioral influences on health that sought to integrate various fields of research to provide a deeper understanding of how certain outcomes become an issue and how we can attempt to solve them. I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Unless you are in the SBS concentration, I would not necessarily recommend this course to other students. Although it does give you a brief knowledge on many topics in this area of study, I personally didn't like the structure of the class and probably would have taken the other option to fulfill my SBS requirements. My discussion section is what saved me from really not liking the course, since I looked forward to that every week due to the people in it and the great effort by the teaching fellow.",
    "I would recommend this class because it gives you a great opportunity to get to know other fellow classmates and Jeannette's lectures are like a breath of fresh air compared to some other classes that you may take.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in taking an SBS course. Some people may not like the course because the assignments are very open ended, but for those who can take advantage of this open-endedness, I think it's a terrific course to take!",
    "I would highly recommend this class for everyone who wants an overview of current topics in SBS.",
    "I'd say avoid it if you can, especially if you have a heavy work load already that semester.",
    "This is a comprehensive introduction to a very broad topic, delivered with passion and enthusiasm. Students will learn a lot about the course material but they will also learn a lot about themselves. Don't miss it!",
    "The reading is heavy and important for discussion group, so at least look at everything before class. I would suggest getting the concept sheets done towards the first half of the semester because the writing assignments pile up towards the end.",
    "Great! So interesting and so practical!",
    "Interesting, but too much work. And not very flexible,",
    "Yes, only because it is required. This class do able compared to other SBS required courses. Stick with this course and you won't go wrong.",
    "I fully endorse this class...If i were Robert Ebert or Gene Siskel Id give the class two thumbs up!",
    "Good overview for any ph student",
    "This course could be considered like a survey class which you read lots of different scientific articles of the subject weekly. The final paper is a great learning experience to helping one think about designing a study and all the research and considerations that go into the final proposal.",
    "Great professor. Interesting topics. Outrageous workload which impacts the quality of learning.",
    "Unlike others I spoke to, I didn't mind the assignments and thought they were worthwhile (writing a NIH grant, concept sheets, op-eds). The material was fairly obvious, if you possess an iota of common sense and have read the news, the concepts weren't that novel. I thought the actual class time was a waste. I can't compare to other profs or classes, but if you could find a required SBS class that sounded somewhat interesting, I would recommend taking it over this class.",
    "Aside from the assignments I turned in, I can't really say I got much out of the course.",
    "There is a lot of reading, writing, and discussion material. Someone from a science background may have to expend more effort in the class. Good introduction to SBS",
    "The amount of work required for this course wasn't worth it for what I got out of it--I didn't feel like I learned very much, but we had to write reading responses for about half the classes, in addition to writing other random papers. I wish that the assignments had objectives that were moreclearly linked to the course, rather than seeming like busy work.",
    "This course is about social and behavioral influences on health, not only at an individual level but also at a population level.Its an overall good course with a great instructor and I would recommend this course to the fellow student.",
    "would notrecommend. extremely repetitive."
