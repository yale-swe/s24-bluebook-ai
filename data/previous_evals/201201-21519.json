    "Somewhat of a revision and reinforcement of 120",
    "Fantastic, fantastic course, especially if you get Madame Koundi. She is very perceptive to how her students are feeling about the material and will immediately explain in easier French (or in English) if she senses that people are lost. Exceedingly patient, she makes the class infinitely more manageable. I was originally placed into another professor's section but switched specially so that I could be in hers, and I am so glad that I did. Great professor- you end the year with much, much greater fluency in speaking.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to a fellow student. Your french improves greatly! Furthermore you do gain an appreciation for the language.",
    "Too much mindless work, but it's fun to start reading real books.",
    "Madama Koundi was a phenomenal teacher. She was encouraging but firm when we needed it. I believe everyone learned so much from the class"
