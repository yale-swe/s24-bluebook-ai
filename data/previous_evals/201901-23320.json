The feedback on our assignments was always speedy and very thorough. Weaknesses: The discussion sections were very helpful, but I think it would have been nice if we had more time for discussion\/questions during the lectures as well.",
    "There is a lot of material covered, which isn't a bad thing. However, Ben is not an organized speaker or presenter. So a lot of time was spent untangling threads that didn't need to be tangled in the first place. He doesn't seem to realize that not everyone thinks like him."
