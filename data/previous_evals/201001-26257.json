    "I really liked the content of the course. Very timely. Interesting to view public health problems using economics principles.Might be better if the first class was devoted to the way to analyze these problems using economics and policy. Subsequent classes could then be devoted to using that framework to examine each problem.",
    "Poorly taught, disorganized. Too bad, because the potential was so great!",
    "Overall, the topic of this course is very interesting; however, it is poorly executed. There is a lack of organization and planning, which really shows during class discussions.",
    "this course was terrible. It had so much potential, but it was simply too large and was overwhelmed by undergrad econ majors. The topics were interesting, but the professor appeared intimidated or overwhelmed by the size of the class and didn't always get her point across. I wish it had been the small seminar it was meant to be - the professor obviously has a lot to share, and many students had interesting viewpoints and contributions, but they got lost in the set-up and I sadly learned very little in this class.",
    "I was really captured by the concept behind this course. It is truly unique for the health policy division and fills a gap in the Yale curriculum. I love behavioral economics and have had trouble finding behavioral econ courses at Yale. I enjoyed spending two weeks each on four different addictions. While I was initially upset about losing two (three) classes to student presentations, they turned out to be really interesting and informative. I learned a lot from my fellow students.My biggest complaint was class size. The class was WAY TOO BIG. I don't think that Prof. Sindelar realized that she could turn away Senior Econ majors. They preregister, but she didn't have to accept all of them. This class should be no larger than 20. It was hard to have meaningful discussion. With 26 students, the class was this weird mix of a lecture and discussion.Jody seeemed somewhat certain of how she wanted to run classes. It was unclear whether she wanted it to be a lecture or a discussion-based seminar. She should be more clear from the outset of each class how she wants to run it. I think it was useful for her to spend 5-10 minutes framing the discussion\/debate withsome background\/opening thoughts, but the rest of the class should be discussion and debate. My favorite class was the one where we debated the minimum legal drinking age. People participated and were engaged.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. It was a little difficult to have a discussion style class because of the class size.",
    "This was an excellent course.",
    "Overall the topics were interesting. I wished we would have talked more about concrete economic principles. It would have been a good idea to structure the class as 1\/2 concrete lectures, 1\/2 discussion. Student presentations were not a good idea for a course that large. Three classes of presentations was a bit much.",
    "I think that it would have been really helpful to change the format of the class. For example, the first hour could be more of a lecture\/powerpoint giving an overview of the topic and the 2nd hour be more of a discussion. That way everyone would be on the same page when it comes to the discussion.",
    "Excellent. Very interesting and relevant. Readings were very good. Discussion always interesting."

    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Jody is excellent. Very knowledgable. Great to learn from a leader in the field.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Disorganized, unsure of herself. She also put students down in class.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0The instructor for this class is very knowledgeable of the topic; however, the weekly classes themselves were very unorganized. It often times felt like the professor did not prepare very well for the class and let the discuss progress with no direction. If the instructor can somehow better structure the class discussion, it would make for a much more interesting course.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Her strengths - she knows what she's talking about, has done some really interesting work, and enjoys her subject. Her weaknesses - totally scattered, unable to put her foot down and make decisions (about limiting the size of the class, about telling certain individuals to let others speak).",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Jody is a really knowledgable professor. She cares a lot about the topic and her students. She seemed a little scattered\/disorganized at the beginning of some classes, but that could just be her style of speaking. I was really excited to take a behavioral econ class at Yale. Her diverse research experiences greatly enhanced the course.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Dr. Sindelar is an excellent instructor and has passion for the course material.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0I thought Jody was an excellent professor.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Jody was very warm and receptive to students, but a bit difficult to follow at times during lecture.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Jody was excellent. Incredibly knowledgeable and helpful."

    "Good class. Would recommend, especially for people interested in health policy.",
    "I was a bit disappointed with this class. I think it has a lot of potential but needs more work in terms of organizing the structure of it. The assignments were fine, and our final project was interesting. But, if the instructor can work on fine-tuning class discussions and also minimizing undergraduate students, it would improve the quality of the course tremendously.",
    "if it's a tiny group, the class would probably be fine. If there's more than about 10 students in it, stay away. The professor cannot handle a class, but the subject's interesting.",
    "I would recommend it if you like behavioral economics and only if the course is capped at 20.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "Overall the course dealt with interesting topics."
