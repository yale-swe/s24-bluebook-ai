   "comments": [
    "The class is very good because it is flexible in terms of the workload and it allows you to really develop a practical understanding of the ideas you learn in lecture. The class has few weaknesses, maybe one is the timing of the paper at the end makes it hard to write pieces throughout the semester, especially if you don't have data yet.",
    "great class",
    "Strengths: flexibility. The course is basically hands-off for the whole semester. You write a proposal at the beginning and then don't really have an assignment until reading week. Weaknesses: time-intensiveness. The 10-hour\/week commitment is a lot, especially when you're prepping your paper and presentation at the end.",
    "The strengths included fast access to talking with professors about research and connecting biology with computational research to improve the pace. It could be improved by allowing collection of more biological data to compare with the computational modeling.",
    "This course is well-designed to facilitate hands-on student learning in the lab. It also affords students the opportunity to understand the research process of proposing a project, conducting wet-lab research, writing a report, and presenting the findings."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend working in a lab to any student and also this course because it allows you to really develop as a scientist and a thinker.",
    "yes! great way to get an MBB elective while doing research",
    "I would be hesitant to recommend this course. There are not many assignments and this is a great way to get involved in research while also getting a credit, but it is a lot more work than 1 credit gives. Prepping the final paper and presentation is also a lot of work to have to juggle in reading period\/finals period.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they have prior research experience either through interning, volunteering, or working at a lab. Much of this work requires exemplifying skills to professors in order to help the project.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student that wishes to pursue scientific research as it affords a fairly accurate research experience."
