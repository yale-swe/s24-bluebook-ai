   "comments": [
    "Take this course. As I said above, you will know Old English by the end of it, plain and simple.",
    "If it's looking like there are going to be 30+ students, I might not sign up. It's hard to stay engaged when you only contribute one or two lines to the translation per lecture. That being said, it was a great class. You come away with a lot of knowledge about the culture and language of the Anglo-Saxons.",
    "If you're legitimately interested in the idea of studying Old English, take it. If you're looking for a relatively easy pre-1800 credit, don't.",
    "It is relatively painless, fun, and extremely interesting. It gives you a unique historical perspective on both English literature and language, and Professor Frank is charming, fair, and very agreeable. Some of the quizzes annoyed people, but with minimal studying and preparation the course is pretty easy but still very valuable.",
    "If you want a dose of pure awesome punctuated by the terror of working with a dead language, you should most definitely take this course. If you don't, then my condolences.",
    "The beginning of the class is definitely heavy in drudgery-- boring translations, and you don't really feel like you're getting much out of them. It doesn't get more fun until after the midterm, when you get to read Beowulf and work on a fun presentation of your choice. All you do most of the time is translate some passages for homework, and then come to class and check them. THAT'S IT. As for the exams and quizzes, be prepared to spend quite some time MEMORIZING all the pieces. Yup, that's right. MEMORIZING THEM. Also, I wish that I had a better idea of what was going to be on the quizzes. For instance, we were supposedly not responsible for knowing any vocabulary, but then certain vocabulary words were expected to have been internalized through the translations--unfortunately, these didn't turn out to be the words that I actually internalized! I also studied very hard for the ID quiz, pulling a lot of IDs from the Anglo-Saxons book, but absolutely none of the IDs I had prepared showed up on the quiz. These quizzes were SO SO random! This also applies to the ID section of the final exam. However, the curve is really generous. The class shouldn't be too bad if you go in knowing what to expect.",
    "I would recommend this class, although it's not for everyone. You're not expected to learn or memorize Old English grammar; instead, for most classes you are assigned a passage of prose or poetry to read in Old English and translate into Modern English. In class, you go over the translation and talk in brief about the given passage's historical and\/or literary significance. The final few classes were devoted to Beowulf, which we read in Modern English, except for short passages that were in Old English.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in Old English or the Anglo-Saxons or learning old languages or learning new things about the English language or all of these things, you should take the course!",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this course if you have any interest in early Medieval history, language, or literature! It's a phenomenal course, and I was sad to see it end.",
    "Old English is a lot of fun and a low-key way to be introduced to some classic Old English literature in the original language. Sadly you read Beowulf in translation for time purposes, but you still learn a lot. The exams are a little weird and test you on material you're expected to know but haven't actually gone over in class, and you essentially have to memorize the Old English texts in order to do well on the translation portions of the exam. You get to do a presentation on a topic of your choice, which is pretty fun.Overall the workload is not terribly high and it's not all that difficult. Professor Frank is really passionate about the material, and though the logistics of the course need a little ironing out, Old English is so cool that you'll want to put the work in.",
    "I urge all of you to take Old English with Professor Frank. She is awesome and super-nice, and the language and literature of pre-Conquest England is fascinating. This course is perfect for people interested in the Anglo-Saxons, Beowulf, Tolkien, linguistics, the early medieval period, or the genesis of vernacular Englishliterature.",
    "I would summarize it by saying it is a good class for someone who enjoys linguistics and languages, and wants a relaxed, fun class atmosphere.",
    "English 150 is an introduction to the language and literature of Anglo-Saxon England. I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of language, in the roots of the English literary tradition, or in any aspect of Medieval history. It's not for everyone, but Professor Frank makes it easily accessible to those willing to think of Old English as fun. I did, and do, and hope to pursue the subject further after this course.",
    "Old English is a great class to take if you have any interest in linguistics, history, or a love of English literature. Or if you just really want to take an unusual and fun course. It takes some work, and it is structured somewhat like a language class, but it is definitely worth it. I would highly recommend it.",
    "It has very little homework, and is very rewarding. I recommend it entirely.",
    "Anyone who likes languages, wants a safe place to make LOTR jokes, and is not easily frustrated by grammar (or has a background in German, heheheh) will probably get a kick out of it. Roberts Frank is great, the workload is pretty light, and I feel like we're pretty self-selecting, so it's usually a good crowd as well.",
    "Look, for a Pre-1800 course when you are in a pinch, it has a lot of advantages. The early literature you translate is mostly biblical or stories of saint martyrdoms, which I found boring, but The Wanderer and Beowulf are obviously really exciting to be able to go through in the original.",
    "Take it. It's a fun course, and Professor Frank is a lovely instructor.",
    "Old English is the perfect course to take if you are an English major who would like a break from the same old routine of reading lots of literature and writing a lot of critical essays. Professor Frank is an absolute delight. The course would be worth it for her alone, but there are plenty of other reasons to take the course. The class was much bigger than an ideal size this semester, but I\u0092m still very glad I took this course. In sum, this course is: interesting, off the beaten path, a very reasonable work load, no papers, and one of the most memorable professors you will have at Yale!",
    "A fun, interesting course where the tests a much more difficult than the classwork."
