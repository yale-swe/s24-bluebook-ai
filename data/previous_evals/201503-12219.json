   "comments": [
    "Professor Shore definitely changes the course from year to year, including very different readings and focusing on different contemporary events, but I would definitely recommend the class for anyone looking for a relaxed and interesting once a week seminar. It's a strange mix of philosophy, history, and a course on contemporary Eastern Europe, but it works very well!",
    "Awesome class! Fascinating reading over centuries of European philosophy. Marci Shore is amazing. She is so brilliant and knowledgeable about such a diverse field of information, and never ceases to provide a compelling framework and fascinating commentary to our conversations. She is also incredibly open in inquiry and will very strongly support students seeking assistance. The workload is reasonable, and the weekly journal entries keep your mind sharp while avoiding the intense stress levels that other class's reading responses occasionally induce.",
    "Take it if you're interested in rather obscure central European themes and authors. If this is the right course for you, you'll know it.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in literature, history and\/or philosophy from central Europe and Russia or if you are interested in the philosophy of history. It will be eye-opening even if you had little knowledge of central Europe before. You get to read some fascinating literary and philosphical works that you probably wouldn't get exposed to in other courses, e.g. Ukrainian writer Taras Prokhasko."
