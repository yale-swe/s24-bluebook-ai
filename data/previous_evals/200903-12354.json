    "This course was alright. We learned a lot of really interesting ideas and things about the sunbelt and american history, but I felt like the readings and discussions were all kind of disparate and didn't point towards enough cohesive\/overarching ideas. It's the first year this course is being offered, so that can probably account for the lack of cohesion in the syllabus. Professor Larkin was really nice and clearly knew her stuff, but we seemed to make her nervous and she had trouble really communicating her ideas to us effectively. It was her first year teaching, and I think it was definitely an adjustment. Either way, the seminar is on a really interesting topic (and a unique one within the history department), but needs a few more years to \"mature.\" give it 2 years and it should be great!"
