    "4. The course went a little quickly at times. For example, I would have liked more time explaining functional responses and how to transfer graphs from f(N) to N to dN\/NDT and explain how density dependence altered the graphs. It took a bit of time fore me to figure all of this out. Perhaps that lecture could be split into two or done in one the lab sessions when there is more time.",
    "Lots of work, but completely worth it.",
    "This was an awesome class. Very difficult, but I highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in ecology.",
    "9. A field trip, at least to Yale Myers old fields would have been so helpful. I loved all teh chalk talk but after a while it was just too much without some applicaiton. the 'lab' periods were just more of the same. the lecturing was brilliant, but a real lab period would have awesome. There is so much we could do: working hands on in R in groups, using VENSIM or other modeling software, playing with cellualr automata for spatially explicit models. sooo much that would tie it together hands on. I feel like I got so much from the lectures but really had to learn R and even the math to a certain degree \"on my own\" through the homework. It worked, but god it could have been easier to actually do some of that stuff together."

   "comments": [
    "Understanding how ecological concepts can be tested and explored mathematically rather than simply qualitatively.",
    "The course made me understand new concepts of modeling and also gain an appreciation for how hard it is to model ecosystem dynamics. And as hard as the assignment was, I really appreciated the history of ecology paper because I read papers that as an ecologist I probably should have already read. This course gave me a historical understanding of ecology, as well as a thorough introduction to modeling.",
    "Interesting overview of how ecologists develop dynamical models. I now have a basic understanding of ecology as a science and what ecologists do. I am less intimidated by the mathematical models in academic literature.",
    "The term project. It was great to learn the material, but actually applying that to a real problem was the most useful for me.",
    "Os' teaching",
    "Os is brilliant. Colin is so helpful. Its an incredible survey of modern ecological theory with the meat to make it worthwhile. But its very heady. Difficult to ground\/too conceptual at times. For me, grounding it in simulation would have been an option, or relating it to biological or experimental reality a bit more.",
    "Lab assignments and the final project were most helpful for learningLectures were well organized and concepts were fully explained",
    "The subject material was very interesting and it was easy to see how information taught in the course is extremely useful in wildlife management.",
    "Dr. Schmitz really has a talent for teaching theoretical ecology. Although I didn't learn everything I was intended to learn in the course because of time constraints, I found that I even had insights in other classes thanks of this class."

   "comments": [
    "I think the overall flow of the course and helping the students maintain the big picture or important learning goals during the lectures. Often times it was unclear exactly where a lecture was headed or what the point of it was, and this was only understandable in retrospect. We also, for example, talked about ecosystem models in various places throughout the class, and the timing and purpose of these was a bit unclear.",
    "As mentioned above, I think some lectures deserved two days worth of explanation (e.g. functional response curves, solving for equilibrium \/ explaining equilibrium and stable states).Additionally, I would like to see the due dates for assignments changed. 55% of our grade was saved for the last week of class (final exam, primer, and model). The primer could have been due much earlier (at the end of spring break, or the week after?), which would have allowed students to focus more on the model and final exam. I also would have liked some optional \"working lab section days\" where Os and Colin would both be in the classroom to aid our work on the model.",
    "-Professor can become easily frustrated with students if they are not understanding the material. Professor seemed to get flustered if he did not know the answer to a student question--there is nothing wrong with a professor not having the answer, but it's better to acknowledge that then dismiss the student.-Occasionally the pace of the course was too fast. It felt like several students were confused\/lost in some lectures.-",
    "In the future there should be a heavier focus on isoclines, especially interpreting phase planes. A lot of the concepts could be a lot easier to grasp with an understanding of what the phase plane analysis can tell you.",
    "Maybe have the work spread out more. The beginning of the course and the end were very heavy while the middle was light.",
    "The learning tends to be pretty 1 way, in that Os is brilliant and downloads his brain every day the whole semester. He's definitely open to questions, but its difficult to really get a word in sometimes.The interactive aspects of the class is kind of a joke: its us trying to complete Os's sentences and him getting frustrated that we don't get it.By the end of the semester, we do get it, so I sort of trust the process, but I thinkmore space for field trip, actual labs, discussion, and processing of material would be ideal...maybe just a bit of the enormous depth and breadth of material could be cut for the sake of pedagogy.The readings were great and well organized, but almost never directly referred to in class, and so were the first thing to go when I was swamped, by this class and others. Connecting the readings more to the work and utilizing them more would be useful.",
    "there was a lot of material and I would have preferred some clarification of what the professor believed to be most important to comprehend",
    "A bit more explanation of specific parameters in the equations would be helpful.",
    "A final paper, a final project, and a final test are way too many assignments to complete well."

My interest is in soil ecology on the one hand (for which this was amazing) and complex systems on the other (for which this was useful, but not quite generic enough to really fulfill my need). It was very firmly grounded in actual ecosystem pattern and process, which is great for the ecological side, but detracts from the way in which it could be a more generic modeling course. It would be great to have a bit less specificity with ecosystem realism and bit more of a treatment of spatial and landscape modeling as well as the process of parametrization \/ model application and exploration of some models that are actually used.",
