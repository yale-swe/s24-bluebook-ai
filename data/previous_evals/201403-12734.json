    "It is a tough class, but is manageable with a strong BC Calculus background. Many of the kids have taken it before in high school. It is a requirement for many majors, and is very useful to know.",
    "Only take Math 120 if you have to... not a fun course or one you'll learn a lot in. Teachers are VERY hit or miss, to the point that sections have massively different class sizes because people switch between them. If you've already taken a fairly rigorous multivariable course in high school like I did, this course will bore you to death. Unless you need calculus for a major\/pre-professional track, Lin-Alg or 230 would be a better choice.",
    "If you're considering taking Math 120, you probably need it as a prerequisite for a STEM major... it's pretty standard as far as a math course goes. Lectures, problem sets from the textbook, moderately difficult exams. Be aware that it focuses on the math only for each concept, and not how they apply to physics.",
    "A good class, with not too much work outside of the problem sets. Don't wait until the last day to start the homework."
