    "I definitely think this class helped with my reading speed and reading comprehension. We read a good handful of books\/short stories so there definitely wasn't a lack of practice.",
    "I improved my understanding of the French language by learning new grammar structures and vocabulary. I became more comfortable with speaking French and employing, for example, pronouns while I speak. We learned about French history\/ Francophone nations through interesting texts.",
    "A lot of grammar, not much speaking practice, some writing practice",
    "My fluency in speaking and writing French improved greatly, as did my grasp of French grammar concepts.",
    "Developed my skills in French grammar and reading comprehension significantly. Read a lot of french short stories and books and analyzed them.",
    "I learned how to read better in french and present a topic in french. I also refined my grammar skills that i had forgotten.",
    "I developed my French speaking and writing skills"

   "comments": [
    "There was a lot of good material to talk about with this class. The intensity of the grammar rules was a bit stifling sometimes.",
    "Strengths: This course is amazing! Being forced to speak French every day really improves your understanding and comprehension. The texts we read were interesting and I like that we not only discuss grammar and employing French but we talk about life and themes of poverty, gender, history, etc. in French as well. You receive feedback immediately on pronunciation, word use, etc. Madame Koundi is so friendly and warm and that makes conversation really easy. You feel comfortable messing up! Weaknesses: I can't think of much. I would like to learn more vocabulary, specifically verbs.",
    "This class is poorly taught because the teacher doesn't actually explain any of the grammar or teach the class. We should be reading more in class and discussing- not the teacher summarizing herself (which means students will not read on their own).",
    "I love the small setting of the class as it forced everyone to participate and fostered discussion. More time could be taken on tricky grammar concepts.",
    "strength: the hw balanced exercises in reading, writing, listening and speaking. weaknesses: the amount of grammar on the first test felt overwhelming.",
    "The class had a lot of engagement and the environment made learning very collaborative. However, sometimes the work load did not match the amount that was being taken out from it. I wish we had changed up the format from solely focusing on books and practiced speaking more.",
    "strengths were the small class size and the very active learning. I loved doing different things in class everyday. very cool stories too! weaknesses were some people not talking a lot",
    "Im not a big fan of having the course meet during reading week. It is structured well for learning overall"

    "I would just because I think foreign languages are important and this class has pretty fun content.",
    "Yes!! L4 is not that much work and is very manageable with a full course schedule and your french skills will improve greatly!!",
    "Do not take French at Yale unless you have a strong background or tangible reasons for learning it. Very difficult and not that enjoyable. Take it in the summer.",
    "This is a great course for anyone who wants to improve their French language skills. Mme Koundi is fantastic, and I learned a lot over the semester.",
    "Yes, but only if they're willing to put in a lot of work. The only way the course is enjoyable is if you are fully engaged.",
    "Yes for sure!! Great course!",
    "It is a challenging course with a lot of work necessary, but students learn a lot."
