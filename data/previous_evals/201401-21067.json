    "Go to class, listen to Paul North for two hours, get your mind blown. Take a walk and rethink it all.",
    "A class like this assumes a strong foundation in Kant and concentrates on some extraordinarily difficult texts. If you are willing to put in a lot of work, you will get a lot out of the class. The daily tweets grew somewhat tiresome as the semester wore on, but did provide some interesting moments. Professor North is great.",
    "A fascinating exploration of primarily faith through some really rewarding readings; will leave you with more questions than answers.",
    "An intense seminar on the topic of faith and knowledge (with an emphasis on faith). Very difficult texts and high level discussion. Would definitely recommend, but only after having read some Hegel, Kant, and Kierkegaard.",
    "take anything Prof. North teaches if you want to do some hard reading and serious philosophising.",
    "Very erratic readings, ultimately a light workload. If you're into the stuff, take it, but you're not going to get anything out that you didn't put in."
