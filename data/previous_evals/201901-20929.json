    "How to speak French.",
    "Improved my french speaking, listening, understanding of grammar, and developed a love for the language.",
    "I certainly enhanced by understanding of the subjunctive and conditional tenses, past vs. imperfect and the use of pronouns. I had background in these topics before the course but I certainly have a better understanding now.",
    "I developed grammar and speaking skills in French. I also gained insight into French literature and film. I learned a lot about the French language and formatting using it.",
    "I learned the framework for intermediate-level speaking, writing, and communication in the French language. The class did not have lessons solely dedicated to French culture, however, there are enough relevant films and texts covered to understand the basics. More importantly, this method of teaching students the tools to comprehend\/interpret other books\/films if they choose to do so on their own time.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: you practice language every day. Engaging course Weaknesses: not organized well, you would sometimes work on grammar that would be on the test the day before the test, or for instance you would have a vocabulary list given to you the day before the test.",
    "For those who are quiet or have difficulties speaking in seminars, this type of class can be pretty hard.",
    "This is a fantastic course with great design. I do not believe improvements are necessary.",
    "Too much work that takes up all of my time. I had a 5.5 credit course load this semester and this class couldn't always take up my time but my grade dropped so fast. Why doesn't homework count to help with that.",
    "strengths- interesting. I enjoyed the books and movies we watched throughout the course. weaknesses- an obscene amount of work. exceeded any course at Yale.",
    "The course had a lot of content that was covered throughout the duration of the semester but I often found some of the day-to-day tasks to be really repetitive. The repetition was good for learning but made it was sometimes hard to feel engaged.",
    "The content is very interesting. I like how it uses books and movies to learn the content. I feel as if too long was often spent on certain topics and we spent too much time taking about the small plot details of books instead of more productively practicing French.",
    "strengths: high engagement, useful group work & lectures weaknesses: course pack, audio programs how to improve: The course pack and audio programs definitely need to be revised for this course. Though each audio program\/exercise is no more than 35 mins, students will spend a lot more time on them than that. A student must either pause and replay sections to understand the material or catch mistakes. That could, in many cases, take them twice as long to complete the audio assignmentsespecially when they are assigned 2 to 3 every day. On top of that, each student is expected to fully understand the assignment for a book\/movie and produce a well-written redaction on the material too. Speeding through tasks like these is not difficult, but it will come back to bite you. The harsh difficulty of the tests and comprehension questions forces you to know plot points, insane amounts of vocabulary, tenses, conjugations, and symbols as if the material was covered in a Yale-level English class. Most of my classmates stopped seriously doing hw after the 3rd week of class because things became too difficult and time-consuming. You're better off skimming the course pack and taking notes in class instead. Significantly reduce the course pack assignments or remove them altogether. Other assignmentsincluding hw exercises you receive at the end of classare sufficient.",
    "Fast paced at times. Good content."

   "comments": [
    "Honestly, if you're planning to major I'm french or are really interested in it then yes take it. However, if you're deciding between other languages then definitely choose other language departments. The workload is ridiculously long and it does not feel like you're improving when you watch a french movie and the proceed to answer over 200 questions for the film.",
    "If you like learning languages and are interested in French, I'd recommend it. If you're just trying to fulfill the language credit, maybe take something else. There are plenty of languages that are really really fun with less work.",
    "Absolutely! This is a fantastic course taught by a wonderful professor.",
    "No, take Spanish.",
    "Probably not. If they love French or want an immense challenge, then yes. But the workload was over-the-top heavy.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if he or she is interested in learning more about the language and culture! We read short children's stories, read two french novels and we studied a french film. The class was really engaging and my language skills definitely progressed.",
    "Yes, but only if they are willing to put in the time. You get as much out as you put in and the class can be very frustrating but it is also rewarding.",
    "Only take this course to speed through a language requirement or legitimately learn the French language. The stress from massive amounts of hw and super difficult tests is not worth it. I recommend supplementing this course with a full semester of guts if you want to do well. Otherwise, expect a prolonged sleep deficit throughout the semester just because of this class.",
    "No because there is too much work."
