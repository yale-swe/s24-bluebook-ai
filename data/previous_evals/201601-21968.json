    "The most amazing class you will ever take at Yale.",
    "Definitely take this class. Sumarsam seems happy all the time, which makes for a great environment for learning Gamelan. Anyone could learn these instruments. Highly recommend!!",
    "Fun",
    "A phenomenal way to open your eyes to another culture's musical traditions and techniques.",
    "Great way to get hands on with a new instrument, especially if you're interested in ethnomusicology. A bit unstructured.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you are interested in world music. I have taken many music classes here at Yale but none covered Javanese music; it was so interesting to be exposed to a different form of tonality and to learn to play new instruments as an ensemble. Sumarsam is also incredibly knowledgeable. Great experience."
