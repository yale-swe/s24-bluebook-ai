    "Biological Physics attempts to bridge the divide between concepts in cell biology and quantitative problem solving in physics. We used calculus and elementary differential equations, linear algebra, and Fourier analysis to solve problems of diffusion, statistical mechanics, and chemical equilibrium as pertaining to the cell. We also used the powerful computer program Mathematica to model physical parameters of biological phenomena.To students with backgrounds primarily in biology, or who are rusty at math: don't listen to the physics students who say this class is a breeze! It took me the majority of the course just to remember old physics and get comfortable using math this intensively. I would say the class takes a decent amount of independent work to learn the material. I think the topics are fascinating, but I think the execution of actually absorbing the material came up short."
