    "YES, TAKE IT!!! HSAR432 was an EXCELLENT class and one of the best that I took this year! If you have no art history background you'll still enjoy this class, but you'll definitely have an advantage if you've had either an introductory art history class or, better yet, any class on Italian Renaissance. I came in only having taken one art history class on Italian Renaissance and felt right at home. Professor Kanter, the curator of the Yale Art Gallery and former curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was FANTASTIC! I looked forward to coming in every week and listening to him lecture. He has such a passion for his field which was evident in the way he talked about each artist and their works - particularly Fra Angelico. Any professor who shares his or her enthusiasm with their students makes their class that much more meaningful. Furthermore, instead of focusing on the \"textbook\" definitions used to analyze paintings and their subject matter, he focused one of the main purposes of visual art, which is to look. Instead of worrying about being able to accurately interpret a painting, it helped regain my appreciation for each artist's magical skill with paint and stone. One of the BEST aspects about this class was its size of only seven people - three undergraduates, two graduate students, and two international grad students. Because of its size, the class became more like a seminar. Another HIGHLIGHT of this course was whenever Professor Kanter brought out original works from storage for us to examine. To be up close and personal (even be able to hold it!) with a piece of art from the Renaissance was breathtaking; it really gave me a taste for how you could apply what you've learned in class to the field of art history. There was no final exam, only two papers both of which were enjoyable to write. For the first paper, Professor Kanter asked us to describe a painting of our choice (within the gallery and of the relevant time period ) without researching the painting. This encouraged us both to really look at the painting and to interpret it based on what we saw. The second was a research paper aimed at narrowing our focus about a particular work or technique of an artist of our choice. This paper was challenging but in a good way. The readings were \"suggested\" but not required. I didn't have time to read them, but I never felt like I had missed out on something."
