   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take it if you can. It will be the best thing you do!",
    "Definitely. You have to like the subject matter and do the reading but it is a manageable and very enjoyable course.",
    "This is a generalist's course. It allows you to see the broad connection between thinkers, rather than particular issues.Kapustin is a great professor. Its certainly worth taking the course for his sake alone. But if you take it with him, be prepared for a packed classroom that often doesn't feel like a seminar.",
    "I would recommend this to even a non-EPE major who wants to have a thorough but necessarily fast-paced survey of major interdisciplinary thinkers in Western thought. The class is a great opportunity to really think about the ways that ethics, politics and economics do or don't overlap.",
    "This course covers essential writers and philosophers in the field of EPE, and it deviates from a standard curriculum that focuses on merely the Classics and the Enlightenment. You really won't get as much out of it if you don't at least attempt to do the readings. It's very \"concentrated\" in a positive way; by that I mean, after 2 hours, you leave feeling like you have learned the same amount of material that any other class would have taken a 1-2 weeks to cover. It's fast-paced and really interesting.",
    "a survey of major texts in ethics\/politics\/economics. take it.",
    "i would absolutely recommend it",
    "This course is absolutely amazing. It teaches you to think in a profoundly different way than most Poli-Sci\/EPE courses.Be warned, though, that the way of thinking is very specific, resembling the intellectual approaches of Foucault and Derrida. I came in to the course not being able to understand either, and I can now do so and appreciate what they are saying. However, I also don't particularly like those styles of approaching intellectual questions, so I did not particularly enjoy this course a lot of the time.Kapustin is an excellent seminar leader, but he has very obvious favorites in the class, and his reactions to you will be determined by the impression he has of you. That impression is very hard to change, so if you're getting bad vibes from him on the first day, that will probably continue for the rest of the semester.",
    "Take it, and definitely take it with Prof Kapustin. Even if you just have to take it for EP&E, you'll enjoy it with him."
