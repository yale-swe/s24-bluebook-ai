    "Pretty standard Spanish class. Would recommend as a distributional requirement.",
    "Great course, a lot of work but your spanish definitely improves",
    "I would recommend Spanish 140 if a student wants to close up a high school and college career in Spanish and perfect their use of grammar in speech. Keep in mind it is quite a bit of busy work and you have to show up to class every day. There are also a few boring classes from time to time but the material tended to be good I found."
