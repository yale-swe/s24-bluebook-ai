   "comments": [
    "Great class, minus section.",
    "YES but only with Prof. Latham. There isn't much work at all, the exams are easy, and the material is interesting.",
    "In this class, you compare bioethics of countries such as abortion policies. It can be a very interesting class.",
    "TAKE IT!!! You will learn so many interesting facts about different medical systems around the globe. A lot of info can be helpful and applied in other PoliSci classes if you are taking any at the same time as Bioethics.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in discussing about the ethics of important bioethical issues, such as abortion, assisted-suicide, assisted reproduction techniques, stem cell research etc. , and for those who want to learn more about healthcare policies and policy-making, as in healthcare systems, cost rationing, public health policies etc. The workload is manageable, the material is really interesting and the professor is great. I definitely recommend this class!",
    "I would recommend this course, or any other course taught by Prof. Latham, without hesitation. The material is fascinating. Prof. Latham is the nicest man alive. The workload is manageable, although non-trivial.",
    "this was only the second time he's ever taught this course, and i'd say it needs more time to reach its potential. international bioethics is a really interesting subject.",
    "Good survey course - you do not really delve into the \"ethics\" of the issues, but rather briefly overview the controversy and compare laws\/public policy across nations. Professor Latham is wonderfully eloquent (never needs notes!) and knowledgeable about the issues - the lectures were enjoyable.",
    "Take it. You will never be bored in class and the workload is really manageable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The workload is not too bad, the class is very interesting, and the midterm\/final were very manageable. Professor Latham is great also. Take this class!",
    "Good course. Recommend you take either this OR Bioethics and Law. The overlap can get a little monotonous but both on their own are very good courses.",
    "Comparative Bioethics is a relatively easy, but still fairly interesting course. You probably won't learn the material it covers in very many other yale college courses, and if you do, it won't be in as holistic and comparative a context. While the material is not easy, per se, requiring a fair amount of study, the class is not very challenging. Professor latham's lectures are good, and are very effective at communicating the material, much more effective, I thought, than the textbook which was rather dry.",
    "Yes - the lectures are interesting and engaging, and you learn a lot.No - if you're looking for a class with definite deadlines.",
    "I would definitely take this class!",
    "great lecture course if you are interested in the material. section was not demanding. go to lecture because that's what is on the tests.",
    "Really interesting. If you're interested in international health care, I definitely suggest taking this class!",
    "Yes. I'm not going into bioethics or international law but I still loved the class. The teacher is great. It's not too hard and you end up learning a lot. You gain a new perspective on a lot of modern issues.",
    "Easy A. You basically just need to know what 3 countries stances are on each topic presented in class in order to ace the exams. If you want something more intellectually challenging, take a bioethics class that actually has debates about topics and gets into the philosophical foundations of the arguments for and against these issues.",
    "Yes, I would. I did take it after Professor Latham's other, more America-focused bioethics \/ medical law course and feel that this was the lesser of the two. If it's an area of interest for you take the other course, and if you really like it try this one. I think it was not comprehensive enough as a stand alone item but worked fine as an addendum to the previous semester's foundation.",
    "It feels like a survey class in the comparative politics of international bioethics. It's a great way to see how moral theories are translated into policies.",
    "Yes. It's good to know what other countries are thinking about as related to big issues like assisted suicide or abortion and the reasoning behind them.Reading can be a little dense at times, but lecture\/section clears anything up really well.Latham is a great lecturer too.",
    "A disappointing class. I find bioethics very interesting, but Professor Latham turned a subject that's rife with excitement and controversy into something dry and dull. His lectures tend to be repetitive and not very compelling. As a result, I stopped going to class and section and doing the reading (I took it Cr\/D) and yet found the exams so easy that I probably could have gotten an A or A- in this class despite literally doing nothing for it. You might learn some interesting things from the textbook, but it's pretty dry in general.",
    "Great class! You'll learn a lot if you do the reading, Jost is a slow but ultimately interesting read. Class is necessary to know what is going on, though, and that's nice - you feel like you're really gaining something from sitting there.",
    "Great class. I love Latham and his teaching style-it's never boring, always very interactive. Not too much work but you learn a lot about the world. It was definitely easier having taken his American Bioethics course, but it would by no means be too hard without that.",
    "I would recommend this course because of the connections it made globally.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Professor Latham is really a great professor and, besides that, his exams are very fair. I enjoyed coming to this class every week because I was learning something new each time - as cliche as that sounds. The course covers a variety of topics, about one a week, so you are moving from one issue to the next slow enough that you have time to understand the concept before moving on, but also fast enough that you don't get bored.",
    "If you're even a little curious about bioethical issues and policies in the US and around the world, you MUST TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Latham is an incredible and engaging lecturer. It was definitely one of my favorite courses here at Yale!"
