    "Although probably not going to be offered again, this is such a fantastic class to think about visual culture in general, what it means to see, what arts and architecture might mean to human beings, and East Asia in general....Some lectures, Yiengpruksawan seems way too theoretical and abstract and I had hard time understanding some things(readings were pretty stuffy too), but other lectures Yiengpruksawan is amazing. She makes even the lecture classes like this engaging, is willing to answer questions after class, meet up with you during office hour. Such a nice human being, and a wonderful, creative professor! I am amazed at how creative she is, how she seems to be able to bring in new perspectives to practically every established areas of scholarships...Not much work throughout the semester, but the final paper could get a little stressful..because the concepts are so abstract and hard to put into words.",
    "Yes, and you don't need to know anything about Japanese art. If you ever found Japanese art beautiful or cool, this class is worth taking it. I liked the independent research project as our term paper. I picked a painting that I personally enjoyed very much, so the paper writing wasn't as painful as others were.",
    "In this class, you study a few of the most important works of Japanese painting and printmaking in order to better understand how Japanese visuality works-- i.e. what might a Japanese artist or viewer think or understand when looking at a work in comparison to what a western viewer might think. It is an interesting approach somewhere between a broad survey and a very focused seminar, and I think it was a useful introduction to the visual world of Japan. The professor is very knowledgeable, but approaches the art with a philosophy of there being no right or wrong answers, and she is very interested in open ended discussion of the works.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a great way to approach Japanese art for the first time.",
    "This course is a really interesting survey of the major works of Japanese art. Mimi is a great professor and even though it is a lecture course, she welcomes questions and comments from the students. The hour and fifteen minute lectures did feel long at times (especially in the warm, dark basement room of Loria), but you are exposed to a completely new type of art. You don't really have to do the readings (which are drawn from scholarly articles) and the course is really not a lot of work for most of the semester. There are 3 15-minute quizzes and then one term paper (15 pages). The paper requires a lot of work, but it can be very creative and Mimi is more than happy to meet with you. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in art, art history, or Japanese culture. Or for anyone looking for a humanities credit that really isn't that much work.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. It is quintessentially \"liberal arts\" in its inter-disciplinary\/innovative hypothesis, and refreshing for anyone seeking to broaden his or her point of view, i.e., beyond canonical ways of thinking (of East Asia vis-a-vis the West and, to an extent, Japanese art vis-a-vis its conventional narrative). Anyone interested in art, its history, architecture, anthropology or history would be wise to shop it. Professor Yiengpruksawan shouldn't be miss during your tenure at Yale.",
    "Yes strongly recommend. Reading is doable, quizzes are on obvious works, and the paper is very open and up to you."
