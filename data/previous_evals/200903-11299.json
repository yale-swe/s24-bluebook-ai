    "Basic introduction to multivariable. I heard the engineering one is better though. There are no weekly problem sets, but rather daily homework which is very straightforward. Exams were mostly fair, but at times very algebra intensive. Self-doable, just know how to do the common problems exemplified in the book and it's an easy A.",
    "It's easy. Jean Sun is a relatively bad teacher. She doesn't explain things for the most part. Don't worry about getting a good teacher though. The textbook is good enough. You could easily learn the material yourself without much problem if your teacher is bad enough.The tests are reasonable. The problem sets are also very reasonable (they take perhaps from 1 to 1 1\/2 hrs per week).Multivariable calculus is a course you must (in my opinion) take if you're going into science\/math\/econ.",
    "Not unless you're already familiar with topics. It can be very daunting when you aren't.",
    "I do not recommend this class unless you ABSOLUTELY need to take it. The class itself is pretty useless, and didn't teach me much about anything; I did not learn a single useful application of multivariable calculus. If you just want to gain a theoretical understanding, take this class; if not, then don't.",
    "math 120 was a good class - not easy, but not too tough either. the most important thing about this course is which section leader you get, and I didn't get the right one because I transferred in halfway through the semester and had scheduling constraints. Chun-Yi Sun is very well-intentioned, but she's also difficult to understand and her lectures didn't add much to my understanding of the concepts. Get to pre-registration early, and sign up for Michael Frame's section, as he's the actual professor and the rest of the teachers are just TAs. If you don't get Frame, you'll hardly interact with him at all since the class never meets as one big lecture, so try your best to make it into his section.",
    "I would NOT recommend this math class to other students unless you plan on being a math major. I found the classes to be extremely boring and at times very unclear. Moreover, you are never provided with real life applications for any of the math you are learning. I would definitely recommend taking this course from the engineering department instead.",
    "I would say that it is challenging and to find a teacher who is good at conveying the topics and who is willing to meet with you outside of the classtime for extra help.",
    "If you are thinking of taking this course, then I would recommend looking at ENAS 151 first. You'll learn the math here but certainly not the applications as well as in that class.",
    "I don't think Math 120 is for everyone. I recommend it only if you really want to learn math or it might be helpful to econ majors, and only if you are willing to spend time doing a lot of practice with the textbook. If you are looking to be an engineer or the applied side of multivariable calculus, ENAS 151 would probably be better.",
    "Yes for premed. No for the fact that the teacher's are pretty poor.",
    "A class that isn't too difficult, but at the same time shouldn't be taken for granted, because it isn't trivial. Doing homework regularly plus a few extra exercises will definitely pay off."
