   "comments": [
    "YES I highly recommend it, an interesting first foray into art (without requiring great drawing skills).",
    "I would recommend anyone with any artistic inkling to take this class.",
    "ART 132 is a great class to take. The class emphasizes concepts of design rather than mastering Photoshop or InDesign. Julian is a great instructor. Since assignments are typically completedoutside of class and critiqued in class, you get as much out of the class as the work that you put it. On the whole, the class was very enjoyable and I would definitely recommend it to any student.",
    "I would definitely recommend Art 132 - I learned a lot about graphic design, skills that will be useful in so many ways.",
    "You will leave this class with the ability to better convey visual messages that will have an impact on viewers. If you don't like prolonged periods of sitting and talking about art or are overly objective, this is definitely not the art class for you. If you like refining art projects through constructive criticism, this class will definitely help you do that.I would actually consider taking this class again.",
    "Take it! I took it more or less on a whim and definitely intend to continue with the graphic design sequence now.",
    "It's a very mellow introduction to Graphic Design.Low stress but can be challenging.You get what you put into it.It doesn't teach you how to use the computer and is not 100% computer based.",
    "The classmates I had were not very committed and student work varied week to week. Better peers would have made stronger work, and there was little self motivation to do better, go beyond or challenge oneself. I learned a lot and enjoyed myself, but I was left wanting more. Prof. was excellent and I would certainly take it again, just hope for a good section.Into to GD will open doors into tons of other, more advanced classes, so TAKE IT. It was totally great. Take your collection seriously and put out good work.Prof. Bittiner had an excellent dynamic and control on the class. Demanding without being absurd. Great comments and insight, gladly take another class with him.",
    "Yes I would! If you are interested in Graphic Design TAKE IT! Sometimes the hour and fifty minute critiques get long, but if you bring something else to do for a little while (doodle or something) and then focus for the rest of the time it is totally worth it. I learned a lot and have seen a great improvement of my work. it does take a LOT of time. I spent at least 6 hours each week on each piece and was always surprised that it did not get done faster. ALSO, the final project takes FOREVER. This class meets during reading week...",
    "I would recommend this class to any undergraduate interested in learning more about graphic design or the design process in general.",
    "Intro to Graphic Design is a pretty basic intro course, which helps you feel comfortable with the elements of graphic design, and also acquaints you with your own graphic design style. There is a disappointingly small amount of time spent designing on the computer, but I suppose the weeks of practice with manual design helped establish what techniques we were trying to achieve on the computer.I would recommend this course, because I did learn a lot, although it was a lot of (often tedious) work."
