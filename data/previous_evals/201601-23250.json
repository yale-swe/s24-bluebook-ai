    "Great Course. Good topics. Final project is a good assignment.",
    "This is a course that all students who are very keen on applied mathematics and quantitative finance should take.",
    "I feel like I learned more in this class than in any other class I've taken at Yale. I hadn't used R before taking this class, and now I feel pretty comfortable using R for data analysis. I also learned a lot of techniques (ARCH, GARCH, copulas, VaR, etc.) that I had never heard of before this class. Further, the lectures built on a lot of what we learned in previous econometrics classes, so I feel more confident about that material as well. Lastly, it was nice that the final assignment was a research paper."
