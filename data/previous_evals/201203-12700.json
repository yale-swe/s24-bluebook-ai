    "If you are a QR-oriented student looking for an easy writing credit, here are a few things to consider: the subject matter is completely derived from the question of whether it is possible to create a mind from software; if this doesn't interest you, don't take the course. Further, while the workload is incredibly light compared to other writing classes, Professor Gelernter demands a very particular style of writing. His expectations take getting used to, and your grade will suffer immensly until you adjust.",
    "This course is about the feasibility of artificial intelligence and writing concisely. I would only recommend this course to a student if he or she is interested in the philosophy of mind and\/or needs a writing credit (even then, there are probably better ones out there). The only comments he wrote on our papers were on how to write some sentences more concisely.",
    "If you're looking at this class, chances are you're a computer science major looking for a writing credit. If that is what you're after, suck it up and take the course. Class is boring and Gelernter grades very harshly, but the readings are short and you will only have to write four short essays and a final paper. It will not be as interesting as your real computer science classes, but at least you can get a writing credit without weekly essays and mountains of reading.",
    "yes. interesting material, not a ton of work. just don't expect an A.",
    "Yes, this class is OD in terms of the meticulous attention to detail. However, all really short assignments, but you will likely put just as much time into them because of the amount of necessary revisions. Take it if your interested in making a Mind out of Software.",
    "Google Gelertner before you take the class. He has many essays on how women should stay at home to take care of children, how women don't have a place in science, and how liberals are ruining our education system. Do you want listen to this man talk for 75 minutes twice a week?For the class, expect a light workload (some readings and a few essays) and extremely arbitrary grading.",
    "I saw the reviews before me. They said \"Prof Gelernter is a harsh grader,\" and I thought, \"Psh...how hard could he grade. Puhlease, I'll be fine.\" No. He's a harsh grader.",
    "Professor Gelernter is very brilliant, but somehow it doesn't not come through the course as he tries to explain other's views on whether you can build a mind out of a robot. A simple research would reveal that he is a deeply religious man who thinks that you can not do so, but he tries to pretend like he is impartial and only responds to the questions students raise through the perspectives of the texts that we read. Unfortunately, he came off as stubborn, dogmatic and unwilling to listen to the other side, and desperately trying to defend his own beliefs by giving bad grades to anyone dare to reject his implicit views. (yes, like thinking A- for paper on his side, C- or B-, but nothing higher on the other side....). You are allowed only a few paragraphs to voice your view, (like less than 200 words), so naturally it's hard to voice a logical argument. He will not apply the principle of charity that philosophers apply to opponent's arguments, instead, he will poke hole in anyway possible as if it's his own beliefs under attack.Regardless, if you are willing to sacrifice your grade, you will still learn a few things about the debate on consciousness, robot and the mind. I wish Professor Gelernter had kept an open mind in grading papers rather and shared his views (which becomes obvious as the course progresses and through his zealous defense of those who don't believe in thinking robots) and his arguments. Oh, he gives great edits to your paper and you will learn a few things about writing well, but the cost is too high and the draconian grading simply becomes counterproductive to learning.This course is for the brave, the credit-Der, or those seniors who wnat to get the writing credit (but not course credit) by withdrawing at the end of the semester. For the rest, you think you can do it? Prepare to see more C- and B-.",
    "The course forces you to write very concisely, and is graded harshly. There are 5 essays 4 of them are 300 words. The material is not relevant to the real world. There is very little work for a writing course.",
    "If you are a straight dude with a distaste for justice on the look-out for a painfully slow and pointless gut that will probably lower your GPA anyway, look no further! Otherwise, you might be interested to know, in the words of the great man himself, a few of the openly published views that good old Gelernter has no interest in keeping out of the classroom:\"Asking a traditional Jew or Christian not to 'discriminate against' a practicing homosexual is like asking him to venerate idols. Judaism and Christianity hold that homosexual behavior is an abomination.\"--Gay Rights and Wrongs, the Wall Street Journal\"It would be gutless and contemptible of me not to fight modern feminism tooth and nail, as hard as I can, however little I may accomplish. And I teach my boys to do the same.\"--interview, Yale Free Press\"If women aren't being kept out of science by force, they must be choosing not to enter, presumably because they don't want to; presumably because (by and large) they don't likethese fields or (on average) don't tend to excel in them, which is nearly the same thing.\"--Women and Science at Yale, the Weekly Standard\"Women mainly work because of male greed.\"--The Images Dancing in David Gelernter's Head, The Chronicle ReviewSee also: his article \"Why Mothers Should Stay Home\"So yeah, if you're into bad writing and bigotry, go for it."
