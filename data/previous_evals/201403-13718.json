    "The work load was mostly appropriate. The final project could be more useful, if the elements were due throughout the semester, for feedback. Since the content of the project is not the direct focus of the rest of the course (not that it should be) it's hard to know if you're dong it right, until the end.",
    "I would have liked if some of the extensive workload at the end had been budgeted throughout the course.",
    "Workload throughout the course is appropriate and useful for learning in class. The amount of time required for the final project is not in balance with its educational value.",
    "The workload for the course, particularly the final project, would have been better spread out throughout the semester. There was relatively little work to do all semester, and then a massive project at the end. Many of us waited to do it until the end because we felt ill-prepared to do so beforehand. Ultimately this project felt unsupervised, and we would have much more enjoyed and learned more if we could have turned in parts of the project over the course of the semester for feedback."

    "Professor Trites is a very effective leader of class discussion. She allows the class to reach its own conclusiosn while making sure to keep the big picture clear.",
    "There were times when it felt like the professor assumed prior knowledge when there wasn't enough, and other times when it felt like we didn't go deep enough. I understand that this was a introduction course and that each student is approaching the material at a different level of familiarity with the material, but it didn't feel like a graduate level course. It felt like an intro course in an undergraduate business program. It needed more oomph - more penetration of the material, and more examples of how to make the information practicable. Sometimes, due to the speed that concepts were discussed, or the lack of depth, concepts didn't sink in, or didn't seem to make sense of how it was executable."

    "I don't think we had enough opportunities to talk through a single-ticket marketing plan before having to complete it. I also had no idea how one might re-think it because I had not other options to use besides the one we were provided with.",
    "The final project to create a Marketing Plan is a good idea for a project, poorly executed. Students have much to learn from creating a plan holistically, and we did learn from this project, but much of the time that was required was spent confused or performing mechanical work. Practically, the task assigned is to reverse engineer the final project of a student from the previous year. Many of the aspects of the example given were never discussed in class, and much of the example project was redundant. It was difficult to make sense of the whole. The project would be much more effective if we went through different pieces of the model marketing plan as we moved through the relevant topics in the course. That way, we would have practical exposure in each class and have a better idea where to begin when we reached the final project."
