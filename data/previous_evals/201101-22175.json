   "comments": [
    "This is a very solid Shakespeare lecture. Definitely take it if you have taken Histories and Tragedies. Some people don't like Manley's lecture style, but I thought he was consistently interesting and insightful.",
    "If you're willing to read a lot of Shakespeare (a play a week), you'll get to hear some great lectures and learn how to discover intricacies in the text, come to reasonable conclusions and argue for\/support those assertions. If you're looking for a lighter workload, you basically only have to read the plays you write about, but you'll miss out on Yale's finest. Professor Manley's lectures are both broad and dense, since he pretty much knows everything. If you've ever wondered why\/whether Shakespeare is important, take this class.",
    "Take it if you're looking for a great WR credit that's not too demanding but still very interesting.",
    "If you like Shakespeare, absolutely!",
    "Take this class if you want to read more Shakespeare and more importantly if you enjoy reading Shakespeare. That's the class's only stumbling block. If you're enjoying reading the plays, the rest is great, but if you'll get tired of reading plays with very similar structures all semester, then this isn't the class for you.",
    "Great survey of shakepeare's comedies. A bit straightforward but really cool.",
    "Do it as a pre-1800, or to get a general understanding of Shakespeare. Manley is not the most exciting (read: you WILL be surfing the internet during every lecture), however, it's not graded too harshly and it feels good to be exposed to this stuff.",
    "good class. learn a lot about writing and really appreciate shakespeare.",
    "Solid survey course of many of Shakespeare's plays but a little monotonous at times.",
    "In ENG 200 you pretty much just read most of Shakespeare's comedies. I would reccomend it if you have any interest in doing that. The pace of the class is pretty comfortable at about a play a week. I found taking the writing option was a very good choice so that I never had to go back and cram all of the details of every play, or worry that I needed to remember the details of every play. It was nice getting a chance to read so much Shakespeare, hear the professor's thoughts on it, and through the four papers get a chance to really delve into four of the plays myself.",
    "If you look down upon the comedies, and want to skip this one for histories and tragedies, well you won't know what you're missing. Not just pairs of swapping twins in this class - lots of great plays are covered, including all the romances (Pericles, Winter's Tale, The Tempest), and the truly bizarre \"Troilus and Cressida.\" I would recommend this class, because Professor Manley is just a great lecturer and the plays are a lot of fun to read. I looked forward to this one.",
    "Yeah, I'd recommend it. Always good to read more Shakespeare.",
    "Unless you plan on not going to lectures and just reading the plays on your own, I would not recommend this course. There are other English classes, let alone Shakespeare classes, that are much more interesting.",
    "I would recommend it only if one were interested in the texts. Lectures were dull, though there were some funny moments. If you're an English major, there are better ways to fulfill the pre-1800s requirement.",
    "Take the course. You will read wonderful plays and learn a lot.",
    "Shakespeare's Comedies and Romances, one play a week.",
    "I would recommend English 200 if a student enjoys studying Shakespeare or if you're an English student and you need another pre-1800. There was a lot of reading, a play a week, but all English classes have a lot of reading. The lectures were very interesting.",
    "Comedies and Romances isn't an awful class, but it could certainly be much better. Lectures are seriously lackluster, often downright boring. The plays themselves are pretty good - it IS Shakespeare - but that's not enough to make this class really worth taking. Though I did the regular option, I think choosing the Writing option might have made this class significantly better, as you write four papers instead of two, allowing for more in-depth exploration of the plays than is otherwise possible. Not a class to take if you're looking for interesting lectures.",
    "Good to take if you're an English Major and you need another easy pre-1800.",
    "Professor Manley is kind of boring because he basically reads his lectures word for word. But the books are great and you will learn a lot about some great plays.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in Shakespeare. The workload is a lot less than Kastan's, and overall it's a great course.",
    "I would recommend in this class if the student is interested in Shakespeare and the study of how language conveys desired effects.",
    "Professor Manley is knowledgeable, but somewhat dry. Does not engage well with the class. He could have just sat a tape recorder on the podium and pressed play, and the lecture would have felt the same. As the name of the class reveal, all you do is read 11 Shakespeare comedies, so if you haven't read any of them before, this class is a great way to catch up on all you've missed.Also, there is real world application: This class definitely helped me answer a few questions while watching Jeopardy! during the semester.",
    "I would recommend the class to people that love Shakespeare but haven't read many of his plays.",
    "This course is an introduction to Shakespeare's comedies and romances. I would recommend it for anyone who is willing to commit to it. Prof. Manley has fascinating ideas and seems to know everything that has ever been said about any of the plays, but his lectures are dense and demand students' attention. A writing-intensive option was offered this term, and the students who took it seem to have had a very different experience. Their grades were dependent only on the four essays they wrote, and they were not required to take any exams, making attendance in lecture more or less optional for them. For students who want to read the plays but who don't want to come to class, the writing-intensive option seems to be essentially a directed reading in the plays (with weekly, fifty-minute sections).",
    "This is a great lecture course. Manley's lectures are brilliant, full of dry humor and intellectual insight. I really enjoyed writing the papers for this class as well. The workload is manageable--one play a week goes pretty quickly; two five-page papers, a midterm, and a final exam. I highly recommend this class.",
    "English 200 is a survey course of Shakespeare's comedies and romances. The reading is great, and the lecture varies from average to good. Professor Manley clearly is very knowledgeable, but he is not the most engaging lecturer. The workload is very manageable: one play a week, 2 short papers, a midterm and a final.",
    "Overall a great course\u0097\u0097wonderful choice of plays, thought-provoking discussions. Manley passion for the material is always apparent, and inspiring. Workload was reasonable, not overwhelming but thorough (Two 5 page papers, midterm of passage ids from lecture, final with ids and in-class essay). Manley may not be as flashy as some other professors but he has real heart and probes deeply into the material. I very much enjoyed the class, particularly my section with Andrew Kau. He is great!"
