   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You will read a lot of material that you should definitely read before you graduate (Williams, Miller) as well as a lot of interesting stuff that you might never read if you didn't take this course. It has a definite theater studies focus, which can be both fascinating and challenging for non theater-studies majors.",
    "Yes, definitely. Although the class is dominated by theater studies majors, it is still a great class for exposure to modern American playwrights even if you have no theater experience.",
    "I thought this was a great class. I wish there were a little more background information for the members of the class who weren't so well-versed in theater histories and traditions rather than just assuming we all knew. But overall, the syllabus was great and well-organized and Professor Robinson incorporated a lot of dimensions of the texts into the class (for example, showing photos and video recordings of performances, facsimiles of original scripts, and movie versions of the plays). Professor Robinson really brought the class to life as a humorous and engaging facilitator of discussion. I enjoyed the balance of lecturing and discussion.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is a great way to immerse yourself in American theater and culture. The plays are fun and the class discussion is interesting. I always looked forward to class. The discussions flew by!",
    "Robinson is wonderful. He's really funny and will talk about how he hates some of the stuff on the syllabus but that we need to read it to understand the arc of the class. He picks really interesting stuff, some obscure, some well-known, and creates a really good mix. Modernism isn't really my thing and I was taking it primarily because it was the only English Senior Seminar that I liked that worked with my schedule, but I enjoyed most of the reading, being in class, and feel that I got something out of it.",
    "I would recommend this class but only if you realize what it is - it is very modern art like stuff (a lot is pretty abstract\/hard to understand).",
    "Take it if you really like theater and reading plays but you haven't necessarily had the chance to read a lot of the classics, like Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller. Professor Robinson is awesome, the workload isn't bad, a couple plays a week and two 10-page papers."
