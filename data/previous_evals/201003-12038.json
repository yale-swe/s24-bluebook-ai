    "If you can get it, take it! Exceptional for English Majors and those interested in Contemporary\/Modern\/American Romantic poetry.",
    "Great great great... Bloom is Bloom is Bloom, and there's a lot to love about that. And this syllabus, which is amazing on its own terms, shows him at his best. Take it if you get in. And apply if you're thinking about applying\u0097you might not have that many more chances to do so.",
    "Bloom adores Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane, and you'll get insightful and passionate readings of the great works of these two in the second half of the class. On Whitman Bloom illuminates the poet's mysterious mystic strangeness---he's such a difficult poet that I was so glad to have Professor Bloom to elucidate his weirdness. Dickinson was one of the most enjoyable parts of the semester. She's such a fascinating anomaly and Bloom points us right to where she is at her most powerful, most transgressive.",
    "Definitely take this class if you can. It's a really ideal way to both become familiar with several major American literary figures as well as start to understand the connection between them.",
    "These poet we read\u0097and Bloom's readings of them\u0097were mind-bendingly good. From Whitman to Crane, every poem lights up and aligns with every other poem you'll read. The class is not difficult or intimidating (although it's rather impossible to get into \u0097 don't feel badly if you wait for years; just let him know you're waiting). Once you're in, it feels like a DS section on major American poets. Cannon is very important to Bloom, so have an idea of what that means before going in. (read his amazon book reviews to get an idea of his scholarship style, too).",
    "I would strongly recommend Professor Bloom's class to any student."
