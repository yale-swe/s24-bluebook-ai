   "comments": [
    "Well taught. Assignments online suck. Take some time each day to study the material and it is an easy class. Good class. It's a language, you get what you expect.",
    "If you can take it with Professor Sabe, do it. shes awesome and i actually enjoyed going to class",
    "Take it. you probably have to anyway.",
    "Yes if you need it for distributional. If not, no.",
    "Great language class!",
    "Pretty similar to L1 with a little more intensity. Get Prof. Lourdes Sabe, she's the best",
    "This class is a great introductory Spanish class. Professor Sabe makes the class interesting, and doesn't assign unnecessary or pointless work. Instead, she encourages students to push themselves with Spanish, and in the process, makes students more familiar and confident with the language as the semester goes on. I'd definitely recommend this class.",
    "I think that this course is like an intensive introduction to spanish. It is definitely harder than SPAN110 and requires more effort in all the areas: speaking, writing and reading. There's always some midterm or quiz or composition every other week. Be ready to put in a lot of work throughout your semester if you take this class because there is always work to do for the course right from the the shopping period till the finals. It never ends! Also you may find some people in your section who have had far much more experience in spanish than you do. So be ready to handle this pressure even though the class is not curved.",
    "I would recommend this class, just make sure you find a section with a good instructor because that will make all the difference.",
    "It's required. There's an extra column of work. Course is slightly improving over previous years. Example. Presentation is individual, not in a group."
