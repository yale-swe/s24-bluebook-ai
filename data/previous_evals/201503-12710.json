   "comments": [
    "If you need the math credit for the Physics major, sure. If you actually want to learn the advanced topics like complex analysis or differential equations, take another class.",
    "great math class that introduces physical concepts",
    "The class was amazing. Definitely take if Professor Baker is teaching. The professor was absolutely the best part of this class. He was kind, caring, intelligent, and extremely helpful. He was the best part of my semester.",
    "Take this course if you want some structural background in the math you need for physics courses, but it WILL NOT give you in depth knowledge on any of the topics touched upon. I'm taking another Linear Algebra course later on to make sure I have my linear skills up and running. That being said, the workload is relatively light, and the first half of the semester is a review of single variable functions and calculus - relatively easy stuff.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The material starts out slow because it starts basically from differential calculus, but it definitely picks up after the midterm. Professor Baker and Ferzan (the TA) are both great, super friendly, and very willing to help you individually if you are having trouble understanding certain concepts. Definitely take advantage of that.",
    "Phys 301 covers a lot of useful subjects without being too demanding. I would recommend this course to anyone who thinks they may be shaky on certain subjects.",
    "Useful course for introduction to a variety of material. The pacing is sometimes too fast and sometimes too slow, but in general pretty good. Professor Baker is an amazing person and professor who deeply cares about his students."
