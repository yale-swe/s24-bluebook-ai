    "Amazing class. Definitely challenging, and we read a LOT, but it got much faster by the end--Herodotus isn't a difficult read. Even if you're not sure if you're interested in Herodotus, take it with Bakker, who will show you how interesting he really is. It might just have been our group, but it also ended up being a really fun class--I looked forward to going to class every time.",
    "this was basically--i think--the fantasy of what a seminar is supposed to look like. it felt like our engagement with the material was so deep, but every minute of it was also so incredibly incredibly joyful. Professor Bakker is an extraordinary professor who makes you feel like you are receiving dispatches from directly inside the text itself, but who also just made this seminar so happy and relaxed--never at the expense of but always in the serve of substance. i imagine it's different depending on who is in it and how many people so it's hard to make any general recommendations, but i'm not sure i've ever enjoyed myself more in a class, in such a lovely intellectually fruitful way.",
    "Excellent. I came away with a good understanding of Herodotus and more confident in my understanding of Greek grammar. I have taken translation courses with several professors in the Classics Dept., and Professor Bakker is among the best."
