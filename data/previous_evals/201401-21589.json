    "You're probably a BME major if you're looking at this course- definitely don't worry about it! It's pretty interesting and the instructors are great. Some parts of the material are dry while others are super interesting (cardiovascular modeling, image processing). Problem sets and exams are fair and low-stress. Overall a solid course!",
    "BENG 352 is pretty good. I think the material is very interesting, although I know others thought it was kind of dry. I really like math and imaging, though, so maybe that was why it was good for me. Professor Duncan is really good, although he goes very fast, and Professor Staib is very boring (he speaks in a monotone). Overall it\u2019s a very good class, with problem sets that aren\u2019t too hard and tests that are fine because they\u2019re open note. I\u2019d recommend this class, although it doesn\u2019t really matter, seeing as how if you\u2019re BME you have to take it anyway.",
    "You will have to take it if you are a BME major. Be careful with the midterm and the final but the problem sets are not too bad.",
    "I leaned a lot in this class although it was not my subject of interest. The lectures could get a little dry near the end of the hour and fifteen minutes. The psets and tests were really reasonable. The final was probably the most reasonable final I've taken at Yale, nothing tricky and if you had done well on the psets you would have an idea of how to do everything.",
    "Best teaching fellow I've ever had in biomedical engineering! Extremely quick in her e-mail replies when I have a question. Her review sessions were very helpful and the homework solutions she puts up are very thorough. Definitely a huge asset to the class. Duncan and Staib definitely want everyone to do well in the class!",
    "Good course, great professors. Very interesting material! Teachers and TAs are extremely understanding and wiling I meet outside of class, so make sure you use these resources if you're having trouble.",
    "A good class if you are interested. Dont be fooled by open note exams- they can be deceptively hard. Just stay on top of the work if you can and try and resist the temptation to skip class.",
    "Biomedical Signals and Images covers concepts related to both 1D and 2D continuous and discrete signals. The organization of the class is really helpful to applying the old material to new lectures, and the weekly-ish problem sets aren't too difficult (especially with the help of the TAs in section). There is one midterm and the final, both open note, and they were both perfectly manageable with studying. If you're taking the class you probably have to, but if you're interested in signaling concepts, this class is a bit dry but interesting and not too bad at all.",
    "A decent course, the material could be interesting at times, but was for the most part an overview of signals. You have to take it for BME, if you're not BME, don't bother.",
    "Chances are if you are looking into taking this class you need it for the BME major. The material is interesting, fascinating, and very useful. But unfortunately the lectures can end up being dry. Even though the notes are posted online you should make every effort to go to class because, are you really going to go through 20+ lectures during reading period to cram for finals? You'll hate yourself.",
    "BENG 352 is an integration of physiology with mathematics and physics as well as an introduction to biomedical imaging. Students have the opportunity to learn concepts thoroughly, and I would recommend it, except obviously only to BME majors.",
    "The lectures aren't riveting, but the workload isn't bad. Exams are fair and straightforward."
