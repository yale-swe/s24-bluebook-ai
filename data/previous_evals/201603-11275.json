    "This class really helped me learn how to apply my mechanical engineering skills in the real world. I learned how to read and write technical reports on a topic that I was passionate about.",
    "Beth's lecture portion of the course was really great -- It was very informative without seeming tedious. There was always an application to the particular project people were working on.",
    "I learned how to develop and produce my own project",
    "This was a great experience, and a great opportunity to work on the skills you want to develop as an engineer.",
    "I learned an enormous amount of domain-specific biology material relating to my project, as well as a ton of general engineering. I've gotten better at CAD and rapid prototyping, learned basic Python, learned surface-mount soldering, and am much more confident in my abilities as an engineer. Additionally, I feel I've learned a great deal about professionalism in both writing and presentations from the in-class lecture portion. Fantastic course!",
    "I developed ways with which I can communicate my research effectively."

   "comments": [
    "I really liked it and thought it was run very well. I would suggest showing examples of very good presentations and technical reports done by students in the past as a target for current students.",
    "Well taught, very informative, and a nice balance between structure and milestones with independence.",
    "The skills lectures are far too basic and unnecessary",
    "Really excellent course. Loved the supplemental material as well as the freedom to pursue my own project.",
    "I appreciated that the course was tailored to help the students--the time spent on lectures and review was effective and efficient. To improve this course in the future, I think the length of the final paper can be slightly reduced."

   "comments": [
    "This class really helped me learn how to apply my mechanical engineering skills in the real world. I learned how to read and write technical reports on a topic that I was passionate about. I would suggest all mechanical engineering students take this course.",
    "If you have a particular project and an advisor in mind, then definitely! I learned the most at Yale through the independent projects I've worked on.",
    "Yes, you have to take the class in order to do a senior project. I loved conducting my own project, the course just seemed like something I had to do, however",
    "Fantastic course, both in the freedom it offers to pursue an independent project, and in the in-class training in professional writing and presentation. Great practice with writing technical reports and public speaking. Prof. Bennett is lovely and provides very helpful feedback.",
    "I would definitely recommend the independent research project experience for at least a semester!"
