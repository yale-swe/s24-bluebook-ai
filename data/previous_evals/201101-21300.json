    "I learned more about presenting in this seminar than the last seminar and feel I've improved. I would recommend it because it became interesting once we had basic knowledge and it became fun once we were all open to discuss both the paper topics and each other's presentations.",
    "Dear Future students,This course is an excellent seminar course where you will learn a great deal about the field and expand your speaking skills, presentation skills, and critical thinking skills. You will begin to analyze the literature and bring concepts together to form conclusions. This class will vastly improve the future of your scientific career.",
    "It is a semilar course specially designed for students interested in pharmacology research. During the seminar each student has chances to present papers. Students have plenty of time to communicate with the professor about any aspect of research that they are curious about. It is a great course so I would recommend it to other students.",
    "It is a mandatory course, so recommendation wouldn't influence a student much. However, an assessment of the course results in an overwhelmingly positive review.",
    "This is a degree requirement for Pharmacology, and I assume each of the BBS degrees has a similar seminar-style course."

   "comments": [
    "I learned about many biochemical and biophysical techniques that I would otherwise not have been exposed to. Though I will not likely be utilizing them in my research, understanding them makes reading research papers easier and more rewarding.",
    "This course will help me efficiently prepare for giving talks and will make me more conscious of my body language\/ stuttering\/ \"um\"ing and pace of delivery.",
    "This class has without a doubt contributed to my profession. I feel like I am a better presenter, speaker, and presentation designer because of this class. I can not begin to describe how far I have come in developing my skills because I had essential and relevant feedback that I used in improving my skills!",
    "This course greatly deepens my knowledge about structural pharmacology. I learned lots of skills about presenting as well. Communication with Professor Rudnick and peer students is very enlightening and also a lot of fun.",
    "It greatly assisted with getting familiar with biochemistry laboratory techniques.",
    "This course synergized well with the Structural Pharmacology course; I felt that I learned a tremendous amount this semester about crystal structures and their importance to determining a protein's mechanism of action and drug development."
