   "comments": [
    "It's a ton of work, but it's definitely worth it!",
    "Superintese and the perfect class if you REALLY want to learn Chinese. But be warned, it's going to consume you. And yes, I would recommend it, given this student has the capacity and a good reason to learn it. This is not the kind of Chinese class you should be taking if \"you just wanted to learn a little bit of Chinese\". This is the real thing.",
    "Any introductory language class will require enormous amounts of time. If you're aiming for an excellent grade on quizzes and homework, expect to spend at least an hour and a half preparing for each class period. It's possible to still perform at a decent level with less work, but you will not be able to learn the material as well, and that's important for the tests. Also, going to class everyday is extremely important; practicing the material is essential to learning the language. If you're willing and able to put in the time, this class is definitely worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's challenging but I learned a lot in one semester! You cover 10 chapters in the textbook and learn 300+ characters.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student only if they are prepared to spend about 2 hours a day for it. It was very hard work but also very rewarding.",
    "Absolutely take this class - you will have homework every day but it's always manageable, and the teachers all do a wonderful job of making sure you understand the material. You learn an incredible amount in one semester. However, only take it if you are sure that you are interested in the language - it is a lot of work and the material can definitely be difficult at times.",
    "Absolutely yes. Chinese is taught beautifully at Yale. In a short period of time, I have developed a level of Chinese that astounds most of my Chinese peers. I owe it all to my teachers who pretty much contribute days and days to their students, teaching a class every day, checking exam papers within two days, holding extended and convenient office hours and replying to all emails very efficiently. 1. The small size of the class (~9) really makes it a great freshman year and language experience. You are engaging throughout the classes, which are very chill and informal 2. The teachers can logically answer every meticulous grammar question. They know their stuff 3. There is an infinite amount of support available. I know a person who had three Chinese tutorials a week+the 5 usual Chinese classes because he needed the help. If you dont understand something and want to understand it, they will provide you a way of doing so 4. CHNS110 opens up the exciting possibility of a Light Fellowship, makes you laugh, introduces you to new friends\/great mentors, teaches you to write an elusive and beautiful script (youll feel so proud looking at your characters) 5. This class really is open to absolute beginners. There is no curve so your grade is COMPLETELY dependent on your hard work. Getting an A is not too hard and everything is just hard work *Note of caution: Chinese is a very very hard class. The first two months are hellish for those without a background. But it gets drastically easier in the last few months. There is a clear, repeating and easy-to-figure-out game to Chinese learning and exams. Once you figure that out (and almost everyone does), it wont be a primary course of concern even though it might seem like your only important class in the first two months.",
    "Chinese at Yale is definitely worth it. The teachers are excellent and I learned so much in one semester! The workload is pretty heavy and, to be honest, you can drown if you don't stay on top of things but the teachers are fantastic and always willing to help you out. You get out what you put in! If you're willing to spend time on the class and do all the work, you will reap all the benefits.",
    "I recommend it to anyone who is willing to spend most of their working hours studying Chinese. There is a LOT of work involved in this class, so be prepared to put in a few hours for homework and a few hours for studying for the every day quiz."
