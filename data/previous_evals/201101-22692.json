    "I absolutely loved this class. Karen is an incredible professor and going to Queer Ethnographies was the absolute highlight of my semester (except, of course, the walk all the way up to the anthro building). The reading list is, for the most part, fascinating. It's a pretty heavy amount ofwork (a book and 3-5 pages a week, for 9 out of 11 weeks if you're an undergrad), but Karen's not that picky of a grader and cares more about whether or not you contribute to the discussion than how nicely written your reading response is. Really enjoyable--definitely take it!",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. As a graduating senior, I'm so glad I decided to take this.",
    "It makes you think of queerness in a lot of different ways, and explore topics that you may think you have set opinions on, but you'll find the works read and discussions in class can lead you to question many things.",
    "Really in depth look at this category of queer ethnography. Brings a human element to what might otherwise be pretty dry theory. Comparison of research methods and topics is especially interesting. Be prepared for lots of work, and discussions may be somewhat difficult for people without background in sexuality\/gender studies.",
    "The course is really fun. You read some really good books - some of which are really seminal texts in queer anthropology - and I would think most people, especially those with less of a WGSS background, end up learning a lot and changing their own worldviews.Karen is amazing. She is a funny, sensitive seminar leader who cares a great deal about her students and their performance. I would take other classes that she offers if you get a chance.",
    "This is a great class, especially for those interested in the transnational study of gender and sexuality. The ethnographies are, for the most part, fascinating, and the discussions are a lot of fun. Reading a full ethnography and writing a precis (3-5 page response) each week is time-consuming, but doesn't take long to get used to. TAKE IT.",
    "YES. The workload's not as annoying as it seems.",
    "A great class to take just for fun, although be prepared to put effort into the readings (if not necessarily a ton of time, at least concentrated analysis of the ideas). Discussion is much more engaging if you've had time to fully read the book and watch the movie - and the movies are fantastically interesting, if heavy. Because we jump from book to book be prepared to have many unresolved thoughts about the works, but if you're interested in thought-provoking dicussion on engaging books, this is a stellar class."
