    "The perfect senior seminar. Brilliant professor who really cares, lots of fascinating material, gain tangible skills, very little work. Only be warned that Professor HIll can be difficult to read and you might have no idea what he thinks of you...ever. But don't mistake this for ignorance or apathy on his part: he really cares about the students and he observes everything.",
    "This is the perfect 2nd semester senior class. Super interesting, low stress, very enjoyable. You read classic speeches, deliver speeches, talk about good speech making. If you can get in, do it!",
    "Yes. No question.",
    "If you get in, absolutely take it. My advice on getting in: think about why you want to attend this class in advance and what sets you apart from other interested seniors, and write a compelling motivation.",
    "Would absolutely recommend. One of the few classes where I felt like I learned something from everyone in the room. Great class for second semester seniors.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. If you get in, take it. It is perfect course for second semester seniors--you will learn a ton of real world things and practical tools but won't do any unnecessary work. Perfect class.",
    "Take it! It's a must for every senior!",
    "One of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. Very small workload, but what we learned about current events and about how to present yourself when speaking is more valuable than what I've learned in perhaps every other class. A must-take if you are a senior.",
    "Harder to get into than it is to do well in this class. If you can get in, totally worth it. Interesting and topical.",
    "Great introduction to classics of oratory with a useful practical element",
    "Phenomenal class. If you can get in, you must take it.",
    "Chill class, good fifth credit, but dont expect to become a fantastic orator overnight.",
    "A class that addresses the liberal arts as much as oratory and statecraft. It ties the humanities to current events and your own life."
