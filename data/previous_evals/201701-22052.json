    "strengths - the syllabus is phenomenal! the papers\/ projects are so fun to work on!",
    "the syllabus is fantastic! prof stepto is extremely smart, he says interesting things, the readings are really interesting. that being said, he can talk for the majority of the two hour class so that it really feels more like a lecture than a seminar. it's sometimes hard to get a word in edgewise, class discussion doesn't really happen, and I am convinced that he didn't know our names until about week eight (and we also didn't know each other's names). so a mixed bag. but great to do the readings, lots of freedom for the writing, and very chill in general."

    "Absolutely! amazing classs. Professor Stepto is brilliant and the class is very engaging",
    "Professor Stepto is a delight. Unbelievably kind and esteemed in his field, full of stories. Class is mellow, and if you like more lecture-y seminars (a lot of Stepto talking) then this is a good call for you. I personally prefer hearing a lauded professor talking more than the students (not that people didn't talk, it was still a seminar in essence) so I was happy with this setup.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! There are many ways to learn in this course through discussion and visual engagement. It caters to different aspects of the educational experience. Listening is as valued as speaking, which is a trait in a class that I highly appreciate.",
    "Yes! This is a must take, especially since Prof. Stepto will be retiring soon.",
    "I would take this class twice if I could - it's very rich and all of the readings are wonderful for anyone studying non-fiction, American literature or American History, or is in any of Professor Stepto's departments. Though the seminar tends to be over-enrolled, Professor Stepto makes an effort to allow everyone a chance to get into the discussion, and assigns everyone in the class a week to lead the discussion alongside him. I've never enjoyed writing papers for a class at Yale more than for this seminar, and Professor Stepto is super receptive to creative ideas for completing the assignments. Subjective take: The readings can sometimes be long, but they're super enjoyable when the books are on the longer side (i.e. Richard Wright's \"Black Boy\")."
