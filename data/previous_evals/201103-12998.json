    "Good class if you want to learn Spanish. The teacher is very engaging but the material can be a tad dull at times.",
    "Yes, I would. I understand that most people take this class to fulfill and requirement and I would absolutely recommend taking it with Profesora Asensio-Manrique.",
    "The professor is great, she really helps her students with their speaking skills and it is an overall enjoyable class.",
    "Pilar is great! Take it with her and 5 day a week won't seem so bad.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 130, especially with Profesora Asensio (who is an awesome teacher - helpful and pretty chill). As long as you do the homework, which is graded daily, and study for the vocab quizzes, you can do well.",
    "Good class for improving Spanish skills."
