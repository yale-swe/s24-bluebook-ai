   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend it, the final project is really cool and you can dive into any representation of a group through material culture and relate it to your life.",
    "This class is disjointed and doesn't seem to have a \"thesis.\" The readings and poorly led discussions do not seem to connect or relate to one another.",
    "Sure. Not too hard for a junior seminar, but there are probably more engaging ones out there, especially if you're not really into the topic. Good course. The professor definitely put a ton of time and effort into the course. She was also flexible and understanding, which is nice. But still definitely a demanding class. Interesting topic, but pretty specific, so you have to actually be interested in it to understand. Sometimes the class felt a little scattered though, and making things more clear (like assignments, etc) could have been helpful.",
    "An interesting examination of material culture and race, with varied texts. It was the first time it was offered so it was a little lacking in organization\/cohesion but it was still worthwhile. The assignments leading up to the final paper were all really helpful and relevant, not busy work. I'd recommend it.",
    "YES - fascinating topic; you'll really learn a lot. Professor Yokota is engaging and class discussions are extremely interesting. You'll have a book to read per week plus a reading response. The course cumulates in a final research paper (15-20 pages long) but the work you do throughout the semester helps you prepare for it.",
    "No. Absolutely do not take this class. You will regret it. Promise.",
    "it's a really good introduction to material culture in america. if you've ever really wanted to try to understand the status quo of possession, this is a great way to do so."
