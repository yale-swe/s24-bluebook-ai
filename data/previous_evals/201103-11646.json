   "comments": [
    "German 125 is amazing. Herr Stern makes this class, which has the potential to be terrible, one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. While you will have to put in work to get anything out of the class (Herr Stern constantly reminds us that it was \"our decision to learn German in the first place\"), he makes it fun and exciting. Herr Stern is incredibly knowledgeable and wants you to excel, which makes it easy for you to want to learn. Furthermore, you will learn more about Mozart than you could possibly care to in one sitting...",
    "You will learn German grammar. You will learn culture. You will learn poetry.You will not speak. You will not be permitted creativity.You will want to dive at Stern across the table, Mean Girls cafeteria-style.In conclusion, take this class if you really, really want to learn German grammar (although the regular-paced classes will be miles ahead of you in speaking), don't mind long-winded digressions early in the morning, and have absolutely no need for an instructor to take you seriously (at least not for the first few months).",
    "Take this class if you want to learn German for advanced reading or scholarship. You won't get much experience speaking in this term, so if you just want to learn conversation you might want to take the regular L1 course.",
    "Do not fall behind...",
    "This class will teach you German very well, but some days you will probably wake up wondering why you enrolled in the course. Having 2 hours of class every day can get annoying, and Stern doesn't take very kindly if you're late, even if it's only by a minute. There's a fair amount of work, but I would say that it amounts to less than the combined amount of two 1 credit classes. Overall the course is a worthwhile, though not always pleasant, experience.",
    "Howard Stern is an inspirational person and a great teacher. If you're willing to put the needed effort, I recommend this class a hundred percent. However, if you plan on just getting by, you should consider other options because Howard Stern does not do well with mediocrity.",
    "I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Two hours each morning with H. Stern. I think I would like to do it every day for the rest of my life.",
    "This seemed like a good course. I think the book and professor give much more precise and detailed explanations than you would get in the ordinary intro. It would be difficult not to keep up and learn everything as long as you have time to drill yourself on vocabulary, word order, conjugation \"finger exercises\", and audio."
