   "comments": [
    "This course would be helpful for someone who is interested in theoretical aspects of environmental security\/conflict.",
    "The professor is really helpful when it comes to preparing for the final paper.",
    "Yes, very few courses with this content at Yale.",
    "Would not recommend it for the reasons cited above.",
    "IR 613 examines the intersection of environmental issues with international relations and security issues. It looks specifically at how environmental challenges can manifest themselves into security challenges. The emphasis is definitely on the environment over security, and not the other way around.I would recommend the course for those with an interest in how the environment might affect international security policy. The focus, however, is not on geopolitics, or even the environment and geopolitics, with the exception of a few classes toward the end of the semester (such as the classes on the Nile, the Middle East and water, and Gulf oil and the United States). I would have liked to have seen more of an emphasis on natural resources and geopolitics, and I would have preferred spending another two classes or so on oil and its related geopolitical issues.The workload for the class is manageable.",
    "Yes-- incredibly applicable to our society today."

   "comments": [
    "The course taught me how to view international relations from an environmental perspective, and it exposed me to the very real threat that natural resource shortages have on international security. This was a good professional development course for anybody hoping to go into national security policy. The issues examined are critical for national security policy making.",
    "A vast amount. My research will be significantly enhanced by this course-- thank you!"
