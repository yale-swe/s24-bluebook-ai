   "comments": [
    "I became a better writer, and applying the tools Professor Ehrgood taught us helped me think more clearly and state my arguments more concisely and persuasively.",
    "This class dramatically improved my writing and taught me to make a legal argument. I've taken several writing credits at Yale, but this class taught me to write like no other that I've taken in my life.",
    "The ability to think and write about the law!",
    "In this class, you'll learn how to analyze law, develop well-written arguments, and avoid some major pitfalls of legal writing. But most importantly, you'll learn how to properly craft a sentence.",
    "I strengthened my prose and constructed my arguments with greater care. I prioritized word choice and sentence structure in a way I never have before.",
    "I have never spent as much time and effort on my writing as I did for this class. In this class, I worked on my weaknesses and learned new skills. Professor Ehrgood provided clear feedback, so I knew what aspects of my writing needed improvement. Our class discussions taught me how to build and present arguments.",
    "I learned how to make and analyze legal arguments and how to address counterarguments. I learned how to distinguish a legal argument from a moral one. I learned how to listen to myself as I wrote, and to be more conscientious about the way I construct sentences than I ever have before. I came out of this class with both better analytical chops and better stylistic chops. I have never been able to argue so systematically and comprehensively. And I have never written with more clarity or less ambiguity.",
    "The class teaches two skills: clear writing and clear thinking about legal issues. I can now identify where my writing is clumsy or confusing and fix it in a methodical way. We learned how to think like a lawyer and construct the types of arguments that lawyers use. We drilled all of these skills so that they come much more naturally now."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was extremely well-organized: I think a major strength was that every reading we did was not only interesting, but also relevant to the course.",
    "I only have one idea to improve the course: make a new homework assignment. After a while, I began to recognize examples of bad writing all around me in everyday life. The other day, for example, I came across a book with the subtitle \"Business secrets I only tell my daughters.\" It *should* be: \"Secrets I tell only my daughters.\" Though we do revise our own writing in many cases, I think an assignment that challenged us to find writing mistakes in the real world would be a fun way for us to internalize the rules we learn and see how they affect us when other people make them.",
    "The strength of this course is the amount of time that Professor Ehrgood commits to each student. The weekly conferences really help you improve as a writer and understand the course material better. As for a weakness, at times the homework can seem like busy work and I wonder how much of it is necessary.",
    "Flawless course.",
    "This class, taught by Ehrgood, has no weaknesses.",
    "I think this course is very well taught and all the coursework has been very effective. I see so much improvement in my own writing.",
    "The readings in this class were very relevant, interesting, and helpful. I thought the homework was very substantial (I had to think for a long time just to produce a single sentence or paragraph) but useful in synthesizing the arguments I read. The in-class discussions helped me understand important arguments as well as become aware of counterarguments I hadn't considered before. I really enjoyed the rigor of thinking about how to address counterarguments. I thought the one-on-one meetings with the professor helped me both assess my progress through the class and clarify material I hadn't understood very well the first time through.",
    "Strengths: Professor Ehrgood is 200% in: he meets with students one-on-one regularly and gives very helpful feedback. In class hes engaging, kind, and entertaining, and guides the discussion deftly. Course assignments are creative and interesting. Workshopping peer's paper was a great chance to learn from one another. Weaknesses: None. There's a lot of work but it's all worth it."

   "comments": [
    "Whether or not somebody is interested in becoming a lawyer, I definitely recommend this course. I learned numerous important writing principles, and had the opportunity to delve into fascinating cases.",
    "Take this class! Ehrgood is the best professor I've had at Yale by a mile, and he could not make the material easier to learn. Highly recomend",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. There are lots of writing credits at Yale, but I feel that few classes actually make you a better writer. This class is the exception. Every homework assignment improves your writing and Professor Ehrgood meets with you on several occasions to talk about your writing. As someone who is interested in law school, I think this class gave me a window into making legal arguments and the kind of assignments I would see in law school. The writing assignments are fun and the class discussions are lively.",
    "Yes, yes, yes! Ehrgood is a phenomenal instructor who devotes so much of his time to the course (he even agreed to conference my midterm paper with me over the phone during fall break). The material is fascinating, and I'd still recommend taking the class just for Ehrgood even if it weren't. The workload is much higher at the beginning of the term, but Ehrgood does a good job of spreading it out so that you don't feel overwhelmed at the worst times of the semester.",
    "Yeah, but know going in that it is ultimately about the law. You should be interested in the subject before taking the class.",
    "The class is a must-take! Your life won't be the same after having taken it.",
    "If you're interested in law, take this course. If you're not interested in law, take this course. If you want to substantially improve your writing, take this course. In summary, take this course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This is a sure way to improve your writing. It's a lot of work, but its absolutely worth it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "I would recommend this student to any student who wants to significantly improve their writing ability, especially anyone interested in studying law. The class challenges your reasoning.",
    "I would recommend this course without reserve to another student, provided he or she is willing to do the work. In the argumentative portion of the class, you learn how to construct and analyze legal arguments, and to state the main points concisely and comprehensively. You also learn how to respond to counterarguments and make nuanced points. In the stylistic portion, you learn how to maximize concision and minimize ambiguity. In both portions of the class, you receive concrete, implementable strategies that noticeably improve your writing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Its by far the best writing class Ive ever taken, and gives students the opportunity to think about some of the most interesting legal issues. Take it for Professor Ehrgood, whose attention to detail and to his students is unparalleled."
