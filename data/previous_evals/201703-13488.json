    "make more background readings available, other resources.",
    "This is an excellent class and definitely the best class I have taken at Yale, and possibly the best class I've ever taken in university\/grad school. I learned so much and everything was so applicable to what I want to study.",
    "Interesting, relevant content. The course would be vastly improved by a weekly section lead by a TA. It would help students to solidify the concepts from class, review the homework, and clarify anything we didn't understand before stepping up a level the next week. It often felt like \"the blind leading the blind\" when doing the homework as a group and then deciphering our grade afterwards. TA office hours were packed and often didn't answer our base level questions, so we stopped going.",
    "great subject, great professor",
    "easy to understand",
    "phenomenal class! I just wish that there was more grading structure so we could know where we stand.",

He is absolutely dedicated to his students, the material, and ensuring we all learn the material thoroughly. He was able to relate concepts from class to both health policy as well as everyday occurrences.",
