   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you are willing to put in a lot of work. It relies on self initiative. There are two sides of the class, very intertwined with one another: tech and commercialization. The tech teams do design, testing and research. The comm team does research, research, more research and some writing. Both are very rewarding and both can seem overwhelming.Take this class if you are interested in app tech design (ie not useless gadgets), international development (esp in Sub-Saharan Africa), or product commercialization (esp in developing countries).",
    "Take it!!! Amazing opportunity, you'll learn a ton. A lot of the class structure comes from the students, though, so be very aware, and make sure your teams get work high quality work done on a timely basis, otherwise you'll be really cramming at the end of the semester.",
    "Definitely. Take it, whether you are an engineering major or not, you'll get something out of this class.",
    "Appropriate Technology for the Developing World is by far the best engineering class I have taken at Yale. The class allows you to become immersed in a very challenging and fascinating problem over the course of a semester, and challenges you create something that will function with the ultimate goal of improving someone's livelihood. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in international development, or an interesting in the engineering design process, as this course caters to both of those interests. I especially enjoyed the interdisciplinary aspects of this class.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "Incredible course, like nothing else at Yale. You get to attack real-world problems whose answers aren't in the back of any book. The professors both guide and share in the experience, inspiring a truly collegiate atmosphere. The interdisciplinary nature of the course forces you to see the complexity of the problem in a multidimensional way and consider all of the sides of both the challenge and solution. You will work hard and be rewarded.",
    "Definitely. I loved that this class made use of people from different disciplines, and schools. I also loved that it was an applied design class--it felt like I was helping make a difference in the world. For me, it seemed like it was a huge amount of work since I had very little background in the area, but I would definitely do it again\/take it next semester if I weren't graduating.",
    "Appropriate Technology is an awesome, incredibly unique class. Working with engineers and non-engineers alike in a design class is a novel experience, one that Professor Morrell and Joe Zinter put together incredibly well. You should expect to put in a good amount of time and energy into this class, but it's totally worth it. Don't let the high-level MENG course number scare you, even if you're not an engineer - in fact, commercialization was a significant aspect of the course. And hey, you might even meet some important people.",
    "Take this class. Absolutely.",
    "Dont have any expectations, just take the class. Amazing blend of social and engineering problem solving.",
    "i would take the class, but i would be involved in the design side of it. if you're not a mech-e person then i would be hesitant and would meet with morrell before deciding.",
    "Cool experience, but don't expect a design class. It's more of a work-for-a-design-firm class. The class will get better each year it's offered.",
    "I highly recommend it. Don't worry about your background because you have great instructors to guide you through. It was the most fun class I have ever had at Yale",
    "ME491 is unique in many ways and all the better for it. To name a few strengths:- it is about solving a real-world problem- it is interdisciplinary and features both a tech design team and a commercialization team- it is the one product design-y course at Yale (you think more about the end user than in 489)My overall assessment of the course is that it was a great and unique experience. It felt less like a class, which allows for a different kind of learning (and perhaps a more applicable one). I would definitely recommend it to other students and to continue next year."
