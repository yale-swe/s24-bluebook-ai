    "This is an excellent class taught by a great instructor who is unfortunately leaving after this semester. It would be in the best interest of the School to make finding a comparable replacement a top priority",
    "Note that i took this class for 2 credits and did not take part in the client practicum.",
    "The TA was crucial to my success in the class and my understanding of material glossed over in class. She was patient, reliable, responsive, and genuinely seemed to both enjoy the material and helping students. Overall, she was excellent!",
    "Q 7a. One of the best instructors I've ever had - great at explaining technical concepts in a way that is simple to understand. Matt Eckelmann will be sorely missed by FES students. I would have taken any class taught by him.Q7b. Fantastic TA - very dedicated and willing to meet up with students to help.Q10. I think this is an essential class for anyone seriously considering working in industry and manufacturing. More classes at FES should be skills-based as this one was.",
    "Class is a whole lot of work.",
    "Question 3: I wish I had more time to do the readings, but because between those and the assignments I didn't, I lost out on that additional understanding of the material. Cutting down on the reading might help make it feel more manageable.",
    "The best course at FES.",
    "Very valuable course for understanding the principles of LCA and the specifics of Sima Pro software.",
    "I think he homework assignments could be better, sometimes the questions were to open ended and I didnt know what I was doing. (you can do it but you dont understand exactly what it means)",
    "Professor Eckelman has prepared an excellent curriculum for learning the theory and practice of life cycle impact assessments. I am very glad I was able to learn from him during his final semester at Yale."

    "Doing LCAs through the homework problem sets.",
    "The professor was one of the best I've ever had. The assignments were very helpful to understanding the material. The best part is that I learned an entirely new skill that is directly applicable to my future career ambitions.",
    "The projects!",
    "Patience and teaching style of instructor.",
    "Excellent course! The best course of my semester. Learned so much in the computer program, SimaPro. Loved working with an outside organization. Was excellent professional experience. Matt Eckelman is an excellent professor.",
    "The practical skills it taught, and the overall framework through which to think about the lifecycle of a product or service. Also, the chance to work with a real life client to apply those skills is critical.",
    "Learning LCA!",
    "The final project and Matt Eckelman is an amazing teacher.",
    "The topic is essential for environmental managers; Matt is a terrific teacher. It's quite disappointing that he will no longer be at Yale.",
    "Matt is a fantastic professor and this course is incredibly valuable for learning LCA. Another great part of the class is the practicum aspect and working for a client and doing a real LCA study.",
    "the course content",
    "A complete understanding of creating LCA reports, and immediately applying this knowledge to creating such a report for clients.",
    "The practical learning. There are so many courses at professional schools that focus on theory without really giving students any hands-on experience. This class was by far one of the best I have taken.",

   "comments": [
    "We were not able to use one of the well known-LCA modeling softwares, GABBI - which would have been beneficial to work with as well.",
    "Getting the software environment working properly from day 1.",
    "No complaints.",
    "Assignments seemed poorly formed\/written, and were often very difficult to understand. The TF even had a hard time understanding what the professor wanted, and points were often taken off because the question was very uncertain.",
    "I don't have a way to address this comment, but I will make it in hopes that someone with more experience could some up with a solution: It seems to me that the likelihood of learning SimaPro and LCA concepts are easy enough to learn before a semester is up, and the teaching course is well designed to accomplish this with good time remaining. However, to be a good LCA practitioner, it's all about making good\/best decisions, and that comes with extensive experience that can't be captured in class length (though it can begin to be captured through the final project and interactions with instructor about the project, expertise that is shared, etc). However, if there is a way in final classes to talk about what constitutes good decision-making through specific case studies or something other than just the readings on topics might be interesting. It as it this point in last few weeks of class that I guess I'm wondering if there is a way for teacher to be more assertive\/vocal\/lecture-oriented about how to cultivate good decision-making, or looking at specific instances if possible, would be good.This is not a call for a radical shift in last few weeks, but a slightly different addition to the usual mix which is good.",
    "Many concepts were learned quite quickly, and we used them in our project with the outside organization, so had to access the professor and TA for help. They were always available. There is so much to learn and it's hard to cram into 1 semester, so we weren't able to cover many of the concepts very in depth.",
    "I thought the few classes at the end where we talked about \"special topics\" could have been a bit better. The discussions lasted way too long and so few people in the class did the reading that it was painful at times when the professor was attempting to solicit responses from people. I think maybe only doing one of those \"special topics\" classes would be necessary, and spending the other class either reviewing stuff we already learned earlier in the class or doing multiple classes on certain topics (i.e. a crash course in how to do very basic things in SimaPro) would be useful.",
    "Full access to the pro version of the software, and very clear explanations of the conceptual material. There was a lot I didn't understand after the lectures.",
    "FES should have kept Matt",
    "It should have had many fewer students. In the course listing, enrollment is limited to 18, but that wasn't the case this semester. A smaller class would have been great.",
    "I think the course could be improved by having more in-class demonstrations of using SimaPro. While these are tedious I think it would be very helpful if Matt showed us more aspects of SimaPro.",
    "I think it was perfect.",
    "The homeworks could be phrased more carefully.",
    "This class was very good.",
    "the problem sets",
    "Reliable access to server-based life cycle assessment software tools.",

    "This class provided one of the only opportunities to learn a clearly marketable skill. I expect to use LCA as a professional, and am glad I was able to take it.",
    "I think this course should be a central class to the industrial ecology track. I think more classes should mimic this style and focus practical skill building. Many of the industrial ecology classes are \"soft science\" and stay in theory. I felt that this class actually will give me a heads up from my competitors when applying for professional positions and when trying to develop practical and implementable solutions once I get a position.",

    "As I'm interested in corporate sustainability and green business, this class gave me a great skill that can be used in this field. LCA is growing in use and popularity so it's a great skill to have on your resume.",
    "As an architect, the performance of each material, as well as the building or a community as a whole, relies on the understanding of it aas a whole system. Only life cycle analysis can offer a fair, comprehensive way to compare a diversity of options to each other in terms of impacts on human health and the environment.",

    "Great for 2 minds to work on a complex project. Because of the complexity, the time commitment was higher than original expectations.",

I also think that because it forced us to combine our skills and knowledge in such a new subject matter in order to complete the assignment, we all benefited from what each other brought to the table.",
    "advantages - different perspectives. disadvantages - some people are more perfectionist, leading to wasted time.",
    "Loved my group work- very effective and very fun",
    "Advantages: distributing work forthe final project.Disadvantages: the group work creates an incentive for the group to operate at the \"lowest common denominator\", i.e. the group works at the level of the person with the least knowledge and the least motivation. This has little to do with this course specifically but is simply how these things work.",

The class will give you a great introduction for how to use SimaPro, the limits of LCA analysis, and how businesses are using LCA today. Highly recommend taking this course. Get an early start on the practicum project and hound your clients for data!",
