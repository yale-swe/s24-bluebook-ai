    "The TA for this course, Henry Glick, was incredible. He was the best TA I've ever had in a university course. He was extremely dedicated to ensuring we learned and understood all the material.The course was excellent, but I would recommend having it meet for 3 hours M and W, but just for the first half of the semester, so the course can run while leaves are still on the trees."

Very satisfying to see how you become more and more confident week after week and are able to take in an increasing amount of information.Also, kudos to Henry Glick for being the most amazing, dedicated and knowledgeable taxonomy TA of all time.",

There is too much information and it's hard to know what we should learn and what we should discard. It would be nice if the slides were given an update next year.",

    "I am an international student and will probably not be working in New England after I graduate, so I've often been told that taking this class was a waste of my time. I don't agree about that. Coming from another part of the world, you find yourself at a disadvantage compared to people who grew up here and are familiar with local ecosystems. Plus if you don't know what concrete is, you'll have a hard time learning about architecture... I would feel bad taking decisions as a forestry professional without knowing my portfolio of species.",
    "To familiarize myself with the trees and shrubs that we will be working with for the next two years.",
    "In order to understand forests, you have to know which trees are present and how they relate to each other. Therefore, I felt like it was essential for me to have a thorough understanding of dendrology to be able to successfully work in the field."
