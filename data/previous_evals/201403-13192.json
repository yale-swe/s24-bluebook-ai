    "YES! Useful no matter what your background",
    "I very much enjoyed ENGL 344 for its unique content and approach to \"global fictions\" or \"world literature\" as it is commonly called. The texts that we read in class were very interesting and were unlike any texts that I have engaged in during my time at Yale. I was definitely forced to see the material in a different light through a combination of \"close\" and \"distant reading\" and to relate these readings to a much broader set of themes (and \"vectors of globalization\"). Professor Neuman is an incredibly engaging lecturer who clearly cares a lot about the class and the students. His weekly lunches were also a nice idea and really added to the feeling that he was open to hearing student input. The only real weakness of the class was that occasionally it felt like some of the connections made were a little far-fetched! Other than that, ENGL 344 is probably one of the more unique classes on offer.",
    "This course was a good survey of some excellent literature, from Forster to Rushdie and Buck to Kincaid. It employed an interesting perspective to analyze the books that we read - we examined them as manifestations of various cultural, political, and economic trends relating to globalization. Consequently, you learn a fair bit of history in addition to getting exposure to a wide variety of novels. Professor Neuman was an excellent lecturer. His capacity to weave together disparate images, data, and details from the novels to create a coherent argument was quite impressive, and he has a cheery, pleasant disposition. He also was very committed to making himself accessible to students: he made a point of having regular office hours, eating lunch with students, and encouraging people to come talk to him. The atmosphere during lectures was also quite relaxed, and he welcomed questions and tried to engage students in the lecture. All of these things made Professor Neuman an outstanding professor. Two quibbles: (1) Part of the point of the course was to use the texts as jumping-off points for examining broader ideas, so some digressions into tangentially related topics was to be expected, but some of the lectures seemed to focus excessively on theory or things that were peripheral to the texts themselves. (2) I didn't feel like I had a good handle on how to write the two papers that we were assigned, especially the second one, as the prompts were fuzzy. I anticipate that both of these issues will be resolved for the next iteration of this course, however. I recommend taking this course, especially if you're looking for an interesting intersection of literature, politics, and history.",
    "Absolutely outstandingtake it!",
    "I would recommend it only if you take incredibly great notes while still managing to understand what's going on. Not for people with a short attention span. Started off as a promising course, but I ultimately lost the big picture in some of the lectures. I think this would work better if it went back to being a seminar. Also, the Prezi was not exactly the best way to study for the final. It would have been helpful to have some more concrete presentation slides or even a review session to cover things we might have missed in the fast-paced lectures. I like Professor Neuman's passion, but it can be channelled into more organization if he decides to keep the lecture format.",
    "Global Fictions is a great English lecture. The novels are interesting reads, and Professor Neuman is a high-energy lecturer.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, regardless of major. You read an excellent set of novels and then talk about historical context. The workload was really not too bad (two papers, one final). It's a different mode of reading and writing than your typical English class, but for me that was one of the most interesting pieces of the class trying out a type of analysis that I hadn't ever before.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Two papers, one final. Very good class, prepare to be engaged in class and section.",
    "Prof. Neuman is a great lecturer. The course is eclectic and mostly just involves reading a bunch of unrelated books, which is not the most inspiringly brilliant idea for a class; still, it worked because the books were good. There's not an enormous amount of work: only two essays. These essays were sort of confusing though; my TA had very specific ideas about how to correctly write an English paper, and graded essays according to this standard, but she didn't really adequately explain what the standard was beforehand, and in my opinion it was a standard that was in any case extremely debatable. This was weird especially given that the class was in part intended for non-English majors, and therefore should really be open to different ways of reading a novel.",
    "The lectures were captivating Professor Neuman is a very erudite speaker. However, I'm not entirely sure what I learned from his course. Lectures consisted mainly of tangents about things related to the books we were reading. They were interesting tangents, but tangents nonetheless they didn't feel very cohesive. Section was a major disappointment my TF was a 3rd year law student with no academic experience in English literature, and it showed. Do I regret taking the course? No, because I hadn't read E.M. Forster before taking it (and to me it was worth it just for that). Would I take the course again? No, unless I had an awesome TF. I didn't particularly care for most of the books (except I LOVED Howards End), so this course ended up serving to show me what kinds of literature I don't enjoy.",
    "Global Fictions is a fantastic literature class for those who love English, but it is also a necessary class for those who might be more averse to the subject. It places important literary works into the worlds that surrounded them at their time of production, and integrates literature into other \"vectors of globalization\" like religion, drugs, sex, and war. Literary works are important historical commodities, and that fact fully comes to light in this course. The progression of works is seamless and each lecture brings something new and important to the table. The only flaw seemed to be that we didn't have enough time to get as in-depth as I was used to for some texts, but each text was necessary to the course, so I guess it's just a give and take in a lecture. I would definitely recommend the class to ANYONE interested in history, politics, econ, or english. Must take. Professor Neuman is really a genius, and it's great to hear him lecture on this subject as his own work emerges in the field.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The course was really interesting and I feel like I learned a lot. Prof. Neuman provided an exciting platform to engage with new material that we aren't often exposed to in the English department. The course covered a lot of information and material, which centered on literature but also engaged several other subjects that made the course really nuanced and exciting to come to lecture. Prof. Neuman was a really engaging professor and I feel like I learned a lot from him. His lectures were always high energy, and I found it a lot of fun to learn from him. He challenged us to think in a new ways that I haven't been exposed to before. It was a bit different at first but I really appreciated it in the end. This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would. It's an excellent overview of the relationship between literature and globalization. Showing the complicated, globalized, colonized, colonizing, etc. contexts of the books and the authors discussed in the class."
