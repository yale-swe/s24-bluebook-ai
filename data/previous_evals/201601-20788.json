    "If you are interested in Russia and is willing to push your academic boundaries - this is the class for you!",
    "Great class, incredible professor. The readings were great, the discussion was good, and Prof. Rogers is truly amazing. He encourages his students to do amazing work, and really wants us to learn and think about the world in new ways. He is incredibly knowledgeable about Anthropology and Russia, and that made the class very fun. Prof. Rogers is my favorite professor at Yale, by far. He is an engaging speaker, a great discussion leader, and a fair grader. He is very committed to his student's academic development in a way that is truly special.",
    "Looking at Russia through an anthropological lens is fascinating. It takes a much different approach from a Russian history class-- the information you get is much more \"bottom-up\" and grounded in lived experience. You get a really good sense about how changes in the government structure after the fall of the Soviet Union manifested on the ground. The class focused more on Russian than \"its neighbors\" (though we did read an ethnography on Georgia), but you learn about regions other than Moscow and St. Petersburg. Professor Rogers also made an effort to tailor the class to our interests. Mix of undergrad and grad so you learn a lot just by listening to the members of the class! Reading hovers around ~275 pages a week, a short midterm book review, and a long (16-18 pages for undergrads) research paper at the end. I recommend it!",
    "Take it if you're interested in the region or anthropology!"
