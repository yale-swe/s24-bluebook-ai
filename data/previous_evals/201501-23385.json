    "I enjoyed the class, and its critical assessment of papers. I feel I grew as a scientist and critical thinker through the discussions. The strengths were the focus on student input and presentation, and the visiting presenters. A weakness would perhaps be the unpredictable nature - it was helpful at the end to know what papers to focus on, as this led to a more focused discussion (we were able to fully digest and consider a subsection, rather than try to recall all the details of all the articles). The visiting researchers were fantastic. It was wonderful to learn about certain subjects in such detail, and to hear their sides (beyond what they were able to put into a paper).",
    "I really enjoyed this course - the small size and interactive nature were great for engaging with the material. The student presentations and group exercises were well executed, and discussions with students from a variety of backgrounds contributed a lot to my learning experience. I also enjoyed the guest speakers - getting to have dinner and hear about their experiences as scientists was enlightening, and I appreciated the opportunity to learn beyond the classroom."

    "This is a very dynamic and interactive class. Dr. Stearns is very knowledgeable and opinionated, and drives a very intriguing discussion. It was helpful to learn about a wide variety of subjects and to break away from particular field.",
    "Highly recommend - Dr. Stearns was great to work with, and the material is absolutely fascinating."
