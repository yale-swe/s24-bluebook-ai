    "You should take this class for Professor LeVen alone. Euripides is a great bonus though - his play inspires both intellectual thought and thorough grammar reviews.",
    "Great class if you are moderately to reasonably good at Greek. I put in a lot of hours, but it was never tedious and always pretty enjoyable. Pauline in particular was great -- we spent a lot of time discussing the themes\/ideas of the play, but somehow we really stayed focused on the text.If you have the interest, have some time to put into it, and if they offer it with Pauline again, you should definitely take it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to another student who feels confident reading approximately 60 to 100 lines before each class (roughly 3 to 4 hours).",
    "Be prepared to do lots of work: the workload is very heavy in this course (both translation and other assignments and evaluations), but the labor is worthwhile. Prof. LeVen is an engaging, knowledgeable, and helpful professor--you will learn a lot about Greek drama, Euripides\u0092 plays, and Greek grammar.",
    "Absolutely - the text (Helen) is really enjoyable and interesting, and the course is well taught."
