    "Unfortunately, this was my second semester taking the seminar (as required) and we had many of the same presenters as last year, giving the same presentations. There was a lot of repeat.",
    "Good talks",
    "Weekly seminar in environmental health. A good sampling of the EHS professors and phD students. Helpful for getting to know the work of the department, though gets somewhat repetitive by the end of the semester.",
    "The speakers were inadequate this semester. It was much preferable when outside department speakers were brought and it was held in a true seminar format. We already have enough exposure to departmental research initiatives because of the small size of our department\/program.",
    "The seminar provides a good way for first year EHS students to learn about the environmental science's multiple fields and recent updates of EPH faculties. However, for second year, this semester's seminar is more like a repetitive lecture series.Last year, we had second year students presenting their summer internship\/research project in the seminar. Everyone loves it as it provides a opportunity for second year students to know what their peer classmates was doing and for first year student to learn what kind of summer project could be. However, I'm quite disappointed that the students' presentation is not included in the seminar this year at all.",
    "Great class, great speakers.",
    "It was very interesting to have a seminar where we were able to learn about all sorts of projects going on that I probably would not have known about otherwise. Enjoyed it a lot.",
    "There are none. This class was fine if you wanted to know what professors are doing in the department. This class was sort of a wast of time.",
    "I enjoyed all of the various speakers that came in and presented their research material."
