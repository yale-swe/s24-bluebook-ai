    "A fiction workshop. You present two stories and a revision of one of them later on, and read\/comment on the work of others.",
    "I definitely learned a lot in this course; I'm glad I took it.",
    "Engl 458 is a \"professional-feeling\" writing workshop. I would recommend the class for anyone lucky enough to be offered a spot!",
    "It is a great way to develop your own writing while being exposed to your fellow students' work. Professor Cunningham creates a warm, laid-back discussion environment, which is extremely productive. I definitely recommend this class if you have the opportunity to take it.",
    "This class allows you the opportunity to create pieces of fiction and have them reviewed by your peers and also buy one of the greatest writers of our time. It is an amazing opportunity, and the more you put into your own stories the more you will get out of the class. The class also becomes a wonderful community, and I believe that we will stay close moving on to future semesters at Yale.",
    "I would highly recommend the course. Cunningham makes it amazing. It is freeing and you will grow as a writer."
