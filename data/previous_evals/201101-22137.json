   "comments": [
    "This class is definitely a time commitment-- you always have work to do, and it never ends! The material is much more interesting than 152, so I would recommend it if you can deal with Kang Laoshi's bluntnessand put in the time needed to stay on top of the assignments. As with first semester, there will probably be a huge range of language abilities in the class, and those who have a stronger background in Chinese will naturally find the course easier than those who are just coming back from the Light Fellowship. I'm not sure that I'll remember much of the vocabulary we learned, but at least I got to keep reading, writing, and speaking Chinese for a semester.",
    "The class was difficult, but now that it's over I realized my Chinese improved by a lot. If you know your schedule allows you to spend enough time and effort on this class, and you especially want to improve your Chinese reading and writing, it's worth taking.",
    "The workload is challenging, Kang Laoshi has higher standards, but worth taking if you are serious about improving your Chinese. I feel that my writing and reading have improved immensely, and that I've developed a much stronger 'feel for the language.' I've found that the online quizzes and the recordings to be marginally useful in improving my Chinese, but the essays\/grammar were very effective. Also, if Qian Chen is TA, totally take it - he is fantastic and genuinely cares about helping you out."
