    "Manageable workload, good class to take if you are interested in chns literature and maintaining high level chinese.Mostly reading and writing focused.",
    "If you like Su Wei, it's a great course. You can get a lot out of the course if you push yourself and put the effort in.",
    "Sure, why not?! Professor Su is nice, and the class has a manageable workload. It'd be great.",
    "The course is great if you're interested in learning a lot about the time period of focus (1911-1949) in China. The works can only really be analyzed by understanding the time period in question and the societal changes going on at the time, so if you're interested in straight up literary analysis and language usage you'll have to do a lot of the thinking and writing for that on your own. But Su Laoshi is funny and engaging, and very patient with different skill levels.",
    "This course will almost certainly not exist next year, as there's a huge curricular revision in the works. This is probably a good thing: this course allowed us to read some important and interesting works of modern (1910s-1960s) Chinese literature, and hear about it analyzed by Su Laoshi, who is effusive and warm. However, there were rarely opportunities to talk or improve one's proactive language abilities, and hopefully this will be emphasized further in later courses. Your writing can improve through thiscourse if you want to work at it in your essays, but it's also easy to coast through the course and learn nothing.",
    "Yes, it was a fun class."
