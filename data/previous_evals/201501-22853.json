    "It's very inspiring and offers new light into the understanding of the relationship between dance and visual art",
    "Postmodern Dance is a studio-based course about this dance aesthetic since it first emerged from the downtown NYC scene in the 1970s. Although the central focus was on the work of Yvonne Rainer, we also explored a range of other dance styles\/choreographers. By the end of the course, we had been exposed to a diverse collection of works that improved my knowledge of dance history.",
    "Postmodern dance is equal parts dance and thinking. If you take this class, be ready to jump into a lot of studio-practice, which is absolutely amazing. Emily, having danced with some of the most important people is postmodern dance history, invites some incredible guest artists. It's an honor to work with her and them. Also be prepared to take this class seriously. It is academic and it is intellectual. I recommend it so highly.",
    "Be prepared to move. It's good for any level of mover, though, you just need to be interested in the material. Plus, you engage with some of the most important artists, and their work, from the last century of dance."
