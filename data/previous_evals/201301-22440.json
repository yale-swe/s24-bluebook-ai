   "comments": [
    "Yes I would if you need it. I thought it was better taught than ENAS 151. It does get a bit dry and theoretical though.",
    "This is your basic multivariable calc course--if you can call it basic. I would recommend it if you need it for the course of study you're pursuing, or if you *really* like (difficult) math and are *really* good at it (not the normal level of good, which I thought I was), but not otherwise. Taking it with Tyler Foster was pretty good, although I hear Miki Havlickova is the best teacher for this class.",
    "A straightforward, more theory-based multivariable calculus class.Not highly recommended for someone who doesn't TRULY ENJOY math or who doesn't need it for their major because it doesn't have many practical applications. For them, I would recommend one of the more focused multi classes (MATH118 or ENAS151, for example), since those focus on a specific subject area, and therefore are more practical and interesting than MATH120.Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys math and is more interested and the theoretical side of vector calculus. From what I hear, MATH120 focuses more on the WHY than other multi classes.",
    "If you want to take higher level math courses, definitely take it. If you want an interesting math class just for fun, I would say don't take it.",
    "Very interesting class. The concepts, especially later in the course, are fascinating. First half is somewhat easy, but difficulty ramps up sharply as the course goes on.",
    "Makes math suck, very difficult to conceptualize what you're actually doing",
    "Great introductory math course. Not exactly easy but totally manageable.",
    "I would only recommend Math 120 to students who are either confident in their natural ability or students who are willing to work hard to do well.",
    "Multivariable calculus - fascinating and challenging.",
    "This is a very \"competitive\" course in that many, many people have taken multivariable calculus already and get perfect scores on the exams. If you just need one of the introductory math courses requirement, take 115 or 112. However, if you do need 120 for your major, be prepared to put in the time!",
    "Tyler Foster is great! The course is totally manageable in the first half, and then the last third of it gets really abstract.",
    "What it says on the cover: it's a pretty solid intro to multivariable calc. The psets are boring and get a bit tough sometimes, so go to tutors (I only did this for one pset, and hence did really badly overall). The textbook is kind of shitty at explaining things, so pray you get a good instructor. THE INSTRUCTOR MAKES SO MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE. Tyler Foster was great but he's graduating this year, so sucks to be you. SHOP MULTIPLE SECTIONS AND GO WITH YOUR GUT - evals said Miki was marginally better, and that Tyler was too abstract, but I showed up to both for a week and Miki just went way too fast (and the class length was too long...falling asleep) for me. And Tyler's examples were slow and clear enough to make sense. Basically SHOP ALL THE INSTRUCTORS IF YOU CAN. Midterms were easy, but final was tough. (I studied for one day before each of them though.)",
    "I would recommend this to another student. It gives you a very good understanding of Multivariable Calculus. The workload is very fair, and the tests are manageable.",
    "As a student who's taken BC calc and just a bit of multivariable in high school, I found Math 120 to be quite challenging. It's quite well taught, but not having taken ENAS 151, I can't offer too much of a comparison. The grading can be quite difficult since there are always a subset of people who get full marks on the exams. I would recommend math 120, but would suggest ENAS 151 for students interested in applications, 118 for students interested in Econ, and 121 for those interested in biosciences (if it's still offered)",
    "Math 120 for me was a fantastic experience and I found the material very interesting. When I learned about Stokes theorem my mind was blown, it was awesome. I would highly recommend this course as it is both interesting and accessible."
