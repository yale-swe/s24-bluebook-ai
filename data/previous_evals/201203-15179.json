    "Worth taking this class.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who thinks they will use isotopes in their research or who would like to have a broad understanding of isotope applications for potentially future research. However it is definitely not a intro isotope class. I would definitely suggest students have some previous experience with isotope geochemistry before taking this class.",
    "Course covers the fundamental of isotope geochemistry and is important for any serious student of geochemistry.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any starting grad student that will deal with anything vaguely related to geochemistry. The course manages to be a broad survey but also go into depth. You should expect to gain an appreciation for how different isotope systems follow similar patterns, but are conceptually very similar.The prospective student should be comfortable with math (differential equations and thermodynamics are be a bonus, although no one in our class had much or any background) and using Excel (or equivalent spreadsheet) in order to be successful.The problem sets are very time consuming, but not more than I expected. You should plan to spend the entire week from when a problem set is assigned to when it is due working on it. Working with other students was very helpful for me -- different people see a problem differently.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student because it covers really useful topics, but I would emphasize that working on the homework in groups was really helpful for this course."

    "This course helped improve my fundamental understanding and ability to apply isotope systems to geological problems. It greatly expanded my background in radiogenic isotopes, and it helped me understand some basic concepts in stable isotopes that I had not previously grasped."
