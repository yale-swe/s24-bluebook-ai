He is the head curator of European Art at the YUAG and he has a much more interesting take on Medieval \/ Renaissance art than most professors. He will bring paintings to class out of storage for you to look at while he's lecturing which is great.",
    "Yes! It really taught me to look closely at art and made me much more interested in medieval painting!!"
