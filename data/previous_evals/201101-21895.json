   "comments": [
    "Pretty average class. No lab associated with it, so it's just classroom learning. The notes don't get posted online, so you definitely have to go to class. You don't need to get the book. I bought it but never opened it once. The homework assignments are problems that the professor comes up with. They're fairly difficult, but the grading is lenient. Our midterm (10%) was easy, but the final was a bit brutal and worth 60% (yikes)",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It is a very interesting and challenging course, and very rewarding. It covers the math-ier side of EE, so if you are especially inclined towards that, you will really enjoy it.",
    "This is a great class and you learn a lot of stuff. There is a gap between what is presented in class and what is expected on the problem sets, so you should be prepared for a challenge there. Also, the problem sets are a little longer than usual because they aren't weekly so that means start them early and be willing to go to the professor to ask for helps and tutoring. Narendra's really good at explaining things one on one, and he's also just super nice. Overall, if you want to get a good introduction to this stuff, take the class.",
    "A good course, will have overlap with EENG 203, but it's a solid foundation for systems theory. Narendra knows his stuff to a T and teaches it well.",
    "Take it if you'd like to understand the mathematical analysis behind signals and systems.",
    "Yes . A bit of work but a lot of fun!!",
    "The class was very well-planned, and the material covered was fairly broad. There was a good amount of overlap with material taught in EENG202(with Kuc) and EENG203, but I now feel much more confident about Nyquist plots, the Laplace domain, and other such topics. The homework matched the lecture material surprisingly well, and the Matlab components of the problem sets were a pleasant change of pace.",
    "I recommend. Do all the assignments and never ever get behind on lecture materials. It catches up with you later."
