    "French 150 is a great course for students who took French in high school at a somewhat advanced level, or for those who just finished 140. It's a lot of grammar - if you're looking for a class to discuss literature\/films and write papers, this isn't it. You do write papers (5 3-pagers) but you also have a significant amount of grammar homework. The books are interesting, the films are great, but it is a significant time commitment each night.",
    "French 150 is basically composed of 4 essays and 4 exams and a lot of class participation. If you are afraid of speaking, don't take this class - 40% of your grade depends on participation. Other then that, I feel as if I learned a lot - though the amount of work we were given sometimes took away from the quality of the presentation. I would recommend it if you want to continue French.",
    "It's a great class for a systematic review of French grammar and langauge!",
    "A great course and an easy transition fromhigh school French.",
    "Yes, only if you're willing to put in about the same amount of work as daily classes like in L1-L4. Interesting readings and movies, but it's a lot of work, and students in the class are all over the place in terms of their speaking level. Participation\/oral grading is subjective. Don't go with Schneider unless you're already pretty much fluent at French; she's the most discouraging and condescending professor I've ever had. When you get something wrong, she criticizes you or humiliates you before correcting you, if that. Otherwise, it's an alright class. Take it if you want to get better at French in general.",
    "Yes, the course greatly helped furthering my French proficiency. It definitely has a high work-load (though many language courses usually do)."
