    "I highly recommend it, provided that one is able to put a lot of time into the homeworks. Most problem sets combined abstract problems and more hands-on problems involving data analysis and simulations. The latter, while very interesting in my opinion, do demand a lot of time for programming. I think the course description should include a prerequisite or warning about the coding skills required in Matlab or a similar language."

    "i think it will help my research!",
    "The subject matter was at the periphery of my discipline so I think it gave me a different perspective on my field and different ways to think about our systems. Also it gives you a way to critically evaluate arguments that derive from soft matter physics.",
    "I learned a lot by taking the time to go through all the problem sets. I particularly enjoyed learning about simulation methods such a Monte Carlo, and I believe skills will be valuable in my research."
