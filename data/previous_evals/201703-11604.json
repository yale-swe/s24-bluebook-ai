   "comments": [
    "The material in the course is very interesting but it would have helped to follow a textbook more closely, or have references to sections of the recommended textbooks that taught the topics.",
    "(This course varies a lot depending on who teaches it, so my response is only about the version Zhiwei taught). It covers a lot of interesting and highly important material. However (when Zhiwei taught it) it felt a bit disjointed, as if he were jumping from one topic to another as opposed to going through clearly-defined units.",
    "Strengths: the class was very well organized, lectures were clear and informative, and the problem sets were good at challenging you to use the new information you had just learned effectively. The one major weakness I see is the lack of a textbook or alternative way of learning the material; in particular, the class had a fair amount of category theory while neither of the textbooks recommended by the professor covered it in much detail. As such, I didn't know exactly where to look for help when I had trouble understanding the material. I think just providing this one extra resource would be greatly beneficial for this course."

    "Modern Algebra was a fantastic class. Professor Yun is a very good lecturer, clear. He gives lots of interesting motivating examples.",
    "I would recommend it depending on who the instructor is. While the subject matter is interesting, the experience of taking this course is known to vary tremendously from year to year.",
    "A fairly standard high-level math class. If you like algebra, take it; if you don't, don't. Zhiwei doesn't have the most engaging lecture style but he's a lenient grader and there's only one take-home final, so if you stay on top of the work, you'll be fine.",
    "This course is really interesting so you should take it. The course varies a lot depending on who teaches it, so I can't give you very specific advice as to what to expect. It is fairly challenging, but if you've taken 350, I think you probably are well-prepared.",
    "The material is interesting for anyone who liked Abstract Algebra\/Galois Theory and wants to learn more algebra. It is difficult but taught well; I would recommend it to anyone looking for an algebraic challenge."
