   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the history of human rights law and current debates surrounding it. I also learned a lot about specific situations in certain countries\/regions. Plus, I think my writing got better with Prof. Sanchez's feedback!",
    "This course is divided into two parts: the first half is spent discussing the various approaches to advancing the human rights agenda, while the second half focuses on specific human rights issues. I think both parts together provide an in-depth understanding of the human rights movement's past, present, and future, so content-wise, it's pretty detailed and super interesting. You have readings every week, two response papers, one midterm paper and one final paper -- so you definitely improve both your analysis, research ability and writing skills.",
    "I guess most fundamentally I learned what human rights really means and entails.",
    "I learned a lot about how human rights law and the human rights framework in general work. The first half of the course was especially enlightening - we discussed in depth the different tools that are used to work towards human rights goals. I learned a lot about how international law, sanctions, foreign aid, etc. work and the drawbacks and pitfalls of each approach.",
    "This course taught me about the laws in place internationally (and how they came to be) to support human rights worldwide. After learning about different diplomatic, economic, legal, and military tactics on how states interact to secure human rights, we covered gross abuses of human rights. These units covered genocide, women's rights, civil and political rights, racial justice, and refugee rights.",
    "This course helped me develop knowledge concerning human rights issues both in the US and abroad through classroom discussions and readings that addressed human rights tools and strategies as well as specific perspectives of the human rights movement throughout history.",
    "A great, fairly in depth synopsis of major topics covered in HR law and the political forces governing discourse in the field",
    "The tools and state of human rights in current and recent history."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: books (Not Enough, Problem From Hell, Between the World and Me), Presentations (helped me learn a lot about my topic), Professor Sanchez was definitely a strength (i really liked her!), also appreciated how the reading load was less intense towards the end of the year! Weaknesses: maybe getting feedback sooner on reading responses? This isn't really a big deal but I was a little worried when writing my second that I had done something wrong on the first and just didn't know it yet. Profs just vary a lot in how they grade these!",
    "The strengths of this course come from Professor Sanchez and the discussion-style layout of the class. Professor Sanchez is always able to stir up discussion, bring up points from her experience and build upon the readings we read for the week. A lot of the class, though, also relies on the quality of discussion in the classroom. I think the other students had a ton of value to add, and so the discussion-style format really allows everyone to stay engaged, pitch in new ideas and really converse with the material. This course was great -- I don't really have any improvements!",
    "Discussions need to be better focused. Sometimes Prof Sanchez would leave us with questions to think about and discuss for the next seminar, which I think were helpful. Strengths - it was a good introduction for someone who hadn't taken a class in the global dept before.",
    "The first half of the course was very well-run - Professor Sanchez struck a good balance of letting discussion flow and directing it in meaningful ways. I generally left class feeling like I had both learned a lot of new information and been made to think more deeply about information I had already digested. The second half of the course felt a bit more haphazard - as we were trying to balance presentations and discussions of readings, a lot of things fell through the cracks. I also felt like there wasn't much room for participation. I think that the midterm paper was not designed very well. It was strange for our first reading to be a critique of the entire human rights framework, before we had really learned what that framework was. Writing a paper that had to respond to this critique of the human rights movement as a whole before we had been exposed to any other perspectives on human rights wasn't a useful experience.",
    "The workload was manageable and the readings for each week were always interesting. I felt like I learned a lot. Perhaps a weakness would be that discussions seemed to not be as focused compared to the reading topics, and to make sure discussions aren't dominated by some voices.",
    "This course benefitted from having an engaging and knowledgeable professor as well as the readings, which provided useful insight into the subject material.",
    "I wish we had more time to cover topics a bit more in depth, though that is hard to change.",
    "The course was a very wonderful seminar style. Learned a lot and gained perspective.",
    "I think the class is structured quite while -- and discussions were most often very lively\/worthwhile."

    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course! I didn't really have that much background in the area and I really enjoyed learning about something new. Professor Sanchez is so awesome!! Its readings, two straightforward papers, two reading responses, and a presentation. I didn't find it too stressful but felt that I was working hard and getting a lot out of it.",
    "I would definitely and highly recommend this course to another student! This was probably my favourite course that I've taken at Yale so far. I'm interested in human rights law, and this course touched upon all of the aspects that I've previously wondered about. As a result, I feel way more informed about human rights issues, and the different approaches to solving them. If you're interested in human rights or even if you're not this course is an incredibly way to learn more about a lot of global problems, hear a ton of interesting ideas and leave with a better understanding (and some hope!) of the future.",
    "It was a good fifth class because it was something I was vaguely interested in, but there isn't a ton of busy work, just 1 midterm paper, 2 short response papers, 1 presentation, and 1 final paper. If you're looking for something super engaging, maybe it was just this particular group of people but I don't think this class will be satisfying for that.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to take a deep dive into the field of human rights.",
    "Yes I would recommend it!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any students who are interested in human rights advocacy and the strategies that can be used to mobilize people and governments to address human rights violations both domestically and abroad.",
    "Yes it is extremely interesting",
    "Yes! This course is great for any major because it gives valuable, real world perspective on the human rights issues affecting the world. All of us are humand, so it's important to deeply consider the systemic issues affecting others and how you might be able to find one solution of many.",
    "I would recommend this course! It is a really interesting, relevant, and important course."
