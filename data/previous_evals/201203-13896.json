   "comments": [
    "Strengths- Interdisciplinary learning experience and information on research happening in this field.Weakness- Sometimes becomes too advanced for students",
    "I was disappointed that the seminar was SO research-intensive. There did not seem to be any speakers for those of us who were more interested in the applied side of public health. Also, the talks seemed so vector-biased. I was hoping for more humanity in the talks, as opposed to just genes and insects.",
    "I liked the selection of speakers. It would have been nice if the different room for the CIRA talks were emphasized a bit more. And if the lunch was always on time! :-)",
    "Interesting seminar; topics often go beyond my knowledge (for example, deeper review of microbiology of specific diseases)",
    "Strengths: diversity of speakers appeals to a wide variety of interests by the students.Weaknesses: the length of the seminar sometimes conflicted with other courses. Also, depending on the demand of the lecture, some of the seminars appeared to not be directly focused on students, which could make them a little intimidating.",
    "I enjoyed hearing all of the interesting lectures- pizza was a nice bonus!",
    "Interesting speakers. Mostly on vector-borne diseases and bacteriology (less on viruses).",
    "Interesting speakers, great seminar.",
    "The seminar was a little heavy on the vector-born \/ tropical disease side of things. I would have liked to see some more applied epi speakers.",
    "Really interesting overall. More diversity of subject matter among the speakers would be better.",
    "The seminar series were great. It would be nice if students could be involved in picking the speakers",
    "A lot of great talks",
    "This seminar was a great way to find out about research in microbial disease epidemiology. It was great to be able to understand some of the findings presented during the seminar as a result of materials previously learned in some of my classes.",
    "Great seminar, it is helpful for EMD students because they can interact with different experts in the field and even potentially find and internship.",
    "STRENGTHS: I liked the relaxed atmosphere at the weakly seminar and the chance to have everyone together to hear the wonderful speakers. WEAKNESSES: none IMPROVEMENTS: The one change I would like to see is a couple of speakers from organizations who can share professional advice as opposed to just having speakers from the research side of EMD."

    "Great way to learn about EMD research topics and professors in YSPH and beyond. Pizza every week",
    "The EMD seminar is a good opportunity to observe professionals in the field and some of the current work that they are doing, as well as some of their future goals, which can be inspiring to students who want to find their niche within the infectious disease field.",
    "Great course- lots of interesting talks to hear and nice to see public health in action in so many different ways.",
    "Yes, interesting.",
