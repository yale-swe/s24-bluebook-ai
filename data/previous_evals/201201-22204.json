    "Take it! Once you take a class with Professor Fradinger, you will realize why she is so popular. She is attentive yet challenging with students, and is so well-versed in intellectual thought and art in Latin America, that she will dazzle you. Make sure you sign up and show up early during shopping week, because it's hard to get in--with good reason!",
    "DEFINITELY. This was the best course I took in my four years at Yale.",
    "LONG movie screenings \u0097\u00a0between 2-5 hours each Monday \u0097 in addition to late-night section made this course really time-consuming. Nonetheless, it was a really enjoyable look at some of the most inaccessible films ever made, and gave me a lot of perspective on Latin American culture and history in the 20th century. The workload's also pretty reasonable, and Moira is very kind, if a bit spacey.",
    "Watch rare, but amazing films and discuss them with (hopefully) an incredibly intelligent and insightful group of students. If you don't appreciate the left, nontraditional film, or latin america, you probably will not love this class as much as I did.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student or friend. It has been my favorite class so far. The class consists of film screenings, readings, and discussions. Some of the films covered in this class are very rare and hidden historical archives\/treasures regarding Latin American history. Given that some of the films are rare make sure to always go to all the film screenings. I enjoyed most of the films shown in this class. The class discussions regarding these films were remarkable. Students will be graded based on classesv2 postings about the films, two essays, class participation, and oral presentation on one film.",
    "This class is a must. If you are open minded or consider yourself left winged you cannot let this class slip by you. It is truly a unique experience and presents materials you will never be able to see again. Professor Fradinger is a fantastic seminar leader and really presents this information in a unique manner. The screenings are long, so you have to be interested in the material, but it is really hard not to be. Great for people that have never taken a film course and great for those who have. You really can't go wrong with this one.",
    "yes. if he\/she is so inclined to learn about avant-garde political cinemas, then yes.",
    "Shop it. You'll know if it's for you",
    "Any class with Moira is fantastic. Take this if you want to rage about cultural imperialism and cinema novo.",
    "Excellent class to learn about how leftist politics entered the creative cultural sphere in latin america, in a way that was and still is urgent to society. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
