    "Best class I have taken at Yale. Hands down. The theological readings were interesting, class discussion was amazing, and Danielle was an amazing professor. If you can get in, take it. If you get on the waitlist, stay on. This class is has a fair bit of reading, but it is completely worth it.",
    "If you are interested in the subject, you'll know you need to be in this class. It is hard to get in, but once you do you'll get to read (or probably reread) the Harry Potter books and discuss them in the intellectual depth you always wanted to! Easily one of my top three classes while I've been at Yale.",
    "This was a great course! Professor Tumminio is fantastic and is the expert on Harry Potter and Christian theology. Who wouldn't want to read the entire Harry Potter series for homework (BEST de-stress activity ever)? And the theological readings are wonderful - very comprehensive of classical and contemporary theology. I would definitely recommend this course - it provokes very deep, thoughtful, fun, passionate, and engaging discussions.",
    "If you love Harry Potter, apply for this course. You will find that the theology is actually very interesting and makes you look at Harry Potter and the world differently. I took this course without any theological background and I did fine grade-wise.",
    "Absolutely yes, especially if you've never taken a theology course before. You get introduced to the basic principles, you see how an author can explore personal, religious themes in a Children's work. You read Harry potter. 'Nuff said. To say more for a second, Professor Tumminio is great and her comments on essays will help with your writing.",
    "Great course to talk about Harry Potter with other fans. It provides insight into a lot of possible interpretations of the story and text. Don't take to learn about theology",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It's a wonderful blend of Christian theology and Harry Potter, just like it sounds. I found the class particularly meaningful because I'm a Christian (although I think the non-Christians in the class really enjoyed it as well.) The theological readings we did and our class discussions made me reflect on my own beliefs. The class also helped me appreciate the Harry Potter series on a deeper level. The message I got out of the class is that the series isn't explicitly Christian, but it deals with many issues germane to Christian theology and sometimes in implicitly Christian ways.",
    "It is great! It'll make you see religion and Harry Potter in a whole new light.",
    "This was one of the best courses i took at Yale. You basically read about a different topic in christian theology and one harry potter book every week and discuss it in class. I learned a lot about christian theology and gained a new perspective about harry potter. Professor Tumminio is great and very helpful. The class wasn't too much work (reading response every week, two 10 page papers) and was extremely interesting.",
    "CSPC 250 was an excellent course for fans of Harry Potter and for any range of knowledge on Christian theology. The class appeared to be interesting for those will little prior knowledge and those who with a more in depth background. The course did an excellent job of tying the theology to the series, and the series provided a framework for discussion that helped my understanding of the Christian theology.",
    "I really enjoyed this seminar and think it would be a very valuable experience for anyone seeking to learn more about Christian theology using a familiar and loved collection of literature. The course is structured topically by week and you read the whole Harry Potter series over the course of the semester. Discussions are open-ended and you get a lot of exposure to a lot of good literature on theology. There is a lot of reading, but if you know how to sort through it it's not bad.",
    "The class is interesting and Danielle is awesome. If you're interested in talking about theology and Harry Potter and bridging the two, knowing that sometimes those bridges will be stretches, you'll enjoy the class."
