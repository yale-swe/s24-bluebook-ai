   "comments": [
    "It's a good class. Watch out for Farrar, she's a really tough grader.",
    "No secrets with what the course entails: two discussions per week; you start with Herodotus and you end with Aquinas. Of all the DS courses, it at least appears as though History has the greatest amount of reading in terms of number of pages.I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I would temper this recommendation by saying, however, that this class is made up of competitive students who are trying to impress. Be prepared to contend with some name-dropping and some precocious use of jargon. But do not let these concerns stand in the way of your fulfilling a genuine, abiding love of history, or a genuine, abiding love of humanistic inquiry in general.",
    "You get what you put into it; if you are willing to do the reading and really think about the points and ideas that come about, you can really start to understand some major questions. If, however, you don't read and just treat the coursework as a chore, than it's much more unlikely that you'll learn anything.",
    "DS History is an incredible introduction to the greats of political thought. Herodotus, Thucydides, Tacitus--the list of authors covered goes on and on. It's definitely more political thought than history, and you're tested more on your ability to comprehend the overall ideas than specific events (though you should be able to back it up with specific events!). Cynthia Farrar is brilliant and adorable. We had dinner at her house twice this semester and both times were super fun and cute. She's also a great section leader and tough but fair on papers. I would absolutely recommend DS History and urge you to try to get Farrar, though be warned that it's very demanding. Love DS regardless!",
    "An excellent class - besides the quality discussions that occur in any DS section, Farrar's a great professor who cares about her class and shows it. I recommend it highly.",
    "Directed Studies is an awesome class if you haven\u0092t studied the material before and you really, really like talking in class. If not, you\u0092ll feel alternately bored, overwhelmed, and distressed. However, if the syllabus and class style sounds like your cup of tea, do yourself a favor and take it. Don\u0092t worry about not being able to take other classes. After DS, you won\u0092t want to. Also, if at all possible, get into Professor Farrar\u0092s section. She doesn\u0092t have the political cachet of Charles Hill nor the snark of Justin Zaremby, but she is by far the most devoted and personable professor I\u0092ve encountered \u0096 and is an expert on Athenian democracy, which comprises about a third of the course.",
    "I would highly recommend this class in that the reading is great, all books that you should read at some point in your life and you get to have an extremely knowledgeable professor, in this case Professor Farrar who specializes in ancient Greek history and a small class of people who are highly interested in the subject.The seminars themselves were at 9 in the morning, which made for some tired participants and the conversation rarely got into a healthy groove, which was unfortunate to say the least, but it was also Professor Farrar's first year teaching, giving hope that she will better handle class in future years.On a personal level however, Professor Farrar is incredible. She hosted the class to dinner at her home on multiple occasions, joined us for lunch for extra discussions on Thucydides and St. Augustine and gives more feedback and attention to papers than any professor I have heard of: for my first paper the comments were longer than the paper itself, dissecting points and offering advice, and she is readily available to talk to about papers, class or whatever you need help with.In seminar, the class lagged, but on a personal level, Farrar is fantastic.",
    "DS History and Politics is somewhat like a crash course in Classical Western History and Political Thought. In the first semester you start with Herodotus and the Ancient Greeks and end with Christian political ideals portrayed through Augustine. Throughout you are expected to read a good amount of texts, averaging about 60-120 pages for each section meeting. It seems like a lot, but you learn how to manage your time and how to read texts with the ability to absorb important themes and messages. Out of the three DS classes, be expected to read the most for DS H&P. The essays are also the most difficult to write, so make sure you meet with your professor in the beginning of the week at least with a thesis ready.I would definitely recommend this course to another student. While it is a large work load, you will be exposed to various Historical and Political ideas along with your peers where you will be able to discuss these books throughly and bring up ideas completely new and intriguing to you. It's a completely different experience than if you were to read these texts on your own. I also was able to approach history in a very different way than I have before - by discussing the particular historians approach to writing history. My advise would be to familiarize yourself with major historical events that happened during the time periods the historians are writing about, in order to give yourself a clearer picture. Also, it would be helpful to keep a list of major historical figures and events discussed as you read. It would come in handy for the final exam.",
    "It is an introduction to political science and history and therefore slightly confusing, but it is definitely worth the work.",
    "Directed Studies History&Political Thought is a great class for people who are really interested in this kind of thing, but a lot of people (including me) figure out that they are less interested in it than they thought they were going to be. Whilesome of it is interesting and really worth learning, a lot of it can be tedious. However, if you think that DS is right for you, definitely try it out--you might like it or you might not.Professor Farrar is an extremely nice woman. She did really sweet things like have our class over for dinner at her house, and she was always enthusiastic about meeting with us outside of class if we needed extra help. I really respect her as an intelligent and caring person, but I don't think my learning style meshed very well with hers. Additionally, I think I would have gotten more out of section if she had talked more herself instead of letting the students control the discussion. So, although I would advise you to definitely try to make sure you are personally compatible with your DS professors before you commit to them, even if you aren't, Prof. Farrar is so sweet that you are likely to have a good experience with her anyways.",
    "A super-intensive holistic program on the classics intended to build our understanding of western culture. For the ambitious, slightly masochist, super-motivated students who are willing to sacrifice a lot for what is probably the best academic experience Yale has to offer for the Freshman Year.",
    "Though a tough grader, Professor Farrar is an extremely kind and caring teacher. She is willing to give you as much help as you need and is very available to meet outside of class. She definitely cares about her students. However, I found the class discussions to be very freewheeling and often felt that my fellow students would spout off and say things that none of us (including them) really understood. Professor Farrar did not control the class discussion or offer her own comments as much as I would have liked--partly because she assigned individual students to guide the discussion each day. That said, this was her first year in DS, so maybe things will change next year.",
    "DS History and Politics can be a little bit deceptive - there is little emphasis placed on the actual history and much more on historians and their perspectives. That said, the course does a good job of taking themes like citizenship, fate, and other assorted questions for politics and examining their role in various works throughout antiquity.",
    "If you don\u0092t mind lots of reading and don\u0092t get easily stressed by deadlines (with the papers), DS is manageable, though difficult. It\u0092s a wonderful survey of the western literature, and I already feel so accomplished just after one semester. It\u0092s definitely not for everyone, though, so be sure DS is for you."
