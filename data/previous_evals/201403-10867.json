    "Yes I would recommend this class",
    "Please refer to evaluation in SOM site",
    "Real-world stuff instead of abstract and useless theories. Would definitely recommend",
    "Take it to get policy modeling skills. Take it for your professional and personal development. Take it for fun!",
    "I certainly would recommend it. If you are interested in quantitative methods for modeling policy problems, are comfortable working in a group, and are not adverse to hard work, this is an very rewarding class.",
    "This class is very worth taking if the student wants to learn some knowledge about modeling practical problems.",
    "Great class but very hard and expect to work more than average on homework",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to a fellow student, provided they were interested in probability.",
    "Would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the class to other students. It is an interesting introduction into the sort of probability models that when scaled up can inform policy decisions. Useful for the back-of-the-envelope type calculations you learn how to do and an ability to break problems done into simpler parts.",
    "Definitely recommend!",
    "This is a great interesting course. Professor Kaplan is one of the most gifted lecturers I've ever seen. He makes topics that may otherwise be dull and engages the class. The problem sets are interesting, topical and very applied; however, the are quite challenging and require a lot of time. In addition, you must work on them with a group. If you like your group then this is okay, but if you don't, be prepared for a long semester. There are also additional problem sets for PhD students.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is comfortable with linear algebra and probability. It's really interesting.",
    "Both of the TA are very responsive and helpful. They are the keys of the class."
