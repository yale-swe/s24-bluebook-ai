    "Yes. Great class, and not a lot of work. Helps you to be more creative with a business background.",
    "I would definitely recommend New Product Development to another student- it's an enjoyable topic with an interesting professor and a reasonable course load. It's unlike any other class that I've taken at Yale.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this class to another student. Although the workload was minimal, much of the work that we had to do was tedious busy-work. I felt like I had to teach myself a lot of the things that we were supposed to be learning. The group dynamic was diminished bythe general feeling that we were doing homework that would not be read or that we did not know how to do accurately.Though the course had its fun moments, I generally thought that I could have gotten much more out of the class.",
    "I would recommened it because you get to work in a group and get real interesting experience--it is different than any other class you'll take at yale.",
    "Yes, recommended. For a fifth class",
    "a great class for learning how to make a product in a hands on manner. It gave me a good understanding about the steps to development of products, and really brought out my creative side. At times the subject tought in lecture was dry or boring, but overall a worthwhile class.",
    "fun. take it."
