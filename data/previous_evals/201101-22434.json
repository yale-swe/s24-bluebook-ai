    "Its an interesting situation you will find yourself in if you decide to take Study of the City. Its not particularly difficult. The \"games\" you play are not games, they are projects, and require a massive amount of work to do well. Be prepared for a couple days of boring hell for each of them. I warn you to not underestimate how unbearably boring 2+ hours of lecture are on a tuesday night... they are VERY boring. Garvin reads from the textbook, in slide format, every evening. It is completely dreadful. also, back to the games. They are hard. Not fun and dynamic, literally just using excel and spreadsheets to make numbers work. Its like a freaking accounting class. I wouldn't take the course unless you plan on using it towards your major. You can read the last two pages of every chapter of the textbook and learn the same amount in 3 hours. REALLY consider other options, before you commit to this. Sit in on the lecture, it only goes downhill from day one. This is not a hate response, I did really well in the course, its just an honest to g-d warning. keep it real.",
    "Cr\/D only!",
    "I would not recommend this to anybody. The class was more about real estate and financing developments than it was about cities, which you wouldn't necessarily know just from shopping it. The worst part was the games. They took up all of my free time for a week before the deadline during stressful parts of the semester.",
    "Great course to learn more about the foundations of cities. I would recommend taking the class Cr\/D\/Fail to avoid stressing about grades and to focus more on just the subject matter.",
    "This class is unusual because instead of writing papers, you work in teams on games. If you can handle teamwork and are interested in urban planning topics, then this course is for you!",
    "Study of the City is a very interesting experience. I hated that I never knew what my grade was in the class (we didn't get the second project back until the day of the final, so about 60% of our grades were still in flux.) The games were interesting but difficult, and the in class playing of the games depended on how much the professor liked or hated your ideas. However, luckily your grade doesn't depend on that, but on how much your TA likes your project, which is much easier to achieve than Garvin's approval. Garvin himself is obviously knowledgeable about his subject and is often very interesting but two and a half hours is a little long (around the last forty five minutes, your back will start to hurt and your attention will dwindle). And going to lecture\/paying attention is a MUST. Part of the exam consists of photo IDs from the lectures that aren't available anywhere else. The other part of the exam was pretty fun - assessing a development project and then learning what happened to it in real life. Overall, I'm glad I took it, but you really have to know what you're getting into.",
    "Before taking the course, I had heard it described as \"how to be a real estate developer in the late 90's,\" and that summary aptly captured some aspects of the course - the games in particular are essentially pre-professional in how you must play the role of a real-estate developer or government official for your grade, which is great - but there was much more it to that. During the weekly lecture you'll be exposed to a ton of case studies (most of them very briefly addressed, but some, such as Burnam& The Chicago Plan or J.C. Nichols& The Country Club Plaza are analyzed at greater length) that illustrate Garvin's take on urban planning. If you're interested in cities, it's a class you must take.",
    "Good if you are interested in the city. HardI would recommend it if a student is willing to put a lot of effort in the class and is truly interested in the subject from the start.",
    "Study of the City is not as bad as most of the reviews claim; if you're interested in urban studies, it's a little repetitive, but the incredible games absolutely make up for it.",
    "Take this class if you are into urban planning. Games are an interesting learning experience.",
    "GARVIN IS A RACIST! IF YOU ARE BLACK OR LATINA DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS YOU WILL GET A BAD GRADE AND FEEL HORRIBLE BECAUSE YOUR RACE IS THE SOLE REASON FOR THE HOUSING DOWNTURN ACCORDING TO GARVIN.",
    "The class is less about architecture than it is about real estate. Embrace it as such."
