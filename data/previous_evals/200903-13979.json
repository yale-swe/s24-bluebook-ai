    "Really fun class. We do a lot in 50 minutes, and I leave every time feeling like I have worked a part of my brain that will help me play my instrument. Maybe a little homework might be nice, I feel that it could take us much farther if we got used to doing these ear training exercises outside of class. You just sing and hear intervals for 500 minutes, twice a week, and you leave with a better ear. Great if you play an instrument, or want to listen to music differently.",
    "It's a lot of fun, and not too much work. Good for improving your listening skills and sight-singing ability. Doug Fisk was a great instructor and always had interesting samples for us to listen to.",
    "Great ear training and singing practice.I would recommend it, as it is useful.",
    "A course that is actually useful. So many practical applications for having a good ear, and it's a fun, easy half credit. No homework except practicing for keyboard labs. Not a whole of demands from this class. Take it.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to get better at dictations, sight-singing and piano playing.",
    "Great for learning \/ practicing figured bass, as well as solidifying knowledge of scale degrees and dictation.",
    "This class required a lot more work than I expected. The keyboard lab requires significant practice time. Be prepared to make time to use the Practica Musica program in the music department."
