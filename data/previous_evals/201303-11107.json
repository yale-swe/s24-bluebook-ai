   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! One of my suggestions would be to read the texts very carefully\/ multiple times if necessary in order to offer your best insight.",
    "Great course -- I loved our studies of Latino Lit. Strengths: In-depth reading of literature, well-organized and structured.",
    "Covers the urban latina\/o's experience through novels, short stories, and films: the use of these various mediums makes the class really interesting, particularly in that we use them as examples of ideas discussed in secondary sources. Professor Ramirez is SUPER COOL. She's very smart and opinionated, she knows how to push a discussion into interesting questions, and she inspires her class to love the material. I'd warn people though: Professor Ramirez does not ascribe to grade inflation. She expects near perfect work in order to award near perfect or perfect grades.",
    "Only take this course if you are interested in learning about Caribbean Latino culture because that is basically all that we learn. The reading load is heavy, but the work load isn't. The Prof. is also really strict and not generous with grading.",
    "If you have a preexisting interest in and knowledge of Latino literature, this class will be a great way to explore more in that subject.",
    "You read a variety of texts over the course that deal with questions of Latinidad (what does it mean to be \"Latino\"? How do people with origins in Latin American countries view themselves after migration, in transnational spaces, etc.) Not sure \"Urban Latino Lit\" is the adequate name for it, though. I would call it something like \"Transnational Latino Narratives\". There aren't very many assignments, but the ones that you do have count for a lot of the grade. Since it is a seminar, I guess the discussion will be determined largely by the dynamic of the people in the class. Professor Ramirez lets her students direct the discussion, so if your peers have nothing to say, it can get a little awkward. Overall, enjoyable seminar!",
    "You have a few readings every week and a few movies that are either recommended or required for that week. Each week's readings is presented by a group of people (1-3) and discussion follows the presentation. There are two essays, one of which includes presentations. You may watch videos or listen to music in class when appropriate for the literature read in preparation for that day's seminar. I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the latino migrant experience, especially as it is intertwined with gender and race.",
    "Yes!"
