    "HIST 715 is an excellent seminar for someone considering an orals field in 19th-century America or planning to do a research paper in the field. Aside from those two obvious reasons, it will also be beneficial to those who focus on the 18th and 20th centuries in drawing a more complete historiographical picture with which they can connect their own periods."

    "This course gave me enough background that I now feel prepared to begin considering an orals field in the 19th century. It also allowed me to see how some of the issues I deal with in my own research developed in the 19th century and so will certainly be useful in that sense to my research going forward."
