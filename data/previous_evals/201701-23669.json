    "SPAN 130 did an amazing job reinforcing the Spanish skill I had learned in the past while also teaching me new and useful grammar and skills. I loved the reading and literature focus that 130 had, as I always felt like real-life reading experience was something I was missing.",
    "I improved my language skills in speaking, writing and reading and learnt a lot about the culture of Spain and Latin America.",
    "I developed my knowledge of common grammatical structures for speaking and writing in Spanish. I improved my reading comprehension skills as well as my ability to convey ideas and thoughts about what had been read. Lastly, I improved my fluidity and vocabulary in conversing in Spanish."

   "comments": [
    "While I loved the readings, I thought the use of the Supersite program was wasteful. Considering it cost a pretty large amount of money, and there was really no review or talk about it after the first two days, I really didn't think it helped me at all. However, the course booklet and outside book were both awesome and Prof. Sabe was incredible. I thought the tests, essays and quizzes were really well given (though the quizzes were surprisingly harder than the tests) and helpful as well!",
    "It is well organised with a clear syllabus from the beginning of the semester. A weakness is that the homework assigned on certain days takes up a disproportionately large amount of time.",
    "i wish we had more handouts\/powerpoints had been posted sooner so i could've taken active notes in class",
    "Strengths: Connection to Hispanic and Latin American culture. Small class size to facilitate discussion and conversation. Daily assignments to reinforce learning. Frequent feedback on mistakes made during speaking. Combination of writing, reading, listening, and speaking. Weaknesses: class duration is quite short so not always enough time to ask questions or review homework."

    "Good class if you're wanting to continue your Spanish education. Daily work, and some of the readings are tougher than others, but most of it is worthwhile if you really try and learn it. Would definitely recommend taking Prof. Sabe's section: she's incredible!",
    "The daily lessons are very effective in improving language skills as it provides an excellent opportunity to practice in a conducive environment.",
    "Yes, this class is great for learning about culture and practicing speaking."
