This was an exciting and important aspect of this class because while we had a very in depth syllabus that was followed if something struck us deeply about a particular reading Magda would steer the class towards that space and allow us to tease out our idea so that we could leave the room that day with a fully formed relationship to what we were reading instead of a largely shallow one.",

    "I'm so incredibly proud of my final project. I don't think that it would have been posssible to get to the head space I arrived at on how to conceive this play had it not been for the aims and priorities of this course.",
    "The ability to choose our own final paper topics was helpful. It allowed me to synthesize the assigned readings\/class discussions and use the material for my own studies."

    "Absolutely. There is very little engagement with Performance Studies, Critical Race Theory, Black Studies, or American Studies at YSD. These disciplines offer necessary insights, critical tools, and a fair number of questions we probably should be dealing with given the amount of cultural material we produce in a year.",
    "I toook this course because not only did it interest me but I also had no grasp on the theories that we would explore. I now feel articulate in a form of theatre taught no where else in this institution and I am forever grateful for that because much of what we learn here has isn't mutable, doesn't exist within an area of inquiry that I could see myself making huge contributions to and in this one I do.",
    "No other course in the drama school gives us a grounding in contemporary performance, art theory, black studies or radical race theory. This course is unique and formative also in its cross-listing with the school of art and American Studies. Studying with these other students was a rare and valuable opportunity."
