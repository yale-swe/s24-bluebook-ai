    "Shimi's reputation as one of the best teachers in fes is well deserved. I really appreciate the work heputs into teaching. Superior class.",
    "Shimi is the best professor I have had at FES! His lectures, course materials\/handouts, assignments arewell thought out and selected. The outline of the course is very clear and his expectations of what he requires from us is very clear. I was also amazed at how much time he makes available for office hours (at least 5hrs a week!). Other FES professors offer office hours by appointment which for a busy grad student is hard to plan ahead but with Shimi's class I always knew what that certain times during the week he would be available so it was easy to show up for help. The fact that his course is so well organized is a signal that he cares about teaching well and ensuring that students learn. He also prepares notes on his lectures that are extremely helpful for students who are not so well versed in the sciences and need extra help. REALLY AMAZING PROFESSOR!"

    "Very clear instruction, excellent handouts and course assignments! Lots of time offered for office hours.",
    "Professor uses a combined approach of science fundamentals and environmental management applications that should be more common among FES course and instruction methodology -- whether in the natural or social sciences. The class is very well designed and taught thoroughly. Professor makes himself available to teach and discuss material with students for an engaged form of learning that I find highly effective."
