    "I'd recommend it if you need it or if you're interested in the material. It's very little work -- weekly psets literally take 20 min and it's not really necessary to do the reading. You do need to put in quite a bit of time before each exam though. I was a little frustrated because I'm not sure how much meaningful material I really got out of the course -- I felt like the first half taught us \"hydrogen bonds are important\" and \"protein structure determines function\" -- but it's nothing to be scared of.",
