   "comments": [
    "Certainly learn a lot about the middle east, dating from Muhammad's birth to present day. I feel like I can actually understand what's going on in the world today!! Worth taking. At times, the lectures were a bit tiresome (no powerpoints, he just took and lectured) but overall quite worth it.",
    "Great class. Names are a bit hard to track if you're not used to the language, but the history, political history, and philosophy of fundamentalist Islam is fascinating. Take it, maybe C\/D if you're not a political science or middle east studies major.",
    "This was a fantastic course that covered the history of Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East, up to the current July, using each country as a case study. The lectures weregreat, tracing themes and influences as well as going in depth into the history of important thinkers. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Islam, present day events, or intellectual religious history. This may have been the single most relevant course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in the politics of the future for the Middle East or the politics of the past that brought us to the age we are in today.",
    "Definitely take it if you want to learn more about issues in the Middle East and how the western world fits into that picture",
    "Islam Today is a great class. The information is relevant and well-organized, the professor is wonderful, and the workload isn't too heavy (midterm, final and a 5-page paper [10 pages if you don't attend all the sections]). I learned a ton in that class, especially about current events. I highly recommend it!",
    "I would recommend Islam Today if you're interested in a brief history and background of how and why dominant groups\/people in the MIddle East (ones that we hear about in the media frequently) came to power and where they get their ideals from. This class has given me enough general information about many countries within the Middle East to give me a better idea of what I want to study specifically.",
    "Absolutely. I'm a prospective MMES major and I'd recommend this to majors and non-majors alike. You need no prior knowledge (it suffices as a phenomenal intro to the Middle East class). The workload is super manageable, the grading is not difficult, you will learn a tremendous amount. Above all, the syllabus is terrific as is Professor Griffel. No reason not to take this class!",
    "I would recommend this class as a first class on the Islam. But keep in mind that the course is titled \"Jihad and Fundamentalism\"-- it is not an overview of Islam!",
    "It is an interesting class, but the midterm and final require a lot of studying because of all the terms you have to memorize.",
    "Poli Sci 435 was a comprehensive look into not only the history of Islam but also its effect on political theory and social factors, detailed in about 12 country-specific case studies. I would definitely recommend this to another student because it gave me a wholly new perspective on Islam, which is not my religion of affiliation. Even though I haven't had a very political science-oriented background, this was a fascinating course for me and my favorite this semester.",
    "I'd recommend this class for those who were interested in the Middle East, Islamic fundamentalism, or those who want to get a better grasp of what the heck is going on in the Middle East. It was definitely eye-opening and taught me a lot. While there was a lot of material covered, the exams were not too bad--pretty straightforward and easy to study for.",
    "The class has an incredible syllabus, however, the lecture style is DRY. Griffel simply bestows information on you without even a slide show or videos or anything. Also the tests can be hard because you'll have to do 10\/10 ids and there are A LOT of arabic names that can be hard to remember. That said, after taking the class I have a very strong grasp on the turmoil in the middle east.",
    "Take this class if you've ever wanted to know anything about Islam, especially if your aim is to understand current conflicts.",
    "It was a good course. Somehow I had an impression going into it that it would teach me everything I needed to know about the the modern Muslim world, and, needless to say, that expectation was never fulfilled. I found myself getting jealous of my friends who took \"Middle Eastern Societies\" instead. In this course you focus on a single country\/region for anywhere from 1-4 lectures, learn a very superficial historical outline, and read a few very short excerpts from the writings of important thinkers\/fundamentalists. It was a perfectly satisfactory course, but not much more than that.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It gives you knowledge about Islam and the political background of Islamic countries that is extremely helpful and relevant in today's world. The class is medium sized and the lectures go by very quickly. Both of the TA's are great so there's no need to worry about being placed with a bad TA. Professor Griffel is a fantastic professor who makes, what may otherwise be pretty abstract information, both digestible and relatable. The workload in the class is very manageable, about 100 pages a week of pretty interesting and accessible reading. The assignments consist of a 5 page essay which is pretty fun and easy to write and the midterm\/final. Exams are fairly straightforward if you study and Professor Griffel provides a study guide that makes the exam pretty easy. Overall an interesting and excellent class for students of all majors",
    "RLST 290 is a great class if you are interested in the modern Middle East. This course will grant you an appreciation for the diversity of theological movements within modern Islam. I have a much stronger grasp of Middle East politics because of this course, and I also feel more comfortable discussing Islam on a theological level. This is a Political Science class in many respects, and a very well taught one.The exams were not surprising, but time was a serious issue on the midterm. Rush!!!!I strongly recommend this class to anyone interested in the material.Note: You don't need to do the Lapidus reading material.",
    "This may be a difficult class if you have no prior knowledge of the Middle East or Islam, but I think that it is an important class to take at Yale and I definitely recommend it. Prof. Griffel is a great lecturer and makes sure that you are prepared for the assessments.",
    "Take it!! It's hard if you aren't experienced with Arabic and Muslim names because lots of it is memorizing people and Arabic vocab words but it is a great class. You learn a lot about important themes in the Muslim world and it is really eye-opening. I recommend it if you have time to devote to studying and doing the readings",
    "I recommend this especially if you have some background in Islam, know what Islam is all about or at least know REAL Muslims. If not, although Griffel is a fair professor, studying the terrorism that traces itself back to certain group of people can leave you with wrong ideas. imagine you have never met a Jew in your life and know nothing about Judaism but take a class on Terrorist Jews. You might in theory think you know that not all Jewish people are terrorists, there is a good chance you will leave that class with wrong reservations or bias against that group and religion\/ethnicity.Also be aware it is often very disturbing material, if you are not thick skinned about these things, readings might be emotionally difficult",
    "Don't let the title throw you off...this class if about fundamentalism within Islam, but carefully distinguishes between mainstream Islam and extremist offshoots. It's a wonderful class. Take this class, and choose Yousef as your TF!",
    "The course is organized geographically, which is hard sometimes when countries are so related poitically. I would recomend it if you are interested in the MIddle East. Having some background of Islam as a religion or the region could only help, as it gets intricate and the names\/place\/dates are numerous. You have to write a 5-page essay by the end of the class on a specified question (he gives a question each week and you decide to do one) or you can write a 10-page paper on the topic of your choosing. The midterm and final are very information-driven, which make seem all \"who cares about dates and names??\" but in the end of the day, thisis stufff you should know if you take this course, so study early, hard, and suck it up.One gaurantee is that Middle East politics will always be up in the air and politically relevant, so I would reocmend it. If you can, get Yousef as your TA, as he is awesome.",
    "Great class for those intrested in the intellectual origins and develpment of a significant starnd of Islamic thought today",
    "It is a really great class. You'll learn loads, the readings are interesting and the exams not too bad.",
    "Yeah it's pretty interesting. Good class to take to learn about modern history surrounding the Middle East if you don't have much exposure to that. The work is just readings, midterm and final and one five page essay which is usually easy. Like \"summarize the main points of the writers we read this week.\" All except the last question which was basically \"how would you solve the war in Afghanistan\" so don't wait until the end",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! As someone with no prior experience in this subject area, this course changed my life and helped me decide on my major. I cannot speak highly enough of this course.",
    "Political Science 435 01 is an excellent class for anyone who wants to learn about the MIddle East region and the reasons why Islam is an important religion politically. A prospective student needs to be aware that there is a lot of reading. However, even with the complicated names the class is worth the time and effort. The exams in the class are very fair.",
    "This is a really interesting class and I enjoyed it a lot. If you're just taking it for interest's sake though, this could be a good credit\/D if you don't have a lot of experience with learning material about the Middle East. It's complicated and gets confusing will all the different people in the various countries.",
    "Yes, take it if you're even slightly interested in Islam, the Middle East, jihad, or in current affairs; the class is broad and introductory, so you definitely don't need prior knowledge, and it helps give good background information to help you follow current affairs. The professor isn't bad either, and though there is a fair amount of work (midterm, 5-page essay, mandatory section, and a final) the grading wasn't harsh. Take it if you want an overview of the political history of Islam, however it is nota theology class, so do not take it if you want to learn about Islam as a religion. I think there are other RLST studies classes for that purpose."
