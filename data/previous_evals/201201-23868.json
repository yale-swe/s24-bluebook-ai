    "This was a great introduction to modeling for students with no exposure. Went through a great text and used current literature to illustrate the points. It would be great if there were a follow-up course to take to learn more about model implementation.",
    "I thought the course was very useful. I would have appreciated having a lab component to the course to cover Matlab\/Mathematica. I also think having a project assigned to us would have been more useful than just coming up with one from scratch.",
    "Strengths: The required readings and assignments were suitable for the class. The concepts were challenging but well rounded. Interesting class activities and discussions.Weaknesses: Coursework and material was sometimes difficult to understand without lectures that preceded the class requirements. There were varying levels of math competency among the students and a deeper explanation for some concepts of more complex probability would have been useful.",
    "This course just needs to be revamped for future years. The coursework is fair but there need to be more lectures than group work.",
    "Weaknesses:1)It was not helpful for students to have to read a substantial amount of materials each week and not be lectured on them in class.2)There was too much homework assigned. Often, there were a lot of materials to read given on top of the homework that is due each week.3)Materials could be presented in a much clearer manner. All students have diverse backgrounds. The instructor taught in a manner as if he assumed that all students had a strong statistical background and is knowledgeable about the various statistical distribution curves.4)Workshops were not helpful.5)Office hours should be spread out better. The office hours were on Monday or Tuesday. The hours should be sometime on Monday and then sometime on another day later in the week.",
    "Excellent interdisciplinary course. Strengths: pragmatic approach to teaching a mathematically intensive subject, great balance between theory and application. Format of the course (with workshops, quizzes, and student projects\/presentations) was greatly conducive to learning and helped students gain confidence with the subject. Weaknesses: not enough time was spent going over answers to homework and workshop problems."

    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0Great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0I appreciated Dr. Townsend's knowledge and enthusiasm for the course. Having more lecture-based courses would have been helpful. I enjoyed the workshops but it would have been nice to have longer lectures that reinforced what we read.",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0Jeff is awesome!",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0strengths: flexible and fair grading scheme. Great at getting students to participate in discussion and analysis of the required readings.weaknesses: more detailed and in depth lectures that preceded course required readings and assignments may have increased the level of competency among students.",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0Weaknesses:1)The instructor could have structured the class better (refer to question #6).2)The instructor did not take into account that students have other priorities and classes when the instructor assigned weekly homework\/reading assignments.3)The instructor did not seem to be readily accessible to students.4)Assignments\/projects were not clearly defined and explained.5)Certain aspects of probabilistic modeling were not discussed in class that were essential for students to know when completing their final projects.6)The instructor taught in a manner as if he assumed that all students had a strong statistical background and is knowledgeable about the various statistical distribution curves.",
    "Instructor: Jeffrey Townsend \u00a0The instructor was an effective teacher, and supportive of student ideas and learning."

    "Chris was great. Very accommodating",
    "Chris was my TA. He was helpful in explaining questions I had on homework assignments. However, I wished that his office was not so far away (from the School of Public Health). This did make it difficult for me to see him when I have questions.",
    "The TA was very helpful, particularly during work on the final project. He was willing to meet outside of office hours to help students with mathematics and coding, and was a great resource to the course."

   "comments": [
    "Great intro to modeling, prepares you to design your own model.",
    "I think it's a great primer on how use modeling for topics in ecology,evolution and infectious diseases. It breaks down mathematical modeling without having to actually use much math.",
    "A great introductory course in modeling, which equipped me with an understanding of fundamental concepts in the field and basic skills in actually running a simple model. Recommended!",
    "Overview of probabilistic statistics and modeling for evolutionary biology and infectious disease. If you are interested in the introductory concepts to evolutionary\/disease modeling then this is the class for you.",
    "This course was challenging and comfort with math is a must. But Jeff was helpful and understanding",
    "A strong mathematical\/statistical background and an understanding of various distribution curves are perhaps necessary for this class. I would probably not recommend this class to other students who are not doing research or is not looking to incorporate modeling into their thesis. A lot of work is required of this class. Therefore, a student already taking a full-course load may find it frustrating to keep up with the work required of this class weekly.",
    "Excellent course, especially for those who happen to enjoy math."
