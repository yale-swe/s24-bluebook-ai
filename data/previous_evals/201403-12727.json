   "comments": [
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. Good luck.",
    "I would recommend math 115 for those that need to take this for a math requirement (pre-med). Kimport is a good instructor and is generally helpful. The psets are fair and reasonable but I warn that the exams are meant to be difficult and challenging. Expect the exams to be akin to detailed AP exams.",
    "MATH 115 is hard but worth it if you enjoy math. I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you have to or unless you really enjoy calculus that much. There are probably better QR credits around if you're just looking to fill a distributional requirement.",
    "A problem set based class that reinforces information through pre-lecture videos and lectures.",
    "This class was pretty poor. The mandatory video lectures made it difficult to be remotely engaged with the material, and class was just a reiteration of the videos from the night before. The prep problems were frustrating to do after problem sets on Thursdays. The exams were pretty hard too. It was really frustrating that there was always a problem set due the day after each midterm. There was also a problem set due during reading week, on material that wasn't to be covered on the exam, which was annoying to have to do. I would not recommend this class if you don't have to take it. If you have to take this class, make sure not to do it at 9 AM, and try and get in a 3-day-per-week section.",
    "Math 115 was a good course to further strength and expand knowledge into calculus with a pretty heavy focus on series in the last half of the class. I would recommend math 115 to someone who is interested into delving further into the study of calculus involving integrals as well series and the practical applications they can have. However, for someone who might have taken AP Calculus BC, it might be more beneficial to just take 120.",
    "Decent workload, homework is fair, and overall material amount is manageable.",
    "Second semester calculus. Definitely recommend.",
    "Basic calculus 2 class, I would reccommend it to others!",
    "Yes! But, only if they are interested in math. If it's your first your, this if you've taken calculus before.",
    "Unexciting.",
    "If you need to take 115, I suggest you take it with Susie, but if you dont need to\/want to take it, it probably isnt the right course for you.",
    "The problem sets and exams are not the same. Exams are much more difficult.",
    "Take it if it's an requirement. Take it with Susie if you want to enjoy it and learn it clearly.",
    "I would honestly say math 115 is a hard, frustrating class that you should probably take because you should finish out calc. I would recommend susie as a teacher, but I wouldn't say I really enjoyed calc.",
    "A difficult course focused on boring material. I would strongly discourage future students from taking the course.",
    "Math 115 has been a great way to explore the topic of integral calculus. The work consisted mainly of weekly problem sets, watching videos and answering a short set of questions before each class, as well as three exams. This semester, it was taught in a \"flipped class\" format, where approximately 10-minute lecture videos were posted before each class, and we answered a set of questions after watching the videos. This let us focus on the more difficult topics during class time, and it let the teacher address the topics that students had questions on. I would recommend Math 115 to another student if he or she has had some introduction to integral calculus before. Although the pace can be somewhat fast at times, our instructor was always available for students who had questions or needed extra help. Our class had approximately 40 people, but we still received a great amount of individual attention. Overall, the course was a challenging but rewarding experience.",
    "Math 115 is a calculus course focused on the second part of calculus (integration). A pretty strong background in differentiation and some knowledge of integration are really helpful in order to do well in this class. I would definitely recommend this class to another student who may need a QR credit or need to take a calculus course. This class is especially a good course if a student has taken calculus before but is hesitant of taking Math 120 (multivariable calc).",
    "If you do not need a math credit, and just want to take math, I wouldn't suggest taking this course. It is made way harder than it needs to be a frankly it takes the joy out of mathematics. If you need to take this course, be prepared to work very hard. Even if you understand homework and prep problems, extra time will be required to learn how to do the exam style problems, which are very different.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a calculus course that's kind of \"middle of the road.\" It's not too easy if you've had some calculus before, but it's also not going to absolutely unbearable. It's a good mix of familiar content and new ideas, which is nice. I would recommend it to someone in search of a challenge, not an easy A.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to learn calculus.",
    "This is a bread-and-butter course, so either you have to take it as a prerequisite for a STEM major, or you don't. It was a great calculus class, but if you're just trying to fill a QR requirement you would want to take something a little bit more exciting.",
    "It is a harder version of the second semester of AP BC Calculus. There is a \"flipped-classroom\" approach, prep problems associated with each video prior to coming to class, and a weekly problem set. The course initially looks like a review of things already learned in high school BC courses, but this class turns out to be much harder. I would recommend this course if you are up to a challenge with somewhat familiar material and want a lot of other students who take the course with whom to study and do homework.",
    "Math 115 is a fairly standard introductory math class. It covers a lot of material but does so at a reasonable pace. I 100% support the use of video lectures to introduce topics beforehand as they allow examples to be done in class. I would recommend this class, especially with Susie Kimport (who had a wonderful, engaging teaching style and made time for students outside of class) to students who need this class to take higher level math courses. I felt like I learned the material, but not where to apply it. It's pretty formula based, and not super conceptual. As always, an engaging, clear instructor is very important. Would definitely recommend Susie Kimport."
