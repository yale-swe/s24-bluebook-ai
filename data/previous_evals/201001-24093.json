    "I had never taken a film studies course, but this is a great one to take if you're interested in the field. It helps to have at least some appreciation for Woody Allen's work before taking the class, but it is by no means required. A manageable about of work (2 papers and a short presentation), and watching a couple of Allen films per week is a nice break from the usual reading\/writing courseload. Highly recommended.",
    "You watch 1-2 Woody Allen films (outside of class, as screenings) every week, discuss and dissect them in class on Friday afternoon (Looking at them from filmic, feminist, representations-of-the-city, Jewish, humor, and other perspectives), and just have a general awesome time. The teacher is awesome, fun and supportive. Though the discussions were sometimes not ruthlessly academic or intellectual, and more of the \"I liked this! I didn't like that!\" variety (Again, just occasionally), I learned a lot in the class and recommend it to any student of any major.",
    "Very interesting if you like Woody Allen and films in general, and Professor Kerbel is great. But be warned: after this class you might not like Woody Allen so much.",
    "The class covers as much of Woody Allen's career as possible. There is no way to have added more films without making the work too much. The class is really fun and I definitely learned a lot about Allen. The class size was perfect, and the smaller the better for this class. Discussions were really important.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course."
