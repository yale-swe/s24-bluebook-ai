   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Tons of knowledge about different traditions in theology and where points of disagreement were between them. Especially deepened my understanding of the early church.",
    "Knowledge: You learn a lot about the law; its origins, how it functions, different arguments concerning its creation and adjudication. You learn also a lot about Christianity and Judaism; how they originate, their rationality, how different philosophers tried to make sense of them over time. Skills: You have to submit 3-4 \"reading responses\", through which you write about whatever you want. As you are able to write as many as you would like, they offer a good opportunity to practice writing, and Prof. Hayes offers EXCELLENT feedback. Insights: You will gain life insights, new ways of seeing the world. You will probably question the way you see the world after this class every day.",
    "This course changed my perspective on religion in deeply meaningful ways. I find that the subject matters from this course often pop up in daily conversation. I did not know theory of divine law was so important to understanding the world around me until I took this course, and now I strongly believe that I would not have be well informed about many of the opinions I used to have without this course.",
    "I gained a great deal of knowledge about the development of divine law and the different ways thinkers conceptualized it throughout history. I'm especially grateful for this, because I don't think it's something I would've learned about otherwise. I improved my reading comprehension skills; I mean, philosophers are the worst writers, and if you can understand them, you're set. I gained some cool insights into ways something as loft as divine law theory actually applied to my life and issues I struggle with sometimes.",
    "I gained an understanding and appreciation of the variety of philosophies that can spring up around a single religious tradition.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about religions and their systems of law and how the ideas of God evolved through Biblical Israel to Christianity to the Rabbinic times and medieval Church up to modern thinkers. I learned how to analyze religious thought and compare the thinkers.",
    "This course introduced me to a fascinating swath of philosophers and religious thinkers from throughout history. I learned how to tackle complex texts and gained insight into comparing and contrasting seemingly disparate arguments from radically different authors. Also, this class has prepared me to better summarize readings in a seminar-style setting.",
    "I learned how to critically analyze both primary and secondary documents from times that predate the modern era.",
    "I gained invaluable insights into the development to religious and secular thought through a historical lens. I learned about critical thinking and effective reading.",
    "I never would have been able to analyze divine law through a historical lens. I gained skills to help me analytically view history and certain aspects of it."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are exceptional teaching and interesting subject matter. Weakness was the time slot. (Tuesday Thursday 9 am)",
    "More graded work would add to the strength of this course.",
    "Strengths: The material and the professor. This class is mind-blowing; yes the readings are difficult and will challenge you, but they will prepare you to analyze even more difficult readings in future classes, and you will have the opportunity to practice synthesizing advanced level arguments in your reading responses and class discussions. Weakness: It's a bit difficult to tell what your grade is for most of the course; at the same time, while taking the course, I was almost never really worried about it.",
    "The course readings are well curated, the course is fun to participate in, Professor Hayes is clear about her expectations and her communication. A joy of a class to be in. The readings were interesting and well explained. There was just enough reading that it was a substantial amount, but not too much so as to scare off students. I did all the reading. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Strengths: great content! great analysis of it too\/Christine really helps you understand it at a level unattainable by most on their own Weaknesses: it's very early...9 am was tough. I think I'd be much more engaged had it been later in the day. the final paper was also a bit of a jump. even though we had some reading responses, I had almost no clue what was exactly expected of the final paper.",
    "This course is a lot of reading but very much worth it. Class discussions give deeper understandings and interpretations of the material",
    "This was an excellent course that was taught in an excellent way. I really enjoyed the course. Probably the best course of the semester.",
    "This is an excellent course. Professor Hayes knows what she's doing and has this class down to a science. She knows how to make accessible remarkably complex ideas and concepts. I loved almost all of the readings and learned more than I thought was possible in a single semester. I also appreciate how Professor Hayes didn't rely on busywork to keep students engaged. Though the number of day-to-day graded assignments was low, the challenge of the course remained high. The readings were very difficult and she always expected that students arrive to class having considered seriously the day's assignment. One small critique I would raise is that I feel as though too much time was spent summarizing the readings. The material we covered was undoubtably challenging. However, I would have preferred a seminar that placed a premium on deep analysis and debate. Summary is important, especially with the dense literature this class requires. However, I'm not alway able to fully grasp the concepts of the text through summary. I learn best when I'm forced to analyze, debate, and make an argument. Besides that small critique, though, this class was excellent. Even if nothing was changed, I would take the course again if I could.",
    "I thought this classs excelled at forcing us students to interpret renown sources with context of the time period and different incentives. I thought the course could be improved by a stricter schedule.",
    "A strength of this class is how the material develops and themes are brought back up later in the course. The seminar style is also excellent.",
    "Amazing professor - clear, succinct, interesting, engaging lectures. The readings were a little long and confusing, but they were made very clear in class."

   "comments": [
    "Totally would",
    "Yes! It was a fascinating course that can be taken with no prior knowledge and is extremely interesting to learn about. Professor Hayes teaches well and engagingly.",
    "YES. TAKE THIS COURSE. This is probably the best course I took over the course of my freshman year. Professor Hayes is a stellar professor and a wonderful person. TAKE IT REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER MAJOR YOU ARE CONSIDERING. This is not only a fantastic class to take because of its material but also because of its professor and her willingness to help you improve as a seminar student at Yale. Take this course in particular if you have any interest in learning about law, religion, morality, philosophy, etc. You will read a ton of Apologetics, religious texts, law review articles, such a variety of works. Though they might be difficult, Prof. Hayes will guide you through understanding the key points and crucial arguments, and class discussions are always very engaging and interesting. While this course is not technically a course on church-state relations, you will discuss in class topics that pertain to the intersection of politics and religion.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in the humanities or to any religious person. Very interesting.",
    "Yes, but only if it's what you're looking for. This is a seminar, though Christine does a lot of the talking. There is a fair amount of reading, but if it's a subject you want to learn about, then it's fulfilling.",
    "Absolutely recommended. If you are even slightly interested in theology this course really gives insightful historical context to the development of divine law and philosophy. Hayes is absolutely brilliant and a blast to learn from, even at 9AM.",
    "Yes",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If you have even a minor interest in religion or law this is a must take course!!! one of the greatest courses with one of the greatest professors at Yale!!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This class has been the highlight of my entire first year at Yale. The knowledge I've gained from this class is priceless. Professor Hayes is genius. Taking Divine Law is an opportunity no one should pass up. I learned about history, philosophy, religion and so much more. The course has even inspired me to take more religious study courses in the future.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because I think it deepens one's understanding of world history and law.",
    "STRONGLY RECOMMEND.",
    "Absolutely! It was a wonderful class, and Professor Hayes is amazing. She's well-versed on the subject and an absolutely lovely person. It's a great chance to study an interesting subject you may never again encounter."
