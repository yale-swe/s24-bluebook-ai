    "The way Marjorie brought in her own current\/past experiences to supplement the material and give real-life examples of land use law in action.",
    "The best aspects of this course were (1) the diverse interest and experience of the students in the class, who brought their perspectives to the class discussions, and (2) the vast experience and complex perspective of the instructor.",
    "Shansky",
    "Marjorie is a delightful person is clearly passionate and incredibly knowledgable about the subject matter.",
    "Professor Shansky's lectures ground the material we are reading for class with ancedotes of examples from her profession experience. This really enhanced my uptake of the material and helped my understand the utility of this course.",
    "Hearing Marjorie's stories of being a land use lawyer. Love the practitioner's perspective.",
    "The best part about this course was the energy and enthusiasm that the professor brought to each and every class. The instructor is extremely passionate about land use law, and this made each class extremely interesting and engaging. Also, the instructor works full time as an attorney, and her experiences serve to bring the material to life. The class was a great mix of case law, conceptual frameworks, and illustrative anecdotes, which made for a well-rounded examination of land use law in an environmental context.",
    "Detailed explanations of ways local, state, and national legal cases affect environmental land use (with a strong emphasis on local levels, like planning and zoning board processes) helped show ways that law can help\/hinder environmental management. It was excellent to get this information from a local expert in the field, and follow along with her pertinent cases as they unraveled.",
    "I feel that much of the content of the course should be required to enable better, more informed civic engagement! Marjorie is a delight. Though the presentation of information may not always be linear (not a critique, in my book), it promises to be interesting, considered, and provocative to help me crystallize my own opinions\/ideas"

   "comments": [
    "We barely discussed the cases, and when we did, we gave most of them a surface-level reading. We should have spent more time on these!",
    "I would have appreciated more field trips to witness land use law in practice.",
    "I would have really appreciated a more comprehensive introduction to the subject matter before jumping into cases.I also found it really hard to predict where we were on the syllabus.",
    "Use more powerpoint presentations. A couple field trips to planning meetings would be great!",
    "The class could use greater accountability to ensure that everyone in the class does the readings. I often felt that classes could have been more productive if there were more of an incentive for students to read and annotate each case.",
    "A pointed summary of why certain cases we were assigned to read were\/are important to environmental management today would have been helpful. We covered this information in class, but the cases were so multifaceted that a one to three sentence \"take-aways\" summary at the end of each case reading would have clarified complex cases.",
    "Reading cases can be somewhat dry and hard to muster the effort, but it's good practice and this is one of the most friendly ways to learn to do so! Also, they (we) get better as the semester continues"

    "Understanding the law behind land use actions is critical for lawyers, planners, and other fields that work in the local land use sector. I think this class fills an absolutely crucial niche for gaining a well-rounded understanding of land use.",

    "I have no experience in law and am interested in planning and water resources.",
    "Land use law is important to any aspect of environmental work. I think a lot of change can happen at the local level... and I am excited to learn more!",
    "As someone interested in urban forestry and social justice, this class was very useful. It helped me to better understand both the opportunities and the challenges to using land in an environmentally responsible and socially equitable manner.",
    "The legal system controls many aspects of what an environmental manager can and can not do in lands conservation, and this class showed the specific ways that system can be formed and manipulated to achieve conservation goals, even in the midst of heavy pushes for new developments."

I was particularly interested in learning more about who drives the planning process, who the various interests in the process are, and how the process affects the residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods.",

    "Absolutely, Marjorie explained everything very well and clearly and always took the time to make sure the class (who all come from very different backgrounds- lawyers, scientists, engineers, etc) understood legal concepts. The knowledge of Connecticut land use law that I gained during this course was extremely helpful to me this semester and will continue to serve me well into the future, as I am considering doing legal work in CT.",
    "Yes!",
    "I feel like I don't know as much about the process of land use regulation as I hoped I would, but I do know that it's a very localized process, so I'm not sure I could have learned that much more without the knowledge being highly specific to a certain geographic area that may or may not be relevant to me.",
    "Yes!",
    "Unfortunately, I don't think I took as much knowledge away with me from this course as I expected.",
    "Yes. My improved understanding the land use system will help me in my personal and professional life.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, the course met my expectations.",
    "Yes. It also spurred greater thinking and effort on my part as to how local (and state, federal) land use affect my area of interest. I dove into this deeper through private meetings with Ms. Shanksy and on the final paper, and this subject has now become one of the guiding projects in my studies. I will be presenting on it in an upcoming national conference, and I doubt that would have happened without this class. In summary--the course sparked my thinking, research, and action regarding my area of interest."

Take this course if you're interested in doing anything related to the land...anything relating to building, preservation\/conservation, activism, etc. - you will learn how to navigate the legal system.",

    "Take it!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the legal processes and precedents governing the establishment and the adjustment of land use. The class requires an average amount of work, and the final project allows each student to pursue a topic of interest to him or her. This contributed a great deal to what I took away from this class!",
