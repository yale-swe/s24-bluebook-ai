    "Not a beginners class. Fun, if you like Spanish.",
    "It is a very helpful basic spanish class, that moves through the essentials of the spanish.",
    "It's a fun class and as someone who has never taken the language before it was difficult to be in a class with kids who have taken Spanish before, but as the semester goes on you catch up.",
    "An intense introduction that is perfect if you really want to learn the language because it moves fast and requires that you work hard. It's not terribly interesting or engaging, but it is necessary to start her, so you have to keep the big picture in mind and work hard.",
    "Don't take this course if you have no experience with Spanish. It moves very quickly and will take up the majority of your study time. It is impossible to get an A when others have had 4 years of spanish.",
    "good basic course, but i wouldn't take the course if u haven't taken spanish before, because YOU'RE GONNA STRUGGLE. Almost everyone in the class had taken spanish before and the kids who didn't suffered."
