    "It's an excellent course of stochastic process. I especially appreciate all the proofs we did in the class. Some proofs are tricky and some are elegant. It's fascinating.sure.",

    "It might not directly relate to my research, but it gave me a solid background on probabilities which would be useful with no doubts.",
    "I was thinking it more like the applications in Physics, like the modeling about different processes. Then the class was different, but I learned a lot. So it's an interesting class."
