   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course for people who can take good lecture notes and come to every class. The readings definitely reinforce the topics, but most of the main information on exams is from the lecture. This course is a bit of work--quizzes every week and three in-class exams. The quizzes were sometimes tricky, but you can drop the lowest two scores. If you can keep up on the material, then you should do fine.",
    "Hard work. Interesting, but take it only if you're willing to study.",
    "I would recommend it to an MCDB major student because the class is a fair class andnot a lot of work outside classtime.",
    "A class on development of Drosophila, plants, Zebrafish and other creatures studied in this field. Definitely helps with understanding of human development since most of the processes are analogous.I wouldn't necessarily recommend this class because the simple fact is that it's BORING. The information isn't boring, the LECTURERS are boring. So, if you're interested in the information, stick with it. But, if lecturers are a huge part of it for you (as they should be) then don't take this class. Additionally, this is NOT an easy A. It requires time and focus and careful examination of all presented info.",
    "This class covered very interesting topics, such as limb development. However, the class felt redundant at times, and that made the class a little less enjoyable.",
    "Straight-forward, standard bio class. Won't try to trick you, and easy to study for. Instructors who care. Not terribly exciting but is pretty clear.",
    "Developmental Bio was a solidly taught and organized course - the lectures all connected seamlessly and I appreciated how all three professors in some way linked their particular lecture materials with previous lectures. The course integrated concepts from genetics and cellular biology very well, and I liked especially the small class size. I definitely think I emerged from the class with a better understanding of experimental design. The material was also very fascinating! My only qualm is that Professor Kankel's lectures, relying on links, were sometimes unorganized. In terms of workload, I think this class is preferable to cell biology - optional readings, a quiz each class (of which you drop two), three midterms, and no final. Take it!"
