   "comments": [
    "LITR 120 is a great place to begin exploring your interest in literature. It is not a very difficult class, and you sample a wide variety of literature across different periods and geographical regions. You basically read 1 book per week, attend a lecture on the work and discuss it in section. The workload is not too heavy, and the papers increase in length gradually (4\/5 pages, 6\/7 pages and 10 pages) so it gives you time to adapt to the style of writing.Get Professor Fradinger's section if she teaches it again and if you can. She is an amazing professor.",
    "It's a great course for an English 120 student who wants less rigor in terms of scheduling and more interesting subject material, or for those really just fishing to read a wide variety and write on a select few without feeling constrained by the need to analyze every line of grammar and dialogue and so on.",
    "I would recommend the course because the lectures and books were very interesting.",
    "YES. Not too many readings, light course load (only three papers), but excellent lectures and discussions. Unlike typical English or Lit courses, you get to listen to three different professors give lectures, and you have section with a professor as opposed to with a grad student. The class focuses on narrative, not necessarily on language - so if you like approaching literature from a philosophical perspective, I highly recommend this class.",
    "Take it. The syllabus was amazing, and if you have section with McCrea, you will love the class.",
    "Literature 120 is a co-taught course that focuses on various types of narratives such as films (documentary, Hollywood films,and experimental films), fairy tales, detective stories, notes, and several novels. Students will write three papers of increasing length as the semester progresses. The first class of the week is usually a lecture (on occasion a seminar) and the second class is a discussion on lecture and the narrative. Discussions are led by professors. Themes that are discussed in the class are memory failure, the passage of time, sexuality, issues of low\/high culture, psychoanalysis, and the purpose of narratives.",
    "If not a Lit major but love stories, I highly recommend you take it. Though you have a 1\/3 chance of disliking your section, those are still good odds. Moira is my new favorite person, and Barry charms my pants off.",
    "Literature 120 has a lot of great books on the reading list. Lecture is often relaxing and enjoyable. Great class to take if you're in need of a WR credit or even if you're just interested in the literature.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you want to be a lit major. If not, you might be annoyed by the other students in your section.",
    "An introductory literature course with one lecture a week from one of the three professors in the class, heavy readings, and a discussion section guided by one of the professors of the class.I would recommend it because it was interesting and fair.",
    "Unless they overhaul the course, don't take it unless you have to. It's a pretty easy, but often boring, course. Sections are fun with Prof. McCrea, but the lack of structure throughout the semester kind of leaves you without a sense of real accomplishment at the end.",
    "Depending on which instructor you have as a section leader, you will receive wonderful or horrendous grades. In any case, the way you read WILL change. A great course.",
    "This is a great introduction both to the study of narrative and to a wide range of important texts. i recommend it for people looking to fulfill a writing credit and for anyone interested in the Literature major.",
    "Yes! Most people taking this class are probably either confirmed or potential Literature majors, but it's a great class if you need a WR credit and are looking for a very diverse syllabus.",
    "I came in as non-Lit. Honestly the course felt pretty disjointed. My section, Clark, was particularly dull and we only scratched the surface of this whole notion of the art of \"narrative\". Instead, I felt like we focused too closely on the content of the texts. Needed more academic papers\/perspectives to tie it all together. That being said, the reading list is pretty solid and it does count as a writing credit.",
    "This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The professors are great and the material is really interesting. Go to lecture- you won't regret it.",
    "Reading a book a eek gets pretty daunting, and if you don't get to the reading on time, you just won't be able to read the book that week. I missed all the movie screenings, but you can just do those on your own ( Film Studies Center\/ Netflix). The books are fanstastic for the most part. Lecture Mondays, section Wednesdays. If you take Moira's section, you will have a real bonding experience with your group. (she invited us all for dinner with her husband, who teaches film here at Yale) Moira was always reminding us of the importance of \"community-building\". She's fairly flexible with deadlines, too. Moira also schedules some of her own movie screenings. Also, you get to lead one of your sections on a book of your choice, which is both a valuable experience in leadership (especially since you get to literally \"be the professor\" and lead the section that day) and an excellent ice-breaker. By the end of the course, you feel extremely comfortable with your group.",
    "I would. It's lots of work but is both rewarding and fun. I really enjoyed writing the final paper.",
    "In this class you learn how to analyze the structure of narrative rather than your typical very detailed look at specific lines of text. It is useful because you learn a different type of literary analysis. I really liked the books\/movies we read as well. I would recommend it especially for English\/Literature majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for someone who is interested in any kind of literature. It provides a good framework to understand what literary analysis entails and the discussions in section are very enjoyable.",
    "Take it if Professor McCrea's teaching it, and try like hell to get into his section. I'd heard it was as bad as LITR 122, but it really depends on the professor. I hated LITR 122 and my impression was that the other professors of this course weren't that great (I sat in on another section and it was like death), but Professor McCrea is AMAZING. Lecture's not too helpful but can be interesting sometimes for class discussions. The reading list is great, but again, the quality of the class really depends on who you get for section.",
    "[copied from Q1]__________]The syllabus is pretty cool and the professors are as well. You go from fairytales and the Arabian Nights to experimental lit and cinema. If you check out the syllabus and it strikes your fancy, especially the part about not too much work, I'd recommend it. Three essays to write. And when writing, your grades will be better if you err towards focusing on style and logic than on making brilliant points. A note though: the professors know their stuff and none of the books you read are ones you'd think of as a waste of time, but the course does lose some momentum because there are 3 professor, each with a different style and bent. The course does need some work, from the hodgepodge of the syllabus to why it's taught in a lecture-seminar format by three professors in the first place. To be honest, it's also not anywhere near the most interesting of classes you could take but if you're a Lit major you need it, and if you're not it's a simple choice between it and all the other writing\/english classes. Shop it, note the interesting parts of the syllabus, but do so with a salt shaker.",
    "Much much better than I expected after loathing LITR 122 (the other intro level prerequisite for the Lit major). Fun books, fun movies, great discussions IF you choose the right professor for your section. 3 mid-length papers (5-10 pp)."
