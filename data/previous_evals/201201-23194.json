    "Professor Quint is a great person to take Major English Poets with. He is extremely knowledgeable about Milton, Pope, Wordsworth and Yeats. This was my second time reading Paradise Lost, and it's incredible how much more I got out of it. For example, Quint knew all the jokes and puns that were within the text and was able to point them out. I had no idea that Milton was funny before this class.He is a very difficult grader, and I had to work much much harder to get the same grades that I get in other classes. That said, it made me a better thinker and English student. I think that it was worth it, especially for a course that's at the beginning of the English major. I'll be better able to take advantage of the higher level courses because of Quint's tutelage.This wasn't my favorite class - of the poets, I only really liked Yeats. That said, if you want to be an English major, you have to take it! I will say that it was not as painful as it could have otherwise been.",
    "If you want to be an English major, you have to take this class. As much as I admire Quint's skills, I would recommended shopping different sections of English 126 for a less awkward, forced class experience. Also, expect to be bored with the 16th and 17th century verses of Milton and Wordsworth. Pope is funny. Yeats, whose work stretches into the 20th century, is the most enjoyable. Also expect to see your writing improve immensely.",
    "I would recommend this class even to students who don't intend on pursuing english as a major because the texts are interesting and it helps to hone your essay writing skills.",
    "Take it--Especially if you're unfamiliar with these poets; I was, and I learned a lot.",
    "quint is hilarious and talks about sex a lot. weird due and expects a certain thing but the class wasn't bad",
    "As a class 126 teaches you the basic building blocks of English literature. It is an important knowledge base to have, but is absolutely a tough course taught by tough graders. Professor Quint challenges you to really think, but can be a bit harsh."
