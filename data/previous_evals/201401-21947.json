    "I would definitely recommend the class. Material culture is a really cool field to study and there's just so much you can do within the field. The workload was super manageable and the readings were largely really interesting and enjoyable as well. If it's offered again, definitely go for it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Very interesting but not too much work.",
    "I don't think this specific class is going to be offered again but if it is, take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class. I have a suspicion that many more students would've signed up for this class had the Blue Book listing been more explicit (as it is, AMST 390 only ever says \"junior seminar in American Studies,\" or something equally vague and unhelpful). The readings can be long, but the subject matter is so interesting and cast from such a new light that they were always engaging. The papers were easy and fun, and really allowed each student to select topics that were of interest to them. Discussions were also fun, incorporating a bit of a show-and-tell element. Great class."
