    "talked about relevant human rights issues and questions, but much more focused on developing our own projects.",
    "This capstone class felt like a critical human rights book club, but in a good way. We all got to know each other well, became invested in each other's work and had a great time pushing each other in this setting. This was a fun class that I always looked forward to attending.",
    "I completed a capstone project relating to my chosen concentration in human rights. The class was my first experience with a semester-long, self-directed project, and I was given a level of free rein over the process to which I'm not accustomed - this was really valuable before my spring semester thesis. I got to delve quite deeply into my focus topic and spend a lot of time writing proposals, getting peer feedback, and meeting with Jim and Paul to shape my project - the insight I gained was issue-specific but certainly quite extensive by the end of the semester.",
    "Critical thinking skills about human rights. A chance to grow and reflect as a class and collaborate on practical applications of what we've learned.",
    "I learned to give righteous presentations"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are in the students and the professor as well as the projects we each were doing. More time should be devoted to sharing those projects and collaborating\/providing feedback as well as talking about relevant issues in our discussion. Less so on overarching ideas of human rights. It would be cool to almost have a current events period in each class for relevant HR stuff",
    "Discussions were pretty good and I liked how varied the sources were on our reading list. As far as our capstone projects, the second reader policy on our capstone projects could be enforced. Also, it was helpful to hear feedback from classmates working on a variety of projects, but there could be formal or informal grouping of people who are working on projects with a similar theme or focus to share resources. It's always better to do that than to encourage people to unofficially e-mail each other resources when they come across them.",
    "Out of all of the HMRT program courses, this one was by far the best. This course took a critical eye towards human rights, which sparked many great conversations. Perhaps the guidance\/guidelines for the capstone should be made more clear from the beginning, but otherwise, I thought this class was the most successful aspect of the MAPHR.",
    "The feedback we were given leading up to the end of the semester was especially strong\/constructive and ensured we were all on top of our projects. Everyone gave presentations periodically detailing their progress, which was awesome because we got to explore the issues that everyone else in the program was passionate about (one of the highlights of being in the class was the community feel of the cohort). Sometimes the non-project weeks came with assigned readings that felt a bit disjointed in relation to the course - was this a capstone seminar or a general senior human rights colloquium? I guess it could be both, but the focus of the course seemed unclear at times.",
    "I know that a lot of the readings were required by the College but I'm not sure they were the most effective way to think about different modes of engaging with human rights. I definitely appreciated the opportunity to discuss issues as a class and spend time with the cohort, but I wonder if many of our discussions brought us to the same troubling place of criticizing human rights and social justice work without taking enough time to appreciate why it's important and why we ourselves want to engage with it. Also, the timing of when we got assignments and had to do them was a bit erratic, which at times was unnecessarily stressful.",
    "no improvement needed"

   "comments": [
    "It's required if you're in the HR program.",
    "Yes! Jim and Paul are amazing and the space created by this seminar is truly unique. In our group, we pushed ourselves to have many difficult conversations, which was productive for all of us in the end. Most of all though, it was beautiful watching everyone's final capstone projects come together.",
    "You'll have to take this course if you are in the Human Rights program, so just make sure your cohort is keeping an open line of communication with Jim and Paul so you know what kind of format\/assignments to expect that year!",
    "The capstone is a great way to culminate the MAPHR program. I think they're still working out the kinks of what students should get out of it, but overall it was nice to spend time with Jim, Paul, and the cohort and see all of everyone's projects.",
    "yes."
