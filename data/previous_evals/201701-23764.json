   "comments": [
    "I was exposed to much of the foundational literature of political economy. It was particularly useful for contextualizing and threading together different arguments within PE.",
    "This course introduced me to several different areas in political economy. This course provided a great overview of the literature and, in the course, we focused on big ideas rather than minute quantitative analyses.",
    "I gained an introduction to fundamental texts in political economy. I also learned a bit about how to read and write like a political scientist.",
    "I developed a foundational knowledge of comparative political economy approaches and topics. Not only was I able to engage with many canonical works, but came away with a new way of thinking about problems and questions in every context.",
    "This class is one of the best I have taken for stimulating creative insights that draw on political science and economics.",
    "Broad understanding of the literature.",
    "I was introduced to major themes in comparative political economy - different causal agents (material factors, institutions, ideology, culture); debates on contemporary issues like inequality, gender-based economic discrimination, reform, regulation and business cycles. The main skill I developed in this seminar is to make connections, think about big issues and make arguments (not regurgitate facts or summarize existing literature).",
    "an excellent overview on topics of political economy",
    "I am now better able to contextualize political economy articles I had read previously.",
    "In the first few weeks of the course, I learnt about theoretical aspects such as materialism, institutionalism and cultural-ism. In the second half of the course, I learnt about a range of empirical political economy themes such as regulation, labour and the welfare state, income inequality, political economy of gender, democracy and development and political economy of reform.",
    "I got broad exposure to issues in political economy.",
    "Great connections between classics of political economy literature"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is great as a survey course for the PE literature. I think the main drawback of the course was that there were too many people.",
    "There should be more political economy courses such as this one offered at Yale. While I benefited greatly by the nature of this course, which focused on ideas rather than empirical tests, I think a great complement to this course would be another, separate course in political economy that focused more on empirical strategies in political economy.",
    "On the whole I think the course was very informative and well taught. There were times when I wish we had dug into the material a bit more deeply, though.",
    "The content is approachable yet challenging. The organization of the course was logical and helpful. I wish the course were smaller, just for the smaller-classroom experience. Professor Rosenbluth did a great job managing the discussion to make sure everyone spoke though.",
    "Follows an original and interesting path. Most literature is quite old though, perhaps should include more recent papers.",
    "I really like the way this course is structured - it emphasises reading over writing (for the sake of writing). I would not change anything in course, but I have an idea that might be considered: The main aim of the reading responses is to discuss the readings NOT summarize them; engage with them and make an argument, NOT paraphrase them. An interesting way to do this might be to ask students to write one paragraph every week (~250 words) with the following instructions: (1) The paragraph cannot summarize any argument, briefly or otherwise. (2) It cannot use complex words (ending in \"ization\", \"isms\" etc); (3) It must begin with a one-line thesis statement or argument, with the rest of the space used to unpackage the argument (abstract style). (4) It must make an original point - something that takes forward the discussion\/debate, re-theorizes the issue or argues for a new test (or design to test) findings. I suggest this because my sense is that critical thinking and reasoning are often obfuscated by summarising and using complex words. Saying \"urbanization causes X\" is often an easy way to not think clearly and precisely; while going on about \"how A said X, B said Y\" is using space to not make an original point. A narrower, strictly defined writing assignment might force students to do what is intended. Only a suggestion!",
    "Frances is incredibly clear and is able to lead the most thorough discussions.",
    "The syllabus is an impressive and incredibly useful outline for understanding political economy. However, for some topics, it felt like the class was more or less interested in the material. Perhaps it would have been good to weight the time spent on various topics according to class interest (then again, there were some topics I didn't anticipate finding interesting and was pleasantly surprised when I did, so maybe the current set up is best).",
    "Strengths of the course: (i) The weekly response papers enabled me to critically engage with the readings and be prepared for class; (ii) The class discussions were some of the best I have been a part of at Yale; (iii) The course covers all the important works one should be familiar as a student of political economy and hence, it helped me build a good fundamental base. I can't really think of a weakness of the course, but if I had to suggest one, it would be a few more empirical works from developing country contexts.",
    "Frances really knows how to run this course. Discussion of the readings is seamlessly woven together with mini lectures on the relevant background. This is right up there with Greg's behavior course as a jaw-droppingly good seminar. The only complaint I can think of is that a time or two, Frances sometimes let us go too far off the rails. Those discussions were fun, but not everybody needs to be able to say their piece when we are way out in left field.",
    "Outstanding job by Prof Rosenbluth at systematically breaking up the literature and pointing out connections"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if you desired to be exposed to the literature in a way that you can also build an fundamental understanding of how economies function and if Frances is teaching it.",
    "Yes, this is the best course that I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this to any student who is interested in a baseline course in political economy. Professor Rosenbluth offered a well-organized synthesis of a few different bodies of literature.",
    "Yes, to any economics of comparative political science student.",
    "This is a great class taught by a fantastic instructor.",
    "Yes, for reasons outlined above.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "I definitely would. Frances is a brilliant teacher and facilitator of class discussions.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to another student. This is a fundamental course in political economy and any student of political economy will gain a whole lot from the course's readings and class discussions. This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale until now. I would add that this course is heavy on both reading and writing, and if a student is consistently engaged in both, then he\/ she will learn a significant amount.",
    "Strongly recommend. I wish I had taken this first year. Broad exposure, reasonable workload, the major assignment is designed to be useful to your research agenda.",
    "Yes. Excellent course.",
    "For anyone with PE interest, this course is a must!"
