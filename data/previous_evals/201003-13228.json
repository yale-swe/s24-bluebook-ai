    "Absolutely take it, no questions. Just do it.",
    "Postcolonial literature.",
    "This is very much a theory-driven class: you will learn about the key concepts in post-colonial studies, with some reference to historical and literary trends. That being said, the reading is very manageable and class discussion is helpful to dissecting these complex concepts. In addition to reading, you will also have to complete several blog posts, a class presentation and a final project situating several key concepts in the post-colonial canon.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in how cultures view each other and form identities. It is a very relevant and applicable issue to our world. That said, it requires a large amount of self-guidance because the classes are led by student presentations, and the material covers a broad array of issues that are at times hard to piece together. Be prepared to fend for yourself.",
    "TAKE IT if you have any interest in postcolonial studies (which you should. don't ignore remnants of colonialism in a postcolonial world.)The material is often extremely difficult; you'll read a lot of dense theory. Think: distorting binaries, distorting the distortion of those binaries, destabilizing the distortion of the distortion of those binaries, etc. I'm exaggerating...but not really. But you'll also read passionate and accessible literature and discourse (Fanon, Cesaire, Mernissi), which is a lot more fun. There is really not much work in this class-- just 6 reading responses, a presentation, and a final project-- but the reading responses are pretty challenging and she expects you to take them seriously. She also gives you plenty of opportunities to replace bad grades with good ones, so if you WANT to get an A and are willing to put in some time, you definitely CAN get an A with no problems. The Professor is the bomb. She really knows what she's talking about and welcomes you to debate and question the material in class-- but don't expect her to not challenge your comments! The only sad thing about this class was that it attracted somesuper aggressive seminar warriors who seemed to forget that we were all in class to learn, not to attack each other and\/or the professor. But there were only 1 or 2 of these kids in our seminar.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you have a strong desire to actually learn about post-colonial theory in depth rather than casually explore it.",
    "If you think you're remotely interested in the subject material, TAKE IT. It's been my favorite class at Yale. You learn an entirely new way of thinking about the world. The readings are interesting, and because it's cross-listed in so many departments, you get a really diverse set of opinions on them. Professor Tamalet is awesome: a tough-ish but fair grader, she always makes herself available for students who feel like they're struggling. START YOUR BLOG POSTS EARLY, THOUGH. I think this is what most of the class would do differently if we were taking the class over again. It seriously makes class discussion so much easier to follow, and the prof will let you write more than six and only take the best six grades if you're worried that you don't know enough to substantially respond to the texts at the beginning.All in all, a substantial but manageable introduction to an important body of thought. I can't think of a single reason why you shouldn't take this class. IT WAS OFFERED AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING, I NEVER MISSED IT ONCE AND I AM STILL RAVING ABOUT IT. I think these things speak for themselves.",
    "YES! The readings give a very strong background\/sense of the field. Though some of the material is difficult, Professor Tamalet has an amazing ability to communicate complex theoretical concepts to students. Course discussions were exciting and productive. I was originally skeptical of the final project since I am used to longer papers, but it turns out to be challenging and involve a good deal of research\/critical thinking. There are few classes that I would wake up to attend at 9:00am twice a week, and this was absolutely worth it.",
    "Absolutely! If for no other reason than the incredible class reading list.",
    "This class is an introduction to postcolonialism. Take it if you're interested in issues of representing other peoples and other cultures -- these are questions that are vitally important to most ethnic studies fields, as well as anthropology, sociology, etc. The postcolonial condition is something that seems specific and inapplicable to your other academic interests, but you will be surprised by how closely it ties in or helps you to see another dimension of it.The books are quite enjoyable, but we spend most of our time on theory instead, which can at times be a bit dull and even ridiculous. Applications of continental philosophy, if you're interested, become clearer in this class.The class in general is pretty good. The professor is excellent at explaining just about everything but how she's going to grade you. Since there are no essays, it's a bit harder to know what makes for a successful blog post or dictionary entry, but these things cut down on the major projects you do for the class.",
    "This class gives a good overview of post-colonial texts and concepts, although the big downside is that it seemed to attract a large proportion of section assholes. If you have a low tolerance for jargon filled BS, than I would stay away. The Professor is good though and she will reward you if you think through the concepts in a clear and straightforward manner.This class also has extremely little work - the final project was less then 1000 words long and a third of the final grade, the other two thirds made up of participation (leading one class discussion) and 6 reading responses.",
    "This course is an intro to postcolonial studies and exposes you to literature and theory that is not readily discussed in many courses at Yale. Professor Tamalet does a great job making very complicated topics accessible. I would definitely recommend this course to everyone.",
    "Fairly good class. If it's being offered as a lecture, TAKE IT. If it's still a seminar, you should probably still take it unless it's scheduled early in the morning again (it was at 9 am twice a week for me). Just make sure you get a good read of the other people in the class during shopping period. My class had a few problematic people that made discussion more frustrating at times than it otherwise should have been. This isn't Prof. Tamalet's fault at all, though; she's great. Also, this class has almost no major workload, which is pretty cool.",
    "This course included a reading of literature and theory sources that are significant is shaping the discipline of Postcolonial Studies. Students were asked to write responses to theses readings, ad in-depth discussions were carried out in class. I would recommend this course to students that are interested in this discipline and have some background to go from. Otherwise, the course may get confusing and distant.",
    "Take it for a good global overview of postcolonial theory and literature.",
    "LITR 265 is a survey of postcolonial writing that is connected primarily to the African and Indian diaspora(s). The student will read lots of theory, some interesting novels, and Amitava Kumar's compelling \"Passport Photos,\" which is a combination of theory and narrative. I would definitely recommend this course. You will be exposed to many great texts!"
