   "comments": [
    "It is a class that reads a lot of French lit but also is super focused on sharpening grammar and writing, so beware, if you don't like grammar or speaking, don't take this. They focus a lot on oral components and grammar components in French. If you do take it, TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR HOFFMANN. I love that woman. She is the sweetest French lady you will ever meet or see.",
    "This class is a lot of work. Classes were heavy on discussions about texts\/movies, but tests were heavy on grammar we only briefly went over. Need to put in lots of extra studying outside class for the tests, and we also had several compositions to write throughout the semester. Overall I enjoyed the class and definitely feel like my writing improved.",
    "This class is a LOT of work, between essays, reading assignments, movie-viewing assignments (sometimes with subtitles, sometimes without), and grammar exercises. However, it IS manageable, and you do learn a TON. It is a really nice transition, I thought, between high school French and then moving on to more advanced French classes at Yale. The grammar review is very comprehensive, and really solidifies any concepts that may have been fuzzy from your past studies. Every test has a review packet that accompanies it, with answers, so that makes it easy to study. In terms of vocabulary, you simply have to write an essay on each test using 20 words from the list, which is not as bad as it sounds. The oral presentations were what I found to be the most challenging, because often you'd have to prepare for these on top of all the other homework for that class - but as long as you prepare in advance and practice, you'll be fine.",
    "Strengths: you encounter a lot of interesting texts, you review important grammatical points, the class is organized, the instructors are energetic. Weaknesses: the grammar exercises often get tedious; you don't end up learning all the vocab because you often just memorize 20 terms for the tests.",
    "Warning the skills required in this class is a big jump from French 140. It is only 1 credit but requires just as much work as its 1.5 credit predecessors. That being said, this class will greatly improve your writing skills, if you put in the effort.",
    "Yes, but I only ended up taking it as a requirement. I would say it's a rigorous French class to truly test your ability to comprehend the language, so you should take it if you can!"
