It is easy for people who print a paper copy to fit two pages on one when they do print. For those who read on the screen (most folks, I would guess), having one page of text on one page of the PDF makes life a lot easier."

   "comments": [
    "Quite simply, this course focuses on thinking about how people behave, how to measure their behavior and predict future behavior, and how to encourage more use of science to make decisions. The course does a fantastic job of pursuing all three items.",
    "The empirical approach to understanding science communication was unfamiliar to me and I imagine to other students as well. It provided an interesting lens through which to understand common science communication problems and was really informative in terms of reshaping how I understand our ability to gauge public opinion through survey methods.",
    "The class discussions were the best aspect of the course. There was great, thoughtful dialogue between students inspired from the reading materials."

    "The framework we often used in the second half of the course (What do we know, Was it a good study, What would be a good policy prescription, etc.) would have been helpful early on in the term, particularly on the first case study about the HPV vaccine. Looking at the first few weeks of studies that help us understand how and when people use science to make decisions would have made more sense in some structure, rather than simply having all that (thought provoking) information thrown at us.",
    "I had a hard time with Prof. Kahan's lecture style - not always easy for me to follow and the key points from each session were sometimes hard for me to identify. Might be personal preference; I benefit from a more structured classroom environment and so found his methods challenging."

    "As a scientist and a teacher, I was extremely interested in how people respond to information and use it in their personal decision making, as well as how different framings of that information might matter or not matter.",
    "Science communication seems to be facing a more difficult environment than ever and I was hoping to learn effective communication strategies for publicly controversial science issues."

I guess I wasn't clear on what to expect in the class and have a hard time pointing to specific objectives that were met, but I think overall the class will help me ask better and more critical questions of environmental policy issues that have any kind of public-facing or communication component.",
    "Somewhat. The readings were valuable, and good information was gleaned from the myriad studies we dissected, such as understanding how ideology plays a role in picking sides on certain issues. However I don't feel as though we addressed particular communication strategies as I had hoped."

    "If you are looking to gain a greater understanding of successful communication strategies, this is not the course for you. If you want to delve into the psychological aspects of how people think about science and why polarization about certain issues exists, then you will want to take this course. Be prepared to read study after study about the human scientific psyche, and critique them. Make sure you are paying attention in order to keep up with Prof. Kahan's rapid-fire, never-stops-to-take-a-breath lecture style."
