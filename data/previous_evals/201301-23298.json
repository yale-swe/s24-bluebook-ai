    "yes. great class. prof wallace is brilliant and the syllabus is very well structured. whether china is a focus of your studies or not, this class is definitely worth taking.",
    "Good intro to Chinese politics. Interesting discussions",
    "If you already have enough knowledge about Chinese politics (incl. history, current issues, foreign relations, maybe culture as well) then this would be a great class to take!",
    "Take it if you are interested in China.",
    "It's ok. Good readings. Too many students talking.",
    "only if you know a lot about chinese politics and chinese history going into it. the course was poorly designed. students led every class and because of that the two hours felt very long. it was clear prof wallace knew a lot but i wished he spoke more and gave his opinion more.",
    "Very interesting class. Great way to plow through a lot of big names in Chinese political writing. It covered post-revolution China at a very fast pace. It is definitely helpful to be familiar with modern Chinese history. Downside: The two-hour discussions could be inefficient. Lots of room for bs-ing, which was very frustrating, but Professor Wallace was very nice and interesting."
