    "I would definitely recommend CHNS 151 to another student. You know what you are getting yourself into: the workload is reasonable, and the progress you will make as you begin to be able to read the news and classical Chinese is surprising.",
    "It is very similar to Chinese 150, except for the final skit and the fact that you keep on building on previous knowledge. Some lessons are especially interesting and unusual, such as the ones about Zhang Yimou's films and the one that teaches newspaper vocabulary. On the other hand, a lot of the lessons can be pretty dry, especially those dealing with business language. I would recommend this course only if you really plan to go on learning Chinese one way or another, for even though you do improve your language skills, I believe you end the semester thinking there is still a lot to cover in order to start becoming proficient. A lot of the students end up taking this class as their last Chinese class at Yale though.",
    "Yes, if you want to continue Chinese after doing Light Fellowship for 2nd year study. This is pretty much the only way for you to continue the standard course of Chinese language study at Yale. Sometimes the class feels like it's a waste of time, and it certainly requires a certain level of commitment everyday, but in the end I feel like we learn a lot and become much more confident with our writing skills.",
    "Chinese 151 is more work and harder than Chinese 150. However, it does provide all the tools needed to continue doing self-study of Chinese. For example, the last month of class is devoted to learning to read Chinese news, which is a great way to keep Chinese skills up.",
    "This class was the continuation of the first semesterclass, and was structured almost the identical way. I think I preferred the subject matter in this class however, and getting to read real, short newspaper articles was pretty fun. The teachers are patient and enthusiastic, and fair graders."
