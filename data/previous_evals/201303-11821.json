   "comments": [
    "If you're into the more fundamental problems of political philosophy and enjoy close reading, this class is for you.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS. Prof. Smith is amazing, the other students are usually amazing, and best of all, Berlin, Oakeshott and Strauss will remind you why you love political theory.",
    "I'm not a huge Steven Smith fan. This seminar probably won't recur for a while, so some general warnings follow. Prof. Smith tends to let the class wander, and doesn't really care to beat back the circling sharks of section assholery, even from people who clearly didn't do the reading (the rogues gallery in this particular seminar featured *five* aggressive YPU hacks *and* a prominent Buckleyite). He's a caring guy, but I'm not sure how serious he is at this point. The class tries to cover pretty huge themes with pretty scant connection to the actual words of the text, and papers are encouraged to be similarly high-flying. For all the best and worst reasons, it felt a lot like a return to DS (there were also 3 short papers in this class, tackling big questions with not that much rigor). Would a more focused Smith seminar on a more prominent thinker, such as Hobbes, be better? I guess so.",
    "Absolutely -- important ideas!",
    "YES!",
    "PLSC 296 is a fantastic course on three philosophers students ought to read more: Berlin, Oakeshott and Strauss. These thinkers grapple with the recent experience of totalitarianism as well as such diverse topics as value-pluralism, the nature of conservatism, the nature of political philosophy, history vs. science, ancient philosophers vs. moderns and critiques of rational thought. The class devotes four sessions to each philosopher, and students write a 7 to 9-page paper on each. Professor Smith truly loves the material. He raises excellent questions for discussion and pulls curious, idiosyncratic quotes from the readings for students to consider. I highly recommend the class!",
    "This was a fantastic class. Taking an upper level class with Prof. Smith is an experience absolutely worth having. He is a great teacher, especially if you put in the extra work to meet with him and discuss things.",
    "An excellent survey of three of the most prominent Cold War intellectuals, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better professor to study them with than Steven Smith. Lots of reading, most of which assumes familiarity with the history of political thought, and three essays (7-9 pages each). Definitely take if it is being offered, but take Cr\/D unless you have time to do all of the readings."
