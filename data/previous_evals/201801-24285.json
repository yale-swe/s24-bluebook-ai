    "This was a fantastic course that grappled with a broad range of fascinating historical and ethical questions in an interesting and original way.",
    "Amazing discussion!",
    "This course really emphasized engagement with the different texts that we read. I was one where I didn't just feel like I was just taking I what I was reading like a spectator but I felt like I was having a conversation with the authors of the texts. The Professor also forced us to ask strong questions about the material which lead to incredible conversations in class. I honestly learned so much. My only critique is that sometimes it was hard to see how everything fit into modern human trafficking and sometimes I wasn't sure what direction the course of was going with that topic.",
    "Good reading selection, fantastic instructor, good discussions -- not much in the way to improve!",
    "Strengths: pretty robust reading list, an extremely knowledgeable and passionate professor, really good class atmosphere Weaknesses: seminar discussions rarely touched explicitly on more than ~30% of the reading, which could be frustrating because readings could be a few hundred pages long; it was difficult to find time to meet with Prof. Peck outside of his office hours; Prof. Peck also sometimes overdominated seminar discussion"

    "I would absolutely recommend this course, it is definitely my favorite class at Yale so far.",
    "Yes, the books make for great discussion, and Professor Peck is a wonderful facilitator!",
    "Yes I would. For all the reasons I mentioned above in the strengths. Also the Professor makes the course not feel like a class but a table discussion with friends.",
    "Absolutely, but Peck is a visiting professor! But if Yale manages to poach him, certainly take a class with him.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend it to another student. The subject is wonderful, the readings are great, and Prof. Peck is truly passionate about what he is teaching. That being said, I sometimes found seminar to be a little frustrating, because Prof. Peck spoke a lot during class, which made the flow of conversation more forced and limited.",
    "Yes. Changed the way I think about human trafficking"
