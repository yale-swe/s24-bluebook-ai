   "comments": [
    "TAKE IT! It's just really cool and the type of class you could only take at Yale (and maybe Princeton...)",
    "Awesome class; would definitely recommend taking as a fun fifth credit especially if the rest of your schedule is full of required\/boring classes. Both professors (one teaches the first half of class and focuses on music; the other teaches the second half and focuses on math) are really wonderful and reasonable and care about whether all the students understand the material. The material is very interesting and there were many mind-blowing things covered in class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course-not your usual qr. If you are a classical music student, this is definitely a class for you.",
    "I would recommend it only if they have an interest in the subject",
    "It was interesting - I learned about tuning and chord progressions from a mathematical standpoint. But I don't feel like a got a huge takeaway from the course. Also, as simple and straightforward the in-class material usually was, the problem sets often asked questions in confusing ways, suing words in new contexts we hadn't seen in class. So that was frustrating, but I suspect that if I had started them earlier, I could have asked one of the teachers and it would have been explained better.",
    "I would not recommend this class",
    "Yes, absolutely! Rick and Andrew (Rick especially) are phenomenal teachers, and you learn cool things about how music relates to things like set theory and topology. I'm a science major and took this for an Hu credit, and I found the math super easy. It was also nice for me that the work was problem set- and exam-based (and a very light workload).",
    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I'VE TAKEN AT YALE. It completely changed the way I think about both music and mathematics. On several occasions it prompted me to wonder why I wasn't going to spend my life studying cool things like this. Look at your life, look at your choices, take this class. Rick and Andrew are both really awesome and engaging teachers, and you can really tell they have a lot of fun teaching the class. That said, it was more difficult than I expected. There are only 4 graded psets, and each is 10% of your grade so do them carefully. Midterm was tough, final exam was too but had less of a time-crunch. This is the sort of class where putting a lot of effort into learning the material thoroughly is extremely satisfying, though.",
    "This course can get difficult very quickly. Make sure you have the time to put effort into it. Also, you may find yourself struggling on the problem sets, as the professors often ask questions that you sometimes have the grasp at - you wouldn't know exactly what to do just by going through lecture notes.",
    "Yes take it if you like math and have always found classical music theory confusing.",
    "No, especially if you don't know much about music. It makes it harder",
    "Very interesting class that you probably couldnt find outside of Yale. I would strongly recommend this class as it provides an insight into a very unique topic.",
    "Some words of warning before taking this class: it is not at all easy. I was hoping to find a relatively easy, interesting, QR, which this turned out not to be at all. It ended up being my most difficult class this semester. That being said, you learn some really interesting things about the mathematics behind music. However, it is extremely conceptual and math-heavy. You will have to learn totally new terminology and different material than you have ever encountered in a math class before, because this field is extremely small and kind of obscure. I think some of the issues with this class were due to its being the first year it was taught-- for example, the midterm was really hard and tested us on totally new material, and there was not enough time to complete it. The professors realized this, and I think will change it next year. In general the professors are really understanding and accessible, which was a major help.",
    "I would recommend the course, with a few caveats. The class was new this year, so there was a strange kind of swinging from one extreme to another in terms of simple-yet-pedantic material and waaaay intense music theory that went too fast to be understood by most of the class. The course is definitely not as easy as the first few classes make it out to be -- I'm glad I took it but it's certainly not a gutty QR, especially if you don't come in with tons of background music theory.",
    "Not a terrible qr if that's what you're looking for. Could be better.",
    "How often is it that you'll find a class cross-listed in Math and Humanities? Take this class, whatever your background, because you'll learn something new. Because the intersection of math and music is unexplored and beautiful. Because Rick and Andrew are two of the most compassionate and clear teachers you might find at Yale. Because you'll have tremendous fun. Take this class.",
    "I felt like this course is a cross-disciplinary class that I've always wanted to take. Unfortunately, I had too much prior musical and mathematical experience to grow much in either field. The material was presented in such a clear, slow, methodical way that I was bored at times and eager to jump ahead. If you have at least a solid basic grasp of music theory and aren't afraid of mathematical notation (you don't need trig or calc or anything, just notation), I'd strongly recommend looking into a music theory class, math class, or the higher division level of this course, instead of Music 175.",
    "This class was awful. It felt disoriented, I wasn't sure what I was supposed to get out of it, and the Andrew Jones was not clear at explaining the math. Definitely don't take this course--I can't think of a bigger waste of a class, even a QR",
    "For those seeking a QR credit, or just general edification, this is a great course. The work is challenging enough to be interesting, and the material is very thought-provoking, but it's not overwhelming. I highly recommend the class."
