   "comments": [
    "You should carefully consider whether to take this class. I think it is best suited to immigrants or second-generation students based on the discussions and angle of much of the material.",
    "Really enjoyed it! Interesting topic, goes in depth on a lost of things I wasn't exposed to before. I also like the way that seminar is run.",
    "It is a great overview of Latino history in New York. It doesn't go into extreme detail in any of the cases, but you have the opportunity to do so in the final paper. Laguna is extremely supporting and understanding, you'll love him. If the course overview sounds interesting, you will love the class! Go in with an open mind, though, and enjoy the field trips, guest speakers, and personal anecdotes of the professor. It all was enjoyable.",
    "Take this course! If you're from New York or have never been to New York. You don't have to be a Latino from New York to learn a lot about Latino New York. The workload is very reasonable and prof. Laguna is a great lecturer.",
    "Latino New York is great. It is a reasonable workload and a really interesting topic, even if you're not Latino\/a nor from New York. The class helps you perceive and experience the city in a new and essential way to fully be able to understand the city as it has come to be through the lens of it's Latino community.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student because of its interdisciplinary approach and kind professor. Considering this class meets only once a week, doing the readings and other preparation for class is vital in order to have a worthwhile discussion. The workload is about the same as it is for any other seminar, and the best classes are when students can bring in their own varied background into the conversation, such as different takes on West Side Story. Plus, you get to explore NYC a bit too!",
    "I would say Latino New York is an interest class for students interested in New York and Latino studies. My studies are unrelated to both of these topics, but New York and exploration of cultures are both very interesting to me. I would recommend being patient with the material and trying to look at it holistically to best understand the different aspects of Latino culture in New York. I would recommend this to another student because it is an interesting subject that increasingly needs to be understand in our country and in New York, where demographics are constantly changing.",
    "AMST 320 is the best way to get a comprehensive view of being Latino\/a in New York. Professor Laguna does a great job of picking texts\/topics relevant to each Latino\/a immigrant group. Take this class!",
    "This class offers an exploration of the social implications derived from political and other structural elements of Latinidad, specifically in New York. If you are looking for a more modern Latin America course it is one worth delving into. The trip to New York also allows a hands on experience to the topics discussed during seminar as well as your own investigations through the open ended paper prompts allow for further investigation of the current Latino situation in New York",
    "Latino NY discusses the history of Latino\/Hispanic influence on the city of New York and vice versa."
