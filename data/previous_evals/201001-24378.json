   "comments": [
    "Economics 132 is a useful course. You come out with the ability to really understand what's going on in economic papers. The course is very theoretical and difficult, especially when compared to Economics 131, so only take it if you're willing to be confused for a good chunk of the course. In the end, it's worth it.",
    "only if you're very serious about writing a senior paper",
    "It's a class well worth taking as an Econ major, but you should know that it will be very difficult a lot of the time.",
    "Not an easy class and Prof. Altonji is a bit of a dry lecturer but if you do the readings and pay attention in class you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "I would say take it if you are 1) interested in writing a senior essay in economics 2) interested in the empirical work behind social policy and economic policy. It can be really useful in actually understanding all of this stuff. If you don't want todo either of those things, maybe just stick with Econometrics I because the lectures can be really dry sometimes and the work load is not that light (although it is certainly doable).",
    "This course was the highly technical sequel to the econometrics core requirement. It will be very helpful for writing the senior essay, but be prepared for a challenging, sometimes dull, course.",
    "This class was a rollercoaster. At the beginning, I was so lost and it was a little overwhelming to see symbols and letters all over the place and not understand a single thing. However, Altonji really cares about the students and wants everyone to succeed. By the end of the class, however, I am SO glad I took it. I can read an economics article with confidence. I'm not scared away by symbols or formulas any more. I'm not really sure how I did in the class, but I almost don't care. This is such a useful class for anyone who cares about econ as a discipline and that's really who it's geared towards. Take this class if you really want to understand what economic research is.",
    "Great class, very tough. The professor is really smart and helpful, lectures can be boring but have lots of good content. Fair exams. Project is a great way to tie together the class.",
    "This class is difficult if you have not previously taken Econ 131. The first half of the class in particular requires you to learn the material much more thoroughly than just what statistical tools to use when, such as writing proofs regarding properties of ordinary least squares.",
    "Looking back, this is one of those courses that was great overall but so-so during. It wasn't that the material was boring. Quite the contrary, the material is interesting. However, the course suffers from two main problems.1) It is easy to get behind and once you are behind no one bothers to catch up until the midterm. In this regard, this course is always a cat-chase. This was my own personal fault though and someone more disciplined would not suffer the same problem.2) The class is rather big. I don't think econometrics is conducive to big classrooms. One has the opportunity to ask as many questions as he may like during lecture, but as in any big class, doing so is uncomfortable. By far my best experiences were in office hours when I talked about the models and their theoretical underpinnings one-on-one with Professor Altonji.Professor Altonji is one of the best labor economists in the world. He is also one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. He is also patient and very good at answering tough questions in a clear way. Also, his door is always open for office hours. I absolutely recommend him.The one bad part about his teaching style is that he uses slides. With math and economics, I personally don\u0092t follow slides well. I prefer for the models to be made from the scratch on the chalkboard. If you don\u0092t mind slides though, this won\u0092t be a problem.This course is applicable to any and all students. It makes one think about the world in a different way. Also, it is a great way to get hands on experience with data. I feel comfortable enough to write a senior essay now.Further, I gained most of the understanding of the fundamentals behind the models. In this sense, this is the best undergraduate econometrics course that a student can take. I learned both the theoretical underpinnings of econometrics and further learned how to apply the models to real life problems and data set.The one caution is that the end of the semester is work heavy. There is both a tough final and an involved final paper. The final paper took me over 30 hours of work alone. Work during the semester is manageable\u0097a short problem set every two weeks.",
    "I am sure econometrics is very useful in studying advanced economics and doing empirical research. I personally am not sure why I took this course because I don't plan on writing a senior essay for economics. (An upperclassman had recommended that if I am at least somewhat interested in writing a senior essay, it is absolutely important that I take Econometrics II.) Anyway, I heard that Professor Altonji is the better of the two econometrics II professors, and he is a pretty good instructor, as far as one can make all these theoretics and proofs interesting.",
    "Take it! It is difficult, but definitely enrich your econometrics knowledge. The material covered in this class is very relevant to real-life application of econometrics and the writing of senior paper.",
    "i think it is useful, although difficult, I will recommend",
    "I absolutely recommend the course. It is a difficult course with difficult material, though professor Altonji explains it very well and the course is very practical with many cases and examples of real applications.",
    "ECON 132 is a boring class but you learn a lot. You will notice by the end that any kind of social science paper -- from any field -- makes much more sense. Especially if you plan on doing anything with quantitative analysis, it will be a helpful class.",
    "Yes, If you are interested to be applied econometrics and want to use econometrics in your job or project. This course is a must!",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you are planning on doing some in depth econometric analysis in the future.",
    "Great course if you're planning on doing something econometrics-related for your senior thesis.",
    "Definitely harder than Econ 131, but worth it if you want to understand regression methods. Midterm, final, final project, and several problem sets--so a decent grade distribution. Altonji is good.",
    "Take it! Very interesting material, just make sure you keep up with it so that you don't get behind! Sometimes it's hard to follow the math when he goes through it in lecture, so it's important to look at the slides before hand and struggle through everything individually. Read the book- it helps! Take advantage of Professor Altonji's generosity and willingness to spend time outside of class to explain things in depth! I'm so glad that I took it. A lot of what I learned will not only be helpful in econ, but also in understanding any academic papers that incorporate regression analyses.",
    "A class that is boring but necessary if you're serious about economic research. Teaches you important fundamentals.",
    "Take it. Yes, it's very dry. Yes, it's very difficult material. However, this stuff is the crux of economics. If you have any academic interest in the field, you MUST take this class. There is no substitute. This is the language ALL economists speak, and until you learn this material you will be relatively illiterate. A lot of kids take it Credit\/D\/Fail so the curve isn't all that bad. The applications are pretty cool...you really see how real economics is done. The workload isn't bad at all.",
    "I recommend it if one is willing to work hard and wants to learn econometrics.",
    "This course is fabulous. Take it. Professor Altonji will be one of your favorite professors at Yale and the proofs and STATA work end up being a blast. The course was a little big this semester, but Professor Altonji is always available and this should be taken advantage of. You are basically immersed in econometrics and come out with a thorough understanding of both the big and small topics in this complex field. You will also really benefit from reading and paying attention in lecture. Both the project and the lectures, and even section, were just a lot of fun.",
    "Great course. This is one of the most useful courses I've taken and probably one of the best courses I've taken here. Lecture can be very dry however.STATA is hugely useful for everything...",
    "Challenging course and you learn a lot. Definitely worth taking.",
    "Yes I'd recommend the class. It is an important subject for anyone interested in the social sciences and this was a very well-taught class.",
    "Yes (see question 1)",
    "This is a very good econometrics class, which is well-worth taking if you're interested in understanding empirical work in economics. I felt that I took a very good first econometrics class but it did not prepare me to do a senior project in economics. This class gives a far more comprehensive coverage of data analysis methods."
