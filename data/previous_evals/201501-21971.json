   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class, especially if you're premed. I truly felt like I diversified my writing ability in a way which I didn't realize was so important. Remember all those hard papers we had to dissect and Google every third word in bio? Imagine how much harder that would be for a lay-reader. It is a critical writing ability, and even just ability for yourself, to be able to break scientific papers into easily digestible parts for your buddy in philosophy in a way that is not demeaning, and this class teaches it perfectly. Professor Epstein really cares about each student and is connected to a lot of famous people. Almost a third of the days of class we had a guest speaker (Emmy award winner, presenter on air pollution, \"patient\" for a patient profile) or a field trip (pathology lab, trip to the brain room in the Medical School). The assignments are all really short and don't require a lot of time, other than the final paper. Great second English class for pre-meds, especially given that it's actually useful. You won't regret taking this class!",
    "This class is essentially what it says. You read and write about medicine and public. The assignments are fun and creative.",
    "This course is the best English course I have ever taken. Professor Epstein is amazing and very invested in her students, and I learned a lot in taking this course. Highly recommended.",
    "I would absolutely recommend. Improves your ability to read, understand and translate science. My favorite class so far at Yale.",
    "A great class - Professor Epstein is not only very nice, but also intelligent and an excellent writer. She bakes cookies for the class, but more importantly she is a disciplined editor and will definitely help you with your writing. The classes themselves are fun and can be useful, but by far the most important part of this class is Professor Epstein's feedback on your papers. Take advantage of it whenever possible. She makes herself very accessible, and is always happy to meet with you about any paper, either in person or over the phone. This is not in any way a science class. It is an introduction to science journalism, with the emphasis on journalism. There is a lot of editing: for nearly every piece, Professor Epstein commented on one or two rough drafts before we had to submit a final version. There aren't that many papers, though, and I felt that I had time to put my best work into each one. Don't blow off the first drafts - Professor Epstein emphasizes the editing process, and believes that a \"shitty first draft\" is an important step in the journey to a polished final paper. If you put in your best, and participate in class, you will do well.",
    "This class is an excellent writing class for science majors. It is more of a scientific journalism course that teaches you how to communicate jargony science to a lay audience, and it really helps you on your writing for science classes as well. Professor Epstein is a very caring professor who organizes the class very well and tries to make it the best experience possible. She is very accessible and very open to talking with her students for one-on-one meetings. This class also has a lot of guest speakers who add flavor to the classes, and some of these speakers are actually pretty renowned figures in the medical\/scientific world. Overall a solid course. I would recommend it.",
    "Weak class. Lot of busy work that doesn't help your writing. The assignments are fun and informative but not sure they improve overall writing. That said, Dr. Epstein really cares about her students and takes an interest in them.",
    "This class fit my niche interest in medical and science writing and gave me just that. The technique, class readings, and class trips all focused on this and I learned a lot. I would recommend this class.",
    "YES! This class taught me so much and really made me become the writer I wanted to be."
