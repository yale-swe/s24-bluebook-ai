   "comments": [
    "strengths - practicalweakness - assignments were not very specific",
    "The course covers an important aspect of data analysis. Unfortunately, the course is a little bit messy. Some homework did not really make sense.",
    "The course is too rushed, and would benefit from having a lab component. Since homework was pass\/fail, I felt that there were not as many comments provided. This made it difficult to gauge progress.The course , however, was a good balance of applied and theoretical topics.",
    "Data sets should be made available online, which they were not.",
    "I really enjoyed how this course focused on the 'applied' parts of survival analysis with descriptions of Prof. Makuch's past experiences and how he solved the problems he faced. I would have enjoyed more feedback on the HW assignments to ensure I was understanding the material properly before the final exam.",
    "Application of concepts was good, but it sometimes is strange to mix the biostat and non-biostat students. Perhaps there could be an extra lab session to go over theory, or the biostat students could come tues\/thurs and others could come only tues and cover the applied concepts but not the theory.",
    "The course covered a reasonable amount of material considering the length of the class. The organization could have been better though.",
    "Solid for basic understanding, good pace.",
    "This course is focus on a very special data analysis method, I think we need more good examples about this, and the explain about the results of SAS for this methods.",
    "it's a nice course, and I have learned how to do survival analysis. I hope more examples can be offered in this class in the future.",
    "Strengths: The professor's teaching style is highly effective. Dr. Makuch makes you really want to listen to him and what he has to say because he has a lot of information, especially from his work experience in the industry and government.Weakness: This course could have definitely been semester long.",
    "The course is a sufficient introduction to basic survival analysis. It provides a good depth into some topics (such as log rank test concerning to curves etc) but is lacking in some other aspects (such as survival probabilities etc). However, as the course is only half a semester it does a well for the time it has.",
    "Overall it was a short course that focused and taught exactly what it was supposed to do.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I thought it provided me with some really valuable statistical knowledge regarding survival analysis. In a few short weeks, I felt like I got a really great overview on the topic and learned lots of useful SAS code."

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0In class explanations were good and Makuch returned to basic concepts to explain where it was requested.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch had a tendency to go off on random tangents, and never actually returned any of our homework assignments. I felt like attending lecture wasn't particularly helpful, as I learned more from going back over the lecture slides while doing the homework. Dr. Makuch also tended to assume too much of as, believing that we already knew about everything he was teaching us and skimming over the material.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Knows the materials, but maybe covers too much theory",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0He has lots of experience on this topic, need to improve the use of SAS and explain the results.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0nice instructor skilled at survival analysis",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Very effective professor who knows his stuff.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Professor Makuch provides an easy to understand approach to beginning students in terms of the broad concepts in survival analysis. His background stories helped flesh out the course quite well.I would of liked to receive a week to complete the HW (rather than Thursday- or sometimes Friday- to Tuesday). A large workload made it sometimes difficult to plan another assignment on such short notice.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is very good at explaining concepts clearly without using too much statistical jargon.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch was great. I appreciate his balance of teaching the non biostats and providing some interests for the biostaticians.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Excellent Teacher.Always cool and makes the class interesting",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch was a very good lecturer (especially for the biostatistics department). His assignments were fair, as was the final, and he was very accommodating to the students (we asked for a take home final and he obliged). I would have appreciated if the TA\/prof had done the assignment before assigning it, however, because they weren't always able to answer the students questions."

    "Yes, I would recommend Survival Analysis to anyone who is interested in learning how to learn practical skills in analyzing and interpreting data. Survival Analysis is helpful for individuals who would like to continue biostatistics (ex. clinical trials) or epidemiology. Your professoris great, fair, and wise. The take home final also relieved some burden of exams, too, and the course is completed before the week of the other finals.",
    "If you are looking for a good introduction to survival analysis this is the course to take. I would definitely recommend this to students beginning to study the subject.",
    "Good course very appopriate. Focused on the topic.",
