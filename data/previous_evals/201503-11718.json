   "comments": [
    "This is a great way to maintain your Chinese skills if you're worried about deteriorating language skills.",
    "It is definitely a good class to take for anyone who wants to improve speaking, listening, and writing skills.",
    "Wang laoshi is a wonderful, jubilant lady who never seems to miss a beat when it comes to teaching well. This class is great for native speakers who have had a bit (but not extensive) exposure to reading and writing.",
    "I would recommend CHNS 152 to others, as it is a very comprehensive course and I think I learned a lot and significantly improved my Chinese abilities.",
    "I would only recommend it if you are dedicated to learning the language. The work load is not for the faint-hearted.",
    "With Haiwen you can expect a lot of work (at least an essay a week) but the distribution for the grade is nice as in the final is only 15% but the 4 tests during the semester make up 25%. There is homework every day and a quiz everyday which makes it demanding and kind of annoying. But Haiwen definitely has a passion for Chinese and you can see that and you can see how she tries to make each class fun. But she's also fairly passive aggressive and can be opinionated",
    "A very fun class where you learn a lot of practical lessons and Chinese they really applies to the real world."
