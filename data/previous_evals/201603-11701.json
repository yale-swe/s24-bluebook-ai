    "I feel like my speaking ability was definitely improved and my confidence was definitely increased.",
    "After not taking Spanish since junior year of high school, I was able to regain as well as build upon my knowledge of the Spanish language. I became more comfortable speaking the language, expanded my vocabulary, and learned grammar.",
    "Knowledge about vocabulary and grammar in Spanish. Skills relating to the culture and modern happenings of Spanish-speaking countries."

   "comments": [
    "One of the main strengths of this course was that it was held everyday allowing a reasonable degree of emersion. Sometimes the structure of the class got a little repetitive though.",
    "Small class size, engaging, quick-paced, focused",
    "This was a great course which helped my Spanish significantly, despite my personal shortcomings in language strength.",
    "Professor Ortega was absolutely fantastic and one of the highlights of the course for me. I also liked how there were multiple assignments, none of which was worth too much. The consistent homework forced me to keep up with the material in a good way. Only weakness might be that the course is a bit too structured and oftentimes does not leave enough time for creativity.",
    "The main strength of this course was that the placement test placed me perfectly and this level three course was familiar enough to not be overwhelming, but difficult enough to challenge me to improve my Spanish. Another strength of this course was the use of multiple different media which made the course more engaging. I cannot think of a weakness to the course."

    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. I feel that my Spanish greatly improved.",
    "Yes, please take this course. You will improve so much in your grammar understanding",
    "Anyone at an intermediate level of spanish that wants an enthusiastic teacher and a growth in proficiency in Spanish",
    "As someone taking Spanish just to fulfill my requirement, I was expecting this course to be just as painful as my L2 class was. However, Professor Ortega managed to work around a constrictive and outdated universal course packet to create a positive and constructive class environment. David is amazing, and by all means take this with him.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to any student hoping to build on their knowledge of Spanish or hoping to fulfill their Foreign Language requirement. It can be hit or miss depending on the professor you have (luckily mine was awesome!). Either way, you'll be sure to learn a lot and improve your knowledge of Spanish.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. It is very clear what is expected of you even though it is a lot of small slightly trivial homeworks."
