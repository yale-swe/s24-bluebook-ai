    "I would recommend this class to students looking to learn more about the field of accounting research",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, even those outside of accounting. For accounting students, this class helps provide us with an understanding of theoretical discussions of important topics in our field, such as conservatism. For other students, it provides good exposure to game theory in research. The class can also be rather fun.",
    "Would recommend to upper year PhD students in accounting and finance."

    "It greatly increased my knowledge of accounting theory research which will be critical in my development as a future researcher. As a future researcher, I will need to be informed about all the various forms of research in my field. The papers covered during the semester covered a lot of topics in theory research which I believe was a great first step in developing my understanding.",

    "See response above.",
