    "The course was fine, but way too much work for an L1 language -- 7 exams, 12 compositions, weekly quizzes and homework. Not fun.",
    "If you want to learn Italian, this is an excellent intro course. As long as you have a passion for this beautiful language, you will enjoy the classes, the homework, the studying... basically everything in this course.",
    "take it, much better than the conventional french\/spanish\/chinese language requirements, a lot of material but it's all manageable",
    "Yes. Italian is a great foreign language.",
    "I highly recommend this course to students, especially with Stanley Levers. He is a great instructor and makes an effort to make sure that every student has an equal opportunity to participate and practice their Italian.",
    "I came to this course without even knowing how to say \"hello\" in Italian, but this course turned out to be one of the most enjoyable and inspiring adventure of my semester. The fact that the progress could be seen after every lesson was encouraging. And because the class met daily, we became pretty close with other students in the section. This class was rather intense (for example, we were not allowed to speak English even on the very first lesson), but the ability to express yourself by the end of the semester is worth working hard."
