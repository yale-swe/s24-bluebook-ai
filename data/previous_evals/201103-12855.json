   "comments": [
    "This class will be a lot of work and take up a lot of your time if you do not have a very solid background in Chinese and a very firm grasp on your Chinese skills (reading, writing, speaking). Professor Kang expects a lot from his students, and there is work for every class. However, if your Chinese is good it is very manageable. I wish there was more of a speaking portion to it.",
    "CHNS 152 is a lot of work. The class moves at a pretty fast pace, and in addition to \"normal\" homework activities (e.g. on-line worksheets, vocabulary, translation, etc.), there's two quizzes, a presentation, and a paper (600+ words) every week. That being said, the work itself is not too difficult, and it becomes less time-consuming as you learn how assignments are graded, how the class runs, etc. Most people improve their Chinese significantly over the course of the semester. If you're a heritage speaker and went through the entire weekend Chinese school series (Chinese schools found in many areas across the US, possibly the world, that meet for a few hours on weekends and use a standardized set of text books), this class will be an easy A.",
    "Yes; I learned a lot, even though it was a difficult semester, I improved my Chinese skills. It's definitely not for everyone though.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone already confident in their Chinese background; it's definitely rigorous, and at times I felt that we were being assessed on material that I could only have known because I was a native speaker. Well worth the challenge, though, because I don't think my Chinese has ever improved this much this quickly.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are serious about learning chinese. if you just want the language credit, take L4, or take an L5 that isnt about chinse language learning, like chinese literature or something.",
    "You read chapters\/stories and hw and tests revolve around those chapters. A lot of work, but not too hard.",
    "This is a great course if you're serious about learning Chinese. Personally, coming out of Chinese school classes on weekends through middle\/high school that I never took seriously and speaking mostly English at home I wasn't well prepared for the reading and writing aspects of the class but I found that the lesson material is much more interesting because it brings up a lot of issues in contemporary China. I was deciding between L5 and L4 when I started out and while I would have been much more comfortable in L4 I think doing L5 has been worth it because I've seen huge improvement in my Chinese.",
    "This course provides many opportunities for practicing the four main language skills: writing, reading, speaking, and listening. However, open discussions are somewhat limited; the class is structured more as a lecture\/drill type of class. The professor provides many audio and video supplements which are very helpful. The text and class itself was somewhat repetitive in format, style, and content from lesson to lesson. The professor teaches well, but may come off as a bit critical. Feedback is somewhat limited for a seminar class. You will need to make an effort in order to connect with the professor. To get the most out of this class, you will need to be willing to put in work outside of the classroom. Class instruction hours will help you make some progress, but as with any language class, you really need to be proactive and engaged in order to improve significantly. I would recommend this class to those who are serious about learning Chinese. For those with a passing fancy, I would still recommend it, but with some reservation.",
    "I would recommend it to someone very determined to learn Chinese and who is not afraid to work hard at it. If they have the passion to pursue this language, especially at this level, then the class is theirs to take on. In summarizing the course, I'd say it is challenging and fast-paced. Whoever takes this class should already have a fair understanding of the Chinese culture and language.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 152!! There's homework assigned after every class, but it usually doesn't take very long. The only homework assignments that take time are the essays and presentations. You learn a lot from the textbook but Dr. Kang also supplements it with his own knowledge."
