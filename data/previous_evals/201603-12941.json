   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "That there are many ways to read a paper or a piece of work, and that one should take a step back before accepting the author's framing of a problem or issue. That books are different from papers. A lot about the sociology of the discipline, that we cannot assume that trends necessarily reflect the merit of certain ideas.",
    "I was exposed to the different fields of research in political science. It was particularly useful to see how connected research methodologies and themes were, despite being so diverse.",
    "I developed significantly more familiarity with members of the Yale political science department as well as with the professional world of political science.",
    "It was an introduction to a very eclectic set of perspectives and methodologies from across the discipline.",
    "Great survey of the substantive issues in political science as conducted by our department.",
    "I developed a broad understanding of the fields and subfields of political science and the different approaches throughout the years.",
    "I got a got insight into PLSC faculty at Yale and an idea of who I would like to work with, which was incredibly helpful.",
    "This course was a good introduction to the people and the work within the department. I learned to effectively read literature that I had no background on, or that I would never have exposed myself to otherwise.",
    "I learnt about a wide range of topics which are studied by scholars of political science in our department. It was a good experience to engage with a variety of works in political science. One of the skills I developed was to read papers outside of my own area of interest and to formulate questions (without any background on the topic). The course also helped me to think of meta issues which prevail across unrelated topics in the discipline. As a young researcher in the discipline I learnt a whole lot about the evolution of the political science discipline (and its various sub-fields), as well as the current methodological debates through discussions with the instructor, Prof. Stathis Kalyvas, as well as with various faculty members of the department. The assignment on comparing articles in the APSR which appeared 30 years apart was quite insightful - although I hope we had more time to do this assignment!",
    "A cursory understanding of political science research undertaken by some Yale faculty.",
    "I realized that the academia was much different from what I had expected.",
    "The course was helpful in instructing me to synthesize metathemes from separate papers into a broader commentary of the field of political science. Particularly culminating in the final assignments, I felt that I had been taught to read research differently."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think a strength was that professors were asked to assign one paper by themselves that they were working on and one seminal one in their subfield\/topic. That helped me reflect on how literatures change (or not) and why, while also giving us a sense of what professors in the department are working on. We also had a nice mix of methods and topics that felt fairly comprehensive. I don't think there were really any weaknesses. Some people are not a fan of the concept of a course like this, but I enjoyed reflecting on some of the bigger questions in the discipline, and it's important for us to learn about the sociology of knowledge production. For someone who accepts the precepts of a course like this, it was very well-executed.",
    "The course served as a good introduction to not only different branches of research in political science, but as a way to know the faculty within Yale. The course could be improved by being more explicit in how each week's theme and focus relates to the broader research agenda in the field.",
    "Though this course serves an important function, that is introducing students to Yale and political science, it has a lot of problems. Too many of the readings\/guests were unconnected, and after awhile, many of the expounded about political science became repetitive. I wonder if perhaps the first half of the semester could be spent reading classic readings in political science selected by the instructor, and then the second half involves bringing in Yale professors to share their work. Or perhaps instead of referring to political science, we could be assigned readings that specifically deal with issues in the discipline. I would strong recommend shaking up the structure of the class.",
    "The course gives many members of the department a platform to introduce their work or what interests them. This gives a range of different perspectives, and must surely have provided something new to every student. It did however feel like it could have hung together better. The two presenters at each session were often disparate by subfield or methodology. If they had been closer there would have been more productive discussions in more of the seminars. The requirements for written assessment for the course were only communicated near the very end.",
    "The strength was Professor Kalyvas's facilitation and the insights of the professors who visited.",
    "The strength of the course lay in the diversity of experiences and topics that each class discussion brought. The pairings of professors (sometimes highly unlikely) also led to insightful discussions. The course's focus on questions was sometimes repetitive and not always relevant to the discussions that took place during class. At the same time, I can't think of a different\/ more interesting way to synthesize the readings.",
    "Strengths of the course: 1. The approach of the course to introduce us to the study of politics through the recent works of faculty members of the department was quite innovative. It was also useful to read works which these faculty members considered to be essential-reads in their specific areas of interest. 2. The variety of scholarly works we were introduced to was extensive: substantively, as well as methodologically. 3. Discussions with faculty members to understand their career trajectories and the way they have dealt with research challenges were very insightful. 4. Discussions related to job talks that were happening in the department, as well as current political events were useful. Weaknesses of the course: 1. Less time was given for the two assignments. (Perhaps, we could have been informed about them in advance.) 2. A few students ended up dominating the discussion - although, this is probably because the class size was large (not a weakness of the course per se). 3. Little (or no) feedback was given on the nature of questions posted.",
    "The strength of the course was the breadth of research projects we were exposed to. The instructor pushed presenters to engage with questions and controversial topics. Unfortunately the class had a few weaknesses as well. The instructor was a poor moderator and would frequently interrupt students to complete questions - although their questions were actually different. Three weeks before the end of the semester the instructor decided to announce course requirements which were different from those stated in the syllabus, and very excessive in relation to the course's Satisfactory\/Unsatisfactory status. The course could be improved dramatically by making it more coherent, and relating students to their own and other subfields in a more systematic manner. Rather than asking presenters to haphazardly choose one representative piece from political science, they might be asked to recommend two pieces - one on the science of politics and one on the vocation of politics, which is a theme the instructor also often touched upon.",
    "It would be great if the readings in the course are oriented around a certain theme in political science so that people from different subfields could be engaged in mutual conversations.",
    "The greatest strength is its variable nature, and how the course changes each week with the introduction of new work and new faculty members. Having a slightly off week therefore did not mean struggling to catch up the following week, which was refreshing and helpful. The weakness of the course is related; each faculty member approached the course with their own style, and so discussion was limited. Either full lecture or a discussion moderated by the professors would be good."

   "comments": [
    "It's a necessary introduction to the diverse research being done in the field.",
    "I would not recommend the course to anyone outside of the political science PhD program.",
    "Yes, this course is essential to an incoming political science PhD student. It orients one's interests within the landscape of discipline-specific organizations of topics and gives one the vocabulary with which to speak about one's interests.",
    "Yes, the course allows for an introduction to the variety of interests and people in the field, and encourages students to seek advice and feedback from diverse faculty.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially to those who are new to the political science discipline (like myself). I thought it gave a fantastic overview of the discipline to the participants of the course. I especially enjoyed the discussions on how the discipline has evolved and the methodological debates (qualitative vs. quantitative approaches, descriptive vs. causal approaches). I also think the nature of this course, since it concentrated more on readings and discussions, encouraged the participants to think more - quite valuable today!",
    "Since it is a compulsory course, this question is moot. I would recommend that the department make changes to the course to make it valuable to students.",
    "Yes, but since it is a required course, I would only speak to the nature of the course."
