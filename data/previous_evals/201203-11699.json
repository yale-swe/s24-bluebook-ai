    "Take it to improve reading and writing skills in Japanese after intermediate Japanese.",
    "An okay class, didn't feel anything special about it. Coming off the high of language learning in Japan, it was tough to see some of that degrade over a semester of not speaking Japanese too much. You probably have to take this or 4th year if you want to continue your Japanese career, and as long as you put in more effort than is required in the class you will get something out of it.",
    "A great way to improve your Japanese, both written and spoken. The materials studied (including poetry, essays, anime, and drama) are enjoyable, and if you love studying Japanese than it will hardly seem like work.",
    "Japanese 150 is a great way to being to explore more complex& meaningful Japanese text. Whilst learning a ton of new Kanji, you actually begin to touch on some of the more cultural aspects of Japanese in reading Haikus and looking at famous Japanese writer's works.",
    "Japanese 150, as the first L5 course, is a lot of fun. In a small classroom setting, you really get the chance to speak freely. You begin to tackle some literature, and there is emphasis on Japanese culture. The sensee, as always, are fabulous and very engaging.Consider taking 4th year Japanese if you spent a summer in Japan. 3rd year Japanese, I feel, is very easy for those who've achieved a certain degree of fluency to their speech and have some level of sensitivity to kanji. The workload, as a result, may become a burden rather than an engaging experience. At best, it maintained my level of Japanese at where it was when I left Japan in August.",
    "Definitely! If you're trying to become fluent, the best thing to do is to keep taking classes, and do the Light Fellowship if you can. It's about the same amount of work as L3\/L4, but it only meets 3 times a week. Definitely doable even with a busy schedule.",
    "Lots more reading, lots more kanji, less of the grammar. Prepare.It's not that bad though Maruyama and Stever are still great teachers!",
    "Japanese 150 is for students who have a genuine interest in not only the language, but also the culture and the mindsets of the Japanese, and are willing to put in concerted effort to learn extra on top of what is covered in class to complement that and to improve one's ability. Yes, I would recommend the course, but only to someone whom I know is of the above mindset with regards to learning Japanese.",
    "If you're coming from anything below L5, be prepared for a huge shift. No longer will you be practicing grammar in class; rather, the typical routine is doing some readings for homework, then discussing and going over them in class, and maybe expanding on them a bit. The sheer amount of reading and writing is very good practice, but I can't help but feel that class time could have been better spent practicing grammar and conversation. Despite all this though, the professors are great, and it's still probably better than many other languages."
