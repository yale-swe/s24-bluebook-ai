    "Taking this course I learned about a broad array of methods in group theory and was able to practice them with homework assignments. This course also gained me skills that would be useful in studying other branches of physics from a theoretical perspective.",
    "I learned about lie algebras and lie groups, in particular about the lie algebras underlying the quark model."

   "comments": [
    "The course is very well organized and paced. The homework assignments were given regularly to get students to practice with each week's material. The course is structured in a way that gains students a base set of skills, but also allows them to explore a particular branch in depth with the final project.",
    "I enjoyed the course on the whole. It might have been useful if we had started work on the final projects before spring break rather than after; the month we had was not long enough to do a really ambitious final project."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is specifically interested in learning about group theoretical methods in physics. Prof. Iachello covers a broad array of material for Lie Algebras, Lie Groups and their applications, with a focus on particle physics. The class would be very useful for someone who is looking into gaining technical skills for theory work in particle physics. The course does not spend as much time on the basics, so it would be recommended that the student already has a basic understanding of group theory to appreciate the material.",
    "Group theory with Professor Iachello was definitely an enjoyable class. The final project in particular was fun to do. I would recommend it."
