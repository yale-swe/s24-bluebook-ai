   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend. it",
    "A decent survey course on alternative energy for those interested in chemistry energy research.",
    "I would describe the course as a sampler tray. It's agreat way to quickly get exposed to some of Yale's more prominent researchers and the science they do. However, the course alone will leave you a little unsatisfied.I would recommend this course to another student mostly because taking a professor's class is a great was to get to know him, and with this class you can know four professors for the price of one!",
    "Chemistry 505 01 covers the history of environmental issues in our world along with new ideas for alternative energy. Yes, I would recommend the course. It was very informative; it's nice to hear real world situations in chemistry. In many other classes, I sometimes wonder what's the purpose of the chemistry, but this course was very straightforward with that respect.",
    "Chem 505 starts with a broad overview of current alternative energy technologies developments, then shifts to the theoretical\/computational, bio-physical and solid state\/material aspects of developing solar-powered energy.I would definitely recommend this course for students who has a keen interest in alternative energy, especially solar energy.",
    "Exciting course covering a variety of interesting topics not presented elsewhere. I always looked forward to attending this lecture.",
    "Difficult, need to have a strong chemistry background. I would recommend this course to students who've had rigorous undergrad chem classes.",
    "This course presents a general overview of climate change and solar devices. It's great to benefit from the experience of four experienced professors.",
    "I would recommend this class. The class focuses on Solar Energy, which is an immensely fascinating research area for chemists. Also, don't shy away from taking this as one of your first electives. You get to dabble in a few different types of chemistry according to the professors, and so you might figure out which kind you like best."

   "comments": [
    "It improved my knowledge on solar cells and their possible alternatives. Useful for people doing research in energy.",
    "I intend on doing research in this field; thus, hearing about it in lecture made understanding the area easier.",
    "This course has broadened my understanding of the overall picture (some of which goes beyond pure science) of alternative energy development in the larger context of human society, while at the same time deepened my understanding of the technical key points and challenges in solar energy development. It also offered me a starting point to find a research direction for my dissertation research.",
    "This course exposed students to a variety of topics involving alternative energy that might otherwise not be learned under my particular field of chemistry. As such, this course helped me to become more well rounded, while also allowing me to develop a degree of focus about the instructed topics.",
    "Hard science backup to the energy topics I look at for FES courses.",
    "This course ended up being extremely relevant for my dissertation research, as my lab is currently working on starting a collaboration with Professors Brudvig and Schmuttenmaer. The material I learned in this class has certainly prepared me for this."
