   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend PHYS 206L. You might be apprehensive after taking PHYS 205L, but this is a much more interesting course! The pros: You get to pick which labs to take (after an initial lab tour), you get to pick a lab partner, no final, AND, you get two weeks off! Also, the write-ups are straight forward, and labs don't run overtime. Some cool experiments include finding Plank's constant, plotting electric fields, and working with liquid Nitrogen when testing superconductivity (and yes, we made ice cream!). Great course!",
    "MUCH better than 205 - you get to choose your lab partner for the semester, choose which experiments you do, and the experiments are eons more interesting than dropping an air cart down a track 100 times to learn about the normal distribution. Lab reports are a bit tedious, but you get used to it. My impression however, is that the grading is very much dependent on the TA, so it's a bit of a luck of the draw in that regard.",
    "This is a miserable experience, but let's be real, you're only looking at it because you have to take it. Make sure to sign up with intelligent people you know really well. Reports take forever. Don't do Millikan, start your nuclear scattering report early, and definitely do electric field plotting.",
    "you pretty much know if you're going to take this class. you get to choose the experiments you do. we didelectron field plottingsuperconductivytnuclear reactionsmillikan oil dropelectron diffractionelectron charge mass ratiodigital logicall of which were great, so i'd recommend doing those labs.lab reports can be a pain, after being spoiled by no lab reports from 205",
    "The second semester is much better than 205. Fairly interesting experiments and a fair 1\/2 credit's of work.",
    "Yeah, I would recommend physics 206, but just be prepared to do a lot of work. The lab reports are very time-consuming, and you often need to do some extra work on the side to properly understand the material. It wasn't a painful course by any means, but it was no walk in the park. Take it, and do some work!",
    "Engineering student? No - its not necessary, and overly theoreticalPhysics student? Sure - it is very good with theory and will teach you a lot",
    "Physics 206 is way better than 205. The labs are really interesting. It's a tougher workload, but it's nice not to be rushed for time.",
    "labs much more interesting than 205 and learn a lot more than 205 (which just teaches you the tools like error propogation you need to do the reports in this class). labs are graded much more harshly than 205 and reports take a good deal of time but the class is scaled.",
    "The workload depends on the TA. Unlike physics 205, the experiments are interesting, but you get a good amount of work outside of lab.",
    "Yes. If you suffered from 205, this is a good change in pace. Your grade only depends on lab reports, which were easy to write as you got used to the format your TA outlines.As for the labs you choose, don't choose the circuit ones or the 2d motion.",
    "It is great lab preparation for physics majors. Much, much more interesting than the proceeding 205L.",
    "I recommend this lab class if you are majoring in physics, of course, and if not, it's good if you like experiments. Since you get to choose experiments, that is a benefit. I especially enjoyed superconductivity and nuclear scattering and reactions, which involved using a van de Graaf accelerator. But you have to take Physics 205 before this one, I think, so you can't just jump right into this class.",
    "If you are a physics major, look forward to this course. Particle accelerator for two weeks, plancks constant, x-rays, superconductivity ...",
    "This lab is different than 205 because you choose 9 out of about 20 labs to do during the semester (with two weeks off!).This lab really depends on what labs you choose to do. It can be really easy if you take some of the labs, but really difficult if you choose the electronics labs. However the electronics labs do give you a great grasp of how computers and circuitry works.I really recommend this class, even to pre-meds who are looking for a more interesting lab than the usual lab.",
    "Yes. If you're considering 206, you've already taken 205. 206 is much better! Awesome experiments. Makes you love physics, or if you loved physics already, love physics even more.",
    "you probably have to take it.IM ON A BOAT.",
    "As far as physics labs go, this course is pretty much better in every way than 205. The labs are more interesting and more engaging. However, unlike 205, there is a lab writeup every week. While this is an important skill to have as a scientist, it can get annoying. On the other hand, this lab also simply has less labs - only 9 lab days, as opposed to around 12 in the previous course.",
    "I would recommend it to other students; this is a great class for a non-science person to take credit\/D because the experiments are so cool.",
    "The second semester of physical lab \/ It doesn't quite share 205's drab. \/ To spare histrionics \/ Avoid electronics \/ And this course is actually quite fab.",
    "Physics 206 lets you do experiments that you never thought you could do as an undergrad (including using a particle accelerator!). However, choose your labs wisely as the labs you choose greatly impact the amount of work that you'll be doing. If you choose the circuit labs, you will do practically no error prop. If you choose the other labs, you will spend hours and hours doing error prop, and then realize that you still have to write a beautiful report to go with it."
