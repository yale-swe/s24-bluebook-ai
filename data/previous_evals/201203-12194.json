    "If you wish to both discover French Renaissance literature from the perspective of Yale's own and excellent expert on the subject, this is the course for you. Even if you are not interested in the subject-matter at first, you will realize how much it matters and how delicious the texts will become once you begin to understand the humor, the allusions, and the overall trends that guide the authors' minds.Another plus point is that you will get a lot of writing practice in French, from more formal poem analysis to thematic essays on the texts. Okay, the final exam is somewhat disheartening after you've submitted five papers (even if short ones), but it provides a nice opportunity for all the trends studied in the course to come to a neat closure in your mind as you prepare.If for nothing else, take this class just to have the opportunity to sit through Prof. Duval's outright beautiful explanations of the texts. I would often come into class completely bewildered by the readings, but he would always find a way to explain everything very clearly. He loves doing schemes to explain what we are reading, and those are very helpful.I won't lie, it is a huge mental exercise, and midway through the course it might feel like you're pulling through to get your head around the poetry of Du Bellay, but it is a deeply enriching course, and one of the few courses I've finished knowing for sure that I am \"slightly\" smarter than when I began.",
    "You start off talking about the end of the Middle Ages, and to relate that to the literature you'll read a great farce from that time. Then you move on to Rabelais, Marguerite de Navarre, Du Bellay, Ronsard, D'Aubigneetc. The readings follow a very neat chronology which, on a different level is organized thematically. I highly recommend this course, it'll give you a great sense of what the Renaissance was all about. Also, it may even dispel any misconception that you may have had previously about this time period. This course is a MUST for all French, humanities or history majors, or simply if the time period interests you. (this course and all readings are in French).",
    "I loved this class, even though reading in old french was REALLY difficult. Professor Duval makes sense of it all! I would totally recommend it.",
    "YES. Going into the course I knew nothing about Renaissance literature in France, nor did I feel that it's a period I would come out enjoying this much. This will change.",
    "It is an excellent course for anyone who wishes to have a better understanding of the different aspects of a somewhat underestimated field of French Renaissance studies. Professor Duval is extremely knowledgeable about the subject and he always makes insightful comments in class, revealing deeper meanings of the texts that I would hardly be aware of otherwise. The readings are very interesting and the fact that the assignments are not excessively long contributes to having a very in-depth analysis of the material in class. The essays are also a great way to better grasp the material and improve our writing in French for academic purposes. The discussions in French really enable us to engage with the text in a more effective way and delve into important nuances of language and style. Definitely one of the best classes I have taken so far."
