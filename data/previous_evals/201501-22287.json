   "comments": [
    "This class turned out to be way easier than I thought. If you engage the material and put some effort in to the different assignments, you'll probably get an A.",
    "I would recommend this to students who have not taken any courses on China. You will learn a lot without it being too much of a strain on your course schedule",
    "It is a great class if you are interested in China.",
    "Not a great class, but if you want to learn something about China it is informative to an extent.",
    "An interesting history course that is taught based on themes as opposed to a chronological order. Keep in mind that the point of the course is not to give the most detailed overview of Chinese history but rather to give you an idea as to how the present-day China is influenced or shaped by China's past.",
    "Yes I would! I think that with a little bit of adjustment from this first run of the class, this could be a fantastic class and a staple of the East Asian Studies Department. Also was great that it was taught by two of the most prominent professors in the department. HIST 321 teaches students how to evaluate contemporary Chinese topics in the news in light of their greater historical legacy within Chinese history. The topics are as follows: marriage \/ family, protest, territorial disputes, and the environment.",
    "If this course is being taught again next year, don't take it unless Professors Hansen and Perdue completely overhaul the syllabus. This class was a complete mess, from start to finish, and it was clear at points that the two professors were quite literally improvising the syllabus as they went. The class was an assortment of inconsequential historical anecdotes from the Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties, combined with recent news headlines about China that anyone with a computer could access. Though the professors attempted to make a connection between the two, that connection was often tenuous at best. This is quite possibly the class I have learned the least from at Yale."
