Both the textbook and news articles that we read in class were very interesting, and Chen Laoshi made them even better. There are lots of opportunities for speaking, writing, and listening.",

    "The levels of the students vary a lot. Sometimes, the class becomes boring for more advanced students.",
    "One of the strengths is the small class size, and the chance to participate a lot in class and improve speaking and listening skills. Chen Laoshi also gives very detailed feedback on essays and oral presentations, which help students to improve.",
    "Great pacing.",
    "This class was very engaging and I really enjoyed all the topics we had; the small size of the class facilitated seminar-style discussions, which were really nice to have among my other STEM lectures"

    "I would definitely recommend this class. I learned a lot about US-China political and economic relations, all in Chinese.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their Chinese or learn about business topics. For non-native speakers it is definitely challenging, and you would have to invest a lot of time in the class if you are taking it for a grade.",
    "Absolutely! By far one of my favorite courses at Yale. If you want to learn more about China's economy and business, definitely take this course. Even if you don't, I still highly recommend it.",
    "100%",
    "Yes!!! Anyone interested in China will get a lot out of this class because we cover everything ranging from business, politics, environment, food, and culture. Oftentimes I don't feel like going to lecture but just a fun conversation with people interested in issues in China!"
