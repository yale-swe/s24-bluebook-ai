    "If you are thinking about taking this class and go in believing that your grammar, syntax, and overall writing mechanics will improve (as I did), this course does not do that. ENGL 114 is strictly a class in which you learn to think deeply about the topic at hand and write about it. If you do however, take this class, you really should only sign up for the topics you truly love.",
    "They should definitely take the class, I learned a lot of things I otherwise would have blew off as boring.",
    "Overall it's a good class, and the topics covered are odd but interesting. There is daily reading assigned and you actually have to do all of it, because the class is seminar-based and you're expected to contribute everyday. Class size is tiny (under 15). She is happy to help you if you ask but she is unnecessarily harsh in her grading of papers, and sometimes unfair. Papers are manageable, the longest you'll do is 2500 words. The weekly blog post is required and is quite annoying.",
    "I loved English 114 15. The topic is super interesting and you definitely grow as a writer. Take this class!",
    "A lot of wiring but definitely recommend it! The course challenges you to think outside the box and you are exposed to a lot of different point of views. Get a writing partner.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student who is interested in fan culture. Since we spend a majority of class time discussing and analyzing fans of tv shows, movies, sports etc... as well as fandom critics, I would suggest taking this course to students who are either initially interested in this subject or want to learn more about it.",
    "Do not take this class if you want to improve your writing skills. Also, do not take this class if you are not passionate about the study of fandom and its implications on society. I feel as though I did learn anything.",
    "If you watch tv, like sports, go on tumblr, or read magazines, take this class. It is the most fun way I could ever imagine getting a writing credit because the subject matter is the various kinds of crazy fans that exist in the world. Much of the class is self-directed, in that you get to pick a specific fandom to monitor throughout the semester and post updates about on the class blog. The readings are both manageable and hilarious, and Bo is the greatest."
