    "I gained a broad cursory knowledge of conversational Swahili that gives me the tools I need to craft sentences and hold conversations with speakers in East Africa.",
    "I have learned the foundations of a new language. I went from being completely unable to speak this language to now being able to communicate with people in it as well as comprehend most of what people are saying to me when they speak the language.",

   "comments": [
    "Easily the biggest asset in this course are the language tables. They are incredibly helpful in practicing what I learn in class in a more relaxed and natural setting. I also found the homework assignments and general lesson plan very good and conducive to learning. The main weakness I would identify is that I would love more opportunities to practice conversations in class. I feel quite comfortable writing almost anything in Swahili after just a semester, but speaking remains difficult because I don't get as many chances for conversation. I would also appreciate more homework or essays. Practice makes perfect after all.",
    "I like that this is a small course as this allows for individualized attention from the professor. We get to practice speaking a lot which helps us retain what we are learning. In addition, the class is taught mostly in Swahili so our comprehension level is constantly improving. The only weakness of this course is the time it meets as it is early in the morning, so often times student engagement is not as high as it could be because people are exhausted. And since this course is taken in sequence with L2 Swahili which also meets in the morning, people will be even more exhausted.",
    "The strengths are the great professor, the pace of the class, and the small class size. The workload was manageable and keeps the vocab ticking over. Some of the homework felt a bit repetitive."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone hoping to learn Swahili. It is a beautiful and unique language, and the course structure eases you into what is a very exotic language for most native English speakers. I loved it.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is challenging, but in a rewarding rather than overwhelming way. We have learned a lot in that class and while having a very manageable workload.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student if it is taught by Professor Wa'Njogu. Swahili is a very interesting language to learn due to its different roots, the interesting culture of East Africa, and due to the way its grammar functions."
