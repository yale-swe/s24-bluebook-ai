    "Take it. Useful, fun, good amount of work.",
    "Best lab I've taken at Yale by far. Laid back and fun but you get a lot done. No reason to fear this course. That said, don't wait until the last minute to write the lab reports because it takes a lot of time to process all of the data you've collected.",
    "This is a great lab, especially if you want an introduction to some of the methods at use in biochemistry. I do, of course, think that you could also get the same material from working in a lab, so waiving the course is also a choice to consider. However, I think this class gives a wonderful chance to experience the same thing with a great group of professors and students",
    "This class is a LOT of work. Twice a week, and four huge lab reports. But you WILL learn new biochemistry techniques, even if you are already a lab rat. Dr. Pawashe organizes this course very well, and if you have a good group of people surrounding your lab area, it can actually be fun. But start on the lab reports EARLY.",
    "I would highly recommend the full credit MB&B lab for prospective MB&B majors. It was the best lab class I've taken at Yale so far... very chill environment, Aruna was wonderful, and the TAs were great. Although the class is a huge time commitment, it's a great overview of biochem research and the time generally goes by pretty fast, especially because you get to bond with a lot of other MB&B majors. The workload isn't too bad on a week-by-week basis. However, the lab reports take FOREVER, so start early!",
    "If you take this course, make sure to check out Aruna's yoga classes!!! Tuesday mornings at 7:15 in Bass.",
    "It's a great class, and I would say it's well worth the ~80 pages of writing you will do during the semester. Whether it's your first lab experience or you're truly to fulfill a premed requirement, I highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes, Great course! Very well structured into projects so that you are intellectually engaged in what you are doing. The TAs are very helpful and do the lengthy parts of the experiments for you so you are not subjected to too much waiting during incubation periods.The lectures and quizzes could be improved though... The lectures were often too long and not related to the topic material.",
    "Very interesting lab and you will learn a lot. Just be ready for some long, time consuming reports. There were four reports total, with two of them being full and two partial reports. The full reports each took at least 30 hours to complete.",
    "This class was a lot of work. Taking this class with the lecture (MB&B 301) was really a heavy load of biochem. Sometimes they did complement each other, but it usually just felt like a ton of stuff to stay on top of. As someone with almost no prior biochemistry lab experience, sometimes I felt like I wasn't picking up on things as fast as my classmates. It also takes away afternoons, sometimes going past 5pm, which can be a pain. The lab reports are very very time consuming.On the bright side, I think I learned a lot this semester from both the lecture and lab, even if I had to put in a lot of time. Although it was annoying to have to spend afternoons twice a week in lab, you get to know people in lab pretty well and hang out with them.",
    "Even though this class takes up all of your TTh afternoon slots for other classes, you do learn quite a bit of laboratory techniques. If the lab that you are currently in does not do classical biochemical techniques (e.g. DNA gels, enzyme assays, Drosophila experiments), you can learn quite a bit in this class. It's like a survey of lab techniques that you read and learn about in classes but probably won't do unless your lab does it. That being said, you bond a lot with your lab mates and the TAs and professors are very chill. Warning: The lab reports are very long and cramming for the daily quizzes can get tedious.",
    "It's a class that explores the applications of biochemistry. There's not much correlation with the actual class, but it's thorough in terms of technique and preparation. I would recommend it, if only for the ways it makes you think.",
    "If you want to do research, TAKE THIS LAB! It\u0092s great! Just be aware that you will spend an inordinate amount of time in the basement of OML. However, the actual lab is really good and you will inevitably become great friends with all of the other students (after all, you spend a good part of your week with them). Aruna and the TAs are great and really helpful, and the topics and techniques learned are important if you want to do any sort of research. The daily quizzes are annoying and sometimes tricky, but they don\u0092t count for much and are actually good in making sure you understand the lab before every class, which definitely speeds up the process (and you want to move fast or you wont get out until 5:30!). I definitely look back on this class with fond memories and learned a lot, but be warned that the lab reports are BEASTLY. You will end up writing 20-25 pages for each one and, even if you start working a WEEK before, you will most likely pull an all-nighter before it is due. So just plan accordingly.",
    "Great lab, but be prepared to fork off all of your free time. And all of your non-free time. ALL OF IT.",
    "Take this lab. The 4 lab reports are a lot of work (start at least a week ahead of the due date!), but you learn a ton and the lab is run really well. Some topics also correlate pretty well with some of the stuff you learn in MB&B 301 lecture, which can help with that class. But the main reason you should take this class is because the class size is small (~30) and you get to know the people in the lab really well (meeting 8 hours a week can do that to you). I met and got to know some great people, some of whom are really close friends now!",
    "I found the daily quizzes to be a massive nuisance, but I enjoyed the lab. It's really dependent on who you take the lab with and work with, so try to get that worked out in advance. The reports take a LONG time-at minimum, three days. I liked not having to keep a lab book, but writing notes about results\/photos\/etc. was necessary to remember things for the reports. I would recommend getting a draft of the reports done early, and having a TA or aruna look at it. I didn't do it, and it may have helped. Schedule yourself light on lab days. I was always exhausted afterward. The experiments in the class are a bit antiquated... so the methods you learn are more like a history class than a technique class and are marginally useful. That said, if you've never worked in a lab, you need this class. If you've worked in a lab, the experiments should be easy for you. You need it for the major. You can get it waived if you've done the techniques in a lab, but I'd just take it.",
    "MB&B 360L is exactly what it says it is: an intensive introduction to the lab techniques and methods of biochemistry and biophysics. I took the course with no prior lab experience whatsoever in biochemistry; there is a bit of a steep learning curve at first, but after the first few lab days you get the hang of it, and the lab manual does a very good job of explaining the concepts, reasons, and schematics behind everything we do in lab. This lab is intensive, and you'll spend at least 8 hours a week with the same small group of people doing lab work which is at times highly labor-intensive and at other times a lot of waiting (i.e. incubate for 90 minutes, etc.). The lectures are sometimes interesting but mostly just fill the time while waiting for those long incubations. The lab reports are mammoth undertakings and require that you start well in advance (i.e. more than a week in advance, and work on it every day), but there's only two long reports and two short reports total. With all that said, as someone who had no prior lab experience, I think I learned more useful knowledge and skills from this course than from any other class I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "If you\u0092re thinking of taking this lab, make sure to clear out some time in your schedule, because it\u0092s intensive. Two lab sessions a week plus four reports (two of which are guaranteed to be at least 18 pages) mean that this lab may the most time-consuming thing you do in the whole semester. That said, the experiments are very relevant to modern research, and at least some of the long incubation periods are filled with lectures, so they are less boring than they would be otherwise. Generally, the professors and TAs are relaxed and don\u0092t mindif you play music during lab. Furthermore, by the end of the semester, you will know the people working near you very well. If you have the time for it, this is an excellent lab to take."
