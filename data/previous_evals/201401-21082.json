    "If the class is offered again, and you're interested in reading some very thought-provoking modern philosophy and theories of equality, this is the class for you. I absolutely loved this class; the two big papers were challenging but rewarding, and overall it was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale (and easily the best seminar). Highly recommend!",
    "I would recommend it only to someone who knows that they are interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would highly recommend it for another student interested in equality and who has basic experience writing and reading philosophy. Be prepared to write long papers.",
    "Good if you are interested in race and philosophy.",
    "Egalitarianism takes a good angle at philosophy \u2014 understanding debates between ideal thinkers, and then looking at real world problems that inform these debates. Prof. Lebron is a solid professor, but if you prefer open, discussion-heavy seminars you may not always enjoy his style (which focuses on taking students step-by-step through the readings). The papers allow you to demonstrate your knowledge and develop your own theories, but they were a bit long (5000 words for the midterm, 7000 for the final). A few class sessions had to be canceled this year, which scrambled the seemingly well-balanced syllabus. The material is worth thinking about, and the class has the potential to be worth taking.",
    "Take this class! The reading list is fantastic, and Lebron does a nice job of simplifying very complex philosophical ideas.",
    "I would recommend it, as long as you're interested in the subject matter (i.e. egalitarianism, with a heavy critical focus on Rawls and luck egalitarianism and a number of weeks exploring racial inequality) and okay with the work load (fairly light week-to-week, but heavy during the weeks you write your two 5000-7000 word papers)."
