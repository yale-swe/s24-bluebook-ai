    "I used this class to get credit for taking Mastering Influence and Persuasion at SOM, which is the most extraordinary class I've taken at Yale.",

    "Yes, definitely! Directed Research is a great, \"real-life\" way to learn.",
    "Definitely one of the coolest labs at Yale.",
    "Rush Dog Lab",
    "A class that holds most true to the saying \"what you put in is what you get out.\" You will only learn mans grow if let yourself be challenged and be put in uncomfortable situations. A great class to learn more about people and to pursue self development",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student.",
    "If you are working in a lab or doing research outside of classes, it makes sense to take this class to receive credit for your work.",
    "An independent research can be really fulfilling, but make sure you work with the Professor to find out early on what precise question(s) you want to research and what readings you can do to guide your research. Give yourself weekly goals to make sure you're on track!",
    "Directed research for credit is a great option that allows you not only to earn a credit to do something you're interested in and would be willing to invest up to 10 hours plus per week but also to get hands on experience in a research lab at Yale.",
    "Great introduction to research. Would definitely recommend for psychology majors!",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in pursuing research in a psychology field.",
    "Directed research is a great way to get hands on experience in a lab setting. I would definitely recommend the course!"
