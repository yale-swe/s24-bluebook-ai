    "This is the best science class for non-science people. Prof B is the best - she is super approachable, so knowledgeable, and really kind. I have shopped SO MANY no pre-req science classes, and have found every single one to be either (1) SUPER DRY or (2) SUPER DUMBED-DOWN. This one is neither. Although Cancer is mostly a lecture class, the seminar format allows you to ask a bunch of questions throughout the class and engage more directly with the material so that it becomes more approachable. I'm honestly really impressed with the level of science that I now understand. Warning, though: if you're looking for a gut, this is NOT it. It was really challenging for me, but I got a lot more out of it than I would have gotten out of a gut. It's worth it, I promise, so if you get a spot in the class, take it!",
    "Do NOT take this class.",
    "This was a course about cancer intended for Humanities majors, but it is technical enough that even science majors could get something out of it. Surprisingly fun\/funny even though it's cancer. I would recommend this strongly unless you want a gut.",
    "Here is how you can quickly figure out if you want to take this course: 1. Do you want an easy science credit where the workload is low? 2. Do you want a course that you can study by memorizing? 3. Do you want an easy A? If you answered yes to any of these questions, I would reconsider thinking about taking this class. This class is not a gut, not a class you can passively memorize, and not a class if you expect an easy A. Program: The course is a seminar taught as a lecture that meets twice a week. The reading if you pace all of it is about 25 pages per class (but remember is science texts and not history or econ). There are 3 quizzes (only 5% each so don't stress), a midterm (very hard), a group presentation on one specific cancer and subtopic of that cancer you decide (very rewarding - met some awesome friends doing this), and a 5-7 page paper of your choosing (short yes, but hard because it is not just citing facts and statistics, but the science behind the topic you choose). The material takes time to learn you don't get it right away (I don't think anyone in my class I spoke to did, you'll need to take the time to study). Prof Belperron designs this class to teach you to think. So you won't pass by just memorizing facts. You have to think about the big picture and Prof. Belperron teaches you how to do that. As someone who is going into consulting after graduation, I really appreciated how much Prof Belperron and her class stretched my thinking. Professor: The professor is Alexia Belperron. She knows that Cancer biology is hard to learn and she makes everything more understandable and is very patient. She holds regular lunches to get you to know and so you can know her. Office hours are sometimes at the Med School where her lab but you get to see what she is working on. People: I was a second semester senior when I took this course so Lesson 1: the class is mostly freshman and sophomores but if you're a senior don't rule yourself out. You'll grow close to the people you do the group presentation. Summary: Yes, this was one of the more difficult classes I've had at Yale (might be my lowest grade) and I could have taken something easier such as Issues Approach, but I appreciate how my thinking has changed from taking this class. There is a grind, but you learn to appreciate having gone through it and you form close relationships with some of the people in your seminar and Prof Belperron.",
    "YES. Knowledgeable professor. It's HARD, but it will also be one of the most interesting and informative classes you take. Seminar size is a great plus. Definitely study for the quizzes and the midterm. Final paper.",
    "Cancer was a very good course. before, I held only a very tenuous understanding of the biological mechanisms that drove the development of tumors. Now, I feel as though I have a thorough knowledge of the broad processes of cancer development, treatment, and diagnosis. You learn about carcinogenesis, mutations, inherited risk, infectious disease, treatment, and the immune system. In addition, the seminar format was really conducive to discussion and questions. Professor Belperron is friendly and engaged in making sure that you learn, not just in talking at you. The tests can be fairly challenging, but you can do well if you go over all of the relevant lectures which she posts online. If I could do things over, I would take it again.",
    "A solid science credit. Tests and quizzes are absurdly hard but also generously graded and graded on a curve so not bad. The lectures are a bit disorganized at points but overall very solid and Professor Belperron is very clear at answering questions and is generous with her time--good professor. Readings were really solid. I learned a lot from writing my final paper. Overall you'll also learn a good amount which is more than I can say for my other science credit.",
    "This is a FANTASTIC science credit. It isn't for science majors, and therefore it isn't an intro class that won't teach you anyway. It starts with the basics of microbiology, but it rapidly gets more complicated and in-depth. It's nice that the topic is specific, because you come away feeling like you actually learned a lot. There's weekly reading, three tough quizzes, a midterm, a group project, and a final paper. This is a great non-gut science credit -- take it if you actually want to learn something and are willing to do the work!",
    "Take it knowing that it is a lot of work and hard to get a good grade. Not sure if there are better options for science credits out there.",
    "I recommend this class to students who are interested in science but are not science majors. However, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS EXPECTING A GUT. There is a lot of in depth, \"science-y\" material, which should not discourage anyone because it is completely manageable if you give it the time it needs. Professor Belperron is one of the nicest professors I've had at Yale and is willing to go over anything you need help with. She wants her students to succeed and strives to do all she can to make that happen. The assignments are interesting and though especially difficult, and the research paper at the end was serious, though also completely manageable. It is the only paper of the semester and 5-7 pages, though because of her specifications, it ended up being ~400 words per page, not ~250.",
    "This class was a great way to feel like you were getting something out of the mandated science credit. Professor Belperron is very thoughtful and knowledgeable- the pace of the class is by no means slow, but the work load is light, save for a few quizzes, a midterm, a final presentation and paper. Yeah, it's a lot more than a gut, but I found it worthwhile. I really love to talk about carcinogens now, so totally great.",
    "General overview of the mechanics and history of cancer. Very detailed and I formative. Take it. Great science credit cause it is doable for non majors but always good stuff to know. Not a gut though you definitely have to work hard but it's not hard if you put in the time"
