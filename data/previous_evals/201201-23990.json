    "I would certainly recommend this class as a close reading of four major Spanish poets and their connections to larger movements of romanticism and symbolism in Spain.",

   "comments": [
    "There are very few seminars about poetry in our department, and Professor Valis' seminar was a refreshing and most welcome addition to the department's courses offered this semester!",
    "Helped me strengthen my skills as a poetry critic.",
    "Gave excellent introduction to Romantic and post-romantic poetry and poetics in Spain. Good preparation for exams and authors were highly influential therefore fundamental in our discipline. My dissertation may very well touch on one of the authors in this course.",
    "While this course is not in my particular area of interest\/research, I have benefited tremendously for having taken it, as it's analysis of poetry and, particularly, the poetry of writers that were so modern and so close to being avant-garde (consciously or not), has provided a foundation of precursors to the writers that I will eventually study more in-depth."
