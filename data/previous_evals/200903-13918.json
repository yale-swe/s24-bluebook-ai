    "Take it, take it, take it!",
    "This is the best class I have taken at Yale. If you can get in, take it. The readings were always very interesting and Paul did a great job leading the discussions. I left every class feeling truly intellectually stimulated and wanting to talk about the ideas we discussed with all of my friends. The weekly reading responses are not hard and the final project should be enjoyable.",
    "If this class is offered again, TAKE IT. Discussions were awesome and never boring. Paul Bloom is great!",
    "Take it if you can. It is an unbelievable course.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. very interesting topics, manageable reading, and challenging thoughts",
    "Take it. Take it. Take it.",
    "Cognitive Science of Pleasure is a very good course. The readings are interesting, as are the discussions. I wish we had more time for each topic because with some of them we barely scratched the surface. Bloom is brilliant and a pretty good discussion leader, but he almost never encourages students, which can be very frustrating.",
    "awesome class. awesome material. awesome professor",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any other student. Very fascinating material that you actually want to go to class to talk about.",
    "It was a great seminar, really manageable even if you do not a great background in cognitive science. It looks more at motivations and reasons we find pleasure in various activities, rather than on a neural basis. I would definitely recommend this class for any other student."
