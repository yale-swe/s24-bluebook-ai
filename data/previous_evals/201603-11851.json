   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Samuel's organization of section was very helpful, particularly his opening remarks that framed the discussion for the day. He was also good at bringing the discussion back to its point if the section veered off-topic (as it occasionally did). I think the elimination of the section presentations would be helpful and would allow the teaching fellow to be more engaged with the section in terms of facilitating questions.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0My TF was Ben Gibson. He was great.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0I thought Samuel did a wonderful job. He was well informed on the readings we were discussing, and he helped foster interesting discussions.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Very good. Approachable, engaging and humble. Solid ability to take complex ideas and speak about them in clear, orderly ways. Our section had some very engaged, animated students with a lot to say, as well as some who were a bit more reticent by nature and some who I think struggled more with the material and were hesitant to participate in the conversation because of the other students. So, perhaps a little more group facilitation would be good, being a little bit mindful of the personalities that tend to dominate and creating space for the quieter ones. This did happen sometimes, so I just want to encourage it.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Samuel was the most helpful, encouraging and knowledgable TF I have had at YDS. He has a sense of who his students are and a clear sense for the wide range of individuals and their strengths. I wish that every professor and TF took such an interest in his\/her students like Samuel. He has a rare ability to make his students feel heard and seen in a way that inspired heated, but always respectful, dialogue in my section. I truly believe that enough cannot be said in praise of his strong teaching intuitions. Wonderful semester of learning.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0section discussion was good",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Ben was my TF. He did an outstanding job facilitating discussion and clarifying difficult issues in texts. He was certainly the best TF I've had so far.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Mr. Loncar is very knowledgeable and is a good teacher. Often times he was able to clarify things that I was still confused about after the lecture. He always came to the discussion section prepared with background information and offered additional context for the material we were reading. He seemed to care about how the students were doing. He wanted everyone to succeed and was willing to meet with people one on one to help them do so. The only drawback was that there was some confusion about whether people were supposed to raise their hand in order to speak in the discussion group or if they were just supposed to jump in. Several times one person would be sitting with his hand up while others would just jump in, not allowing him to participate. The conversation was always dominated by four people. (This happens in all discussion groups because some people are more assertive than others. This is why raising hands might be preferable. It would give the Teaching Fellow more control over the participation and he could see to it that everyone has a chance to speak.) Overall, I think that Mr. Loncar is a great teacher and I believe he will make an excellent professor. I would be happy to have him as a Teaching Fellow again.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Sam brought a depth and breadth of knowledge to the material with thoughtfulness and an intelligent open mind. Discussions were both lively and well directed, and Sam offered insights which consistently added perspective to the readings and course lectures. I always valued when Sam lectured on a topic from the course readings, or brought in a relevant additional ideology. Sam was sensitive to the student dynamic and at one point directly addressed a concern of mine in a way that was respectful, honest, and professional, allowing me to grow in my understanding of my own situatedness and also the nature of the situation. For this, I was both grateful and improved. In addition, Sam was willing to meet with me outside of section in a very flexible and generous manner, providing additional reading material and research direction, and feedback on the writing assignments. My only criticism was in that we were each asked to complete a reading summary for the section, but the exercise was a bit unclear and there were a few occasions I noticed that others spent time preparing a complex response but were not allowed time to present. I did not share this experience and was able to present, but it seemed a bit random. Maybe a different time structure would help; perhaps limit the summary to the first 5 minutes and always allow students to prepare and present.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Samuel was a thoughtful discussion leader. Occasionally, he would lose us with his convoluted philosophical language, which might be considered a weakness. Samuel is a tough grader too. But overall, Samuel was a source of knowledge, support, and guidance, and he allowed us to craft the discussions in section to meet our interests.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Note: My TA was Ben Gibson not Samuel (there was no option for this). Ben was, quite literally, the best. He was energetic, fun, personable, funny, knowledgeable, and made me excited about ethics each and every class (this coming from someone who is usually truly bored by philosophy). He did a phenomenal job of being open to dissenting opinions, fostering discussion, and yet bringing us back when we got off track. His section is what I think learning is all about and what it should always look like. I felt ENCOURAGED to share my own opinions and vehemently argue what I thought, and I felt like my section was a family all year- the highpoint of my week each week. Moreover, Ben did a great job of pointing out the practical consequences of certain views, the promise in certain ethicist's opinions, and where philosophers' ideas practically fell short. This honesty made me want to find my own truth in the readings. He deserves to be a teacher and he deserves to know how he made us all want to learn and do our best in the course. He was also incredibly available and supportive to help with papers, and yet was fair and rigorous with grading.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Mr. Loncar was friendly and incredibly helpful. He demonstrated a very thorough knowledge of the material and was always willing and able to aid in our understanding of it. His paper grading was thorough and fair. He sought to cultivate positive relationships with his students. I really enjoyed having him as a TF, and our small group discussions were always very fruitful. My only suggestion would be to set clearer guidelines in the way of assignments. We each had to present to our small group, and it felt like there was sometimes a variation in peoples' understanding of what was expected. To his credit, there is no doubt that he would have answered any clarifying questions, had we asked him, and I did not.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0This was one of the best sections I've had at YDS. The discussions flowed freely. Students were asked to lead atleast one of the sessions. The sessions were animated and flowed fairly well from lectures and the readings. Sam was always open to answering questions students had and meeting with them when needed.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0He was very kind and willing to answer all questions. He was also willing to meet me multiple times to assist in my paper writing process. He was very helpful in section as well and was able to steer very sporadic and often confusing discussions. He also also made everyone feel capable. I very much enjoyed section.",
    "Instructor: Samuel Joseph Loncar \u00a0Sam was great at summarizing texts and drawing our attentions to potential problems in material we covered. He really seemed to value student opinion and was great at asking questions to get students to go deeper. I wnted a little more structure in section. It would have been good to know when I was presenting earlier in the semester and sometimes our conversations would remain on one topic for too long."
