    "The course was excellent - light reading, fun essay topics, and great lectures. Definitely take!",
    "I loved this class. I had never taken philosophy before, but this was so interesting and truly changed the way I think about religion and God. Gabriel is probably the best professor I've had here. He was a very engaging teacher, got so into the material, often stayed after for discussions with students, and made the class what it was. I took this credit\/d and I think that was a good decision because a lot of the students in the class (there were only 12 of us) were either graduate students or had more background in the subject than I did. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to really think more about what God is (in any religion) and wants a class with an amazing professor.",
