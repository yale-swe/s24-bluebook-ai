    "Probably one of the most underappreciated courses at Yale. It would probably help to take the course after taking 125.",
    "A good survey of the Canterbury Tales, although 170 is a very generous listing",
    "I loved this class. It is a wonderful follow up to English 125 and provides a really in depth look at the tales. Not too much work (even though it sounds like a lot). Writing the final paper was really fun and both Minnis and the TA were really willing to give feedback on drafts. Very helpful essay comments. One of the best classes that I've taken at Yale, and my favorite in the English department.",
    "An engaging course that is different in content and focus than many other Yale English courses. It emphasizes close readings of the texts and makes the language and themes of the Canterbury Tales manageable for a modern reader. It's a great option for a Pre-1800 course if you need that for the English major. Also, the class definitely improves your writing, as well as being engaging and well-taught. The course develops themes across the Canterbury Tales, as well as looking at historical ideas which form the context of the Tales, such as courtly love, religion, morality, and warfare.",
    "I loved this class so much! Middle English is super cool, Chaucer is great, and Prof. Minnis is amazing! The lectures progressed thematically, focusing primarily on the historical\/cultural context of the Tales, but it's essential to know about that sort of thing to understand the Tales. True, there was a good bit of writing for the course, 2 7-9 page papers and a final 14-18 page paper, but it was a valuable writing experience, and both the TF and Prof. Minnis were extremely helpful in the process of writing the papers.",
    "Take the course, you will become a more well rounded student by learning about Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.... must read them."
