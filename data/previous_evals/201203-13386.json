    "A great english course. I would recommend it. Just start Moby Dick ahead of time and you'll be fine.",
    "Professor Deming is fantastic and the course is fantastic! It's been my favorite class this semester. The readings are really great and a pretty solid introduction to the recurring themes in American Literature. You'll really get a lot out of the readings, and even more out of the class discussions, which were always facilitated really well by Deming. He's a really great teacher - lots of feedback on essays, always available to help. Be prepared to work though.",
    "Very good intro English class. The material is mostly excellent, and the class is great for developing essay writing skills and gaining experience participating in a seminar-style class. Be prepared to write a lot of essays.",
    "I LOVE LOVE LOVED this class. As a huge American literature geek, this class was amazing. There is a lot of reading, but the material covered is extensive and amazing. The book choices were great, and you really see how American literature built onto itself and created its own themes, which was the coolest part of the class. Professor Deming is just great-- he's a hard grader, but definitely fair. He leads discussion well and comes out with just the craziest things that can change the way you think about the readings, but he leads you to it. He also really cares about students individually, which is nice. Take it and take it with Deming-- my favorite class by far.",
    "Take it!!! As a senior math major, I truly enjoyed this class. Just be prepared to do a considerable amount of reading as the semester goes on (and start Moby-Dick EARLY).",
    "Yes. Prof. Deming is great and the course is good introduction to American Lit. I enjoyed it immensely.",
    "This is a great course if you enjoy this sort of thing--analyzing texts and discussing the finer points of what an author may have intended. The workload is not too intense and the discussion portion was highly enjoyable.",
    "English 127 is a great introductory class to American literature. You get to read great books, and have great discussions with your peers and your professor. I would recommend this class because it can be hard to find time to read actual novels in college, and this class gives you a perfect opportunity to do so, while also providing you witha deeper insight into what makes the texts \"American.\"",
    "I would absolutely recommended English 127 04. The course moves through a variety of the most well-known American texts and leads students to a deep understanding of them. Each new realization concerning a text felt like a fantastic revelation. This course changed my outlook on life several times, and in several different ways.",
    "It takes a while to settle into the class. I would not recommend this class if you need a little extra help but would if you are willing to work and confident in class.",
    "Definitely recommend. it requires a bit of time to get through the reading, esp Moby Dick, but it is a very satisfying course.",
    "Great class if you're at all interested in literature. I was a bit worried I wouldn't enjoy the reading enough because I sometimes dislike reading classics, but Professor Deming made it really fun. The class starts out with poetry so you can get some practice with close reading, and then delves deep into some longer works with the same level of focus. Moby Dick was the highlight of the class for me -- it's now one of my favorite books.I would highly recommend taking the class with Deming; he's a fantastic seminar leader."
