    "Take this class if you like art history, but if you want to learn a lot about religion, this might not be the best bet.",
    "HSAR 142 is a pretty good class. Mimi is a great lecturer and the workload is totally manageable (readings, a midterm, final, and term paper). Plus, it presents a great introduction to Buddhist art which is super cool. Definitely take it if you want a low stress and fun art history class with an incredible professor who really knows what she is talking about.",
    "This was probably one of the best classes I have taken at Yale so far. Mimi is an amazing lecturer who cares about all of her students, and the course material was so interesting. Take this class!",
    "Learn about the history of Buddhist art in the context of different cultures. Midterm, final, and a paper. It's an interesting way to learn about a religion of which I previously knew nothing.",
    "Introduction to Buddhist art through the middle ages. Would absolutely recommend!",
    "great intro art class with not a lot of work. final paper is very fun and you get a lot of freedom."
