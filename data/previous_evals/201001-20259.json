    "This course is a survey of social theory from the Frankfurt School to the present, with specific emphasis on how the material has been used in anthropology. I would highly recommend it for the sake of getting a grounding in contemporary social theory.",
    "Yes, it is indispensable to engage in contemporary theoretical debates in order to develop one's own theoretical framework on such basis. It is particular interesting in rethinking the discursive power and knowledge production itself.",
    "Highly recommended, as it encourages a broad working knowledge of various thinkers, theoretical interventions and historical moments within the development of contemporary social theory not only in the academy-at-large, but also within the discipline of anthropology itself.",
    "definitely a very strong course for anyone in social sciences"

   "comments": [
    "I found some of the texts that we read to be extremely helpful in terms of thinking about how to understand \"society.\" It has also given me enough of a grounding that I now feel more comfortable diving into other texts in social theory on my own -- I have an easier time seeing where they fit, and what debates they're contributing to. I anticipate that much of the material we covered here will provide theoretical grounding for my dissertation.",
    "It helps me understand the ongoing theoretical debate and rethink the strengths and weaknesses of anthropology as a discipline. This is very helpful in placing my own research in contemporary contexts of modernity, development and globalization.",
