    "I would, if solely for the increased applicability and accessibility of the readings. In terms of this section as opposed to others, if you want a true roundtable discussion it might be worth shopping other sections. I feel like I have a well developed understanding of the readings themselves but not much else.",
    "yes.",
    "Directed Studies History and Politics (DRST 006 03) is a course that examines a carefully and creatively selected oeuvre of the Western canon in regard to the historical and political theories and implications of the period between the early sixteenth century and the middle of the twentieth century. This course offers member students the opportunity to evaluate the depth and complexity of an appreciable variety of European (and, in light of The Souls of Black Folk being upon the syllabus for this course, American) historical and political works that are each deserving of a particular esteem and acclaim. I would highly recommend this course to any student who is pursuing an understanding of the contributions to world history and politics that have been achieved and produced by European historians and political thinkers between the dawn of the Protestant Reformation and the eclipse of European civilization in the wake of the Second World War.",
    "I would recommend the course, although the courseload is quite heavy, as an irreplaceable opportunity for classical education.",
    "This class is a reading and writing intensive survey of western historical and political thought. I would recommend it to someone looking to improve their critical reading and writing skills, specifically when it comes to analyzing history, and who is more interested in a broad overview of many thinkers than an in-depth look at a smaller number.",
    "I would summarise it as a good introduction to western political thought with the chance for great discussions and interactions with professors. I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for this."
