   "comments": [
    "All about Forest Management, especially how to manage forest for various purposes such as carbon sequestration, watershed management, wildlife conservation, timber production and so on.",
    "how to assess sites and determine treatments historical and social perspectives on silviculture",
    "A lot!!! There's the direct silvicultural skills\/knowledge that was delivered (and that I learnt), but through learning that knowledge it motivated a lot of new research questions for me and helped me see ecology in a different light that honestly inspired a lot of amazement! Specific concepts I learnt: shade-tolerance, successional stages and how it relates to species guilds, etc. I also learnt a lot from the classmates!",
    "I gained significant knowledge about tree growth strategies and an ability to read the ecological and social history of a landscape based on the existing structure and composition of plant species. Additionally I learned a lot about the silvicultural practices to manipulate growth toward social management goals.",
    "This course was incredibly practical, I learned skills that relate directly to forest management and forest operations. Additionally, I learned to interpret situations differently and make suggestions based on situational factors (the field components were particularly helpful with this).",
    "reading forest stand structure and dynamics, land-use history, succession; natural regeneration, treatments, etc.",
    "learned about basic stand dynamics and forest prescriptions and regeneration methods. I can tell you what coppice systems, shelterwood, seed tree, clear cut, and selection cuts are....still have my nappies though.",
    "So much. Soil science, land history, forest stand dynamics, stand delineation, natural regeneration methods, thinning strategies, quantitative thinning methods, precipitation drivers, forest types across the world, tree identification, pruning, grafting, artificial propagation, and general silvicultural prescriptions.",
    "I learned so much this semester. The class touched on forest ecology, timber operations, climate, geology, global forestry systems, and so much more. We learned how to do forest prescriptions, how to assess a forest condition, and many other skills that go along with forestry. The field trips helped a lot in translating theory into practice.",
    "What the heck silviculture is, and why it is important. How to synthesize the scientific principles and techniques of controlling, protecting, and restoring the regeneration, composition, and growth of natural forest vegetation and their plantation, agroforestry and urban forestry analogs.",
    "Learned a lot about managing forests.",
    "Basics of stand dynamics, natural regeneration, artificial propagation, and how to manage stands for different management goals.",
    "As an auditor, I attended all the lectures, some field trips, and took the midterm exam. I gained basic knowledge of silviculture concepts and practices and insights into how to read a landscape in a contextual and historical way.",
    "Different forest management techniques.",
    "I learned a lot in this course. Broadly, I learned the basics of forest sciencehow biotic and abiotic elements interact, and how those relationships change over time as forests change. I then learned how to apply this knowledge to manage forest to meet a wide variety of land management goals.",
    "I learned the foundational principles of silviculture, from the ecological underpinnings of forests to the various management strategies used around the world.",
    "different forest management practices across landscapes, cultures, and time.",
    "I learned a lot and it was great!",
    "Pragmatic melding of technical forestry and the social limits that all science sits within.",
    "The knowledge I learned in class built upon what I have learned previously about forest ecology and management. The class covered many different topics in silviculture from some basic concepts to advanced management practices. I also learned to read the landscape in New England from the field trips. What I have learned in this class would be a wonderful foundation for my research.",
    "This class helped enormously to solidify my understanding of stand dynamics through the field trips and practical exercises. I also improved my tree ID skills, and began to develop the ability to read landscapes. Most importantly, silviculture brought together many pieces of knowledge that I had before (plant ecophysiology, soil science, stand dynamics) and made a coherent whole picture.",
    "Please see my review for Field trips in silviculture and forest management. I accidentally filled out my evaluation for the lecture and field trips in the same evaluation. The summary is that it was an excellent course that far surpassed my expectations and integrated ecological theory into an application like no other class I have taken at Yale or my Alma Mater."

   "comments": [
    "Exactly align with my expectation.",

    "Very well",
    "Mostly, I expected to learn a lot and laugh a lot and have the chance to learn from Professor Ashton while I'm at FES. And eat some yummy breakfasts on Wednesdays. In that way, it aligned very well!",
    "Very well.",

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Comprehensive infomration in the text book, practical field work and community building Weakness: Lecture slides can be improved so that students can understand the lecture more.",
    "strengths: interesting subject area, textbook weaknesses: lectures, lecture slides, organization improve: more efficient and effective lectures, more clarity on evaluation for participation, more responsive TAs",
    "Strengths: Professor and TAs are highly available, responsive and approachable (and patient)!!! Availability of the lectures and textbook online was helpful for recapping work - it's hard to grasp everything in a lecture. The exams were really educational and well-set in my opinion. The content was also well organised and built on well to each other. Very informative! Weaknesses: Sometimes the sentences in the lectures drag on and don't end, and it's hard to catch what the professor is saying on a sentence-level. Improvement: Can it not be at 8.30am in the morning? :(",
    "The strengths of this course include the comprehensive knowledge about tree growth patterns in different ecological and social conditions. Weaknesses of this course were that it favored heavily towards traditional silvicultural practices and lacked modern day examples outside of the northeast temperate forest. Additionally, I would have benefited from more relevant figures, graphs, and examples used in lectures.",
    "The course has many field trips, which while informative, take a lot of time for students to commit to, and make it hard to schedule other professional skills building on the free Fridays at FES. I think the field trip at Yale Myers was particularly insightful, however. The course also assumes that students have a lot of background knowledge. As someone who has not taken a forestry class before, I felt I had to do extra studying to keep up with regular learning.",
    "difficult to say - perhaps more detail on slides could be useful",
    "It would be better if all questions about the lecture could be saved till the end, so the professor wouldn't veer off track.",
    "In-class lectures difficult to follow at times",
    "I think the course is very strong in the amount of content covered. The only change I'd make, if I had to, would be to have more time for questions built in to each lecture. Occasionally it felt like students really wanted to follow up on specific issues, but didn't have the opportunity because the lecture exhausted the allocated time.",
    "The course demands a lot of time but is all fairly laid out and straight forward. I don't really have any recommendations because it is a finely honed, classic course.",
    "The course is an institution, and more robust and informative than any other class that I've taken at FES. I don't have many suggestions in terms of improvements, besides maybe not getting distracted by random questions that slow down lectures.",
    "Strengths are that Dr. Ashton knows a ton. Biggest weakness is that he obscures his message by telling irrelevant stories and metaphors. I appreciate some goofiness, but to be honest I thought it got in the way in this class. He knows a ton of fascinating info so I feel he could keep it interesting with that! The slides could also be made a little bit more regular and clear.",
    "The textbook is excellent and the lectures are engaging. Sometimes the lectures meander a bit and I know that some of my classmates ended up simply watching recorded lectures online as opposed to attending lecture because they felt it was more concise.",
    "Good field trips. Lecture room maybe too big for full participation.",
    "The strength of this course is that it is very comprehensiveit teaches foundational information about forest science and ecology, and then builds on this knowledge to teach students how you manage landscapes, considering these basic concepts. However, the challenge in this course is that it is very intense and demanding for students. The extra lectures sometimes seemed excessive and beyond what students should be expected to contribute to the course for 4 units. At the same time, course time sometimes seemed to be used inefficiently. If there is a way to keep lectures on track and use lecture time efficiently, I wonder if these extra lectures to cover additional material is really necessary.",
    "The strength of the course is the breadth-- you walk away with a broad knowledge base.",
    "Field days helped visualize the course content and bring it to life. Comprehensive lectures that bring together the various topics and techniques discussed would be useful to help clarify in what types of situations they would be used.",
    "It was fantastic",
    "The quality of instruction and commitment from Professor Ashton to his students should be the standard that other professors should strive for at FES.",
    "One strength is that it is a wonderful class even for students who haven't taken forestry classes before. It is a good starting point if one wants to learn about some basic concepts of forestry and silviculture. It also covers so many topics in great depth. Each lecture is very informative. One weakness is that two hours is a bit too long. I tend to zone out in the last 30 minutes.",
    "Dr. Ashton is a good lecturer and knows when to pause, when to emphasize a point, and when to repeat a key message. In fact, Dr. Ashton's repetition of key messages\/facts made the gigantic amount of information in the class much more digestible. Those key messages were super helpful guiding principles that enabled me to think about any specific forest situation as a part of the larger pattern of forest ecology. Another strength is the unbelievable multitude of examples Dr. Ashton seems to have at hand at all times, from many different parts of the world. This helps keep students with many different interests engaged. A weakness of the course is the quality of Dr. Ashton's slides, though I think this is a minor thing. On the one hand, I understand that fewer words and more photos\/diagrams means students must pay close attention or risk missing something. But on the other hand, fewer words and more photos\/diagrams makes it difficult to go back and review the slides. Dr. Ashton tries to account for this by providing printouts of his slides so students can write on them, so I acknowledge that he probably already knows this and is trying to account for it."

   "comments": [
    "MEM students also can take this course to learn all about forest management although it is a bit challenging for students of non forestry background.",
    "do not take this class if you're not certain about your interest in forests or agriculture - don't take it if you're just looking for a fun, classic F&ES course. it is clearly geared towards teacher's pets and isn't worth the cringe-worthy moments. If you ARE interested in forests or agriculture, this class provides a good framework\/overview. lectures are disorganized and slides are terrible, but dr. Ashton knows a ton of useful info and if you have the patience to ask your question you won't be disappointed.",
    "Make time to read the textbook and review the lessons! Also make some time to learn species ID!",
    "Be mindful that the time commitment outside of class is large and the knowledge learned in this class is wide and very comprehensive. However, if you are interested in the subject matter, this class is excellent and well worth the time commitment.",
    "Read the textbook, make sure to ask Dr. Ashton questions if you have them.",
    "must-take course; excellent professor and content",
    "Be ready for a large time commitment, as almost every Fridays has a field trip, and one entire weekend. Helps if you are a morning person. Go to everything. For me it helps retain this information by going to all lecturers, tutorials, field trips, and doing the readings. Try to get the learning from all angles.",
    "stay on top of the readings",
    "Take it. Be prepared to spend a lot of time, especially during the end of the semester due to field trips. Go bug Dr. Ashton in his office with questions that come up. Do the reading; the writing is pretty great.",
    "You absolutely must take this course. It covers so much and you learn so much, even beyond what you would expect for an applied forest ecology class. It's a classic for a reason!",
    "Do readings before lectures, and rewatch online lectures afterwards. Make sure to attend every field trip that you are able.",
    "This is an interesting class, but it takes a lot of time to get something out of it. It's not perfectly streamlined at the moment to help you learn.",
    "Try to keep up with the readings because the textbook is excellent. Make sure to attend the overnight field trip to Yale Myers, as the concepts covered are important for the field prescription exercise at the end of the semester.",
    "Enjoy it! Waking up at 8:30 and spending rainy weekends outside isn't the most appealing, but the folks who sign up for Silviculture are a passionate and rare bunch so just soak up as much as you can.",
    "Sit in the front of the class to pay more attention.",
    "This course teaches you foundational information for managing forests and landscapes, and these concepts are applicable all over the world. However, the course is extremely demanding of your time. In the end, the course is worthwhile, but be prepared to give a lot of time and energy (and weekends) to the course.",
    "Be prepared for the field component-- it is a great time investment, but worth it!",
    "It might be your most fun and edifying course at FES!",
    "All FESers should take it, especially if you're going to claim you went to forestry school.",
    "Definitely take it if you want to learn about silviculture. The field trips are excellent, and you will learn so much about reading the landscapes.",
    "If you are interested in ecology of any sort, silviculture is an excellent introduction. The class moves at a breakneck pace, so attend lectures and take good notes. You'll come away with an understanding of how trees, stands, forests, and ecosystems function and fit together. Ask any question that comes to mind, because chances are other students are wondering the same thing."
