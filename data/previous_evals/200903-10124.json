    "yes",
    "Yes, it was an area of research that is often overlooked and this course provides an interesting way to understand it.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to a fellow student because experiment is a whole different approach in research. As a very prominent professor in experimental field, taking this course from Shyam Sunder is another important reason for my recommendation. Thanks to him, this course is even more contributing to one's thinking and research.",

    "very helpful",
    "I believe this course will help me to have a greater understanding of my discipline and I believe my familiarity with the concepts and techniques behind experimental economics should prove useful in my future research, if only to allow me to understand existing literature on topics I am interested in.",
    "Being a brand new concept for me, this course enabled me deepen my knowledge in experimental research. Not only my work but also the works of other students taught me a lot. I strongly believe that I improved my skills in asking questions and designing experimental settings as well as data work thanks to this course. I also think and hope this course will contribute my research significantly.",
    "It opened up my horizon. I learned about experiment economics research and I enjoyed it. I will consider work in that area in the future."
