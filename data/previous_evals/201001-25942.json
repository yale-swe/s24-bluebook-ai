   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, with the caveat that the emphasis of the class is more on the culture and practice of sacred harp, and not about religion.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in discussing the history of a uniquely American sacred tradition. It was great having Div School students in the class to help add to our knowledge of theological history, and Prof. Quinn is engaging and accommodating. The weekly singings really make the class.",
    "Yes, I'd definitely recommend this course to another student. It's really good as a sort of odd-ball different choice that provides contrast to one's other courses. My favorite part was the Sacred Harp singings. I think Ian did a really good job of keeping our seminar discussions intellectual but light, and I learned a lot, became interested in a new kind of music that I hope to continue with, and had fun. Hooray.",
    "I enjoyed this class because I was interested in Sacred Harp music already, but everyone in the class had a different reason for participating. It was a nice way to add meaning to our weekly singings, and to create community with the body of singers. The class looks mostly at history (via the approximately 5 books written on the matter), but also a little at the sociology of the Shape Note community and a bit at the structure of the music itself. Class itself is discussion-based and fairly free-form, in a good way \u0096 everyone is very knowledgeable about different components, which makes for a good discussion. Plus there's plenty of in-class singing and listening to look forward to.",
    "I took this class on a lark and enjoyed it a lot. I now know much more about the Sacred Harp tradition, the methods of singing, and the wonderful people who gather to sing it. I'm also a bit frustrated with the post-modern turns such a pre-modern topic can take on. I think this class could benefit from being taught again - we were sort of the experimental first year of it. There was also quite a lot of variation in the amount of work required week to week, and clearer communication between professor and students could have helped with this."
