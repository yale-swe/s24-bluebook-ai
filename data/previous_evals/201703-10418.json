   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot about how to make sure statistical analysis (e.g. via random sampling) is actually representative of the population statistics. Learned some of the background for more advanced ideas in statistics (such as Levy stable distributions).",
    "You learn a lot of incredibly valuable techniques for statistical simulations including the ubiquitous Monte Carlo method, Markov Chains and random walk methods. You also learn correlation analyses. The material is applied in both physics and financial contexts. Importantly, you get to actually code, implement and analyze these simulations and analyze data sets yourself using these techniques. However the most valuable thing this course provided was the challenge: it will get you to think out of the box and develop your logical skills like no other course I have seen. It is very difficult, but I found it immensely valuable in a way that few, if any, of the other courses I have taken can match.",
    "The course was a great mix of actual simulation\/programming and theory. I learned a lot about random walks, monte carlo methods, and some interesting tools of physics that are useful in simulation and physics."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The small size and format are really helpful. The professor teaches \"actively\" (e.g. modifies code dynamically during class) and not \"passively\" (i.e. having a canned lecture planned from the beginning).",
    "Strengths: the unique combination of material; the homework assignments and the way they get you to implement and analyze the simulations etc. yourself; the intellectual challenge and development. Weaknesses: the exams are too hard and too long, so it would be great if they were made easier and or longer so that students are more able to demonstrate what they have learned. Improvements: a recap\/review lecture at the end of the course that goes over all the important tools we have acquired and that brings everything together would be immensely beneficial. I feel like I learned so many amazing things but it would be much easier to retain the material and the significance of what I learned if there had been one.",
    "I think Professor Ismail-Beigi understands the needed improvements, many of which were corrected throughout the course. He was always incredibly responsive to feedback\/criticism and even welcomed it. The one significant complaint I do have are the tests. Each test is worth several problem sets (which often take over 10 hours each), but is so rushed that one cannot possibly demonstrate his or her true knowledge of the topics. For example, on the first test, one of the questions was basically to derive the results in 0.5 hours that were derived three lectures later in about 1.5 hours."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! It covers a range from pure theory (e.g. the basics of stable distributions) to practical methods (e.g. how to tell \"by eye\" that a sampling technique is really providing independent samples).",
    "You learn a lot of incredibly valuable techniques for statistical simulations including the ubiquitous Monte Carlo method, Markov Chains and random walk methods. You also learn correlation analyses. The material is applied in both physics and financial contexts. Importantly, you get to actually code, implement and analyze these simulations and analyze data sets yourself using these techniques. This course provides a combination of material and exercises you would be hard-pressed to find in any other undergraduate course and is likely one of the if not the most valuable course I have taken at Yale. It is very difficult and challenging, so its best to take it with a lighter course load, which will also provide the maximum benefit. The intellectual development this course provides is staggering. I highly recommend taking it if you can.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any physics\/chemistry student interested in simulation. The course provides a great mix of both theory and practice, with lectures providing the necessary theory for problem sets that both expand on the theory and provide coding exercises. The problem sets can be quite long, but can also be quite fun. I will warn you that they might be hard without attending office hours though. Also, professor Ismail-Beigi is great; he is very open to feedback and incredibly responsive over email. Knowing that this was the first time it was offered, he was always looking to make the course better, and I expect it will be very good in the coming years. So, if you have interest in learning how Monte Carlo, random walks, and some other fun simulation tools, definitely take this course."
