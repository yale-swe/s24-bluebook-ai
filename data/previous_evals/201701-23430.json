   "comments": [
    "The readings and cases are great. Class discussion sometimes seems too unstructured.",
    "Strengths: well-organized, engaging, has clear educational goals Weaknesses: poor classroom culture - group presentation style encourages students to be unreasonably aggressive in asking questions that they have no interest in. The limited and aggressive nature of presentation questions at the midterm seemed to change the mood of the class, after which it was commonplace to hear students being mocked for their questions or presentations. The presentations encourage a destructive antagonism that limits the development of students and instead encourages deflection. The formulaic nature of tools that are given during class also create laziness and unwillingness for students to approach problems that are too difficult to put into one of the frameworks (at least, that's what happened in my group several times). Suggestions -Please have at least one class or case on solving unstructured problems --> how in the hell do you collect the data? What are common data sources for problems in hospitals and how are they approached? -if you're going to ask questions during presentations that involve information covered later in the presentation, either stop asking the questions or insist that the presentation jump to that slide briefly. Otherwise, it is entirely asinine to think that students won't learn to deflect. This became a joke amongst the entire class and it made me sad that it wasted so much energy that could have been used to learn more course material or constructive ways to engage with feedback during a presentation. -If you want to be tough, target individual students and ask them pointed questions about their subject matter.",
    "very important course for people interested in management and implementation leadership",
    "I think that the first half of the course was very good. I am not a fan of the time, but Ingrid is a good lecturer. I don't know why Ingrid never returned after spring break, but I know we are all worried. I wish we were given more information. This is supposed to be our capstone course. Because of her absence (even if it was unpredictable and unavoidable), we did loose her insights and the continuity of the course. She was able to give us an academic perspective on healthcare and running healthcare organizations in a way that the guest speakers really couldn't. Other than the ACA lecture, the slides for the second half of the semester were not very helpful. I feel like i learned a huge amount during the first half, but the second half felt more disjointed with fewer lasting takeaways. This made writing the final much harder than the midterm because it was a struggle to figure out if and what lenses we should look at questions through without the summary and continuity between lectures. But that is not really what I care about- I care about the learning that I will need when I leave YSPH, and I care about if Ingrid is ok.",
    "Really valuable conversations and cases Excellent instruction Challenging time of day and location Great guest speakers towards the end Covers key concepts",
    "Really valuable conversations and cases Excellent instruction Challenging time of day and location Great guest speakers towards the end Covers key concepts",
    "A course of uneven quality featuring both exceptional and lackluster sessions. Underwhelming when evaluated in the context of capstone class to the HCM program rather than just another course at Yale. Strengths: - Wealth of experience from professor and classmates; generally well facilitated discussions - Guest speakers. Particularly enjoyed Naya Kehayes lecture - the class of the semester that seemed most connected to real-world practice of healthcare management vs. high-level theory Opportunities for improvement: - Better time management. Much of the first half of the semester felt like 115 minutes of reciting case details followed by a rushed synthesis of what lessons we should be taking a way from the case. This sentiment was acutely felt with particular sessions, notably sessions 3 and 4. More of a problem earlier in the semester, but end the class on time rather than running over. - Clearer expectations. Assignment evaluation felt like a moving target. Consider sharing evaluation criteria in advance of submissions. - The concept of a \"hostile\" board during group presentations needs to be better executed if it is to be a valuable learning experience. I appreciated the detailed debrief on this assignment, but disappointed to see few points of feedback from the midterm addressed for the final.",
    "Readings are too much, misses the point. Classes sometimes try to cover too much.",
    "Learned a lot of valuable information.",
    "STRENGTHS -Introduced me to some foundational texts that were great to have links to (e.g. Quadruple Aim reading, \"What Business Are We In\"? reading, etc.) -Really enjoyed the final group project, getting to dig into a subject that felt timely and interesting to our group. -Did a good mixture of global and domestic cases -Great to have guest lecture discuss details of her day-to-day job WEAKNESSES -Sometimes a bit heavy on theory -Wish we spent more time on key take-aways, discussing them in more detail, rather than spending lots of time digging into details of case (both are important, but balance of time allotment could be improved)",
    "Really useful in teaching us practical applications of topics we've learned throughout our time in this program. In fact, I've already used these concepts in other courses and am certain to use them in my career. The presentations could use more clarity around expectations and defining roles.",
    "I learned very little novel information from this course. The content of the coursework overly relies on heuristics and much of the reading for the course reads like an airport bookstore, \"The 8 step strategic solving method\", \"The 6 ... criteria\", etc... This class relies too heavily on these frameworks when most of the students in the course, in their final semester of the program, have already cultivated intuitions around these frameworks. This course would have been great in the first semester for students with little to no healthcare experience looking to learn some frameworks that they would try out in subsequent internship and practicum experience. Material was largely redundant and review with uninteresting case material.",
    "Unusual course content in that the HBS case studies are to some degree artificial and fictionalized, but we were not supposed to go outside them in reading about the cases...and the other reading was management theory reading....so overall I had a sense of unreality about the content. Also many readings a challenge to access, either because subscription required (Harvard Business Review) or because the links provided to the readings were incorrect (majority of the links were bad). btw the HBR readings are unusual in my mind. Ingrid is a good teacher but overall I had the sense that the course was somehow hyped. Some of this comes from the students of course but I might try and avoid feeding into any presumption of specialness. \"...we are at YALE and someday you will be a LEADER so you really need to show me your best, I know you can do it...\" Yikes. Think some of this could have been normalized by inviting speakers from industry, maybe even...YNNH. The one alumnus speaker seemed to be doing it out of the goodness of her heart. It was an ok (if pretty specific) talk. We were encouraged to thank her afterwards etc...which is fine but of course we are paying a good bit per session. The first project was also pretty weird. I think most people did not really understand what the other groups were talking about, since we had little background information on others' topics, things were pretty rushed, and we were actually told the intention was to create a pressured situation, \"like in business\". In the end people's public performance abilities took over but it all seemed unrelated to content. I did end up learning a lot though, and I did find some of the readings practically helpful to me.",
    "Strengths: -Provided useful management techniques that will be used in the real world -Class discussions to walk through frameworks was a helpful way to apply reading material Weaknesses\/Changes: -Some of the case studies were dated, and it would have been helpful to look at current real world examples -Rubrics would have been helpful to understand which skills we were supposed to practice for each assignment and to ensure fair grading. For example, during the first presentation, an emphasis was placed repeatedly on presentation skills and managing interruptions and questions. Some groups clearly performed better than others (e.g., some groups had team members talking over each other and re-presenting slides that teammates already presented), yet every group received the same presentation score. As another example, for the midterm, the comments back to us mentioned that we were supposed to answer questions based on a specific framework. However, the question prompt did not ask for frameworks to be used. It is possible to provide a thoughtful analysis without using frameworks. Clear expectations of the grading criteria would provide more efficient direction of efforts for assignments. -Projects would have been more useful and engaging if we were consulting for real organizations who had problems to solve. -Over-emphasis placed on class participation through speaking in class. Students would speak without being thoughtful just to get participation points. It would be helpful to create other participation opportunities (such as counting small group work, team projects, and presentations). -Would have liked to give feedback on project teams on member contributions to project work. -The learning environment may improve if the class was held in a larger room (at SOM?) that allowed classmates to see each other during class discussion and had space for small group breakouts.",
    "The class is a great culmination of everything we all learned in our previous YSPH and SOM classes. Often times, the reading would be too much",
    "interactive class discussion centered on cases but sometimes focused too heavily on recaping facts rather than debating more nuanced parts of the case. clearer expectations could have been set about the group presentations",
    "This is not a very well structured or well-taught class. It feels disjointed and perhaps the fact that it is marketed as a capstone makes it worse. As an elective, I can understand but this is not a great culmination of 2 years worth of an MPH. Additionally I felt that students sometimes knew more than the professor",
    "I thought the cases were extremely interesting. I enjoyed reading every single one of them. However, I believe that teaching in frameworks can become someone cumbersome for students, especially if they already have an intuitive or experience based approach to frameworks.",
    "Greatest strength was when the instructor Ingrid talked and taught us valuable insights into the case studies. She is the best. Weakness was sadly the students. People are forced to talk for participation so those that do talk are mostly people spewing random BS just to get a point for the day, and you actually learn zero from your peers. Participation was supposed to foster discussion amongst peers, but that rarely happened, and I'd rather be taught by Ingrid.",
    "The cases were interested, but we missed Ingrid in the second half. Also, the class is too big - there need to be two sections. Finally, fewer cases but more depth would yield a better conversation.",
    "One major weakness was that feedback on assignments was sometimes poor in quality. For example, one group was told to explain what signs and symptoms are in \"non-medical jargon.\" Surely everyone knows what signs and symptoms are, and in this case the audience was supposed to be the google c-suite, surely they should know what signs and symptoms are? Another issue was the focus on \"you are being graded on participation\" rhetoric. On the one hand, participation does add value to the class, but sometimes the quality of the comments was really low because people only did it for the grade and not because they had anything of value to add. It would be better to try investigating different ways to incentivize participation without negatively affecting the quality of the discussion.",
    "I found all the topics and content interesting and salient to healthcare, but I'm not sure if I came away knowing how to manage a healthcare organization...There are so many slides in her teaching deck (look somewhat busy and outdated), and they are merely glossed over. I would appreciate a bit more time and attention on the theoretical content.",
    "Course was good. Ingrid and Bonnie did a great job.",
    "This course had a lot of potential but fell way short in the delivery.",
    "Poor concepts...horrible overall"

    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0I've only heard that it has been a rough time for the professor. Previous to her absence, things were not going well in this course. The absence really only made it worse. She doesn't have a very good command of the room. I feel like she is insecure when pushed on or debated. It feels like she is trying to state her legitimacy in the class. I'm not sure why students make you feel insecure about your work, if you believe these silly management concepts, then defend them. I think the tone of the classroom needed to be set by the professor and that was lacking. It was a hostile environment during the midterm presentations",
