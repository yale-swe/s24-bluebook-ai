   "comments": [
    "The course is concerned with classic findings about visual and oculomotor systems of the brain. I would recommend it to any student who plans to do primate neurophysiology, or perhaps neuroimaging.",
    "Seminar course on visuomotor neurophysiology. I would recommend it to any student interested in the visual system or systems neuroscience.",
    "I think this is a great course for a student that actually wants to read and think carefully about this topic. Can be tricky to discuss 4 papers each week due to time constraints. Good practice for qualifying exams.",
    "I absolutely would. There are some ways in which this class is sub-optimal but the amount I learned about visuomotor systems is irreplaceable.",
    "Yes, I would recommend for anyone interested in these topics. See response to #1."

   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot and regret nothing. This was good practice for quals.",
    "This course was very useful for learning current and background information relevant to my dissertation and interests.",
    "Very related to my work, many essential readings. Would have had to read all of this on my own if not in this class, so I really appreciated opportunity to discuss with professors and other students.",
    "To clarify 4c, although I thought the course was hard at times, I don't think I would have gotten as much out of it if it had been easier and I really appreciate how much we were pushed. I think it is great preparation for reading several papers a week in depth, skills that we will need for qualifying as well as throughout our careers, of course.",
    "This class improved my understanding of many things - from methodologies for recording neural activity, behavioral tasks, to abstract concepts such as Gabor functions. It was also interesting to see how ideas and theories formed, developed, and sometimes slowly went out of style."
