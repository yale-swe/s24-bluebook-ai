    "It was a good course. Usually three papers to read per week and you fill out the same worksheet for each. Three problem sets, and one final paper (on any economic institution you want to write about) with periodic drafts so that it isn't a lot of work all at the end like most seminars. I have no idea how I did in the course, but the papers were interesting. Participation does not factor into the grade but discussion still was good. We all liked the papers from the second half more, so I suspect that next year those will make up more of the course.",
    "Really boring.",
    "Good theoretical way to understand political economy of institutions.",
    "Good econ seminar where you learn how to read econ papers.",
    "A very chill senior seminar. You'll learn a lot about how institutions in the developed world got started.",
    "Yes, a good senior seminar."
