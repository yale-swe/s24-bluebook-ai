   "comments": [
    "The course material is very interesting and the discussion basis of the class really pushes your Spanish-speaking skills. It was a very relaxed class with not that much work, and so it would probably be a good fifth class if you feel VERY comfortable with your Spanish. There are a lot of native speakers who take this class.",
    "Yes! It's a fun class and you get to do lots of cool reading.",
    "I have the feeling that this class would have been interesting if it had been taught by another professor. However, this class felt like a waste of time as material was covered randomly without much consistent or thorough analysis.",
    "Great class to do some readings on Latin American literature. You have to find your niche in what interests you because the syllabus does not lead in a specific place; it just provides a lot of stimuli to find what you like about literature, through some very well picked pieces.",
    "Absolutely. This class was great. I think other students should definitely consider it.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!!!!",
    "It is a great class! Interesting readings, interesting approach and not much work.",
    "Definitely recommend. Totally reasonable course load and very interesting subject. Probably depends on the prof, though.",
    "I would summarize this class as a cursory survey of important latin-american authors, a good way to practice your spanish and a refreshing chance to do really close readings of a limited amount of text. I would recommend this class if that's what you're looking for.",
    "I would definitely recommend Spanish 267 to a student interested in Latin American Literature. Only take this class if your Spanish is already at a really advanced level, because you should be prepared to read some very difficult works.",
    "It nice, it was basically philosophizing and talking about literature in Spanish twice a week. Take it if you are willing to do that or to listen to other people's interpretations of poems and texts. Not too much work.",
    "Take this class if you want to really know the backbone of Latin American Literature.",
    "In this instance, the class is inseparable from the professor. I have no idea what Span267 is under a more conventionally minded instructor, but under Professor Estrella it was a series of offbeat class discussions about a series of abstract works, interjected with some of Estrella's thoughts about reading literature at large. Some students thrived on this way of experiencing literature, while others were not entirely thrilled. If you are thinking about taking a class with Estrella, take shopping period very seriously because his teaching during shoppingperiod is indicative of his style the rest of the semester as well. If you love it, great, take the class and have a most interesting experience... but if you are hesitant at all, choose another class.",
    "Definitely recommend it"
