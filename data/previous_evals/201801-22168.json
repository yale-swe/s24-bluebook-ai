    "Overall an interesting seminar. I learned a lot about ritual and status in South Asian religions, as well as how senses work.",
    "I learned a great deal about the senses and how the senses are connected both internally and externally. I also learned how to contemplate a concept which is inexplicable: Brahman. The course gave me a new appreciation of South Asian cultures, and overall helped change my academic path throughout college."

   "comments": [
    "There should have been many fewer readings, much less powerpoint time, and a better split between undergrad and grad students. A lot of the airtime was taken up with grad students in an imbalanced way.",
    "I love the structure (weekly papers on the readings, then discussion in class) because we had to consistently engage with the material and couldn't skip the readings. That being said, I could have used an introduction to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism at the beginning of the class so that I understood the context.",
    "Professor Gerety's experience in the field and the fact that students were not only undergraduates but graduate students as well as faculty guests."

    "This is a great course. If you keep up on the work, it isn't stressful at all and the topics of discussion are interesting. There is a lot of reading\/watching\/looking at\/listening to other media, but it isn't a ridiculous amount.",
    "Yes, definitely. The course was taught very well and in an engaging manner. It was a truly unique classroom experience, as I was able to learn not only from the instructor but other students of various backgrounds. It was a very intellectually and spiritually stimulating environment."
