    "I think that HSAR 468 gives you an incredible look at a field of art that most art history courses at Yale and across American universities would not give you. Not only did HSAR 468 give me a new knowledge about west African art and culture, it also challenged the kind of inherent supposition of art history that only Western art is worth studying.",
    "You will learn various indigenous African cosmologies, and how those cosmologies are represented and manifested in visual culture, music, myths, and art.",
    "In this course, we learned a great deal about some of the art and culture of several African cultures. Our most detailed analysis was on the Yoruba tribe.",
    "Great insight into Yoruba culture"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Master T is an absolute legend -- he's had the most incredible experiences in the field, he knows everyone, and he radiates enthusiasm and knowledge. He could make anyone excited about the African diaspora and its effect on artistic traditions around the world. Weaknesses: it could be somewhat disorganized at points, honestly just because Master T knows SO MUCH that I think it's hard for him to distill it completely. I also wish the slides were labeled and posted online so I could have referenced them later.",
    "Professor T. has a fetish for Black women and some of his stories might make you feel a tad bit uncomfortable.",
    "Professor Thompson is a wonderful professor who loves his students and is really an expert in his field. He has a lot of fascinating life experience from traveling and immersing himself in other religions and his stories make for a fascinating seminar. However, he is very hard of hearing and so interacting in the seminar can be difficult. It would have been helpful to have somebody helping out during the seminar with communication b\/w students and Professor Thompson, and explaining how the class was going to go earlier on.",
    "Great class, not much needs to change.",
    "The professors Passion and understanding of subject."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in art history but hasn't had the opportunity to get a sense of the field outside of the Western world. I would also recommend it just as an opportunity to be with Master T -- this course is a unique combination of very chill grading (Master T absolutely just does what he wants, and he really just wants you to learn and not worry about grades) and super interesting, engaging material (you get out of it what you put in).",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the subject! It was a pretty chill seminar and I learned a lot about West African art and culture and its continuities in the Americas - something I was never familiar with. It's pretty easy to do well if you do all your work.",
    "Take it for the knowledge on African Spirituality",
    "Professor Thompson has a wealth of information that is more than willing to share with all of his students. He will teach you, with passion and respect, about Black Atlantic history that will color the way you perceive the world forever. He not only respects these cultures, but demands everyone else respect them as full of richness and elegance. If one gets the chance to take the course, it is a wonderful class to take. Take it as a cred\/d\/fail.",
    "Yes! This a really unique class and Professor Thompson has a lot of experience with the works that he's talking about. He's so clearly invested in his work and has a lot of amazing stories to tell during seminar. Be prepared for a very unconventional style of class, and some confusion about assignments and the structure of the semester (a more hands on TA could have been helpful). Once you adjust to Professor Thompsons style, this is a class you will learn a lot from and never forget.",
    "100% take this course. Professor Thompson pioneered the academic study of African art and is a living treasure. The workload is light (~50 pages of reading and a 1-2 page response each week) and you'll get so much out of class itself. Take this if you love black culture and wanted to deepen that love.",
    "Most definitely. It's not too tough with the workload and you learn a good deal about an interesting topic from a great professor.",
    "Yes, if Prof.T teaches it again",
    "YES!"
