    "Definitely!",
    "Absolutely. If you want to learn more about U.S. cultural history during this time period (especially to enhance your more diplomatic or military understanding of the war), I highly recommend this class.",
    "A thoroughly enjoyable class! Professor Van Vleck is incredibly passionate and helpful and is great at facilitating interesting class discussions. The final research paper is a good opportunity to dig through the resources that Yale's libraries offer. The readings are very interesting and Professor Van Vleck's feedback will help make you a better writer. Would recommend for anyone, not just History majors.",
    "HIST 181 was an in depth look at the different ways of understanding WWII. It provided a diverse and complicated array of perspectives leading to interesting discussions about the war and historiography. I would highly recommend this course. Professor Van Vleck is absoultely wonderful and the class is incredibly interesting.",
    "Amazing course on WWII. You'll learn a lot; and Van Vleck is amazing",
    "Fantastic, stimulating seminar. Engaging material and professor. Discussions tended to be fairly formal, so be prepared to organize your thoughts in advance. Not a lot of internal intellectual discovery will take place within the class, though insightful revelations will certainty be made. Overall, well worth taking.",
    "Great and engaging history seminar. Van Vleck really guides you through the writing and research process and creates a very positive seminar space. The topic is really interesting and you definitely engage in a lot of questions about what it means to be a historian more generally"
