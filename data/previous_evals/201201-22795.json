    "Prof. Hollyer is one of the smartest professors I've met at Yale. And he was so incredibly helpful. I just wish he was staying at Yale. I'm very glad I took his class.",
    "This is the second year that I've taken a course taught by a Leitner Fellow, and whilst the fellowship is a one year appointment - thus making it unlikely that James will teach at Yale again in the near future - I can highly recommend my experience with professors taking part in the Leitner scheme.An incredibly engaging class, paying close attention to empirical political science. A little statistics background is helpful, though not essential. Really excellent.",
    "If you are interested in the theory behind this concept take it. If you want case studies, dont."
