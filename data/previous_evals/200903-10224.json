    "The course is very useful and will really benefit future research paper endeavors.",
    "This course introduces grad students to some of the issues at stake in the field of early national US history, some of the ways historians have approached these topics, and some of the important primary sources from the period, before movingon to support students as they do research in the field.I would recommend the course highly to another student both because of the importance of the topic and because of the useful scholarly tools the course helps develop.",
    "I would recommend it but recommend fellow students to begin working on paper topics and proposals before the syllabus says to.",
    "I would recommend History 703. If a student feels interested in conducting focused historical research on the early United States, work in this course with Professor Freeman would be highly valuable in practicing the craft and perhaps creating a project valuable on its own or as part of a dissertation or thesis."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me many new ways of thinking about evidence and about how to construct an historical argument. I'm certain that I'll use these tools as I approach every research project I undertake in the future.",
    "I definitely understand more fully what is required of historical research and writing. Additionally, I am more familiar with the sometimes frantic writing pace, and see myself as more comfortable with pressing deadlines that will inevitably come in the future. I am absolutely considering integrating some of the ideas and perhaps the entire finished product into a dissertation."
