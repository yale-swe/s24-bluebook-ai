    "Yes -- have an idea for a final article before you start class. This class can be extremely stressful at times, and assignments are literally due at the most inconvenient times.",
    "Yes I would HIGHLY recommend this class!",
    "Take it with Brill. He is hardcore and challenges you, but only because he pushes you, especially when he can see and knows your potential.",
    "A class on journalism. How to write for it, how to manage it, and an attempt to understand where its going",
    "Great to take if you are really interested in journalism--about it both as a business and a public service--a 10 page profile if a classmate, some short assignments and a long magazine article at the end that takes some real hard work reporting and writing--strongly recommended--and a trip to nytimes",
    "Write a profile of a fellow student and an in-depth piece on a campus or city issue for your final project. Not too work-intensive, eye-opening, fun. Definitely do it, and do it with Brill. If you work hard, he'll do everything he can to help you find internships and figure out how (and why) you should go into journalism.",
    "This was a really good class, and I would highly recommend Journalism. Make sure you know what you're getting into, though, because Brill will be tough all semester. If you care about your mental health, take Abramson. Brill frames the class as a class on life, not just a class on journalism, so if you don't do well in his class, it feels like you won't do well in life. That's pretty terrifying, but on the flip side, it's motivation to do well. I worked harder for this class than I have for any other class in my life."
