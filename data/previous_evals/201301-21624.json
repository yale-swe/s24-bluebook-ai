    "You will learn a lot. It may take a while to click, especially if you're only taking it will cell bio concurrently. It should easily be a full credit course.",
    "I didn't believe it until I saw it for myself: cells are real! I heartily recommend this course if you are sick of mindlessly acting out meaningless lab protocols and want to have a useful, rewarding, and independent research project. Of course, be warned!! There is a long long report at the end. However, this won't come a surprise and Mr. Piekos will keep you on track enough to make it manageable.",
    "One of the very few lab courses, and classes in general, that are worth the tuition. When will you ever be able to use transmission electron microscopes and go through the whole process of fixing, embedding, sectioning, staining a real mouse organ in an undergraduate class? This class is very laid-back, Barry is awesome, and it's just amazing to see the cumulation of all your work at the end of the year, as well as other people in the class. Don't waste your time taking lower level biology labs when you can just save your requirements for small classes like these. You need to notify Barry months in advance because there's only like 4-5 students per section. It's an awesome lab that I think most biology students if they get in, should try to do. It's not too much work, and it's just super cool to see actual cells and figure out for yourself what each organelle is. There's one long paper and presentation at the end of the year, and a short one in the beginning, but the workload is very manageable. Take this lab!!",
    "It's a great class but it requires a LOT of time, especially towards the end of the semester so be sure that you are able to commit to this. But the instructor and TAs are very helpful so be sure to use them as resources.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to do the extra work (~2 hrs\/week). Tons of work in the last week of the course - there's plenty of time to do it if you start well ahead of time but you probably won't... in which case the 3 days before will be rough"
