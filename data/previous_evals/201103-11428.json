    "I would recommend it if you're interested in copyright, privacy, and\/or anonymity on the internet. I hadn't thought much about these issues, so it was harder for me to contribute much to discussions. This class also includes a 20 min presentation by each person in the class, so the topics covered will vary a good deal based on the interests of those in theclass.",
    "Manageable course load, good mix of technical and policy topics and Feigenbaum does a good job at teaching."
