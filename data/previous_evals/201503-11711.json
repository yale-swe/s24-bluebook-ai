   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Although this is a heritage Chinese course, there are plenty of opportunities for speaking and improving Mandarin Chinese with daily participation, presentations, and weekly TA tutorials. You cover about a chapter a week, have short daily quizzes and homework, but you will learn hundreds of characters by the end of the semester and be able to recognize even more. Both Liu Laoshi and Chan Laoshi are very knowledgeable and helpful. Class is small, so there are plenty of opportunities to participate and know your classmates well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was fun, interesting, I made friends, and I improved my Chinese a ton.",
    "A fast-paced course that teaches native speakers (including those with fluency but no reading or writing abilities) considerable character cognition and offers insight into many different facets of Chinese culture. Would absolutely recommend."
