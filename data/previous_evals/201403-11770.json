    "Beginning Yoruba is an introduction to the language spoken mostly in Nigeria and other parts of Western Africa. Professor Adesola makes the language come alive, and we learn a lot about the cultural and social aspects associated with the language.",
    "I would recommend this to all of the students that I know. It is a great class and I learned a lot about the Yoruban culture which was great to learn about. I really annoyed this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Yoruba to another student. The language is not well known and people are interested in the unknown. It sounds very interesting and the professor is very friendly.",
    "It's a great class."
