    "Anybody interested in sociology should take this class",
    "I would recommend the class only if one needs it to complete the major or distributional requirements. I would not take it just for fun. Only two papers- midterm (7-10) and final (10-12). Two review papers for two books we read also; they were short.",
    "Norms and Deviance is a phenomenal class with Elijah Anderson!",
    "Incredibly interesting course that will shift the way you observe the world and behavior of those around you. Professor Anderson lectures for a majority of the course but is far from dry.",
    "If you are interested in norms of power and privilege, it's a great course!",
    "An immense amount of reading. The midterm and final are actually papers, not exams. Interesting material, to be sure, but a lot of work even if taken for credit."
