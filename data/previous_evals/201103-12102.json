   "comments": [
    "You have to take this class. First you must grasp this. The class was too large for the professor to handle and he couldnt find a TA so no homework was issued. It is painfully boring and met from 6-8 thursday night rather than the regularly scheduled time. Often this causes lots of conflicts. Also, the two tests are near impossible. The average on the midterm was a 55. So, in essence, this is a horribly run, yet important for the future class.",
    "it was just as bad as most other chemical engineering classes offered at yale. Professor has no interest in teaching, structure is disorganized, you come away from it feeling like you learned nothing. Don't recommend it.",
    "It's a class about control methods in chemical processes. Very practical and only semi-boring.",
    "If you are ABET Chem E you are taking this course, otherwise you'd prob be best staying away",
    "How to model a process' response to a change or disturbance in the system. I would not recommend it to someone who does not have to take it for the ChemE major...it's really boring...",
    "if you are taking it you probably have to.",
    "The course material is not too hard, but the once-a-week lecture format makes learning and remembering all the concepts tough. Do the homework, or at least know how to do it in preparation for the tests.",
    "Insist on a TA and do the problem sets well. The class is not hard with sufficient practice. Khalil is fairly laid back in class but writes difficult exams so be prepared. Review partial fraction expansions and laplace transforms and you will be set."
