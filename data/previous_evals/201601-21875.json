    "Take it! The credit doesn't count for anything, but a great way to get experience!",
    "MCDB 475 is a great way to spend more time in the lab. In my first two semesters in my lab, I didn't spend enough time, and therefore I didn't get a whole lot out of the experience. However, coming in to do research upwards of 10 hours a week was really great for me, as I was able to more fully dive into my research project. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, particularly in their junior year, as it's great to get a good handle on your research project at that time.",
    "good way to structure your research",
    "MCDB 475 is a great way to do lab research for credit. The only required assignments are the proposal at the start of the semester and the paper at the end of the semester, both of which are useful for your lab research anyway."
