    "Definitely, take it!!!!!!!!!",
    "Really easy class. Homeworks are like things you would do in high school (read an article and answer questions). Lecture was kind of boring--half the class never showed up. Mercedes is really kind and funny, I enjoyed her as a professor. The material is interesting--but sometimes it's pretty hard to 1. understand what Mercedes is saying (b\/c of her accent) and 2. figure out how what she's talking about relates to anything (we watched a lot of random videos and commercials, I have no idea why. The exams are open note, so it's easy to do well. To be honest, this class was a bit of a joke.",
    "Excellent class. Mercedes is the nicest professor ever and the material is also very interesting as you read case studies of real world business practices.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in ethics",
    "I would recommend this class because it is not a very hard class but you learn a lot about ethics. So it is not too stressful but you take away some valuable information.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It does not take a lot of time as compared to other courses. So, if you are looking for a nice course for your fifth credit this is the best option. The teacher is excellent and the material is interesting and entertaining.",
    "It is a class where you learn about corporate ethical decision-making from a case study perspective. Interesting material and I highly recommend it.",
    "This course was a general survey of philosophical traditions that can be applied to everyday professional lives. It could have been more in depth, but I definite have a keener understanding of all philosophers (and there were many!) and how philosophy seeps into every aspect of our lives because of it.Do not take it if you have taken DS as it will not go as much in depth as you'd like. Professor Carreras is a wonderful teacher and person. She's great. And you can ask her opinion on anything! Shop the class, at least, if you're interested. Workload is manageable.",
    "I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS COURSE TO ANOTHER STUDENT.",
    "The class is pretty easy but you have to do the weekly homework assignments that are just reading an article\/case study and answering questions about it that are directly in the reading. Basically just busy work. The midterm and exam are open note and very easy as long as you have decent notes. I enjoyed it and went to each class even though that's definitely not necessary. Easy class if you need a 5th.",
    "Take this class! Lectures can be a bit dry at times, but workload is very light.",
    "I loved this course! Even though people might say it is simple - I feel like I learned a lot, and was challenged to think critically about things I just took for granted before. Professor Carreras is such an inspiring and caring teacher who knows a lot about all the topics we discuss. The one lecture history of western philosophical thought she gave at the beginning of the semester was one of my favorites in my time at Yale.It was a pleasure to have her as a professor.",
    "A must take class at Yale.",
    "yes i would. good, functional real world class that makes you aware of important ethical dilemmas you will face in the real world.",
    "This is an amazing course. Professor Carreras is really nice and you learn a lot about ethics in the work place. There is a lot of work each week, but if you do the work you can learn a lot and will do well.",
    "i would not recommend it. i dont feel like i learned anything.",
    "This is a good class to take. It is easy but you learn a lot at the same time. It is a good class to take whether you like ethics or not.",
    "This is a pretty light and fun class. However, the lectures can sometimes go so off-topic that you might wonder what the course is all about: Professor Carreras often showed us movie clips and music pieces which, while fun to watch, were not what we ought to have been doing during a lecture. If you're looking for a mildly interesting class with a not-so-heavy workload, this one may work for you, but if you're interested in a serious analysis of the various ethical theories and their influences on practical ethical issues, perhaps you should take a moral philosophy class instead.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to other students who are looking for a course that is not too time consuming but that is also interesting."
