   "comments": [
    "Yes- its a great seminar option.",
    "I would only recommend it for a student who is really interested in saints and Catholic theology. While its benefits are immense for people interested in these areas, those who have difficulty placing themselves in the mindset of the religious middle ages would probably not get a lot out of it.",
    "Don't waste your time on this class.",
    "Fascinating, even to those not particularly interested in religion. We discussed several different topics, including saints\u2019 relics, the importance of gender and food to Medieval society, and the vitae (written lives or biographies) of saints. Ray Clemens is a humorous and friendly guy - take this course if only to get to know him! As a seminar, this class met once a week in the basement of Beinecke. Ray and Eileen would always check out manuscripts and books to show us, which added a great dimension to the physical historiographical aspect of the course. There were three smaller, 3-5 page papers throughout the semester and then a final paper of 5-10 pages. Ray was pretty laid back, something I didn\u2019t really expect from a seminar instructor. I would recommend this course even to non-history majors (there were several in my class), and especially to those interested in Christianity and\/or the Medieval period. Even if these aren\u2019t your interests, you\u2019re guaranteed to learn a lot and to enjoy doing it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone that has an interest in medieval history, the history of Christianity, and\/or in beautiful manuscripts. Honestly, I can't think of any reasons to not recommend this course."
