    "I would recommend this class for sure. It is a lot of work every day, but I think it's necessary for a language class to keep up your practice. Juliana is great, so enthusiastic and fun! I learned a lot and we covered an incredible amount of material in one semester.",
    "I highly recommend Juliana Ramos-Ruano.",
    "ME ENCANTA LA CLASE DE ESPA\u00d1OL. Es excelente. Te la recomiendo much\u00edsimo y sin duda si quieres hablar esta lengua.",
    "I would only recommend the course to students who are willing to put in a lot of time and effort into a foreign language course.",
    "There is more work for this language class, but if you keep on top of it and work hard you can do well. It is a great spanish course and the professor can make a difference in your overall enjoyment.",
    "I would TOTALLY recommend this class to a fellow student-- especially if you can get Juliana Ramos-Ruano! She is incredible and really creates an environment of learning and life where you automatically gain a passion for the beautiful language of Spanish.",
    "Spanish 120 is a basic, elementary-level Spanish course that presents grammar topics from the preterite\/imperfect tenses to the imperfect subjunctive tenses, vocabulary related to varying themes, and some cultural aspects of Spanish-speaking societies. Class sizes are fairly small, so there are many opportunities for interaction, and the material presented is very interesting. I would strongly recommend taking Spanish 120 with Juliana Ramos-Ruano, as she is very engaging and facilitates a very comfortable, interactive atmosphere in the classroom. She is also very helpful and will definitely help you work through any problems that you may have in the class.",
    "I would recommend this class. There was a lot of work but it was expected for a 1.5 credit course and there is an opportunity to learn a lot of Spanish.",
    "If your goal is to learn spanish this class will greatly increase your knowledge."
