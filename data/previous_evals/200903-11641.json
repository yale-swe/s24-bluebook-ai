    "I would definitely recommend it. You really become so much more comfortable and confident at giving speeches in front of a crowd, which is a very important skill to have. And you end up feeling totally prepared and eager to actually write your senior essay in the spring.",
    "Yes. This will restore your faith in WGSS (if it was ever in doubt) and make you comfortable with the fact that you're graduating, knowing you are prepared to present your thoughts to others in the real world.",
    "It's required for the major, but you should want to take it, too. It's a chance to organize your thoughts, increase your public speaking skills, and bond as a class. Don't just think of it as something you have to get through to graduate.",
    "Keeps you on track to finish your senior essay!",
    "This is a very laid-back class that will keep you working on your senior essay. It's entirely presentation-based - no written work at all, which is probably a mixed blessing. It really improved my public speaking and my level of comfort in front of an academic audience, though, so I'm really grateful for that.",
    "more fun than the junior seminar and less work."
