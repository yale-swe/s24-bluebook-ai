    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. This is a poorly taught class--it's not even really taught. What happens is: you watch a SmartPhysics lecture that runs for about 20 minutes online and do a couple \"checkpoint\" questions, then in class you have to be there for the clicker questions which can happen at the start, middle, or end of class, then you have discussion sessions which are unhelpful, then you have an online problem set, and then a paper problem set. The problems: Engineering students who already have a solid background in Physics will take this class because it's easier for them and then screw up the curve. In the small lecture class, the professor just does derivations that are IN the online lectures already; this leaves us being just as confused as before. The big lecture class is just a bunch of demos. The midterms are NOTHING like the ones that they post. Sure, one problem will be similar, but as you can see, the past tests (2011-2013) are more similar to each other than 2014. The online lecture is HORRENDOUS. The ideas are quickly brushed through, the derivations are too quick, and the lecture makes so many assumptions. The information that they tell us usually doesn't help much in solving the problems. THE TEACHING FELLOWS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING. I fortunately had one good TF for my discussion session, but the rest...One tried to convince us that kinetic friction was greater than static friction. The ones who write the paper problem sets can't even answer their own questions. And the TFs who help us with our paper problem sets never get the questions that their fellow TFs wrote right. They'll tell us that the answer is right and then when we get them back, the answer is incorrect. How do we even know if what we're learning is right? SmartPhysics is also a terrible program. It can't even read some strings correctly in the input field. During the midterms you can't even ask any questions which sucks because there is so much ambiguity in the wording. I really did not like this class, and I don't recommend it. This class puts Yale to shame. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Do not take this class unless you need it as a requirement.",
    "Enroll in the smaller section if you can, the Friday meeting time is worth it. Pretty standard as far as an intro physics class is gonna be, but if you took Physics C-M in high school you will be pretty comfortable will most of the material, although the weekly discussion section problems and written problem sets will still challenge you.",
    "Physics 180 is an introduction to classical physics, comparable to what one may encounter in an AP physics course in high school.",
    "If you have to take physics and want to get a good grade with not a lot of strenuous work, this is the class to take. It was a complete review of high school material. Doing prefecture and 3 homeworks per week took up time, but they weren't hard",
    "The way PHYS 180 is organized right now is horrible. It was incredibly frustrating to think that I am attending an elite university like Yale to learn introductory physics almost entirely from an online lecturing program. The actual lectures in class are hardly helpful and I felt like I missed nothing when I skipped them. The PSETS are ridiculous because they are extremely unclear and unnecessarily a lot harder than the exams. I took the section with Ramos, which is the smaller one (~45 students) that meets 3 times a week, and I enjoyed that because it was more of a classroom setting. The exams are pretty fair. So, don't take this class unless you have to. If you have a decent physics background, you will do well. The curve isn't that good though, so getting an A- or A will take some work.",
    "For premed, I would take 170.",
    "This is just like AP physics c : mechanics. I would recomend this course if you need to take it. We use smart physics and sometimes getting a handle on certain topics will be hard.",
    "i wouldn't recommend this class. it is a lot of work, a headache, and very frustrating",
    "PHYS 180 was what I expected from this level physics course, smartphysics sucks but you'll survive the boredom and come out with a pretty decent knowledge of introductory mechanics.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to",
    "Physics 180-02 was overall a decent experience. As far as introductory science classes go, I would say it is actually the best that I have taken so far (I have taken both Bio and Chem now). I liked the smaller size lecture teaching style of the class and also found the clicker questions to be a great source of immediate in-class feedback. Thus, if you have to take this class, I wouldn't dread it. It could have been a whole lot worse than it was, and I actually left the class feeling like I did have a better understanding of the way the world works.",
    "I would recommend this for those who prefer lectures over the interactive learning method used in physics 200.",
    "If you need to take the class, you should take the class, and you will probably be able to manage it, but you need to keep in mind that it will be difficult and stressful.",
    "I would say this course is very difficult. Especially if you did not take AP Physics in high school. Also I do not like the use of Smart Physics. For me the class would be better served if the Professor did the base lecturing.",
    "Similar to AP Physics B, but pretty much all online--which can be annoying if you prefer to be taught in class all these concepts. Class is not very math\/numbers based as much as conceptual. Not difficult, but you definitely need to stay on top of your work each week to do well (reinforced by smartphysics assignments).",
    "If you're a physics beginner, please don't take this course and opt for 170. If you're a seasoned physics student but fear the challenge of 200, take this course.",
    "This is a survey intro course for physics-- your basic science prereq.",
    "Definitely take Professor Ramos section. She is really good at explaining things and caters class to the students input from smartphysics. However, beware that the course is slightly disjointed. The written HW questions are written by the Sunday Session TAs so only they can help with the HW. The exams are written by the professors so doing the practice exams are the only way to study. Sometimes the clicker questions you do in class (with Ramos) appear as a conceptual question on the exams. I felt like smartphysics was a good way to learn physics but that the HW questions online were very different from the written HW and exams.",
    "I would not really recommend this class. It is much more difficult than it needs to be and the knowledge one receives is much less than the workload.",
    "Though the class is boring, if you keep up with the work in the class, you will do fine. As someone who never had a physics with calculus background, I felt that I couldn't really go more advanced than this class, even though it was pretty dry. Do the clicker questions, complete the online work on time, and do the practice exams. Go to the study halls that the TAs offer! That will help you get through the long problem sets.",
    "I would summarize PHYS 180 as a course that spans general physics topics. It is smaller assignments to improve comprehension, which is nice. I would recommend that someone take this course if interesting in engineering especially.",
    "PHYS 180 Is a poor example of a general physics course. I would not recommend this course to anyone as it is confusing, time consuming, and very against productive learning of physics.",
    "It's a lot of work and material, but you have to learn it somehow, and I think this course did a good job. Continuous assignments were annoying but ultimately helpful. Plus the actual physics you learn is cool.",
    "this is a good class that teaches all the basics of mechanical physics. the problem sets are kind of a pain because some TA's write ridiculously hard questions while other weeks the problems are very manageable",
    "In all honesty, physics 180-02 was my least favorite class this semester. I found the material dry, the problem sets difficult, the online homework tedious, and the lectures disengaging. But this is all most likely a result of the fact that I switched majors halfway through the semester and my general dislike of the topic. However if you must take it for your major, I thought Dr. Ramos' section is a good choice because hers tends to be smaller.",
    "lot of work on your own with smartPhysics",
    "Phys 180 is painful. Don't take this class unless you have prior physics experience because you do not want to play catch up in this class. I regret taking it.",
    "Okay so here's the rundown: if you can take PHYS 200 (and I mean you actually can) don't take this. The class is not well organized and if you really want to learn you'll have to do a lot of legwork on your own. It is better that PHYS 170 unless you're premed or into bio. Be prepared to not understand and find your own ways to do so. Smartphysics textbook not very helpful. Google is your friend."
