    "A very interesting introduction to some of the issues involved in jazz studies for musicians and cultural historians alike - each of whom can bring their own understanding to the class discussion. Some initial understanding of jazz vocabulary and musical structures, as well as racial and cultural politics in America in the 20th century wouldhelp students to get the most out of the readings, listenings and class discussions.",
    "The course introduces the historical periods or different styles of jazz in the twentieth century and covers several other critical topics. I would recommend the course to a student interested in jazz or ethnomusicology, but not as a means of preparing for comprehensive exams."

    "Although this course was not directly related to my research, a foundational understanding of American cultural, musical and racial politics is undoubtedly useful for pursuing a PhD in the USA!",
    "Although little of the course content specifically addressed my discipline (music theory) or served as preparation for comprehensive exams, it did provide important background and promising starting points for work along the lines of one of my main research interests, the study of music outside the traditional canon of European art music."
