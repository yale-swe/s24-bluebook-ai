    "If you are taking this, it is probably required. I preferred Professor Devoret's more practical approach to the subject over Scholkoef's more theoretical approach. But I think it is personal preference.",
    "This class is different than other electromagnetism classes in that it has a few demos and teaches transmission lines. The demonstrations were interesting, but not enough to pull the class through its slower moments, and transmission lines were less interesting than I was hoping they would be. Half the class is transmission lines, and the other half is Maxwell's equations and a general re-cap of introductory electricity and magnetism. This class gets a resounding so-so. If you don't have to take it, I recommend you pass it over.",
    "The homework, lecture, and tests are completely unrelated. The lecture moves SO slow. If you're ABET, you have to take it. Otherwise don't take it unless you LOVE physics.",
    "The lectures aren't great, so it is important to do reading and start problem sets early, but the class is fine if you keep this is mind.",
    "Yes",
    "Don't take it unless you have to for your major. You will learn very little."
