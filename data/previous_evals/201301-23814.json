    "If you take EDST 190, definitely take this 1\/2 credit component. You will be spending the same number of hours completing your observations for the seminar anyways, so it makes sense to get credit for your time spent in the classroom.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Just the mandatory observation part to the EDST 190 class. You learn a lot from going to a nearby high school and applying what you read and learn from the seminar to a real-world context.",
    "My favorite memories of the semester.",
    "This was an observation of a classroom for an hour a week, with about a half an hour optional discussion with the teacher. This is very exciting and interesting if you are interested in education or want to get an idea of education in New Haven.",
    "Yes! Great opportunity to get into a school and learn about the New Haven system.",
    "This is a weekly observation at a NHPS school--always interesting, and then you write reflections connecting what you saw to class readings.",
    "You get to observe a teacher in a New Haven Public School as often as you want. I visited 3-4 times this semester, and wish I had gone more, since it was really refreshing, considering the homework for all my other classes consisted of readings\/papers on theoretical topics. This was a splash of real world."
