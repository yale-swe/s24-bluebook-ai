   "comments": [
    "Mercedes is wonderful. She knows so much (is a lawyer, has a PhD, is a Duchess), and she imparts so much knowledge to her students. It's wonderful being taught from an expert. The class itself involves daily assignments, several debates, a midterm, and a final paper. Quite manageable, rewarding and good practice for keeping your Spanish up. Highly recommend.",
    "If your Spanish is great and you are just looking to gain knowledge in the area of legal theory or you simply want to boost your legal vocabulary in Spanish, take this course. If you are looking to brush up on your spoken Spanish or your conversational skills, this will not do the trick. If you are interested in legal reasoning, case precedent, or current events, again, this class is not for you.",
    "I would summarize it as a class in Spanish about the legal systems of Spanish-speaking countries (mostly Spain). I would also definitely recommend it to a fellow student -- the subject matter is interesting, the work is beyond manageable, the grading is super easy, and your Spanish will get much better! VAMANOS!!",
    "This is a great course! You will develop a new Spanish vocabulary set, and learn a lot about the legal systems of Spanish-speaking countries.",
    "Highly recommended",
    "If you can get in, absolutely take it.",
    "Great course if you are interested in practicing your Spanish or interested in law at all. I would highly recommend any course with Mercedes, especially this one."
