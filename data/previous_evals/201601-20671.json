   "comments": [
    "Expect to really analyze both broad interpretations and close readings of all of the books. I was impressed that the longer novels like Don Quixote and War and Peace were discussed very efficiently in class, a feat I didn't think possible.",
    "Yes, would recommend this course but it is not an absolute must-take. I think it's important for all thinking people to have a deep exposure to and appreciation for good literature. This course will absolutely give you great works to cultivate your literary skill, but there are also other courses at Yale that can do that for you as well.",
    "Take it if you're in the Ds program, and if you are looking for a less intense professor, I would argue that Hagens is a good professor where you can learn a lot and improve a lot, but also get good grades.",
    "If second semester DS Lit interests you, this class is great. You have to like the more modern western canon.",
    "DS spans centuries worth of literature, and this strength is its weakness. There is simply not enough time to devote to each work a fraction of what it needs, but if managed well, there in lies the goal and beauty of the course. By the end, I have several works I will come back to later on, for there is something there I wish to reread and gain beyond the survey of the course. Most frustrating is the inability to complete all the readings, or at least to read them well; to do this, you have to prioritize Lit above Phil and H\/P, at least in my experience. Professor Hagens is responsive to the class and is very helpful throughout the paper process; the biweekly responses allow for added engagement with the texts.",
    "Would definitely recommend!",
    "Great course, great faculty, great community. DS is painful, and you'll learn only as much as you commit; but you won't find anything like it elsewhere in Yale--you'll regret not taking DS."
