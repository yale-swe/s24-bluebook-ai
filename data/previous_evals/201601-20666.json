    "Although BIOL 103 is a mandatory course, I would definitely NOT recommend taking this class with Weimin Zhong. Wait until the fall and take it with a different professor. The subject material is very interesting and extremely relevant if you are interested in biology research, but this class was extremely poorly taught. Although it is conceptually not that difficult, the material is presented in a very confusing way that makes it unnecessarily challenging to learn.",
    "Have fun. It's gonna be a blast. Jk. Bio 103, like the other modules, is going to be something you have to trudge through. Just suck it up, and pray you get lucky on true\/false questions.",
    "You are taking 103 because you have to. It will help you appreciate the organization of the other modules.",
    "The class is a pre-req. If you are taking it, you probably had to, like I did. Its not the worst thing in the world, but it isn't going to be pleasant. Just grind your teeth and get through it.",
    "By BIOL 103, the (now disenchanted) prospective Yale biology student already knows that the introductory biology sequence is one of the most poorly-taught and ill-designed programs at the university, but BIOL 103 brings the sequence to a new low. It was the worst class that I have ever taken. Hard as I tried, I found it impossible to effectively learn anything in lecture. Zhong is a good man, but not a good teacher. Take this class if you must, but be warned that it is atrocious. You do not learn biology in a logical, linear manner, but through incomprehensible scientific diagrams, using jargon that is often never explained. It is not only hard but it is massively boring, and you never know what you are supposed to be learning. I found myself desperately wishing that someone would just teach me biology already. Most of the things that I learned, I learned from Wikipedia. It is a disgrace of a class and a blight to Yale's academic reputation, and I would avoid it if at all possible. But if you are one of the many students forced to go through it, good luck. You'll need it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH ZHONG IF YOU ARE NOT A PRE-MED. To other pre-med students out there, I am deeply sorry.",
    "It was an interesting course, but definitely the most difficult module so far.",
    "If you have to take it, otherwise do other biology courses.",
    "I hated the way the class was taught. Professor Zhong was horrible at explaining what was going on in his slides, and if a student stated that he or she did not understand how the Professor had described something, Professor Zhong would merely repeat what he said word for word and not provide any clarity. Using Piazza and googling paper abstracts was the only way to get through the class and understand the material. Overall, however, I did learn a lot about how to conduct experiments, but I wish the class had been taught better. Weekly quizzes were horrible! I spent 3-4 hours studying for each one and Professor Zhong would ask ridiculous trick questions that you could get wrong even if you knew the material well.",
    "This was probably the worst of the four modules. Professor Zhong is not a clear lecturer and often jumps over complex topics that require a LOT more explanation. His slides are unclear and make it very hard to study. The textbook readings are barely related to what's covered in lecture, and the quizzes can be very hard because no one knows what to study for. I am really counting on a curve to help me out in this class because otherwise I am going to fail (and judging from the averages on the quizzes, so is everyone else). Unless the structure and teaching style of this course is drastically changed for next time, I would wait and take it with another instructor.",
    "BIOL 103 is a challenging class. It was taught better than 102, but sometimes the questions and answers from class and especially on the quizzes\/exam are worded in a vague way that leads to confusion about how we're supposed to answer and what information they're looking for.",
    "The topic is not the most interesting topic, and each class passes by pretty slowly but the whole course went by very fast. The quizzes are hard but focus on more broad concepts. I would recommend it if you are interested in embryology and development or need to fulfill requirements.",
    "Only take this if you have to - the material is interesting but I honestly thought that this amount I learned was not worth the stress and work it required to make up for a bad lecturer and confusing lectures.",
    "Overall, it was an incredibly unorganized and punitive course. I went into the 103 module wanting to major in some field of biology having loved 101 and 102, although 103 made me hate the subject for a number of reasons. The material in the lecture slides was esoteric and repetitive, and never clearly presented. The exams and quizzes were loaded with \"trick\" questions that did not assess how well one knew the material, but rather how well one was at taking the exam. The format of the class in the form of weekly quizzes with no other exposure to the material in a testing format left the students confused and frustrated. The closest thing we ever had to preparation for an assessment was the 3 problem Pset given at the end of the module which did not accurately reflect the material on the exam. The lecture slides did not present the information clearly, and the textbook readings often had minimal overlap with the lecture. Many other students and I left the course unclear what we had even learned over the course of the module, a stark contrast to 101 and 102.",
    "If you don't have to take this class, don't. If you do, make sure to keep up with the material and utilize piazza.",
    "Dear Student, If you're reading this evaluation, it means that I have survived the horrors of what was BIOL 103. It also probably means that I am suffering extensive PTSD from being in that class. But for real, if you're reading this eval, it probably means that you don't really have a choice in taking this class. However, IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TAKING THIS CLASS FOR FUN, DO NOT DO IT. IT SUCKS ALL THE FUN OUT OF GENETICS AND DEVELOPMENT. Professor Zhong seems cool in the first lecture, but after having to endure 1\/2 a semester in his class, I can honestly say that 103 was the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. I never thought I would experience such a horrendous academic experience, but then I walked through the doors of 103 and got completely slaughtered. Professor Zhong never explains anything clearly and his quizzes are so subjectively worded and tested on the most obscure of things that the averages on all the quizzes were around 60. The outline, quizzes, tests, and organization of this class are so utterly horrendous that it sucks all the fun out of genetics and development. The content of the class focuses so much on mechanisms, experimental methods, and details - THAT THE PROFESSOR NEVER EVEN TESTS US ON - that you never actually get the \"big picture\" of what development is, in what steps it occurs, and what actually happens. I feel like I learned nothing from this class and suffered immensely trying to learn experimental details and complicated pathways that were never tested on. The quizzes were worded so subjectively that you could completely understand a concept 100000% but because of the wording, not get any points for it. When confronted with these issues, Professor Zhong didn't even acknowledge that anything was wrong and that his method of asking questions\/writing the quizzes were right, EVEN AMIDST DISAGREEMENTS WITH NUMEROUS TAs AND THE PEER TUTOR. Professor Zhong never makes himself available and is unapologetic and apathetic to the students. His presence is rare on Piazza, and even when he is on, he offers little to no insight on any topics. Overall, this is one of the worst classes I have ever taken at Yale, and I am severely disappointed with the entire \"intro\" (what a joke) biology sequence. You should only consider taking the intro sequence if 1) you are already diehard MCDB major; 2) already have biological research experience. If not, you will struggle immensely. This is the most cutthroat class I've ever had here, and it's been the most soul sucking. I feel like I'm suffering from PTSD from being in this class.",
    "BIOL 103 is exactly what you'd expect. It's a solid introduction to genetics and developmental biology. It's a prereq for pretty much everything, and it's worth the time. Its full of information that you should know as a foundation for biology.",
    "BIOL 103 is a fantastic course if you are interested in pursuing a career or research in genetics and\/or development, and if you aren't just doing it as a requirement. It will be tough though, so you have to be prepared to think critically under time pressure and wrestle with somewhat complicated concepts.",
    "It's great, and the curve is harsher than in 101-102. You won't enjoy it, but you likely don't have a choice about taking this class. The quizzes are harder than you might think, so study hard for them.",
    "BIOL 103 is quite the ride. The quizzes are (for the most part) fair. The readings are helpful, but not necessary by any means. In fact, they often contain more information than is necessary or do not exactly overlap with what is covered in lecture. The quizzes are based solely on material from lecture, so focus on understanding the material presented on the powerpoints and really understanding the concepts (conceptualizing is key in this course) in addition to memorizing new terms underlined in red. Professor Zhong isn't very receptive to receiving questions, unlike Professors Koelle and Mooseker in BIOL 101-102, so don't be surprised if you find yourself waving your hand helplessly in class after completely failing to understand a slide (or more). Piazza is often slower and less effective (that is, questions are answered quite indirectly) than in my experiences in the other 2 modules. The problem sets are also different from 101-102, and instructions are vague sometimes, but Surjit gives out extra details or \"tips\" on a weekly basis to help guide students in this, which is great. Otherwise, I think the problem sets would be a lot more difficult in terms of figuring out what is expected. That being said, the class does teach you to think differently, and it is a necessary evil for pre-meds and some STEM majors, so good luck and make the best of it. The sooner you adapt to Professor Zhong's teaching style, the faster you will begin to see yourself progressing in this class.",
    "Bio 103 covers very interesting material that helps excite students, especially pre-medical students, to purse the sciences. The class also effectively teaches the student how to perform his or her own research.",
    "While this wasn't my least favorite module of the Intro Bio sequence, it was definitely the most stressful and, in my opinion, difficult. Professor Zhong zooms through concepts and the weekly quizzes expect a level of concept mastery that is incredibly difficult to achieve within the same week of learning the material. Be prepared to feel pretty overwhelmed unless you have hours and hours to put in outside of class.",
    "Bio 103 is probably the hardest of the four modules. I recommend putting in the time and effort to study outside of class and review the notes before lectures. Take advantage of Piazza if there is anything you are uncertain of.",
    "Learning development in the hardest way possible, but getting to write a cool research proposal if you put your mind to it.",
    "Don't take if you don't have to.",
    "The bio sequence as I have experienced it takes an approach that, for the most part, very constructively requires students to re-orient their thinking towards an experimental methods, and how we know what we know about biological systems, not just what we know. This was challenging but fulfilling for me in 101\/102, but 103 was a deep disappointment. Lectures were unclear and slides were misleading in the way they were constructed, making clarification even more difficult. The answers to class exercises were never clearly stated, let alone explained, and in the rare instance that someone asked a question, Professor Zhong didnt seem to make an effort to conceptualize where the confusion came from in fact, he responded quite condescendingly. The quiz format was consistent, but the content of questions was the opposite of what most professors strive for: confusing grammar made questions difficult to understand, and trick questions made very rushed 15 minute questions into a battle of semantics. Professor Zhong assured us that he was challenging us now but would curve up the class later. I did ALL of the textbook reading and used piazza, but found the quizzes incredibly difficult. Curving up our grade is all well and good, but I would much rather him teach us in a way that facilitated our understanding. Discussion sections did very little to clarify lecture topics. For me, and I think for many other students, the papers were not particularly helpful given a basic confusion with the material as presented in lecture. There is a point at which material is presented in such a way that looking at its application in a scientific paper is more confusing than clarifying. That was the status quo in 103. Rather than being a tool for clarifying nuances, Piazza became a secondary lecture in which large groups of people regularly scrounged for an understanding of basic concepts not sufficiently presented in class. I was very surprised to hear that some people after taking 101\/102 decided to take different classes (evolutionary biology, physiology, etc.) instead of finishing the bio sequence. But having had this experience in 103, I would have certainly done the same as they did. While the bio sequence may be geared somewhat towards MCAT preparation, I would much rather take a different course if it would be a better learning experience. I appreciate that Professor Zhong wants to make this class challenging for us. I welcome that in principle. I benefitted greatly from such motivation in 101 and 102. However, his methods made the learning process frustrating rather than engaging. Before taking this course, genetics and development interested me the most of all the material covered by the bio sequence. Its a shame that they were made into the subject of game-the-student rather than a fulfilling scholarly challenge.",
    "This is such a crap course. The slides are confusing, the lectures are dry and the quizzes are unfair. Like, seriously, science doesn't matter in this class - the only thing that matters is the Zhong's opinion on stuff. For that reason, this class should be a HU credit.",
    "Well, it's mandated by Yale for biology students and impossible to place out of because Yale doesn't understand its students, so I won't bother talking about how horrible and boring it is.",
    "Hell. This class is hell. Can you take it with Vivian Irish in the fall? Do that! Oh please prospective student, save yourself from the mental torment that is Weimin Zhong! I really cannot even conceptualize how pointless and horribly taught this course was. The textbook is completely unhelpful. The readings are not helpful either. The TFs have no idea what the hell Zhong is saying so even your cries for help on Piazza go unanswered. He made me really miss Mark Mooseker. You heard me right. I would sit in lecture dreaming about the days where I at least understood that I needed to memorize every aspect of some obscure biological pathway and then demonstrate that I could come up with an experimental protocol that demonstrates their existence. With Zhong no such clear path to success exists. Think you've memorized his slides? You haven't. He'll come up with wackiest way of testing the \"concept\" (whatever that means) he could possibly imagine. Example: \"In the sequence A B C D E F, you take out A and you don't get B C D E or F. What does that mean? Okay, now you put A after B C, you get BCABC. What does that mean?\" That's an easy question. This isn't to say that Zhong is boring or disengaged. In fact, he is VERY enthusiastic about quizzing you in the most nonsensical way you could possibly imagine. Be prepared to hear the the phrase \"I'm having fun with you guys!\" over, and over. By the end of this course you will never want to have fun again.",
    "Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to (pre-med, bio major, etc). You will have to learn a lot of information, but at the same time, you won't really feel prepared for tests\/quizzes. Lectures were at times vague and disorganized, and even though I put a lot of time into studying for the weekly quizzes, I never really felt that my grades correlated with how hard I had been working. If you do have to take this class, definitely take advantage of the TAs and peer tutors - you will probably not understand a lot of the things presented in lecture, but these people will help fill in some of those gaps.",
    "I would definitely recommend BIOL 103, but only for students who are genuinely interested in genetics and development. The material was complicated and they expect much more out of you (indicated by the research proposal), but if you put in the time and effort, it will be worth it.",
    "Intro bio sequence, lots of work, final project, good class, learn a bit.",
    "The quizzes are a nightmare to interpret but the material is interesting.",
    "BIOL 103 with Professor Zhong was by far my least favorite module. It's poorly taught and he overly complicates simple information.",
    "Be ready to do a lot of work and not understand a lot.",
    "I would take it if you need it as a prerequisite. I did end up learning a lot, but due to some disorganization and confusing lecture slides, I had to spend a lot of time figuring out what to study.",
    "A truly horrible class that gave me anxiety attacks every week. Very poorly taught, sorry to anyone who has to take it. Made me regret being pre-med.",
    "Palm to spend a lot of time studying for weekly quizzes. Don't skip over any details in the slides.",
    "This course was hard compared to 101 and 102. The quizzes are difficult and there's a lot of information.",
    "Great introduction to genetics and development",
    "Every time you think you have it right, you're wrong.",
    "Decent class, not especially well taught but the material is interesting. Don't take it if you don't need to.",
    "BIOL 103 is a reasonably demanding course which covers a broad set of topics, many of which will be a re-hash for some but still present new dimension or a level of understanding that isn't encountered often in high school. It is definitely a worthy addition to the biology modules, and shouldn't be missed by those seeking a complete experience in introductory biology.",
    "This class was pretty difficult. I wouldn't recommend it unless it is required for a major. However, while the material was hard to understand, I felt that what I did learn was pretty interesting.",
    "Only take if you have to.",
    "You will probably have to take this course if you are a bio major or premed. If you aren't, or if you can place out of this class, don't take it. You'll have to teach yourself a lot of the material, and the quizz\/exam questions are often arbitrary or ambiguous. It gets better in 104.",
    "This class is on the right track, but could definitely be far better. What's nice about it is that it teaches the content through the lens of experimental findings, so you really have to start thinking like a scientist. However, Dr. Zhong's lectures were very unclear in their message and logical progression, and his quizzes were at times unfair. He did not seem to resonate with the concerns of students just trying to be rewarded with a good grade for their hard work. Take it if you have to, but don't be overexcited about doing so.",
    "Go through the slides, don't get stuck on details. For example, it's a waste of time to memorize pathways. If you come into this class with 1) some knowledge of the scientific process 2) exposure to biomedical research and\/or 3) an interest in biology, you are honestly good to go. Easier than BIOL 102. Use the process of distinguishing topics that matter from topics that do not matter to study. Do not be intimidated by the nebulous class expectations, and don't complain when you are (finally) confronted with a professor who doesn't coddle you with perfectly digested tidbits of knowledge.",
    "You should not feel bad about taking this class. You will learn a ton about genetics, most of which will be useful in higher level classes. You will become comfortable with common genetic experiments and terms. However, be prepared to study a decent amount.",
    "The class is challenging but interesting.",
    "Only take it if you have to. Or, take it CR\/D\/F.",
    "I would not recommend Biol 103 and think its unfortunate that it is a required course. You will hate the quizzes no matter how interesting you think the material is.",
    "BIOL 103 covers a lot of ground for a half-semester course. Overall, you will learn a lot, but it's a lot of studying.",
    "In all honesty, I would summarize BIOL 103 as a class that is very hard to do well in not only because of the depth of the material, but because of the way it is presented, tested, and graded. I would not recommend this class to anyone because I was very unhappy with lectures, assignments, readings, and modes of assessment. In high school, I had an awful biology teacher who read off a powerpoint, yet still came away loving biology. In contrast, I have hated all of the introductory biology sequences at Yale. Were I not completely sure of my wish to go into a field in biology, I would have dropped this class after half of the first lecture of EACH MODULE (except 104 which is currently fine). BIOL 103 is by far the worst module of all the modules of introductory biology, each of which I disliked. Grading is unfair, material is esoteric and ambiguous, and lectures are almost painful. The remodeling of the introductory biology sequence is absolutely necessary.",
    "Very interesting material, and professor Zhong is pretty engaging. We cover so much and he goes pretty fast so it can be very confusing at times... Enrichment sessions help a lot if you are struggling to understand the material. Quizzes are hard because it is hard to predict what you need to know, but the final is pretty fair.",
    "I would recommend Biology 103 to any student looking for a course on genetics, because the course is very informational and provides the necessary information to gain some background in the field.",
    "The worst thing",
    "If you don't have to take it, you shouldn't. Genetics in my opinion is very interesting, but this class is not what I had in mind. I was excited for this module and was deeply disappointed.",
    "It is what you would expect. Pretty interesting, but a bit of a slog at times.",
    "Bio 103 covers fascinating topics, but the way in which it is taught makes it hard to get engaged and comprehend the material.",
    "It was looking at big picture stuff",
    "I wouldn't take this course unless you had to or unless it gets better. As of now it seems like lectures and exams don't match up and many quiz questions are much more difficult than anything presented in lecture. Additionally, the course readings from the textbook diverge from the course material pretty early on and it makes reading feel pointless. There are 5 quizzes, 5 psets that take the form of writing a research proposal, and a final. If you have to take this class, just get ready to study a lot because you definitely need to if you want to do well. The course material is actually really interesting, the class itself just takes a lot of work.",
    "I would only take this course if you have to (if you are premed or you need it for your major) Out of the 4 modules, I would say 104 is the best followed by 101, then comes 103 and lastly 102.",
    "This was definitely my least favorite of the bio modules so far, mostly because the material was presented in a confusing way and the quizzes were structured to purposely trick you. This had a lot to do with the professor, so if you have the freedom to plan it out, I would very much recommend taking it with someone other than Professor Zhong. I put a lot of work into this class, but ultimately, as my TA put it, your success largely depended on how well you read the professor's mind and whether you interpreted his true\/false questions correctly (because there were frequently ambiguous true\/false questions, if that's any indication of how this class worked).",
    "This is a thorough course on genetics and developmental biology. A lot of material is covered, and I would recommend taking it if you're interested in pursuing studies in this area - there's a lot of really cool research that you will cover!",
    "I would simply because I love the subject and its a requirement."
