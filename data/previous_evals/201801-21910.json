    "I learned about importance Christological controversies, Imperial Christianity, and key persons and events of LA Christianity.",
    "I gained a much greater facility with the primary literature around various topics concerning Christianity in LA. I also learned a variety of disciplinary acronyms I had not yet encountered, while establishing meaningful relationships--professional and amicable-- with fellow students. Finally, I have been able to use the bibliography assignments to construct a reading list of texts I need to read.",
    "I appreciated the engagement with theoretical material, and felt that this has really been lacking elsewhere in the AC requirements. I also really appreciated the format."

   "comments": [
    "Some reports were better than others, which made learning and deep engagement somewhat lopsided. Perhaps more concrete specifications on the major report assignment would be helpful in this regard.",
    "The biggest weakness of the course, in my opinion, was that it was too big and had too many people from outside the Ancient Christianity program. This meant that discussions were often not at the level they could have been, in-class presentations were not as strong because there wasnt background knowledge of this material, and major reports were of varying quality. Having a class session split between two major reports didnt work, and should not be continued in the future. I think the enrollment needs to be limited to students with serious background in the material (this could still include students outside the AC cohort), and numbers need to be kept down so that everyone gets a full class period for the presentation. I do think the course is organized well, and when discussions were good they were incredibly productive. Maria is a fantastic instructor, as well"

   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wanted a more challenging class on Christianity in Late Antiquity. It gave me the chance to encounter readings that I had intended to read, engage in a new level of scholarship, and improve my knowledge. It was a very challenging class, but I would recommend it to others.",
    "Yes, the theoretical work done at the beginning of the semester is a great way to set up engaging with the rest of the material throughout the course. I was unfamiliar with much of the theory and was a bit apprehensive, but I am very glad to have had the course set up in this manner. Dr. Doerfler always presents a class in which all voices felt validated and welcomed.",
    "Yes! I thought it was a good way of getting into late antiquity as a scholarly field and also covering the major areas we would need to know."
