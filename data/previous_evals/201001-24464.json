   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it to someone interested in colonial history, theater or international studies and literature.",
    "yes. great class.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to read things you'd probably never find anywhere else. you'll learn a lot about the culture and history of the countries from which the plays come. the papers are reasonable, and he provides good topics to chose from. there are about 5 or 6 guest \"lecturers\" who come to talk about the plays, which are all really excellent. it was a great experience.",
    "This class focuses on Anglophone drama from outside the U.S. and Britain; it emphasizes breadth more than depth. I would recommend the class: it introduced me to unfamiliar playwrights (and political questions). A few of the plays were duds, but most were enjoyable, speedy reading. Professor Biggs has a sharp wit and leads consistently engaging discussions. Several guest speakers brought additional vibrancy and expertise throughout the semester.",
    "Yes for a ThSt major looking for exposure to different sorts of drama.",
    "An enjoyable class with texts that probably will not be covered in other classes. I would without a doubt recommend this class,or any of Biggs' class to another student. There is no way anyone would regret it.",
    "Yes, it's fun, interesting, and not too much work.",
    "Amazing course! Definitely take, especially if you are interested in how art and politics collide.",
    "A class on often flawed, occasionally fascinating plays that you probably will not read or see otherwise. I would recommend this class to a student only if they are more interested in learning more about the countries studied than discussing theater.",
    "Definitely take it, or some other class with Professor Biggs. He rocks.",
    "This class is a great introduction to a very different kind of literature. Not much reading (just a couple plays a week) and all enjoyable. Three papers, one group presentation. Very tough grader. Might be a good candidate for the one cr\/d English class that majors get.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone looking for excellent discussion on what will be, in most if not all cases, completely unfamiliar works. A hugely welcome escape from the Dead White Male reading lists of which Yale is so fond, Commonwealth of Drama is a pretty ideal course."
