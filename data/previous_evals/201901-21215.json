    "This class is more focused on teaching the skills of writing research papers than on actual Materials Science. While I learned some basic methods of measurement and usage of research tools for materials, all the theoretical knowledge is repeated from MENG 285.",
    "I gained some really practical and relevant material science knowledge related to engineering. Also got some practical lab experience with regards to using a wide variety of testing equipment.",
    "Knowledge of materials science and laboratory methods - better grasp of how materials are characterized and why that matters.",
    "Conducting experiments. Writing a lab report. Presenting research. Being able to sustain an attention span for 4 hours."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures were fairly redundant for those who have already taken mat sci, and the writing off lab reports is redundant with fluids lab. My suggestion would be to just fold this into the regular mat sci class.",
    "The class did provide a somewhat realistic sense of writing and revision of a research paper. Perhaps its greatest weakness is the disorganization in data collection, making the paper itself somewhat difficult to structure. The lectures were not too interesting, but the labs themselves did provide the experience that I expected.",
    "I thought that the workload was reasonable and I think I learned what I was meant to learn. It would have been nice to have a little more support with the big lab report in the middle - maybe if we could've had TA appointments to talk through what we were doing and how to improve somewhere in the middle of the process (before and after meeting with the professor, maybe?). The thing that was really weird to me about this course was trying to make a story out of the labs we were doing when it seemed like the labs were kind of just a mish mosh of introductory materials science stuff, which by no means was new and cutting edge. for that reason, when doing the report and presentation I was always really confused because it seemed like our whole report could've been background, but we had to choose some stuff to pretend was new and exiting. For that reason I couldn't always see how what we were learning applied to what we would actually do in the real world. But, I still feel like my communication skills in general in writing and presenting improved - Prof. Schroers seems to know a lot about how to communicate well and he's good at passing that along to his students.",
    "Labs were a little boring at times with a lot of waiting around because instruments were limited and each group had to use each instrument for the different steps in the labs. However, because the amount of time each \"station\" took varied, sometimes groups were left with nothing to do."

   "comments": [
    "Super smooth lab, only one paper that you write with a partner and the \"lectures\" were very similar to his in his material science class.",
    "Not the worst MechE class.",
    "If you are looking for a course on Materials, then take MENG 285. If you have to take this class, take it after MENG 285, as the paper will be very difficult to write without that background.",
    "Definitely. I felt I learned a lot with just a few lectures and labs, and all the material we covered was the most important\/relevant material science material related to engineering.",
    "I would recommend this course because I thought the labs were really enjoyable and I learned some good stuff about scientific writing and presentation. I do have a lot of interest in materials science on it's own, so maybe that's swaying my opinion, but I thought this was a really enjoyable and good class. Professor Schroers is great and a really nice person. The TA's were really nice too.",
    "It's a reasonable lab to take if you want to learn how to conduct mechanical engineering research or solidify concepts regarding statics and material science."
