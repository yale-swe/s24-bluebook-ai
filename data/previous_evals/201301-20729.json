   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to all students. Undergrads don't be scared or discouraged! This class is very different from all of your other classes but really great!",
    "Highly recommended. If you like building things, or if you need this for research in the physical sciences, this is a must. Plus you get a souvenir for having completed the class.",
    "Will give you a solid basic understanding of lathes and milling machines and an appreciation of what you might be able to do with more training.",
    "The course teaches you the basics of using mills, lathes, and other machines. The entire class is dedicated to making a model steam engine. Each weekyou make a part or two of increasing complexity. Dave walks you through step by step in the beginning, but by the end you should be able to figure out how to make most pieces by yourself. He is always there to consult of course if you need help. When the class is over, you get to keep the steam engine you worked so hard on and it is very satisfying.",
    "This course provides a great general introduction to some of the machines in the machine shop. You learn how to cut and shape a few different types of metal. All the pieces you build throughout the semester are then used to construct a small steam engine. The class is a great break from the usual grind of courses and labs at Yale. I always looked forward to spending my time up in the machine shop.",
    "This is one of the best courses at Yale! You will learn incredibly useful skills and enjoy yourself at the same time.",
    "YES. TAKE IT. One of the rare classes at Yale that you actually get to build something with your hands and not type in front of a computer. Very cathartic and nice for a change in this predominantly academically focused institution."
