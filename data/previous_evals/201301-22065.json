   "comments": [
    "Overall it's fine I'm glad I took it. The research paper and the end of the course on human evolution were may favorite parts",
    "This is a great class that I would recommend taking to another student. The material is really interesting and important. The professors are funny and nice.",
    "The material is obviously interesting, but in the process of covering the breadth of the field, we sacrificed a lot of depth. Moran and Donoghue are good professors in their own right, but Donoghue's sudden medical leave left the focus of the class even more disoriented. Also, don't forget about the paper at the end of the semester.",
    "Good class. First half was microevolution, second half was macroevolution. Very much a survey course. Workload is manageable and PSETs are not too difficult.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone planning to study biology or medicine, or even who is looking for an interesting way of understanding the natural world. I truly consider it irresponsible to study the natural sciences without evolutionary biology, and think it generally enhances any outlook of the world. Take it Credit\/D if you're a non-major or just want to enjoy learning about something incredibly enchanting without worrying about how you'll do.",
    "It is a broad survey of evolutionary biology. If you are looking for a fun and informative EEB course, I would recommend something more specific, so you can finish the course feeling as though you are knowledgeable about some subject. Otherwise, I couldn't imagine taking this course for any other reason besides for a major requirement.",
    "For some reason Prof. Moran gets less than stellar reviews, but I think she does a great job. If you are interested, this is a good class. One annoyance for me was the style of exam - 20 or 30 short answer questions on specifics, not any major concepts, which didn't really match the focus of the lectures. On the other hand, maybe I just didn't study enough. Our semester was a bit weird because Prof. Donoghue had a medical emergency during the term and had to have Prof. Moran and guest lecturers fill in his time with other topics, but the lectures he did give were very good. The course work load consists of a midterm, a non-cumulative final, a 10-page paper on an evolutionary topic related to humans (a bit random), a few easy problem sets, and weekly papers to read for discussion section.",
    "This class was pretty interesting, although a lot of it was a repeat of the old E&EB intro class. Professor Moran was not a very interesting lecturer, although she really knew her stuff. Professor Donoghue was a great lecturer. It is a decent class, although I wouldn't necessarily take it if it's not required because there are better science classes.",
    "Really good course. Both professors were really passionate about their work, and very approachable. The readings were interesting, but I barely opened my textbook.",
    "I would recommend this course. It gives you a great foundation in micro and macro evolution.",
    "A decent course, but deceptively math-centered for the first half of the course. The second half is quite enjoyable. The work isn't too bad, and it was nice the final was not cumulative.",
    "It's a straight-forward science class with a fair grading scheme and a supremely interesting subject matter. If you're taking it, it's probably required for your major. Nevertheless, it represents a legitimately challenging science class that operates on a decently low level of complexity",
    "This class is very interesting and easy to follow even if you have only basic prerequisite knowledge of biology. The instructors are both knowledgable and stars in their field. Take it if you're interested in the topic, but probably not to fill out your schedule with a \"fun\" class."
