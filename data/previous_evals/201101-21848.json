    "I always looked forward to taking this lab. There is little outside work and the work you do in lab is enjoyable, even though it may be tiring at first because you need to cover so many plants in one sitting. Plus, once you go to angiosperms, you start eating a lot of fruits. We also went to 2 field trips, one to West Rock and one to the NY Botanical Gardens in the Bronx. Wendy was incredibly helpful, energetic, and enthusiastic in lab. The people who work at Marsh botanical gardens (lab is in the greenhouse) are great too. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this class with some reservations. If you want to take it, be ready to memorize lots of of latin names for little or no benefit. Otherwise, the material was fascinating and useful.",
    "It was extremely helpful for tests in the 246 class, and it was fun. I am definitely not an artist but drawing plants all day was relaxing and a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend this lab, especially if you are taking the class that goes with it.",
    "The laboratory is definitely worth taking (especially if you're in the lecture class). Observing, dissecting, and even tasting the plants we study is the only way to truly get a grasp of the diversity of plants. While the course covers a lot of material, the exams and quizzes are manageable.",
    "It's the best lab you can take at Yale! There are no reports, all you do is sit in a greenhouse for three hours every week and draw plants. The grading is very generous, and the professors are extremely interested and well-informed with their topic."
