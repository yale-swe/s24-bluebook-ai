   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to someone looking for a class in which they could quickly gain language skills as well as explore cultural areas of interest.",
    "FREN 121 uses the French in Action system (also used in FREN 110 and 120) to prepare you for the L3 level. We also read Francophone literature in class. There is a lot of work and time commitment involved, but you definitely learn a lot over the semester if you put in the work. Mme Skorupa is one of the best professors I've had at Yale - try to take this class with her if you can. She makes the class fun and energetic and the learning process that much more enjoyable. Grading isn't that harsh and the learning isn't too difficult if you put in the work.",
    "No matter where you're starting from, this course will bring you up to speed in your verbal and written skills. If you know a little French and want to pursue French further at Yale, or even just want to have the ability to engage in basic conversation, I would recommend this class.",
    "As you get into the semester, it will come to mean an hour to two hours of French homework each day. I'd recommend the class because this is Yale, they know what they're doing with their French program, and it works.",
    "If you want to take French, you should\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you MUST... take it with Professor Skorupa. She is one of the most talented teachers I have ever seen (I am a foreign language major). In this course you will be using \"French in Action\" book which is an amazing resource for studying French. If you put some effort in this class, you will be amazed at your progress! I enjoyed every single day of the class. No doubt---take it!",
    "This was my favorite class of the semester. It is definitely difficult, but all of the work is for something. The method works and you will leave speaking and writing in French better than when you entered. If you put in the time this class requires then you will se results. It was also a fun class with lots of different methods and activities to keep it interesting.",
    "French 121 is a hard class, however if you choose to take it you will undoubtedly reap the rewards. My written and spoken French has improved considerably as a result of this class. I would definitely recommend it."
