    "I would highly recommend, because you learn not only the findings in the literature and the tools of the trade, but also learn how to critically evaluate the claims and their applicability to the real world.",

    "I would recommend MGMT 758 to a student who has NO background in behavioral economics. For someone who has taken classes in BE before, it can be a bit repetitive. However, the lectures are engaging and fun, and the material is interesting. Warning: The grading is a bit hard to get a handle on, as there are very few graded assignments, and they are not returned until it is far too late to use them to improve. They are graded very harshly, without too much feedback. I do not know how I did on the final project (not having yet seen my grade), but it is hard to tell how you are doing in the class until it is over.",
