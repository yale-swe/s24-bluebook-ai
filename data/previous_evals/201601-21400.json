    "It moves fast, but is still manageable. Be ready to teach yourself large portions of the material, and study for the final carefully.",
    "A fairly straight-forward math class, that moves quickly (as a lot is covered in one semester) but is taught well. Possible for all with proper time management and effort.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are very motivated to take calculus to another step. The concepts are difficult and abstract and it requires a lot of dedication and hard work and patience to do well in this course. The topics are very interesting!",
    "Only take this class if you absolutely need it for your major. Otherwise, don't do this to your poor self.",
    "Math 120 is a problem set every week and two midterms and a final. The world load gets progressively harder as the course moves on. The grading is brutal though, and 90 percent of your grade is based on two midterms and a final.",
    "Very cool new material. The course is very focused on calculation techniques though and less on principles so sometimes you will just do repetitive calculations (especially in the problem sets)."
