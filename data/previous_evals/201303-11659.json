   "comments": [
    "Introduction to sociology which was nice and take it if you want to not do much work, but there is no way to really figure out how you are doing in the class.",
    "I would recommend this class. It will honestly make you see the world differently.",
    "This is a course that will provide the student with a vocabulary to analyze many phenomena in society with respect to ideas concerning propriety and race in America.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the subject of people's or society's norms, and how deviating from these expectations affects us and others. It focuses on black males, but the theories applying to that deviance can be extrapolated to any other kind of deviance (sexuality, gender, religion, handicaps, whatever)Incredible course. The material is more than pertinent, and can be applied in all ranges of one's social and professional life.",
    "I've never been so ambivalent about a class at Yale. On the one hand, the books you read in this class are incredible (the best reading list I've had at Yale), and at the end of the semester you will look at race, privilege, and deviance in a completely different light. On the other hand, Professor Anderson is not the best seminar leader...in the sense that he doesn't really lead a seminar. Instead, he tends to reflect on his life and repeat a number of core concepts over and over again to the point where it becomes tedious. In addition, the midterm and final were frustratingly broad, and we did not receive much feedback on our work. Shop it and see what you think, because the sociology of deviance is something that everyone should study at one point in their life.",
    "This class is amazing. Take this class just for the professor.",
    "Some of the technicalities of theories are confusing to distinguish."
