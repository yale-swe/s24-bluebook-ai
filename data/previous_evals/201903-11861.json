   "comments": [
    "I greatly increased my ability to speak and write grammatically correct Spanish, and I now feel like I know many of the nuances of Spanish grammar.",
    "I honed my Spanish language speaking and writing skills by investigating advanced grammar by consuming a plethora of media including short stories, historical articles and films and participating in debates on nuanced topics including the implementation of CRISPR gene editing and the black market of historical artifacts. Overall, I feel my fluency and command of Spanish has significantly grown over the course of the semester.",
    "I definitely believe that my Spanish grammar has gotten better since taking this class. While that might not have been very evident in my exam scores, I do have a better understanding of verb tenses and moods. I am glad that I took this course just because I believe this is something I needed to do.",
    "I developed the ability to make my Spanish sound more native with more advanced grammar skills. I am now able to comfortably say complex sentences in Spanish without hesitation.",
    "I learned how to speak and write closer to native Spanish speakers. It was very helpful to receive rigorous feedback on my Spanish grammar, especially in writing. It was also helpful to be in a class of mostly non-native Spanish speakers, because we focused on grammatical development as well as verbal and aural skills.",
    "I learned to better write spanish.",
    "I improved both my writing and speaking skills in Spanish in this class. I learned to use and feel more comfortable with a lot more advanced grammar structures that I knew existed but wasn't sure exactly how to use them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very well-organized and is a perfect amount of work in my opinion. The only thing I wished we did more of was speaking practice, even though it may not have a place in this exact class, I think it would be very helpful in general and would be the best way to ensure conversational fluency.",
    "Strength(s): there is a good balance between writing and speaking in the course Weakness(s):",
    "I think that a strength would be in the teaching and the material that we went over. This stuff really helped me learn and improve. A weakness would be the exams simply because I felt as though they did not judge my knowledge adequately.",
    "lot of work, but I went to office hours almost every week and Prof. Asensio was extremely helpful and nice! would recommend office hrs if you feel like you are struggling.",
    "Strengths: GREAT professor (Maria Pilar Asensio), great content that is necessary when speaking, really gets into the nitty gritty of the most niche grammar concepts, great in-depth coverage of the language Weaknesses: the workload (like 2 hours a night)",
    "It's very helpful to learn grammar in a small class. The professor offers clear and helpful advice, and spends a lot of time correcting student work. If you look at the corrections, you will improve. I think that there should be some type of mechanism that forces students to review corrections (in addition to the occasional writing revision assignment). This way, the professor's hard work can go to good use. There's a lot of work in this class that could be considered as busywork. There's some matching of adjectives and nouns, etc. that might not need to be present in an L5 Spanish course.",
    "I felt that we could practice speaking a little more.",
    "I think this course has just the right amount of work to keep students focused and give them practice, but not too much to be overwhelming. The work was always announced well ahead of time and we had plenty of time to do everything. Also we read and watched a lot of interesting stories\/movies so the class wasn't boring at all (the name of the class could make it sound boring)."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course! The professor is very kind and very willing to help students, and the class environment is fairly relaxing and conducive to learning. Although the grammar can be very difficult and tedious at times, the professor does her best to make it fun and engaging to learn.",
    "If you are looking to improve your Spanish (and were placed into L5) but haven't taken it in a while, it is a great place to start; you get to practice doing everything on a level that is advanced but in a very welcoming environment.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student even though it was challenging. Especially when being taught by Pilar, I felt as though taking this course will help anyone with understanding Spanish grammar. I hope to become fluent in Spanish and I am planning to be a Spanish double major so I think it was very useful. The Spanish department is also very nice and provides the support needed, so I do recommend this course.",
    "YES!! Taking at 9:25 was rough so maybe don't do that to yourself lol, but the class and the professor were great! The workload was a bit much with four other classes, but I loved the professor and the content was really helpful in terms of drilling very important grammar into my head. Very pedantic exams but super helpful in the long run",
    "Yes! This class is great for near-fluent Spanish speakers. It is the next logical class after AP Spanish Language (or equivalent). Keep in mind that \"Advanced Spanish Grammar\" is actually a misleading title--although we focus on Spanish grammar in the class, we do a lot of reading, speaking, writing, and listening. A large component of the course is maintaining an online conversation relationship with a partner in Ecuador. This is great to develop better speaking and listening skills.",
    "Yes! I definitely would as I felt like this course helped me refine my spanish skills.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to anyone coming in with high school AP credit, but still feeling uneasy about going straight into a college level class. We reviewed a lot for grammar that I had learned maybe once already, but we went way more in depth to the point where I have a much deeper understanding now. I think that it is a great class to take before taking other L5 classes to improve language skills and feel more confident."
