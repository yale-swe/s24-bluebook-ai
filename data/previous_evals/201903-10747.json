   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "not enough in class discussion at all -- too many students",
    "The course does a great job introducing new vocabulary and then revisiting the same vocabulary in future lessons to make sure I remember everything that weve learned; however, the lectures in class can become somewhat repetitive and dull.",
    "I think the day-to-day classtime could be better organized. We would have slideshows on most days, but it was often unclear how they were organized.",
    "I thought it was good at introducing us to higher level writing and vocabulary, but that it was weak in terms of keeping up our conversational level. There wasn't enough emphasis on conversational vocabulary and not enough opportunity to speak in class (class size was too big). I though it was good that there was an emphasis on writing papers and not just taking tests. But again, the conversational practice was almost non-existence, and I don't think the wechat homeworks made up for it. I also wished that quizzes had been hard; only needing to write pinyin and translation meant that I could very briefly review the new vocabulary and could get away without really memorizing it.",
    "It would be great to have more speaking time in class",
    "The strengths are that you learn a lot and the teacher will be incredibly passionate and helpful. The weakness is that it's a pretty high workload (though much better than L1-L4 which meet every single day), but that's also a strength because it's necessary in order to learn as much as we do.",
    "The course overall is great; however, some sections are a bit too large which takes away from learning the language intimately",
    "Although I enjoyed this class, I felt that the pace was much too fast for a three times a week class. The course was taught at the same speed it was when it used to be offered five days a week and I don't feel as though I had enough opportunities to practice using new grammar and vocabulary in class. We moved through slides rapidly and as a result I don't think I retained as much information as I would have in a five-day-a-week class. Although I did improve my writing skills and ability to express complicated ideas, I think my ability to write characters suffered. We had very few hand written assignments, so the only time I was required to write characters was on the two exams. I think it would have been beneficial for quizzes to require more writing."

    "I would strongly recommend this course.",

    "Yes! This is a great language course, and if you're motivated, you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "If you want to keep taking Chinese at Yale, there's not much of a choice. I would recommend supplementing it by going to office hours or getting a CLS tutor. I think you can learn a lot, but definitely might involve studying outside of what's required by the class if you want to learn a lot of Mandarin.",
    "I would definitely recommend this because you will learn a lot. The Chinese teachers are always incredible as well. Just be prepared for the high workload.",
    "If you are strongly considering becoming fluent in Mandarin, this course is highly recommended"
