    "If you don't like Renaissance Poetry, then the class will be a struggle. If you even have a vague interest in the material, I would highly recommend it. Lawrence Manley's enthusiasm and expertise will make the class valuable, and I feel like I left having a general knowledge of English poetry in the 16th and 17th centuries. There is a bit of writing, but Professor Manley's comments are very helpful and detailed. You can also write about whatever you want!!",
    "The material is crucial - you'll be happy to have read these poets. Also, if you are stressed about shopping classes and getting into seminars, few people (surprisingly!) show up to this one, so you're probably guaranteed a place. Regarding Professor Manley, here is a reproduction of my answer given above: Professor Manley is a wonderful Professor! He is a great discussion leader - the class is always engaged in a focussed close reading of the material. He is a helpful grader - he is tougher than many English professors, in a good way, and gives insightful, helpful comments. And he is dedicated to the material - his passion for it is apparent, and inspires the same from his students.",
    "No. I took it because I enjoy pre-1800s poetry, and even I really struggled to find value in this class. The department will offer more pre-1800s offerings in the future; take those instead.",
    "This class is amazing and probably one of the best in the English department. I didnt think I was interested in the Renaissance poets but this class changed my mind. Youll learn close reading skills that are invaluable for every other literature course. Rarely had any boring read and some of the poetry is genuinely beautiful. No final which is nice but can be a lot of writing.",
    "Lots of close reading of English Renaissance poets. Highly recommended for those who wish to improve their close reading skills."
