    "Take this class! I don't even like the Middle Ages, but I loved this course! It has some really great reading assignments and Christiana is great (she's also going to be teaching DS next year!) Assignments include weekly short reading responses, a short paper, an easy midterm, a final paper, and leading one class discussion. The readings are time consuming but worth it. I would recommend this to anyone- not just Italian majors.",
    "This class was incredible. Certainly recommend if you're even a tiny bit interested in the Middle Ages. Prof. Purdy Moudarres is a wonderful lecturer and she brings her own research interests in the classroom in the best way possible. Would certainly recommend. It was a pleasure to take this class.",
    "Definitely take it! I know a course in the Middle Ages sounds daunting, but you will learn a lot and get to read very interesting material. Christiana is a fabulous professor: young, energetic, fun, and brilliant. At least shop it. You won't regret it!",
    "This is without a doubt the best class I have ever taken at Yale! If you are curious about this class, I'm telling you that you will love it. If you are remotely interested in literature, history, or women's issues, this class will definitely change the way you think. I would highly, highly recommend that you take it. The best part of this class is Professor Purdy Moudarres. She is the best professor I've ever had. She is both razor-sharp intelligent, and approachable and lighthearted. She made every class both intellectually challenging and fun. She is always open to meeting outside of class, which really helped when it came to papers. If you can take any class with her, I hope that you take the opportunity. The material itself is also pretty amazing. We start by reading the Bible and Ovid, and then we read about the women of the Middle Ages themselves (like Theodora, Hildegard, Trotula, Catherine of Siena,and Angela of Folgino.) Finally, we read about these women in the works of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. Every singe reading was interesting. Even if this doesn't sound interesting to you, I would give it a chance. There is a lot more to medieval women than people would think! I promise you that this class will be one of the best experiences you will have at Yale. I envy anyone who takes this class next year!",
    "read really important texts talk about them talk about women a lot eat great food and become obsessed with your professor",
    "Take this course if you have any interest in learning about medieval women in history and literature. It is extremely interesting and informative."
