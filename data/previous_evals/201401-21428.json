   "comments": [
    "I recommend French 150. You do a fair bit of writing and you also have 2 oral tests. You work hard, but your French improved greatly.",
    "This class was good for improving my written and speaking French. The texts were interesting and manageable. It was really frustration that grammar was very emphasized on the tests but we never covered it in class. Also, work in this class comes in waves, one week you'll have very little then the next there will be an oral exam, a written exam, and a composition in the middle of midterms.",
    "It's a great way to improve your French.",
    "French grammar review. Some new vocab.",
    "A great course to improve your conversational skills, written French, and reading comprehension\/speed. The practice in these three skills is based around readings of short novels, plays, short stories, and films, all of which were very interesting and well-chosen- I loved doing homework for this class. Highly recommended!",
    "Level 5 French is the natural progression of the French program and a requirement for certain higher-level courses. Beyond being a gateway course, though, I found that it was truly valuable in itself. The course truly helped solidify grammatical rules, while making me very comfortable speaking, writing, and reading. Moreover, some of the texts we read and watched were incredible including Kieslowski's Rouge and Yasmina Reza's \"Art.\" While the course does not meet daily, unlike the lower-level French courses, the workload nonetheless is quite high with small compositions, grammar exercises, and readings for every class. Nonetheless, to get the most of the course (which is to become comfortably fluent), it is worth seriously committing to the workload, so if not merely taking the course to fulfill a requirement, I would recommend making time for it. I hear that most of the professors are excellent, but I would particularly recommend Madame Skorupa who seems to have a very deep understanding of the language (grammar, etc), and is also incredibly and cheerful and helpful."
