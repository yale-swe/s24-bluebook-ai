If you are a humanities major, you will likely find that this is an incredible opportunity to bring to fruition the compilation of ideas and interests you've developed through the room that the Humanities major offers you to explore your own interests and desires. It can also be a way to develop a worthwhile and significant relationship with your adviser.",

    "Yes! Not that you have a choice if this is your major.",
