   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you want a technical understanding of the course and wish to spend tim experimenting with the oversight of the one of the best conservators in the country.",
    "The material is very specific, but if you are interested in learning about art conservation and traditional oil techniques, I would HIGHLY recommend this course. As an artist I find I've learned a lot of really valuable information.",
    "ART 324 is a great class, with really fun and interesting material. You will learn so much about paintings and how to look at paintings -- will change how you look at paintings. I would recommend if you're interested in how paintings were made and if you have an interest in experimenting with new materials (although somewhat limited to oil painting though).",
    "I have already recommended this course to many of my peers. I usually tell them that this course deals with old master painting techniques and materials and that it has been a real treat learning from a conservator. I tell them that I now have a greater appreciation or understanding of what goes into the maintenance of paintings. Also, I am now able to notice things about a painting's condition that I was not able to before.",
    "An overview of traditional painting methods with a focus on oil techniques.",
    "Great class! Not a lot of emphasis on the act of painting, but you learn a lot about the materials used in painting, how to identify them, and how they age. If you keep on top of the painting assignments, it's a fairly low-stress, fun credit!"
