   "comments": [
    "I learned an incredible amount about how women were portrayed in medieval literature, and how current portrayals could actually learn quite a bit",
    "I developed my close reading and discussion skills.",
    "An eye-opening course that will expose you to new ways of thinking about gender and identity, from medieval times to the present. I was so glad to take an English course in a respectful setting with other people ready to listen and discuss. I would highly recommend for other students, especially English majors, as you will learn to read text not just at the grammatical level but at a meta-level, thinking about how power dynamics and character identities facilitate the storytelling process.",
    "I learned a lot about medieval literature and women in the middle ages. I also improved my ability to write short papers.",
    "In terms of insight, I've come to see literature from the medieval period as not so alien or distant from the present-day realities. Through the thoughtful discussions we had about women and the supernatural in texts like The Canterbury Tales and Cliges, I've gained an appreciation for the nuance and questions that each text offered."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought this was a great course. It would have been nice to have some sort of introductory lecture about the society of the middle ages, or historical readings alongside the texts we were reading. I felt like people were able to make a lot of unsubstantiated claims about \"medieval culture\" because there wasn't any common ground in terms of the class's knowledge about medieval history and society.",
    "Strengths: eye-opening, fun texts and materials, a trip to the Beinecke, a movie day (WE WATCHED GAME OF THRONES!), and a better understanding of how gender and magic can function both in medieval texts and modern texts (and society). You become able to quickly analyze situations and power dynamics and end results, which is a useful skill! Weaknesses: It is a long class, two hours once a week. Sometimes it felt very long if people weren't speaking up. Johanna was new and didn't always have commentary to fill in the gaps in conversation, so some classes were full of awkward pauses.",
    "The readings were pretty interesting and manageable. It would be helpful to talk as a class about social history around the time the individual texts were written. I sometimes felt our discussions lacked context. I also think it was a lot of writing for a non WR course.",
    "This has nothing to do with the course or Professor Fridriksdottir, but I think that if offered again, the class needs to be presented to prospective students more accurately. The role of women in medieval literature is not the only topic that this course allows students to explore."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, it's an incredible course that I think people could learn a remarkable amount from",
    "Take it! Professor F is actually brilliant and also really approachable\/kind. Readings are super manageable (usually a primary and secondary source, but you really don't have to read the secondary article unless you're super interested in it) and there's 3 baby papers (like, reading responses really) and one 10-12 page paper. A super relaxed class with easy and fun discussion and some old-school (but also like super canonical) readings. Would be a good 5th class\/an easy (and way more fun) pre-1800 for the english major.",
    "I would definitely recommend. The texts were fascinating and I would not have come across some of them otherwise. Johanna is great.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend. There were great course readings on the syllabus, the classes were interspersed with two movie days (one of which was Game of Thrones) and a visit to the Beinecke. Johanna is the best - she's kind, always willing to meet with students and accommodating with their schedules. She gave great feedback on papers and clearly loves the subject, which made it all the more interesting to students. This is a valuable course and I'd recommend it to all English majors, as it operates on a different level than the usual \"textual analysis.\" We read a lot of stuff in translation, so our readings tended to focus on characters, power dynamics, and transactions within the text. It was a very useful skill to help analyze how these dynamics play out in our own lives.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes! I was pleasantly surprised by how fulfilling and thought-provoking this class turned out to be. If offered again, I think it would be a great option for English and non-English majors."
