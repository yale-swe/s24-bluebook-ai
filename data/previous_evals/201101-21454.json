   "comments": [
    "A very good course, if sometimes overwhelming. The course hits you fast and hard with information -- you'll cover entire fields of biology or math in a single lecture, and often it's a struggle to keep pace. Zucker is a pleasure as a professor, though, and the work is quite do-able. I'm a bit terrified of the final exam, given the sheer amount of material covered, but that's really the only thing I haven't enjoyed about this course.",
    "nothing is concrete and thus it is hard to follow. although not necessary definitely keep up on the reading...you will wish you had at the end",
    "I loved it and I'm an Electrical Engineering major. Definitely recommendable. Note that the bulk of the grade is defined in the last 2 days of class when the final project is due and when you take the final.",
    "This is an interesting one to evaluate. You will go through a lot of the semester having no clue what's going on, but in the end, you'll at least get the main ideas. And that's all you are tested on, too. Basically, it's like a big survey of all sorts of computer vision examples and ideas; most of which is just stuff that the professor finds interesting, not things that you genuinely have to know. I regret not having gone to class as much as I should have; make sure you especially don't do this in the beginning, because you can fall really far behind in the process. And read the packets as you go along; don't be fooled by the lack of a midterm, because this stuff builds on itself. If Matt is the TA again, meet with him to go through concepts you're stuck on; he's super helpful. But also know that no one else really knows what's going on either, so despite the fact that you'll feel lost, you're no worse off than anyone else...and it does kind of all come together at the end. Also, be forewarned that, at least this year, 80% of your grade came in the past two weeks...it was nerve-wracking, to say the least. Overall, I'd say it's an accessible course if you stay on top of the material with the potential to be really interesting, but the temptation to slack off and not keep up with it is very high.",
    "This course is a general survey course of computer vision. The lectures make this class worth going to and the material itself is also great if one is even faintly interested in vision. The professor is great and is also very helpful. The one caveat is that a lot of material is covered and 80% of one's grade is determined in the last 3 weeks of school (final and final project) so do not take this if you will have more urgent demands at this time. Otherwise I recommend this course since one will learn a lot.",
    "I would not recommend this for a Comp Sci elective. The material is pretty interesting and Professor Zucker cares about the material and about teaching. But the course is very stressful for a couple of reasons. The final and the final project count for 80% of the grade total. And expectations on both are pretty unclear. So while work during the semester is minimal, the end of the semester is terrible. There is no reason that the course is structured this way, and honestly for me, it would make me not want to take the class. Also, Zucker is a bit of a wild card. He is very nice when meeting in person, but he can get agitated at any tiny disruption inclass. He kicked someone out for sending an email during class, and when the class had prefrosh during Bulldog days could barely get through the lecture because of people entering\/leaving the room\/making small amounts of noise. Also he can just make you feel sortof uncomfortable. It was a tiny class and he didn't know anyones names. There was even a set of identical twins in the class, which usually had only about 10 students in lecture. He didn't notice that they were brothers until the final review session!",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course. If you're interested in computer vision consider Biomedical Imaging and Analysis instead. You'll learn more in 3 lectures of that course then you will in the whole semester of this class. There is very little focus on practical techniques and the problem sets are more tedious than educational. The professor is also a bit frustrating. He makes the final and final project, which was due a day after the final, worth 80% of your grade. There's no reason for it and it makes the class very stressful, not to mention that his expectations aren't clear for either. He also makes absolutely no effort to get to know or even recognize students - every time you talk to him its like meeting him for the first time even though there were less than 20 kids in our class. Also our grades just came out within 2 days of submitting 10 - 20 page final papers, often with significant coding portions. Frankly that offended me after I put in so much time\/effort. There are a lot of CS professors here who put a ton of time and effort into their courses and students, so there's really no reason to settle for this class as an elective.",
    "This course, while scattered and intimidating at first, is actually very interesting if you take it with the right mentality.1) It is taught in a grad student style. You MUST be personally responsible for doing the reading and reviewing outside of lecture or you will flounder all semester2) make sure you have a strong interest in the subject matter and stronger background in math. Don't take it just for the creditAlso you will have no idea what your grade is or why, ever. haha take it credit d perhaps?",
    "If you're interested in AI, take it--lokewise, if you're a CS person who likes bio or math.",
    "This class is pretty good. Definitely pay attention to the early math stuff, because everything after that is based on it. Be aware that there is a final project and also a final exam, which was kind of rough."
