   "comments": [
    "As someone who before starting to write a two-term senior essay in economics purely as a passion project (i.e. not for distinction or to get into an econ grad school), without much background in mathematics, econometrics, or really economic research, writing a senior essay has been an incredibly rewarding experience for me. My advisor has pushed me and taught me invaluable skills for pursuing my specific research area, and I have gained experience (and will gain much more) in how to read and synthesize literature, data management, and working with Stata on building a model to analyze data.",
    "I have learned how to better analyze data, improved my skills working with statistical software, and gained a greater understanding of the process of academic research.",
    "You can ask professors and the TF associated with the course questions on your thesis, as well as meet with your adviser. Other than that, no mandatory class.",
    "Over the first semester of the senior essay, I have learned how to identify economics research questions and develop them. I have worked on conducting background research on a topic and worked on learning where to look for useful data, and identifying appropriate econometric techniques to analyze this data.",
    "how to come up with a research topic for a senior essay (it's way harder than it looks)",
    "Working on economic research, and how to design a study"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "In general, I think this course is fantastic. Strengths include the weekly TA lessons for those who feel underprepared to conduct economic research- Ana Reynoso is the TA this year, and she makes herself super available, and her lessons each Monday are engaging and helpful for anyone starting out on a research project. Others strengths: meeting with your advisor, who (if you pick a good one) can be instrumental in helping you organize your thoughts, provide you with ideas and insight about your economic research, and just be a good motivator in more stressful times via your class schedule, etc. I also appreciated Weaknesses: I think more guidance could theoretically come from the economics department administration in helping students select an advisor and a good topic. I was lucky to have picked a topic very early, but finding an advisor was very difficult for me, because I only looked into people who had a ton of experience in the field I was looking to write the thesis in as opposed to the general field of economics. They were incredibly unresponsive, and it was somewhat later into the semester that I ended up broadening my search and finding a good adviser. If I had received more guidance in emailing and eventually choosing an advisor at the beginning, I think it would have proved enormously helpful and I could have gotten a head start on my project.",
    "Among the strengths of the senior essay are that it allows students to explore a topic of interest to them, helps them gain insight into the process of academic research, and allows them to apply the skills they have learned throughout their academic career. One potential way to improve the experience is to find a way to facilitate conversations between students who are thinking about writing a thesis and those who are currently working on or who have completed theses, because those who have gone through the process might have helpful advice for the younger students.",
    "For better or worse, the vast majority of the senior essay experience is determined by your relationship with your advisor. Thus, general comments are not particularly useful, though I found my advisor to be a helpful resource and great source of guidance on my thesis.",
    "more supervision from the department would have been helpful, especially some reminders regarding deadlines and requirements. there were no reminders sent about the prospectus deadline so a lot of people forgot \/ missed it \/ didn't have enough time to work on it and just rushed out a topic, and qazi and the DUS are not fun to deal with when your prospectus is late, even though there were zero reminders about the very first deadline."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. I was very nervous about writing a research paper and two-term thesis at all, because I had no experience conducting my own novel economic research, and didn't even feel particularly engaged with the major before writing one. However, I think this thesis allowed me to go off and explore a topic that I feel particularly strongly about while also learning the ropes of how to conduct research in economics. I tend to be less math-focused, and more political science-oriented, and this has really helped me to feel connected to the major while also reading about and analyzing data for something in which I am fully interested in, and of which I feel completely in control. It's the type of experience I'd always wanted from Yale, and I believe its helped me to define and refine my career path after graduation as well.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in gaining hands-on experience in academic research. It is a great way to explore a topic of interest in depth while gaining useful skills, and it is especially rewarding with a great advisor.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Gives the time to actually conduct the preliminary research needed to complete a thesis in econ.",
    "The senior essay can be a great experience, or a miserable one depending on a variety of factors. However, I would recommend the senior essay if you can find an advisor that you get along with and who is willing to support you through the process.",
    "Yes, I definitely would. Writing a thesis allows you to research in-depth an idea or sector you are passionate about.",
    "if you want distinction in the major you've got to do it. apart from that doing your own independent research and working closely with a faculty member can be pretty cool, but you need to be very self-motivated and not procrastinate like I did."
