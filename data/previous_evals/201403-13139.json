   "comments": [
    "The class was just an overview of American literature, pretty self-explanatory. That said, I would recommend it to anyone who has any interest at all in literature. The course is more about analyzing than development of writing, so that might factor into whether one wishes to take it or not. You do read some very remarkable books; for all the complaints about Moby-Dick, I quite enjoyed it. From what I gather, all the professors are good, but Prof. Williams was quite exceptional. If you choose to take the class, you simply cannot go wrong in choosing Prof. Williams' section.",
    "This was a great class all around. Not too many novels, not too much poetry. It's a great way to get a little bit of everything and also challenge new ideas during discussion.",
    "Readings in American Lit is a great English class that requires a decent amount of reading. But, the novels are usually pretty interesting, and the discussions are great. I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the great American novels, such as Moby Dick and Pale Fire.",
    "English 127 is an interesting class if you actually have time to do all the reading. However, because the class has limited thoughtful class discussion and offers barely any writing instruction, if you're not self motivated in this way, you may not gain much from this course. I took it as a first semester freshman and found myself regretting the decision because I wanted a class with a bit more writing instruction and found myself not really learning anything.",
    "Very good intro class; if you need WR class based more on analyzing literature, I would recommend taking this class.",
    "absolutely",
    "Take English 127 if you are interested in and want to learn more about American literature! You will be able to read and discuss some quintessential American authors in this class, including Walt Whitman, Herman Melville, Elizabeth Bishop, and so on. There are less writing assignments in this course compared to English 114 and English 120--your grade is determined by only four. Be prepared to work independently on these writing assignments, as the class doesn't really go over how to write. It is more focused on reading and discussing.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in literature. I am not an English major, but I liked this class enough to wish that I was interested in more than just literature. The readings are more American than you'd expect - not just the typical old dead white men, the readings embody the diversity in culture found in America. The workload, under Professor Williams (who I highly recommend) is not too strenuous, and is just enough to keep you interested but not enough to make you hate the class.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. It is an excellent course to take if you want a fun and interesting survey of American literature--it is exactly as the course title advertises."
