    "Again, Alex Felson is one of the most talented and ambitious instructors I have ever met, let alone at Yale. I hope his work here and forestry is appreciated. He works harder and is more dedicated than most which makes him personable and a great mentor.",
    "Prof. Felson is great at generating discussion, bringing relevant points into the discussion and summarizing what has been discussed. His lectures (this was not his typical way of teaching) were fascinating, but not especially well structured.",
    "It was a pleasure to work Professor Felson. The energy that he offers is unlike any other professor I have worked with at Yale. His position as \"liason\" to the School of Forestry is one that is challenging, and I surely appreciate his desire to provide a dialogue between the two schools. Moreover, his ability to connect with students individually is uncanny. He takes each students interest and offers the assistance to push those interests to a new level."

    "The final project should potentially be a little less open ended.",
    "This course was an interesting experiment between two distinct fields that have much potential to fuse together. Although it was a challenge, I feel that some progress was made in introducing the Forestry students to the design field and how we represent our ideas, but also how architects can begin to understand the types of experiments in which they engage. The most problematic part of the course, in my opinion, is the delaying of the final project until later in the semester. I felt that in the end most groups had to rush their proposals rather than focusing on them from the very beginning. I think all the early assignments we had could be integrated as part of the final project in an effort to come up with really interesting ideas. I also believe that it would be productive to have 2 designers working with a forestry student, as it would allow the architects to more clearly convey ideas of representation and design to their respective team members. I personally felt a disconnect with my team member, and think it would have been useful to have another designer to express my ideas."
