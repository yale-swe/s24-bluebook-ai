   "comments": [
    "Difficult. Unless you are a physics major or it is required for your major, don't take it! Take PHYS 180 instead.",
    "Difficult but necessary class for physics majors, be prepared to spend time on problem sets... would reccommend to those planning to go into physics",
    "I would not recommend PHYS 200 to another student. Even though the book we use says it's a course for engineers, I found it to be highly theoretical and the course was taught with the use of a lot of proofs, which I did not like. I would suggest taking PHYS 180 or something that was more applicable, unless the student likes learning physics from a theoretical, proof-based stand point.",
    "Be ready to do a lot of work outside of class and be ready to be forced to do a lot of hard thinking on problem sets. But it's an excellent class and you'll learn a lot. Only for students who have some physics background, are good at math, and are interested in physics.",
    "THIS IS NOT AN EASY CLASS. Lots of theory, lots of figuring things our yourself, psets are hard, midterms can bog you down. BUT, you do learn lots of physics and you learn the right from the underlying principles, so if you want to get a good grip on physics, go ahead.",
    "The PSETs do require you to put in some time and effort, but you will learn as much from the PSETs as from the lectures. I would recommend this course if you have done some physics in high school and are looking for a more conceptually challenging course (The mathematics involved in the course does not go beyond basic calculus). I liked the collaborative atmosphere of the study halls - the teaching fellows and peer tutors are really there to help you with the problems if you are willing to put in the effort.",
    "This is an introductory mechanics (and special relativity for some reason) course, but it is a difficult one. Expect to leave many lectures feeling slightly disoriented and more than slightly nervous about how you are going to complete the problem set on the material you just learned. Also expect very difficult midterm exams. This is a difficult course, there's a ton of material, and Prof. Golling does not budget his time especially well. He leaves very little time for in-class practice problems, making the problems sets quite struggle. I would recommend this class if you have taken some sort of into physics course before and felt you have a VERY good knack for it. Otherwise, this class will be a bit miserable.",
    "I would not take this class, choose 180 instead. Or if you really love Physics go with 260.",
    "It's not terrible if you have to take it, but I'd recommend investing a lot of independent study time. I did not find the lectures particularly elucidating, leaving learning the content to independent study.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 200 to another student.",
    "Avoid this class like the plague. Unless you are a total physics whiz, you will feel lost. If you get it, you get it. If you don't get it, you just don't, and you'll get no help from Golling or from the TFs on how to grasp what you're learning. The first week of class, Golling tells you that he can't \"teach\" you physic, that he can merely \"facilitate learning,\" but he does neither. Lectures are totally disengaging and you're better off watching videos online. There is an enormous gap between what you learn and the problems you have to solve. 99% of class time is spent doing useless derivations of formulas, which you never actually learn how to use. The problem sets have extremely contrived problems and you're expected to solve them without ever having done basic problems as a stepping stone. The heavy curve justifies Golling not actually teaching you how to solve problems (the average on the second midterm was a 50%). And problem sets take about 6-8 hours on average a week, but if you account for the fact that you have learn all of the material outside of lecture, this class soaks up much more of your time.",
    "A tough physics class where you will learn to problem solve. I would recommend it to another student simply because I learned so much from it.",
    "Physics 200 is awful. Do not take this class. If you do well at physics, take 260. If you're not sureabout your physics ability, take 180. Avoid 200 at all cost.",
    "Physics 200 is a challenging course. If you do not have at least a year of physics (AP-level) and calculus I could not recommend it. Many of my friends struggled with the course, and I found the tests very difficult and perhaps \"unfair\" to some extent (questions may seem unfamiliar), but there is a curve anyhow. But there are so many resources available from which you can learn the material in this class. There are lectures, Shankar's video lectures (which are great), lecture notes provided (and they are quite extensive), study hall for problem sets and general questions, and of course the textbook. If you WANTa sophisticated understanding of classical physics, have a strong background in math\/physics (no multivariable required) this class could help you get there. If you're totally against the idea of putting any stress on yourself with an intro physics class this is not your class. Simple as that.As for my background: 5 AP Physics C, 5 AP Calc BC, 780 SAT PhysicsAnd I've been just inside the first quintile.Also don't think anyone should worry too much about failing the course. From what the professor has said, D's and F's aren't really a thing (despite the second midterm average being basically 50%).",
    "I would recommend this class to those who want to explore physics using mathematical methods, which is a different way than I believe people did in high school.",
    "Physics 200 is an intermediate yet still challenging introduction to physics. It is good for people who perhaps took AP Physics but perhaps do not want to have as a challenging a class as 260, and for people who perhaps only took one year of physics in high school, but feel ready for a challenge and want to try 200.",
    "PHYS 200 is a good introduction to physics, it covers mechanics,special relativity, and some harmonic motion and thermodynamics. The course was similar to high school physics, but the topics were explored in greater depth and the PSETs were much harder.It was a good course, the psets were challenging. The second midterm was VERY hard, much harder than expected. Beware of the relativity pset and midterm, it requires effort.If you know multivariable calculus, look into 260 - I've heard good things about it.",
    "I took Physics C in high school, and I did well. I found out in Physics 200 that I'm not very good at physics. 200 is a hard class. The workload is not tremendous, but the exams this year were extremely difficult.The lecture is terrible and there's really no reason to go. Our professor had us watch lectures online from the Yale Open Course on PHYS 200 and posted lecture notes online. The actual lecture was just going over that material. Very little application was taught in class, which means I got almost nothing out of lecture.Going to the tri-weekly study sessions with the TAs and peer tutors was the only way I could figure out the Psets, so I would recommend you do that if you're going to take this course.",
    "Good course overall with a couple poorly taught sections",
    "Take the course because it challenges you, but be prepared to work very very hard and yet fall short of your expected grades.",
    "This course covers a ton of different topics without exploring them too deeply. Many concepts will only be derived with the most standard textbook derivation before the course moves on. Although very similar to live lectures, Yale OCW is your friend. I found MIT Mechanics OCW to be a great complement too, as its topics are also similar. The midterms are rough, and most people are very equal, so that one problem here or there makes a difference to your grade. Midterm 2 is insanely difficult, no matter how good you are. Don't let it discourage you. If you care about physics for the sake of physics, start out by trying the more indepth Phys 260 and hop down a notch if you want to later (from what I hear loads of people in Phys 260 have not taken the supposed req. of multivariable calc). All in all, Im glad I took this course and have learned so much about physics from it.",
    "I wouldn't say I head-over-heels loved this class, but I do think it builds the essential blocks for anyone interested in physics.",
    "A LOT of work! Go to the review sessions and do extra problems out of the book so you aren't cramming for the midterm or final.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student because I don't think that the difficult concepts are taught with much clarity.",
    "I would say if you are very interested in physics, take PHYS 200. If you like physics (even if you took a lot of physics in high school), but are not sure if you want to major in it or not, you should take the lower level. The course was more difficult than I expected and that caught me off guard.",
    "If you have any sort of interest in physics you should definitely take this class. I learned a ton. But a lot can be said for reviewing at home -- I definitely had to do that a lot just to make sure I was keeping up. If your up for a little extra work the class is perfect.",
    "Physics 200 is a really intense class. We learn a lot of material, really quickly, and students have the responsibility of reviewing the lecture notes and watching the lectures on OpenYale before coming to class. However, there are plenty of opportunities to get help if you're struggling, and you end up with a really good understanding of and appreciationfor Physics.",
    "It's a solid, challenging course that's curved hard because of the number of students who are really good at Physics. Be sure to come in with a sufficiently complete physics background, or be ready to work hard watching online videos.",
    "I would recommend it to them if they have a good experience with physics or would be willing to put a lot of time into this course. If someone just wants to use it to fulfill a distributional requirement, I would recommend they shop other classes as well.",
    "This is a very tough course with a lot or work. The p-sets are especially difficult, so expect to set aside a good chunk of time each week to work on them at study halls. The exams are not always representative of the material we learn (they are really hard), so it can be frustrating when long hours of studying don't pay off. A large amount of material is covered in a short time, so it can be hard to keep up, but students in this course definitely learn a lot.",
    "I would tell them to take physics 180 or 260 instead. Most of the people I talked to in this class felt that it was either too easy or too difficult. I don't know anyone for whom the teaching style of this course worked well for them, only people who managed to make it work with enough effort.",
    "It's a good course to take if you're willing and able to teach yourself a whole hell of a lot. Otherwise, one of the other physics courses is probably a better idea.",
    "I feel like PHYS 200 was worth it. Physics isn't exactly my favorite subject, so that says something. Sometimes, it could be a bit rough, and it was definitely harder than 170\/180, but I feel like that made me work harder to understand concepts.If your grade is your first priority, it'd probably be best to take the others (though I hear 170\/180 have very bad curves, so 260 is the way to go if you can), but if you can't get into 260 and you really enjoy physics, 200 is probably a good choice for you.",
    "It is a fairly difficult class that requiresa fair amount of work and effort. Worth taking if it is toward the major or if you enjoy physics.",
    "Think before you take Physics 200. If you really love physics and feel you have had a great deal of preparation (beyond AP Physics B or C), you may enjoy this class a lot more than I did. As someone who came in as an engineer with less preparation, this class has proved my hardest class at Yale thus far. The class requires a great deal of work with the difficult problem sets, and the exams were terrible. If you can do the work and really love it, you may enjoy the class, but otherwise, please strongly consider Physics 180 or 260.",
    "Take the course.",
    "Take this course if you want to do anything with Physics. Even if you have had some high school physics, this course really solidifies the foundations.",
    "I thought this was a very difficult class that was not taught the most effectively. We are told to watch lectures by another professor and then the class lectures are exact copies of it. The lectures are also purely derivations as opposed to actual examples, which made psets particularly difficult. A nice professor, though.",
    "It is a very had class. Take it if you are truly interested in physics, but keep in mind that both 180 and 260 are easier. I would recommend taking either one of those classes instead.",
    "Good class- take it if you're very interested in physics and are looking for a challenge- it probably isn't going to be a grade booster.",
    "Prof. Golling is one of the most open-minded professors out there, and truly cares about his students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 learning and performance in the class. While the teaching itself is confusing and many people do not follow, I feel like Prof. Golling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willingness to listen to his students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concerns and adapt is something that can help to overcome that barrier. The class is certainly rigorous, not in the amount of work assigned, but in the amount of time that needs to be put in to understand the concepts. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d recommend this class, but know that you need to put in a lot of time and that most people in the class are intending to be physics majors.",
    "I was recommended by the department to take Physics 200, but even then I found it a rather difficult course right from the start. If you do take this course, be prepared to put in the work before lectures to learn the most of them. The lectures are most effective when you have at least given the notes a read-through.",
    "This class is more difficult than AP Physics C, but is manageable if you have a general knack for problem solving, simplifying complicated situations down to equations, and\/or you stay on top of all the work.",
    "I would say this course was a great introduction to physics. I would recommend it to anyone with interest in physics or math.",
    "Physics 200 is a dumb class that is horribly structured, take either 180 or learn a lot more math and take 260 next year. This class is for the masochistic."
