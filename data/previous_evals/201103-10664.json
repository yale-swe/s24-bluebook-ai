    "Absolutely. Students interested in cognitive science and philosophy would certainly benefit from taking this course.",

    "On one hand, the course covered a great deal of research and while I was familiar with some of it, I found it particularly helpful in thinking through the implications of the research for philosophical theories.On the other hand, the course was also helpful in thinking through some of the philosophical theories that seem to make empirical commitments and working out how to test those.While my dissertation won't be on this exact topic, it is highly relevant and has certainly deepened my understanding of the underlying issues.",
    "We learned how much contention there is on the topic."
