    "I would recommend CLCV 257 to any student interested in gaining a good grounding in Roman culture. For those with a fair amount of prior knowledge on the subject, it will probably be a lot of review, but some material should be new. The class is especially interesting to take in conjunction with CLCV 256 in the fall.",
    "This course is an introduction to Roman culture that focuses on various topics such as religion, family life, political life, etc. in the different lectures. It's a bit all over the place in terms of topics, and especially considering how wide the course's scope is, the lectures are extremely disorganized. Professor Freudenburg has interesting observations to make, but they often feel random and it is unclear what we're supposed to get out as the main points or terms of each lecture (studying for the exam is nearly impossible). I would only take this if you're required to by the classics major--if you're not and just want to learn about the Romans, I'd choose a class that surveys a more specific area like history or art.",
    "We discussed Roman culture from a variety of different perspectives (including religion, ethnography, geography, dining, slaves, aristocrats, and architecture) using numerous texts by Roman authors (Livy, Virgil, Pliny, Juvenal, Horace, etc.).",
    "The reading list for this class is wonderful, but this semester it was very disorganized. Since it was the first time it was taught this way, hopefully it will become better organized. I wouldn't say I learned very much (as a Classics major who had already read some of these texts) because Professor Freudenberg didn't go into much depth. That being said, he may improve it with time, and it has the potential to be great, given the material.",
    "Great course!",
    "This class is for any student regardless of how much experience they have had with Latin. Professor Freudenburg provided really amazing insight into what you read and how you come to understand it. Also, the workload is completely manageable; only 50-100 pages of reading per class period, which is 2 times a week. Throughout the class, you have 2 papers and a final exam as well as weekly quizzes in section that are more for your own benefit than for a grade. At times the talking points may be a tad dull even for people like me who are big classics geeks; however, overall, the class is absolutely wonderful and taught by an amazing professor and TF. I would definitely recommend this to another student if you want to know more about Roman civilization and want a laid back class, since the class atmosphere feels very laid back generally.",
    "If you're a classics major, take this earlier rather than later. The course work isn't too demanding, and it provides a very useful context for all the texts you will read in your other classes. Freudenburg is very enthusiastic and will keep you engaged.",
    "Wonderful course, definitely take it. Whether you're a classics major or not, you'll definitely enjoy it.",
    "It is a holistic examination of the Ancient Roman culture. It included topics ranging from religious practices to dining to family life. There is a heavy focus on primary text readings and examination of primary artifacts (sculptures, paintings, objects etc.). The course included travels to the art gallery which were always fascinating. I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in the material. I would highly encourage doing the readings because the texts were an important part of immersing oneself in the Roman way of thinking."
