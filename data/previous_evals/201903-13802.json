This is the only class at FES where I have learned a coherent method for performing policy analysis, in spite of having taken many classes with \"policy analysis\" in the title."

While the content was repeated at times and the course could have been organized a bit better, the content we covered was incredibly interesting and important, and I anticipate that it will guide my thinking for the rest of my career."
