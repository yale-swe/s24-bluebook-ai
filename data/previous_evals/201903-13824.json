    "I learned a lot of the basic techniques of glassblowing, many of which are useful in a research-lab setting. For example, I learned what the numbers for different ground-glass joints actually signify and how to score and break glass safely. I also learned how to make side-seals, straight-seals, bends, tapers, Vigreux columns, and bulbs. I learned how to use a wet saw to cut glass and I gained an appreciation for glassblowing and the work our glassblowers do on a daily basis."

   "comments": [
    "The biggest factor limiting me from learning the techniques taught in this course was the time required to practice the skills. For safety reasons, we were only allowed to work in the shop when the shop was open. These hours largely conflict with hours graduate students need to be working in lab. I understand that the logistics would be difficult, but it would be nice to have evening or weekend hours available for students to work."
