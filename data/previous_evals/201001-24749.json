   "comments": [
    "Hard. Don't believe what anyone says when they tell you its a gut class.",
    "Take this class. Snowden is a leader and huge expert in his field and his lecturing style is engaging, thought-provoking and basically just a joy to hear. Seriously, take this class. The reading responses are a little annoying at first, but they're not that big of a deal.",
    "I am a science major that was looking for an amazing humanities credit and this was the course to take. Professor Snowden is an amazing lecturer and you learn so much. It's a standard history class so you read about a book a week and write a reading response on it. Otherwise there's a take home midterm, a final, and a final paper. This is definitely one of the best classes to take at Yale and I'd recommend it to anyone, history majors or not.",
    "HSHM 235 provides a detailed overview of all major epidemics that occurred from the plague (in the 16th century) to AIDS (in the 20th century). I would highly recommend this class to a fellow student. At the end of the class, one is left with an understanding of the impact major diseases had on society and the progression of societal measures taken to prevent further outbreaks.",
    "I found the class to be very interesting as it looked at some of history's most important diseases and the effects they had. There is a lot of reading but is worth it if you are interested in the material.",
    "While the class can be dry sometimes, it was actually a really cool subject. Definitely take this if you are history or HSHM.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class. A lottt of reading (a book a week) but it's interesting and you don't have to do it all, skimming will suffice. Lectures are really interesting",
    "this was a great class and it wasn't too much work.. take it",
    "Interesting take on a seemingly mundane, scientific topic. Highly recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you're prepared to study diseases for a semester - it gets to be a little grimmer than you might anticipate during shopping period. Most of the readings are more novel-like than most nonfiction, and you have the choice of writing the course paper on a work of fiction or nonfiction. There are weekly 2 - 3 page reading responses, and though they make the workload a little heavier than the average history class, they definitely help improve your writing more than you would expect. The lectures themselves are excellent, and talk about how the diseases impact culture and society as well as the medical world.",
    "Good class to take, interesting subject matter and fascinating reading.",
    "i would most definitely recommend this course. It was fun and interesting and not difficult at all",
    "Great class. I recommend taking it.",
    "Epidemics is a great course. Class can be tough sometimes because there's so much information communicated very rapidly, but Snowden is an excellent lecturer and you really get a lot out of it. Expectations are fairly straightforward. There is a LOT of reading (and two-page reading responses every week is seriously no joke), but I think it's worth it, and you really walk away feeling accomplished.",
    "Good course on a different subject matter than the average class.",
    "This is a class designed to essentially look at how epidemic diseases impact and shape social history. While this is an interesting concept, be warned that after the first few lectures, it all starts to pretty much sound the same. Professor Snowden is a VERY clear lecturer, but try it out to see if it's your style. It's pretty dry, and definitely elementary. It's a good introduction, and if you take the time to do all the reading (a book a week), you could get a lot out of it. It would probably be a nice CR\/D 5th class in a hard semester, and if it delves more deeply into the public health issues in the future, it would be a much more interesting class. I was a little bored by the end, but it has promise if you're interested in the material.",
    "I took this because it was a humanities credit that had a lot of science in it and I thought that it was a great class. It's a great survey of epidemic disease and the lectures and readings are pretty entertaining. It was a bit writing heavy for my liking, but it's only a reading response a week and a paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in history, public health, or medicine. This is an excellent way to get a humanities credit for science students, and Snowden is an excellent lecturer. The reading do add up - roughly a book a week - but can be managed and ocassionally put off as necessary.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the material. Too much reading to actually do. Weekly reading responses are a pain, but not too difficult and check\/+\/- grading. Take home midterm (timed, closed notes which is crap) and finals period final both with TOO MANY IDs and then essays. Not an excessive amount of work. Lectures are dry and monotonous, but are interesting if you can pay attention.",
    "I would recommend this class to any person who wants a very good background in epidemic diseases. It was very helpful in expanding my general knowledge of history and of how epidemic diseases have affected other events in history.",
    "It is a study of the major effects of disease not only on the medical world but also on society and future responses. There is something that will appeal to everyone regardless of their background in sciences etc. Disease and public health is something that everyone would do better if they knew more about it.",
    "Yes. Sometimes the workload is a little heavy, but it's never unmanageable. Plus, Prof. Snowden always made it very clear what was expected of the students on exams, papers, and reading responses, so if you put a decent amount of work in on the assignments, they were all pretty straightforward\/not especially difficult.",
    "I would recommend the class if you have any interest in diseases and their effects to society across the globe.",
    "Take it. The work load is average, but the assignments aren't daunting. The class is straight forward in the sense that the teachers and TA's basically tell you what it takes to get an A",
    "Great course. Take it if you have an interest in diseases and their historical impact.",
    "This is an interesting class, and I would recommend it. You have to write a (short) reading response each week, so be prepared to at least skim the reading, but it's not overwhelming. Professor Snowden's voice can be soothing at times, but if you listen you'll learn a lot. He's at the top of this field, so he's the best person to learn this from.",
    "Lots of work! Reading and papers every week.",
    "Yes, take this course, especially if you are completely unfamiliar with the material. This course is an eye-opener. If I would have taken this course freshman year, I'd have probably went into public health."
