    "I would recommend it to anybody who wants to spend more time speaking but would also note that the class itself is not extremely difficult. It's a lot of what you make it.",
    "It's a conversation class. You'll enjoy it. You'll basically speak a lot.",
    "If a student is interested in speaking and participating, this class is a perfect fit. I would strongly recommend that the student try to find a class that is smaller. Larger classes may be less intellectual stimulating. Also, the Spanish department has other great classes where you can improve your fluency. Please do not be intimidated by a subject class such as International Politics or Legal Spanish. These classes are great avenues to improve your Spanish. I have taken many of the classes in the department and they are all great. I've taken 8, and I'm not even a Spanish major!",
    "I'd recommend this course.",
    "Take Spanish 151 (especially with Professor Asensio)! It's a fun way to maintain your Spanish fluency, boost confidence, and get your language requirement out of the way without too much work."
