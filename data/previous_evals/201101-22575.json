   "comments": [
    "This class definitely had merits. It allowed you to read some really great works of French literature and philosophy. However, if you are looking for something that includes a lot of discussion and philosophical arguments, this is not really the course for you. It tends to veer towards a lecture rather than seminar, and much of the discussion is guided by the professor. Kavanagh is pretty nice, but he is a stickler about grammar. It's a solid French course, but I've definitely taken better ones.",
    "This is an enriching course taught by a brilliant professor, who, despite being a little heavy-handed in leading class discussion, still led discussion admirably.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. If you want to keep up your French, just make it a point to listen to French radio every day for an hour. Only take this class if you're a French major. The reason for this advice is mostly because the class is dull, I promise you you won't do the readings, and you've probably run across most of this information before in your other classes on history during this time period. Spare yourself, and listen to France Info or RFI.",
    "I would recommend French 221 to any student who is confident in their reading, writing and speaking skills in French. There is a lot of reading at the beginning of the course and two long essays, as well as an in-class midterm essay. The works that we read were really good, but class discussions were sometimes a bit slow to get started. Professor Kavanagh is really nice and willing to help with all aspects of French.",
    "As a French major, this class seemed like a natural fit for me, though I think this class could definitely be enjoyed by people from all backgrounds, except maybe Computer Programming. It is a lot of work, and requires active participation, but if you're interested in the subject matter there's no better class to take.",
    "It's your basic yale french class. It is almost too vague as a course. i would recommend it but it is not the best french class i have taken.",
    "This is basically a broad (and at times deep) look at 18th century France, combining aspects of history, literature, philosophy, political science, and French language classes. I would recommend it if you're interested in the period, its literature, its philosophies, the transition from absolutism to enlightenment\/modernity\/democracy. Make sure you're confident in your French speaking, reading, and writing ability- our class suffered somewhat from not having enough people willing to contribute frequently, so Kavanagh carried much of the class with his own analysis of the authors and the readings. It's a fair amount of work but there's some fun elements too- movies, a project that you can do basically whatever you want with. And Prof. Kavanagh is great- enthusiastic, cheerful, very knowledgeable, very accommodating.",
    "I would recommend French 221 to a French major who has never studied the 18th century in any comprehensive capacity. It's also a solid class for someone who wants to understand what the Enlightenment is about. The class really depends on the students taking it - if it's a motivated and interesting group, I'm sure the seminar would be great. When it's a bunch of freshmen who don't do the reading, not the most stimulating experience."
