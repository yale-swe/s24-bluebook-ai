   "comments": [
    "excellent course. well planned, well structured, and well executed.",
    "Strengths: Practical, realistic and professional instructor, interaction with organizations outside of YSPH, preparation for real world work, lectures very applicable to the work assigned, readings are practical, class size is small.",
    "The course was surprisingly interesting, and I found the final assignment very informative. It has changed how I view community programs in terms of effectiveness and usefulness. The theoretical readings towards the beginning of the course were not very interesting, but the readings related to actual evaluations and programs were interesting.",
    "great organization and flow to the class.",
    "The course is a great one to have on your resume. It is also one of the only courses I have found at YSPH that focuses on practical knowledge and skills, rather than only theoretical. For those reasons, I really enjoyed the class. However, I think the instruction was weak. I think the professor seemed disorganized and class exercises were not helpful. There were several times when the professor left early toward the end of the class and expected us to sit there and work by ourselves. If I'm going to work by myself, I'd rather do it on my own time. One of the best classes of the semester was the one that was covered by the professor's associate, who came in to discuss logic models. I also don't like that readings were posted only after we had discussed the topic in class. My motivation to do the readings at that point was very low. I would have preferred to have read the material before coming to class so that we could have an educated discussion about it.",
    "It was a good class. Good balance of practical and theoretical, and I will use skills from this class in the future. Very straightforward.",
    "Strengths: practical overall; PowerPoints were straightforward, organized, and helpful for completing assignments; small class size allowed for better discussion and Q&A; while in class, the mixture of small-group work and lecture was well-balanced and enjoyableWeaknesses: felt a little bit lost in the beginning of the semester when we had to select our own organization to work with. This was a difficult process and most organizations were not very responsive. In the future, it would be helpful if the professor had pre-arranged contacts at various organizations who have already expressed interest in working with our class. Then, students could select from the available organizations, or find one on their own if they choose to do so.",
    "It's very casual class where you could learned about the contents and methods of evaluation. Individual project helps you to become engage in a specific health projcet either in the States or overseas.",
    "I really enjoyed the course because the course was very practical and allowed students to practice public health skills in a professional settings."

    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0instructor was very helpful, both in and outside of class. the fact she encorporated her dailywork into course lectures was helpful in providing real-world connection to the material presented",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise is great. Her lectures are very relevant and her assignments and exams and very fair. This is one of the best classes I've had at YSPH and that is very much attributable to her teaching skills and the ways she treats students as equals and professionals.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Professor Stevens struggles a little in the first few classes to translate what she does in practice to the theories of evaluation. She does provide very clear and useful professional and practical insight and makes herself very available to students with questions or concerns.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0very nice and personable. A wonderful resource with lots of applicable experience.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Professor Stevens is very nice and really accommodating when projects don't go as planned. However, her teaching techniques are weak. She seems disorganized, and her lectures are composed mostly of her own personal anecdotes, rather than deep discussion about evaluation techniques.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise Stevens is a successful professional, and it's refreshing to take a class from someone who actually DOES this sort of work in real life.There were a few less-than-perfect moments, such as the lecture where she repeatedly referred to the country East of Ghana as \"The Tongo\" (try Togo!), but for the most part her lectures were great - well organized and well prepared.She was generous with her time and good at communicating and answering questions outside of class.One of the highlights was actually a day when class was cancelled for students attending a conference; during class time she met those of us who were left at Starbucks, where we talked about career plans and picked her brain for advice and connections.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0The instructor had an obvious interest in and passion for evaluation, and this played out quite favorably in her teaching style; she had much enthusiasm for the class. She was also very willing to help students and meet with students outside of class; she always made herself available. Her feedback on assignments was useful and she would respond quickly to emails.No weaknesses come immediately to mind..",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0She has a lot of experience that MPH students could learn from. Also, she is very willing to help and answer students' questions.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Excellent and always willing to assist students about course questions or about working in the public health field."

   "comments": [
    "i would recommend this class to any student that plans on working with an organization in the public health field. the course material is applicable to virtually every aspect of public health careers.",
    "Absolutely! This course if different fromother courses at YSPH and that makes it great. It is realistic and provides you with a great toolkit to take into the workforce and into other classes and projects. Great instructor and small class are the icing on the cake.",
    "The class has a fairly light workload in the beginning, you can rely on the slides\/notes for the midterm. I would recommend that you start writing your final evaluation early, even in conjuncture with each section as they are presented in class. It is one of the few practically useful classes at YSPH and I am glad I took it.",
    "Learn how to evaluate a program and critically read articles. Write an evaluation and receive feedback",
    "It's a good course to have on your resume, but don't expect to enjoy class time or really be challenged.",
    "This is a good, practical course for people who might be going into community health programs, local health departments and other jobs where program evaluation would be a useful skill.The readings and lectures make for a good toolbox that I will take with me in the future.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for anyone looking for a more practical experience, and for anyone who wishes to do evaluation work in the future. HPA, SBS, and CDE students with an interest would benefit most, I think.",
    "Yes because any public health program needs to be evaluated to determine the effectiveness, and we get an opportunity to learn the skills to conduct effective evaluations."
