   "comments": [
    "This class is about DANTE and the DIVINE COMEDY. While I wasn't the biggest fan of lecture, Mazzotta is amazing and I do feel important and well-read now that I've studied The Divine Comedy.",
    "The Divine Comedy is something that I feel all people should read at some point, and there's no better person to learn it from than Professor Mazzotta. There's a lot of reading, but it's spread over a long period of time. The tests are manageable (you end up knowing the book really well) and the final paper isn't too bad. Definitely a class for Italian majors and Literature-likers alike.",
    "Take it because Professor Mazzotta is a very good lecturer. He brings the poem alive and almost lectures in a poetic style. Midterm, final paper, and final exam (which is just another midterm). I really enjoyed this class.",
    "Dante in Translation is a great way to read an important piece of literature. I definitely think you will take something away from the class more than if you read the poem on your own. However, dont go into it expecting that you will get a solid historical foundation as well. I learned, this is a literature class and not much else.",
    "Dante in Translation is all about the Divine Comedy. With the whole semester dedicated to only three books, the course goes in-depth into the epic, the context in which it was written, and (to some extent) fourteenth-century Italian history.",
    "Great way to read Dante's Commedia in the context of some of his shorter works (Vita Nuova, Monarchia). Not too much work, enjoyable and informative lectures.",
    "Italian 310 is an introductory course to Dante's Divine Comedy. In addition to being a literary course, it was also supported with history and political theory. At most, a student would be expected to read eight cantos per week, a very reasonable amount of work, with a lot of intellectual benefits. I highly recommend this course to all Yale students regardless of their major.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale. One of the college's best professors. If you care about beauty, truth, or the meaning of existence--take it. A joy of a class. Every lecture was a real delight. The professor is also incredibly friendly, so talk w him and learn from him!",
    "I would recommend this course if you have any interest in reading Dante or any type of medieval literature. It is structured well so that you will get something out of the reading if you attend class. However, if you are not completely sure if you are interested in this literature I would stay away as it might become rather tedious as the Comedy gets more abstract."
