    "It's a good class for EE majors and people interested in the field, but if you don't fall in one of those two categories, you'll be in over you're head.",
    "Solid class, you learn a lot. Don't take it if you have a lot on your schedule; this class is great if its your one tough class. Also, make sure you have free time to stay for all of lab and go to office hours.",
    "Pretty good class - I felt that I had learned a lot by the end, especially because the lab projects were interesting andapplicable to the theory studied in the class. I thought the labs and course in general were a huge improvement over EE200 (which I took with TP Ma). Many of the concepts that never really clicked in 200 clicked in this class. It was a lot of work though - long lab reports in addition to fairly challenging psets and a decent amount of lab time. Make sure you start the psets and labs early so you can ask Prof. Pan questions before they are due. You get to build a sound filter bank, a feedback circuit that controls a motor to follow a moving led light, and an AM radio transmitter lab. All were really cool projects with nice tangible functions. So overall, recommend if you don't have too hard of a course load.",
    "Essential for any EE major, but a significant amount of work."
