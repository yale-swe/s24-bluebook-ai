    "This course is really good. The department should offer more courses like this to help students get acquainted with certain research topics.",
    "The course was a great exposure to a range of topics in causal inference. Due to the nature of the course as primarily lecture-based, and because some of the material was quite complex, students gained a familiarity with many of the topics, without necessarily having a deep understanding of all of them. An alternative approach for future, similar reading courses could be to have students responsible for presenting or discussing some part of the material; processing material in this way would force students to internalize it in a different way than absorbing readings and lectures does."

    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Professor Crawford has a really wonderful facility for distilling complex topics to their core ideas, and presenting these in a clear, straightforward manner. In my experience this is very uncommon, and it greatly benefits his students.",
    "Instructor: Peter Michael Aronow \u00a0Professor Aronow has a strong commitment to pedagogy--it appears he really wants his students to think clearly about causal inference. He has a great understanding of the material and a very clear perspective. He is not always open to competing perspectives, however. While I think he is usually right, it might benefit students to understand why, for example, certain methods continue to be used in spite of evident flaws."

    "This course covered topics that would perhaps not be of interest to all students, but for those who would be interested in this material, I would easily recommend a similarly structured directed reading with Professors Crawford and Aronow."
