   "comments": [
    "This class ties in the whole policy curriculum. Materials are really interesting and pushes students to think of themselves as professionals. I loved the morality and persuasion concepts throughout the class.",
    "Hard work - but worth every minute! The organization and depth within the modules are engaging and really provide an excellent framework for making sense of our entire graduate school experience in public health policy. Lots of reading, but if you can get through it, you'll be better off for it!",
    "This class was very interesting and I felt like a good wrap-up of our time in the health policy program at YSPH. It was very reading intensive. I would have liked as a component of this course to have the policy faculty come speak on their specific research interests and how they related to the course.",
    "I think the capstone course was great. I thought the topics covered were both useful and important. I also felt that the course was directly relevant to me and my aspirations as a policy analyst. That being said, I could understand if some people thought the class was too theoretical and less applied than they would have hoped.",
    "I learned very little from this course. I would have done a thesis instead and got two credits for it and learned more. In my opinion, there is no rationale behind making this course mandatory. It is not a \"capstone\" in any sense. The writing assignments are a futile exercise. Students would benefit from a thesis or a policy\/management elective instead.",
    "This course is a perfect summary of the health policy experience. It provides students with an opportunity to look outside their narrow field of interest and discuss and think about health policy issues from multiple paradigms and angles.",
    "Great course with Mark, as always! Writing learning points on the board helps with the long lecture tremedously and help students to follow the material throughout the class. I appreciate how organized the course is, especially with the divided 3 parts of the course material. Even though we have a TA this year to help us with the final project, I think having more tangible deadlines throughout the semester would help greatly; such that the background is due this date, and the first argument is due this date. However, I can see the difficulties in implementing these checking points given everyone's topic is vastly different from each other and there is no standard writing format for this final project.",
    "Great class--sometimes it can get very cerebral and uselessly so, but a lot of the time you do learn good information for health policymaking",
    "The course was very interactive and engaging. The material is useful for those who see their life's work as incorporating policy analysis and advocacy. Course encourages us to think about the big picture in health policy analysis.",
    "I did not enjoy this course very much. It is tough because in our last semester, everyone is a bit 'checked out' and I felt that people didn't devote much effort or energy into this class. So that made classroom discussions unproductive. Beyond that, though, I didn't find the curriculum for the course to be very helpful to my future career. I don't think I will use the various policy paradigms in the future. It honestly felt like what we discussed in class about the different paradigms and about morality, etc, was not connected to the real world and not something I could take away with me into my career. I recommend that the curriculum for this course should be entirely re-vamped. My suggestion would be to look at the syllabus for Capstone courses at other public health schools and draw ideas from them. Alternatively, (and I might even prefer the following suggestion to looking at the Capstones at other schools), the classroom component of Capstone should be eliminated altogether and the Capstone should be made more like the thesis requirement of the other concentrations, with a larger, more in-depth, either research-based or exploratory policy proposal paper. On a final note, I recommend eliminating the ability to use laptops (this should honestly go for all classes at YSPH) ... because nearly everyone does things unrelated to class on their laptops and are not at all tuned in to class discussion.",
    "The course is interesting, useful, and taught in a way that encourages engagement from the students. One of the few classes where student participation is not only encouraged in the course, but also appears to have a significant influence on what is learned."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is such a great instructors. Super responsive and really concerned about student learning. He's a great facilitator.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Always awesome. Has a great way of taking people down a path of inquiry and exploration and letting them find their own thoughtful conclusions. Because he patiently guides students through critically thinking about topics, we truly walk away with a sense of experience contemplating topics; opposed to just being told what to think.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Always great, cares a lot about students, provides great feedback",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is very responsive to students and unbelievably knowledgable. I appreciate so much that he does all of his own grading and gives copious feedback.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Wonderful, gifted lecturer, learned a lot. Sometimes, assignments were not totally clear.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is an incredible professor, researcher, and mentor. We are all better public health policy practitioners because of him. Probably the best teacher i have ever had.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is awesome. He has superior knowledge of all topics covered, and those ran the gamut from religious morality to rational policy analysis. He forces students to take on different perspectives and trains them how to think. As always, he was an engaging lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I have no problems with Mark. He is a great professor, very knowledgeable and very entertaining. If the structure of the course were improved, I would enjoy his classes more.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a great professor. He is attentive, rigorous, and approachable. I've found that I have received the best feedback on assignments and approaches in my work from Mark in both this course and the Policy, Politics, and Governance course I took during my first year at YSPH. I would suggest Mark as one of the best professors at the school.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Great instructor. Learned a lot about U.S. health policy and its relationships to politics and a number of other concepts. Providing the mean, median, and\/or mode for an assignment can help students to assess how they are doing in the course.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a strong communicator; his assignments were challenging but very helpful in critically thinking about health policy.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Besides his impeccable taste in winter sweaters, Mark has the ability to instill in us meaning beyond the substance. This makes him in deserving of the highest honor! While all professors are knowledgeable in their own right, Mark is able to translate his wisdom where its understandable and thoughtful. He encourages his students to take vantage points outside our comfort zone, knowing that the best public health outcomes manifest from a discourse of perspectives. He consciously makes an effort for us resolute issues through the eyes of many. His insight has truly shaped this generation of public health professionals to contribute to a better world with empathy and thoughtful criticism. The best qualities, in my opinion, to walk away with.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Professor is very supportive of students and truly cares about our needs. A great instructor and mentor. Always works to stretch our imaginations",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a sweet person and always wants to help students. He is incredibly sensitive to our needs as students, and understands that we have many other demands on our time. He wants us to succeed and to excel at what we do, and is willing to meet with us to that end. However, I think that when teaching, Mark could do more to connect the topics to the real world, which is particularly important in an abstract course like Capstone. Also, he sometimes says, \"I know you won't have time to do all the reading,\" which might be true, but Mark shouldn't SAY that because it basically lets students know that he EXPECTS them not to do the reading, and then they do it even less than they did before!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0I really like that Mark doesn't use powerpoints. He is incredibly knowledgeable, yet able to impart knowledge at a level where his students can understand. He is exceptionally good at eliciting and incorporating student participation in the course, and is also exceptionally detailed in his feedback on assignments. The one criticism I would have is that the assignment instructions often feel vague at the offset. However, the assignments themselves are very helpful for learning the material."

    "This was a required course and I am not sure anyone takes it, who is not required to. It was very interesting and a nice end to our time at Yale.",
    "Do not recommend.",
    "The Policy Capstone course is where you are finally able to apply all of the knowledge, analysis, and policy framing concepts learned throughout the rest of the curriculum into practice. It gives you a chance to look at issues from a variety of paradigms, and allows you to really think and explore messaging, core policy issues, and put it all together. In essence, it is the perfect capstone to your experience, hence the name.",
    "Great course for any health policy student. It has improved my writing skills greatly. You get out however much you put into.",
    "The class is okay--the assignments are a lot more useful than the readings.",
    "Required for health policy students, but would encourage anyone who has an interest doing policy work in the future."
