    "I would recommend Math 112 for someone who needs a math course.",
    "Math 112 condenses everything you need for differential calculus into a semester. Weekly problem sets, 2 non-cumulative midterms and 1 cumulative final. Huge curves. Take it with Prof. Lachowska! She is awesome!",
    "Good basic foundation for calculus",
    "This was a great class to take if you have some previous experience with calculus.",
    "Take it if you've already taken Calculus before, or need it as a requirement for your major. Do not take it just for fun. I didn't know calculus at all, and neither did some other people who took the class, and it makes it difficult, but you can do well even if you'v never taken calculus before. It's a tough class either way though.",
    "I would recommend Math 112, especially for students who want to take Math 115. It is a well-taught course.",
    "it was a good introductory course to calculus, i would recommend it to those without a firm background in calculus",
    "I would absolutely recommend Math 112 to another student. The class is a prerequisite for many majors but additionally, it is a rewarding class. Lectures are spent going over example problems and the homework reinforces the material."
