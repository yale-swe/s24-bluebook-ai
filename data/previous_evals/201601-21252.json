   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Intro to Macroeconomics to a fellow student.",
    "I don't think its a good class at all. Only take it if you have to.",
    "A standard Intro Macro class. Lecture felt unnecessary as the book was pretty comprehensive and very easy to read. My TA (Yaniv) really broke down the pset problems for us, which was so incredibly helpful. He's a fantastic TA if you can get him. Tsyvinski has such a particular personality, which I loved but many others didn't. BEWARE: he will cold call you if you are on your cell phone during class, on Facebook on a laptop, are sitting in the balcony, etc. Stay alert, and stay off your tech and you should be good.",
    "Take it only if you have to. You take the intro courses so you can take the fun ones later, but its not really worth sticking it out if that means two semesters of intro and two semesters of intermediate if you weren't majoring in something that needs econ. As a standalone course, I don't know why anyone would want to take this for fun. If you have to take it, know you're in good hands and you too can tough it through like everyone else.",
    "This is a great class to take. Intro macro was a lot more interesting than intro micro, and you will learn a lot of basic general knowledge that everybody should know.",
    "This course is an introductory course in macro. For those deciding between this one and the intensive one, I would choose the latter. I took the intensive freshman micro course and though it was much more difficult, I learned a lot more. This class being so large and relaxed made me learn less Economics.",
    "Averagely good intro econ class. Nothing super exciting, about the same difficulty as Intro Micro. I feel like the lectures could have been more helpful. Had to do most of the learning from the book.",
    "This course gives you a nice econ background and tools to understand what is going on out there.",
    "Very standard Macro econ course. Would recommend for getting an introductory idea of economics.",
    "It's intro macro. If you can take it with Aleh, do so. He's a great guy and really does a great job of incorporating interesting studies with the lectures.",
    "Boring but necessary for econ major who don't want to take the seminar.",
    "To preface this review: I am normally a chill guy who doesn't have very high standards for what constitutes a good class. However, Intro Macro with Aleh Tsyvinski was the worst class I've ever taken. Going in, I was a prospective econ\/math major, but now I am simply a math major. There are many reasons why my passion for economics has been extinguished throughout this semester, but they all have to do with this class. To begin, Aleh is an incompetent teacher. I will give a few examples to illustrate this: 1. I have never seen him finish all of his lecture slides (which he pulls from the book) in one class; 2. He likes to cold-call people in a lecture hall of over 200 people (this wastes valuable class time) just because he thinks he is funny (but he is not), and awkwardly stands there as no one answers or laughs; 3. He does not teach macroeconomic concepts but instead tells us what has been on the news for the past century (especially during the Great Depression - we watched the inauguration of FDR during class one time even though it had nothing to do with what we were learning in class, although admittedly that was nothing much); 4. He is very arrogant and often delegates all the teaching to the TFs, who were quite good. In addition to Aleh's subpar teaching, there are also several aspects of course design that made my experience less than optimal. The homework, for example, often consisted of literally Googling for historical data, plugging it into Excel, and creating a graph - these data sets were often hard to find (e.g. \"wholesale price index of Great Britain from 1920-1940) and did not relate to what we had been talking about in class (which, admittedly, was often not much at all). In fact, our last problem set was literally looking up 14 financial crises and writing down facts about them. The midterm was nothing like problem sets, and grading for this class is frustrating because there's a preset curve (44% get A\/A-, etc.) so you can do really well on an easy test but still get a not-great grade because everyone else also did very well. The only alternative to this course, unfortunately, is a seminar that has limited enrollment, but if you must take this class, just know what you're getting into. I guess the one positive of this course is that it opened my mind to all of the other wonderful options that Yale offers.",
    "It's a pretty easy class. Unfortunately, that means everyone does well on the midterm, so do study! If you think this is going to involve math, you're wrong - only about half the chapters even pretend to be quantitative, and most of the rest is about models that don't really work in the real world. I found this annoying, but if you enjoy the complexity of trying to describe how the world works, then you'll like macro. No reason not to take it. Enjoy!",
    "Yes. Fairly easy except those impossible PSets",
    "This class gets the job done. It fulfills the macro requirement and prepares you if you are planning to do more macro later. I would not recommend it as a fun class, because it can be boring and is hard to study for.",
    "A big lecture course with a really tough preset curve for grades. The midterm median was a 28\/30. Take it if you know you want to be an econ major or as a prereq for another major. It's not very exciting or fun. Very different from AP Macro",
    "Good class for economics majors",
    "I would! The subject matter is very important for any citizen to know!",
    "It is all in the title. We got some monetary policy, some financial markets, some basic theory, and not too much math. I actually wish there were more math involved.",
    "ECON 116 is an introduction to all the state of affairs that go on in an economy. It gives you a basic understanding of long term economic growth, the business cycle, stabilization policy, debt, fiscal and monetary policy, the financial system, consumption, investments, etc... Studying for the final, I began to make connections between all the units we did in class. However, in class each lecture felt separated from the previous one and I do not believe professor Tyvinski talked much about how to reconcile all these different viewpoints of the economy.",
    "Survey of Macroeconomics. Helps you understand the world better.",
    "This is a good Econ course. Stay on top of the reading and pay attention in class--you can miss a lot just by going on facebook for a few minutes. You'll enjoy Aleh.",
    "Take it for the ECON major. It's kind of interesting but don't take it you dislike Economics. Not essential to life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone who likes economics, or even someone who just is interested, especially if Prof. Tsyvinski is teaching.",
    "Good class. Read the textbook-it takes time but it's the best way to learn the material.",
    "Great introduction to macroeconomics. I would recommend this course - the coursework is not too much though the final was tricky. Overall an interesting class that is very well taught and has phenomenal TAs.",
    "Any student who had to take Econ, definitely. Very doable as long as you stay up to date with the Psets.",
    "Necessary intro class. Material is interesting and useful, although I was personally not a fan of the professor's style. You need to self-teach a lot. Also, the structure of the class makes it really unfair in terms of grades (you can study very hard and still get a bad grade).",
    "It's a required course if you're an econ major but don't worry, it's a great course! The material is not too difficult.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The material is interesting, and if you have the right TF, very well taught. Problem Sets can be tedious sometimes, especially when compiling economic data, but the class overall was a very positive experience.",
    "Worth taking because there's interesting material with a fun lecturer. Work is basically just doing a pset each Sunday night, and they're graded (for me at least) for completion.",
    "Econ 116 teaches a wide variety of economic models useful for understanding economic history, as well as interpreting current economic events. I would recommend it as understanding monetary and fiscal policy is very useful to any endeavor.",
    "Solid if you want to Econ",
    "I think this is a good class for someone who just wants to learn the basics of macroeconomics - pretty standard course.",
    "It's a requirement for a lot of majors and a tough class, but it's interesting content and has lots of real-world applications.",
    "yes",
    "Good class, make sure to go over lecture slides before tests and look at PSETS.",
    "Great Econ class",
    "Interesting course with basic lecture format.",
    "Take it if you have to but not a fun gut at all. Solidified for me that I don't want to study econ in the future.",
    "ECON 116 was a so so class. Totally overhyped. Aleh was not that great of a teacher. He was funny, but that's about all. His accent was hard to follow at times. He refused to post solutions, have office hours, or tell us what would be tested. Basically it was study everything for the final. The class was one of the most poorly run classes I've taken at Yale. No homework solutions were posted, and the exam looked like it was thrown together the night before. What saved the class were the TAs. They were extremely organized, helpful, and dedicated. Don't take it with Aleh. If you do, just skip lectures and read the book.",
    "Maybe. The test was easy so the curve was bad",
    "How the markets affect each other.",
    "Its fine. Aleh can be pretty funny at times, material is obv pretty dry at times but good for what it is. Wouldnt recommend taking unless youre required to.",
    "Take this class only if you need to or are really interested in economics. Not worth your time otherwise.",
    "A good introduction to macroeconomics, although the lectures were not particularly engaging.",
    "Only take it if your an Econ major",
    "ECON 116 is a class that you are required to take if you are in any way shape or form considering Economics as your major. Unfortunately, this was one of the worst classes I have taken so far at Yale. Aleh is not a great professor. He pretty much reads off the slides, leaves a lot of material for the TFs to teach, and focuses too much on current research. The tests were too easy (making the curve extremely hard since those who studied and those who didn't study pretty much scored the same on all the tests). This course depends a lot on your TF. I had a not-so-great TF, which made the course a lot more difficult. Psets in general were also unhelpful, as much of it just consists of searching up data and graphing it in excel. Overall, I feel like I learned from this course, but more so from my peers and the textbook. Lectures were boring and drab. Unfortunately, there are not many options out there, so if you have to take this course, just be aware.",
    "This is a standard introductory macroeconomics course that closely follows Mankiw's textbook. The psets are very reasonable and the course becomes more stressful during exam periods. It is a requirement to take the intermediate economics courses and for the economics major.",
    "A necessary class for understanding the basics of Macroeconomics, but not overly interesting.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course unless you have to take it for a prerequisite, because the material was just so dry.",
    "A Intro Macro class that lives up to its name. Not incredibly enthralling but gets the basics down and is not too challenging.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in economics. Although it is certainly helpful to have prior experience, most of the concepts are easy to understand if all the homework assignments are done.",
    "It is a good course. Not as gutty as I was expecting, and I found out that we were learning some of the same concepts as my friends in Intermediate Macro, so that was weird. But we learned a lot of applicable life skills and the content was much more interesting than macro.",
    "Econ 116 provides an informative and important foundation in macroeconomics concepts. Lectures are entertaining and provide valuable real-world context for the principals and theories discussed. Homework assignments and examinations were always thoughtfully designed and accurately reflected the most important topics of the class. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students who need Intro Macro as a major requirement.",
    "I would consider this a normal intro macro course. I would recommend taking it. It definitely requires some work put into it.",
    "Good course, especially for someone with no macro knowledge previous. If you've taken macro in high school, skip this course.",
    "It's intro macro. You likely need to take it. Sometimes the homework feels like busy work. But overall it's ok.",
    "Much more fun than macro. Professor Tsyvinski was wonderful- funny, engaging, and passionate. Be careful though, he sometimes cold calls people who aren't paying attention.",
    "I would, because it is very practical and helps people understand the general ideas in the newspaper.",
    "I would recommend taking the seminar version if they can because the lecture is difficult for questions and interactive learning.",
    "Good class - important to take. Take with Tsyvinski.",
    "Great intro to Macroeconomics and a good course, even for non-Econ majors.",
    "Pretty basic course, but ok if you've never taken macroeconomics before.",
    "If they need econ credit",
    "It is very tough, but rewarding.",
    "I would strongly recommend students not to take this course, I learned almost nothing and the lack of direction in assignments lead to lots of undue stress for almost no benefit.",
    "Econ 116 offered a solid introduction to the world of macroeconomics. The lectures were clear and engaging, the pests were straightforward, and the exams were fair. Professor Tsevinsky is very knowledgeable about the subject and cogently communicated the key principles of the course. Moreover, his inclusion of academic research papers and policy questions brought the material to life. Be warned that there are only two exams (worth 80% of your grade collectively), which means the pressure to perform on each exam is high. Overall, however, I definitely recommend this course. Understanding macroeconomics is essential for making sense of the world.",
    "Despite being an introductory non-mathematical macroeconomics course, it was well-taught and overall, a good experience due to Professor Tsyvinski. Strengths: (1) Professor Tsyvinski is a gem. Firstly, he is a super effective lecturer because he is a commanding public speaker and has a great sense of humor. Secondly, he engages a class of about 300 students by asking random people questions which I think goes far to prevent us from sleeping\/we have to be on our toes. If someone cant answer his questions, there are never any consequences. Thirdly, he is surprisingly committed to an intro macro class. He cares about the students, is very organized about exams, problem sets, discussions etc. Most importantly, he tries to enrich a boring introductory macro lesson with a range of super interesting knowledge and economics research. A few highlights including the importance of institutions in economics (North v South Korea), a whole lesson on the economics of Game of Thrones (in which the class had a discussion with the professor i.e. mainly me), modern emerging climate change economics and a deep study of the Great Depression. Professor Tsyvinski is a model of a professor who knows how ineffective lectures can be and he goes the extra mile to make them engaging and interesting to combat that problem. (2) Some of the problem sets were quite educational and most were very easy if you read the material. There was a big emphasis on learning how to effectively use Excel for data analysis and visualization (very basic but still useful) and learning about major historical and current world events such as bitcoin, the Asian financial crash etc. He made the content worth studying about. (3) The class is very easy. (4) The slides material was very clear and easy to follow - no additional reading was required (although personally I felt that there shouldve been more incentives to read the book). Even if you miss a few lectures, you can figure things out using the slides. (5) The slides material and some examples in the book are also very interesting e.g. money supply during the French Revolution, FDRs speech, the Fourth Industrial Revolution etc. Weaknesses: (1) There was a massive difference among the TAs. Most of the TAs were really really bad at teaching and just not in touch with the material\/didnt prepare for office hours\/Section\/email questions. The head TA was Antoine who was decent but sometimes difficult to follow. The best was definitely Sebastian, whose concepts were crystal clear and he was very good with answering questions. (2) Most of the math in the class is quite dubious and some of the problem set answers took a very questionable approach. When they werent dubious, the questions were too easy and basic plug and chug. (3) The exams need to be harder if the instructors hop eot distinguish among the students. (4) Since the math is so dubious, it might be sensible to add more conceptual\/essay-type questions with analysis and commentary. (5) The last exam is 50% of the grade and too much. It being cumulative also doesnt help since the material of the Midterm is essentially re-tested in the final exam. In fact, there was no attempt to connect the material and ask overarching questions - the final was literally composed of one exam for before Midterm material, a break in between and then one exam for after Midterm material. Instead, the Midterm should be made 40%, same as the final. The final should then be non cumulative.",
    "Econ 116 is an interesting class that teaches the basic principles of macroeconomics. It was cool to see how the concepts we learned in class related to real life events, and I definitely have a much better understanding of how the economy works as a whole. The class was difficult and sometimes tedious, however overall it was a great experience.",
    "Yes i would recommend for a student looking for basic econ. Dense material but I learned alot.",
    "I mean unless you are an economics major or forced to take this, skip the intro classes and take better econ classes."
