    "I improved my reading skills and stamina in Mandarin, I read a ton of really good Chinese fiction, and I learned hundreds and hundreds of characters.",
    "It's a good class, check out the syllabus on the first day of class to see if you're interested in the readings for that semester. If you're interested in the readings you'll probably like the class. Su Lao Shi ties in a lot of history\/current events, which is interesting as well.",
    "I gained invaluable Chinese reading comprehension skills and essay writing skills.",
    "Over the course of this class, I developed stronger critical thinking skills in Chinese and became more familiar with influential literature. I was able to practice reading traditional characters and learned more vocabulary and grammar structures throughout the duration of the course."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: a really wonderful set of readings, Su Laoshi is a engaged, lively teacher with lots of his own stories to tell, the workload is fairly reasonable Weaknesses: I wish there were more clarity on assignments, as I felt like I never knew whether I was doing the right homework or handing in all the assignments that I should be handing in",
    "This class is usually small and discussion based, which is nice.",
    "I like how the class closely follows the syllabus given you at the beginning of the semester so there are no surprises and you always know how to prepare for the class. I also loved the course materials for this class; all of the readings Professor Su Wei picks are incredible and will allow you to obtain a deeper knowledge of Chinese history, culture, and current politics. The class also increases in difficulty as the semester goes on, but the workload is very manageable and Professor Su Wei provides a lot of support.",
    "This is a strong course that was well-enjoyed by its students. Due to the fact that I was the only non-heritage speaker in the course, I occasionally felt like a stronger focus on teaching language would have helped me improve my skills. That being said, being able to learn content as compelling as the readings we did in Chinese was a pleasure."

   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent course to take if you're interested in reading Chinese fiction and hearing some wonderful life stories from Su Laoshi. I personally found it extremely difficult because I don't think my Mandarin reading level was high enough. I was in class with students who were much more fluent than me, and so struggled to keep up.",
    "Yes -- it's a good class. Interesting texts, not too hard work load, interesting stories from Prof Su.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Professor Su Wei is incredible and well-known in the department and amongst Chinese language learners at Yale for a reason. If you are taking Chinese here, you have to take a class with him before you graduate!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is interesting and well-designed."
