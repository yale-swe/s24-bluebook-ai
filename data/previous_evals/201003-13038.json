   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course for someone coming out of L4 or a freshman placing into L5 who doesn't feel quite ready to be reading entire novels or doesn't know what focus in literature to take. It's a good exposure to different styles of great authors and practice in discussing literature.",
    "This was an excellent course. It covers a broad range of French literature, most importantly the foundational texts that one might not have read coming from a non-natively French context. Moreover, it addresses the authors and texts both individually and given their context within the larger French literary tradition. It is a class founded upon in class discussion, and the seminar was consistently rewarding, excepting the few days when it was quite clear that few present had done the reading. I would encourage anyone interested in this sort of broad overview to take the class, and I intend as a result of the class to take more French literature courses.",
    "great do it.",
    "Meh, the class is ok. The reading is manageable if you don't have much work from your other classes and you have plenty of time to read it. The work load was really low (3 short papers and an oral final exam, plus a couple of random assignments) and Professor Semk doesn't demand more than average performance from students (there is an option to rewrite 2\/3 papers and he gives you questions to prepare for the oral final) so basically you can get through the class with minimal reading and be fine.I wouldn't take it unless you are particularly passionate about French lit.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in French. You'll get a broad introduction to French literature from across a wide range of genres and time periods (texts vary by semester, but we read things by Montaigne, Moli\u00e8re, Baudelaire, Camus, Voltaire, and many others). You'll also get to work on your academic writing in French. There's a lot of reading followed by in-class discussion of the reading; overall an excellent experience, very definitely recommended.",
    "This is a great course for a student who wants to move beyond straight up language education and into using the language for literary analysis.",
    "I would recommend the course. The work is consistent and evenly-spaced, and it provides a wonderful introduction to French literature that can be built upon from a variety of angles (philosophy, further literary studies, history, and theater)."
