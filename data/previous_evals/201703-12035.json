   "comments": [
    "We covered a bunch of different topics. This was a great way to be introduced to the political science faculty.",
    "Good overview of the field and the department.",
    "I thought this class was a great introduction to the professors in the department and it has given me a sense of what they enjoy working on. I feel like, beyond the handful of IR and CP professors I knew by reputation when I came to Yale, I didnt really have a sense of who else was here and what projects they were pursuing. I feel like I have a better sense of that now. I also thought it was helpful for preparing students for workshops. Ive heard from students in other years that when they took the class, the discussions were often about methodology and process -- and I do wish there had been more of that -- but the fact that we were engaging with the professors on the substance of their work feels like it will be good training for evaluating other research.",
    "I was introduced to a number of faculty in the department",
    "Knowledge: A broad understanding of the different subfields of political science, as well as the department here at Yale. Skills: Ability to read political science writings outside of my main subfields.",
    "It was hugely valuable to be exposed to the work of faculty members in the department. It was also helpful to learn how to formulate and ask questions in a classroom setting at the graduate level.",
    "I was able to read broadly over several different subfields in political science. I also appreciated the opportunity to become better acquainted with the faculty and my cohort through the evaluation and discussion of the course texts.",
    "The course was very useful as an introduction to the Yale political science department and the professional requirements of a career in political science. It also provided a great introduction to the variety of research currently being conducted in the discipline.",
    "The course introduced us to the work of faculty in the department and that was interesting.",
    "I learned an enormous amount about how the faculty in the department view their work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Was good as an introduction to the Yale faculty, but more could be done to make it an introduction to the field of political science.",
    "Bringing in more methods faculty members might have led to more debates on methodological debates on the field (which were to me among the most interesting parts of the class). I felt that the class worked better when the discussions flew more freely - I understand there is a trade-off with getting everyone involved, but there might be a compromise in limiting the \"free-flowing\" debate to 5-10 minutes, or in grouping the questions and letting multiple students to ask theirs before the answer. An overview of the subfields and methods at the beginning of the class would be useful.",
    "The greatest strength of the course is the way it facilitates a dialogue between new students and the faculty. Which is why I was at times frustrated by how stilted the conversations could feel. I understand the need to encourage all students to participate, but I wish the format had been more conversational than reading prepared questions. I enjoyed the sessions most where those questions led to follow-up questions and a good report with the professor.",
    "there's a trade-off between ensuring that all members participated in the class and allowing conversations to progress in interesting and natural ways.",
    "Strengths: Covered a lot of different topics\/subfields in a substantively meaningful way. Weakness: The Q&A format could be restructured (or de-structured) in my opinion.",
    "While it was very useful to hear about recent and ongoing work within the Department at Yale, I found that the course did not systematically introduce me to the discipline of political science (i.e. subfields, methodologies, controversies, history of the discipline). I would recommend either re-titling the course to \"Introduction to the Yale Political Science Department\" (to temper expectations) or to modify the syllabus to more accurately reflect the current title, \"Introduction to Politics.\"",
    "The strength of the course is in the introduction to the graduate study of political science. The course assigned readings that I would otherwise not have been familiar with. The weakness of the course is related to its structure. Some of the classes had rich discussion, others did not. In the classes that had the richest discussion, the flow of the class was often interrupted with the rigidity of answering questions from the students that were on a different topic. In those instances, enabling the discussion to continue instead of referring back to the originally submitted questions may facilitate greater learning.",
    "Discussions regarding how to interact with and professionalize yourself in the discipline were useful. Discussions of methodology pluralism, as well as the strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate uses of particular methodological approaches were also helpful, but perhaps not frequent enough and not encompassing of all possible approaches. I would have liked presentations by more methodologists (both quantitative and qualitative), and possibly to have one quantitative and one qualitative methodologist debate the strengths, weaknesses, and possible interactions of their approaches together. It also may have been helpful to guide discussions back on track with more frequency, as discussions at times strayed into overly narrow territory.",
    "The course was aimed to introduce us to the department as well as the discipline, and I think it accomplished that.",
    "More open discussion would be welcome, as would a more straightforward introduction to political sciences' subfields."
