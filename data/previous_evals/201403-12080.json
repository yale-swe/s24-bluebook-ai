    "Definitely take it! Especially, if you have not taken literature classes yet. The seminar makes you want to take more literature classes.",
    "Take it! Great syllabus, great discussion, great professor - what more can one ask for in a literature seminar? Professor Grigoryan is extremely caring. Her professional\/literary acuity is quite evident; what may not be salient to people who have not taken one of her courses is just how invested she is in discussion. She has a remarkable talent for crafting engaging, organic discussion that keeps everyone interested and eliminates the need for hollow commentary. I was also able to get assistance - talk about a facet of some work, clarify arguments in a paper, etc. - very easily. This class is a gem!",
    "Great reading list with a completely reasonable amount of work",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone regardless of major. The reading of this class is very interesting and the books are interconnected in terms of content and social background. Professor Grigoryan is amazing. She leads the discussion very effectively and always tries to engage everyone in the seminar. She is always willing to help during office hours. She definitely makes this class one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. The reading list is incredible and Professor Grigoryan is awesome. The quality of discussion will depend on the other students in the class, but I can't imagine it being anything other than wonderful. The reading is also not insubstantial but the books are so good it hardly feels like work reading them!"
