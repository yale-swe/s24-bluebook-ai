    "If you liked 301 and 305, the material will a bit of review of 305, and the rest will be some really beautiful theory. Some of the professors who have taught 320 in recent years have been pretty bad, so I would go with Margulis if you can. He isn't the best, but his lectures are well thought out and easy to follow.",
    "It is fairly interesting, definitely harder than other courses earlier in the real analysis track but doable if you like the subject and did ok in 305.",
    "This course had two parts: a careful treatment of abstract measure and integration theory in the beginning, and a general survey of functional analysis, together with a peek at probability theory at the end. The material is quite nice, in my opinion. There are some delta-epsilon arguments here and there, but somehow at this level of abstraction, much of the nastiness associated with analysis on R disappears. If you have taken 305, this will be a continuation\/generalization of the Lebesgue theory developed there. For me, this was illuminating, as it underscored the essential properties that measures and integrals have. I highly recommend this course, especially if Prof. Margulis teaches it in the future. Though measure theory can be dry at times, the theory discussed in this course is still quite nice, and foundational from what I understand. Professor Margulis is an excellent teacher as well. Be sure to listen to his background commentary as well as the main presentation -- he drops gems from time to time.",
    "It's exactly what you'd think- a canonical course in measure theory. You learn all the relevant material, which takes plenty of work. If you want a grad math class or if you like analysis, it's great."
