   "comments": [
    "Its a great course that gives a very broad knowledge of the field of LGBT studies. It is heavily focused on the US, so it makes for an interesting sexuality studies course even for an American studies major. I would definitely recommend it for someone who wants a crash-course style in LGBT studies. However, it is a lot of work (plenty of readings that need to actually be read).",
    "An excellent course in queer theory, but not a great introductory course for students with no background in LGBT issues. I would recommend Chauncey's U.S. Lesbian and Gay History for that instead. It would be more logical to take WGSS296 after learning some history.",
    "LGBT studies is one of the best courses I've ever taken. I was SO disappointed to discover that Montegary is only a visiting professor. If you get a chance to take any of her courses next semester (or if she returns), I HIGHLY recommend it. She cares about her students, has a sincere passion for teaching and is incredibly enlightening, even for those who have little experience with theory. She takes complex information and information and makes them accessible and understandable. Take this or any other course Montegary teaches, no matter what!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the material is very interesting. Even if you have already taken a couple of WGSS classes before, you will probably learn something new and gain a new way of looking at things, especially with respect to intersectionality.",
    "Take this class! At first I confused this for the US Lesbians and Gays History course, but after shopping period I was very pleased with this class and decided to stay. The professor is great: very enthusiastic, helpful, and approachable. The course readings aren't too overwhelming, although some readings can be harder to grasp than others; the professor did an excellent job of unraveling the difficult theories, however. If you are at all interested in queer studies, this is an excellent course to take.",
    "Modified lecture with lots of in-class discussion. Definitely recommend!!! Extremely current. Opportunities to find your voice in the debates. Very important topic.",
    "WGSS 296 is a survey class that takes an interdisciplinary approach to topics in LGBT studies. The class begins with a theoretical component which frames the concerns of the following readings on the nation, ethnicity, capitalism, globalization, medicine, law, and academia. The theoretical component deals with the production and regulation of sexuality. The topical readings (and films) lend themselves very well to discussion and to the application of concepts regarding the production and regulation of sexuality through institutions and racial formations.This was a very good class. If you are looking for a comprehensive introduction to LGBT studies and some freedom to apply what you have learned to your own areas of interest, then consider taking this course.",
    "This class is NOT something you should take just because you are a gay person and think that for some reason means it is a gut. It should probably not be your first WGSS course; the \"intro\" name is misleading. Make sure queer theory is actually something you want to engage with before you sign up. (Hint: there will probably be people as cranky as me, and if you are not on the same page it will be a very tense, unhappy semester.)That said, the material is life-changingly awesome."
