    "Might have been better as a 40-person seminar-style class than as a 150+ student lecture, but if you're interested in health in low- and middle-income countries, this is the class for you. It's pretty straightforward, especially if you know a bit about the subject already. The policy briefs are straightforward if you pay attention to what Skolnik tells you to do. If possible, finish the first one a week or two ahead of time and ask your TA to revise it. It'll put you in a good place to ace the rest of them.",
    "I would recommend this class as more as eye-opener to the situation in the world today in terms of health.",
    "Good class. The material can seem repetitive, but overall you will come away with a broad understanding of the global burden of disease and how to best allocate funds to solve these problems.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in how to make the world a better place.",
    "HLTH 230 is a basic overview of global health. You'll learn about what makes people sick and what people die from in low and middle income countries. You won't spend much time talking about high income countries. I would recommend the class - you'll learn a lot about the world and gain a new perspective that you might not have had the chance to learn otherwise.",
    "Easy to understand, not that heavy on the workload, but you should definitely keep up with the readings. The prof is amazing and it's a must-take if you are even remotely interested in the subject.",
    "HLTH 230 is a fantastic course, and if you're interested in learning more about global health, I'd definitely recommend taking it. Professor Skolnik is extremely kind, accessible, and knowledgable. He wrote the textbook the class uses, shares tons of insightful and funny anecdotes from his professional experiences, and provides thoughtful answers to any questions you may have. Even though there were about 200 students in the class, he made an effort to get to know all of us and call on everyone by name. Remarkably, he also was always happy to meet outside of class to discuss anything school or career related. Lastly, the workload is reasonable, the exams are fair, and the writing briefs are very rewarding.",
    "Approach with caution. If you know nothing about global health, have never taken a public health class before, and particularly if you come from a place of privilege and want to get a good introduction to a lot of real-world problems, this class is definitely worth taking. I don't say that to discourage people from taking it, I really think the topics covered are important, and I definitely took a lot away from the class, and for people who really have no clue where to start but understand that they really should know more about health issues on a global scale, this is a really, really good place to start. However, I think a lot of people who are interested in these kinds of topics would probably have some trouble relating to Professor Skolnik and his teaching style, and there are plenty of other courses offered (I heard Health of the Public is good) you might be better off taking. That being said, I got a summer opportunity out of this class and a really cool TF, and I learned how to write really good policy briefs, so I'd say my experience in the class was worth the time I put in, just not the best class I've ever taken.",
    "An incredible course. Take it if you have any interest in the topic whatsoever and you will be happy you did. Really incredible material with a professor who has spent his life devoted to making these changes happen. This class is all about application. The policy briefs are an interesting exercise and definitely worth the time to learn how to do well. They are generally manageable and a nice way to help your grade. Tests are also not too hard. It is hard sometimes to know how to study for this class, though.",
    "I had heard incredible things about this course from friends who were interested in public health. The caveat was that they took the course when it was a small seminar and I took it when it was a 140 person lecture. I am not sure what made the course so incredible as a seminar, but I was not particularly inspired by the lectures. While Professor Skolnik is extremely dedicated, accessible, and enthusiastic, his lectures were not clearly organized and he often rambled without providing information that was unique from his textbook. In all honesty, the textbook was the course. Merely reading and studying the textbook and using the Global Burden of Disease Heat Maps online to understand which conditions affected which regions would have easily substituted the lectures. The course is also over-intuitive and many complex issues seem to be almost over simplified by the explanations about a few determinants to health (poverty, education, socioeconomic status, etc.). This course\/textbook lacked a critical framework that grounded many of its claims and instead relied on large numbers of policy briefs to illustrate arguments about the nature of health issues. If you are interested in an introductory Global Health course for the Global Health Fellows program or just interested in knowing more about the field, shop this course and Professor Radin's course Historical Perspectives on Global Health and choose accordingly. If Professor Radin's course had been offered this semester, I may have preferred it as an alternative to Health 230.",
    "A good class that could probably be 3 weeks shorter... I felt at times that we could have condensed the lectures and still gained the same insights in less time.",
    "Provides a World Bank perspective on global health issues. Focus on the burden of disease and health statistics. You don't cover the issues in depth. Policy briefs must be written in a very specific style.",
    "Richard Skolnik is one of the most accessible professors I have ever met. He is an absolute expert in his field, and taking a class with him is an awesome opportunity. His readings are not too demanding (make sure to keep up) and his lectures are fun and engaging. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "This class was great and I would definitely recommend it! The content was extremely interesting, Skolnik is engaging, and the TAs are dedicated. I loved this class. Section for this class was fantastic. It is clear that Skolnik and the TAs work really hard to make sure that each class is engaging and interesting. Most sections were directed towards coming up with solutions for real world problems, which I really enjoyed. I think on a whole the class provides a very interesting lens to look at the world through, particularly if you've never taken any sort of global health class.",
    "Very basic course, gives you a good overview of global health at an introductory level. Appropriate level of work and expectations are made clear. Overall a very good course. Skolnik is a great professor to have as he really cares about his students and makes himself available for extra help\/summer internship finding\/general advice.",
    "I would definitely recommend Global Health 230-it is a great class to introduce you to the realm of global health, and the professor is awesome. The workload is manageable, and as long as you pay attention in class (which is hard not to!) and read the material, you can do well.",
    "HLTH 230 is a good intro global health class. It gives you the basics. I don't know if I would recommend it--sometimes lectures were boring and difficult to sit through. That said, I do think the material is important and everyone should have a basic understanding of global health as it affects all of us.",
    "Health 230 is a great introductory\/survey course in global health. Take it especially if you want a very policy-oriented approach to global health and to gain broad understanding of the global burden of disease.",
    "Go over the core problems in Global Health",
    "Absolutely the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. The material was somewhat worthwhile but the teaching was really awful. The large lecture format does not work for Skolnik's teaching style. Each class ended up being about 20 minutes of actual teaching and 55 painful minutes of listening to Skolnik call on his 5 favorite students and have them answer yes or no questions taken from the textbook. Often the attitude expressed by professor Skolnik made me very uncomfortable, particularly regarding race and culture. One direct quote from class: \"Ethnic stereotyping is allowed in this class!\" In my opinion, this type of \"joke\" is inappropriate. I did not learn very much in the class, and everything useful I did learn I could have gotten from about 3 hours of browsing the WHO website.",
    "The class is a great intro to the field of global health both for students who have no prior knowledge and are just discovering their interest and for those who are passionate and have already traveled the world performing health-related tasks. You will learn from both your classmates and Professor Skolnik, who is awesome and knows it. I would definitely suggest it if you have any interest in the field!",
    "I would highly recommend this class for another student, it has reasonable pacing and workload and is extremely interesting. I enjoyed sitting in lecture so much and felt like I also learned a lot just by listening to Professor Skolnik talk. If you are uncomfortable with a cold-calling format perhaps reconsider. But if you have any interest in global health please take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student who is interested in global health but has not had much exposure. It gives you a really good overview of what's going on in the field of global health, and how these issues can be addressed.",
    "Great introduction to global health. This class covered the most prominent health problems and interventions in today's world. It is essential if you plan on going into global health, as it provides a foundation and different ways to analyze and solve global health problems (from economic, social, cultural, and policy perspectives, etc.). Professor Skolnik is an entertaining lecturer--well he doesn't really even lecture, a lot of the class is comprised of him asking students questions and leading discussion. Because of his teaching style, there is never a dull moment. I learned a lot about global health that I'm sure will be useful in any health or development career I go into.",
    "Yes! HLTH 230 is perfect for anyone with even the smallest interest in health studies. It provides a great introductory overview and is rewarding to all who put the effort and work into the course.",
    "This is a great class for getting an introduction to the health of the world. Though you may not realize it, you end up learning a lot of information that you can even use in everyday situations. The policy briefs that you have to write for the class are structured and not difficult and are surprisingly fun to research and write. My TA was very informative and engaged in helping us use the information in real-world scenarios. The only thing I did not like about the class was that even though it's a lecture course, there is an attendance policy, and Skolnik happens to know when you're not there and may or may not email your dean about it. Also, he is very vague about what the midterm and final will cover, so just be sure to read the book well.",
    "Good course, highly recommended. It's straightforward - read the textbook, get familiar with the trends, pay attention to the formula for the policy briefs (because it is a formula) and you'll be fine. Tests are pretty basic in that if you do all the textbook reading you'll be fine, but he does throw in some specific questions that could be the difference between an A and an A- or B+, so study a lot for the final (from the textbook - the online readings are less important) because it's 40% of your grade. It's a really interesting course and I think incredibly useful for everybody. Knowing about contemporary global health issues will make you think about the world that much differently. Especially if you're interested in public health, medicine, international studies, etc., this course will undoubtedly be beneficial for your development as a student and person. Lectures aren't terribly necessary since they are not mandatory and Skolnik doesn't go over anything that could not be learned from the readings, but they can be fun and interesting and offer cool random insights like a book you should read, or a story you might look into, or a research paper topic for another class (this happened to me twice). Plus the guest lecturers are all AWESOME. Skolnik will try his best to get to know everyone in the 130+ class. He prides himself on being accessible in a way that most Yale professors are not, and I found this to be true, especially if you're in a department that is not chock full of small seminars (e.g. English or art history or something). Take advantage of this. Talk to him about your career plans (if you plan on pursuing global\/public health in some capacity) because he has very practical and blunt advice, which is refreshing. He's also a lot more personable in these one-on-one meetings, because at times he comes off a touch arrogant in lecture (but to his credit, he is very accomplished and is just very aware of it). He has lots of connections and wants to help his students. Again, take it if you're even thinking about it. The workload is very manageable, and I found it to be a good 5th class. Just make sure you really know what to do for the policy briefs - i.e. be CONCISE, follow the formula he states for you in class, and don't stray from it in the slightest. While following a formula for writing can feel a bit constricting, the TA's are good at making sure you do learn how to be concise and direct, and such policy brief-writing skills are useful and transferable to other forms of writing.",
    "This is definitely a great way to get a WR credit. A lot of students think that the class is very eye opening, but this is more so if you haven't read much news\/wikipedia\/other stuff and haven't read about how prevalent global health issues are in the world. With the policy briefs, the most important thing is to make sure that you put the right information in the right section. Don't trust the model briefs for these that are on the v2 website. For the midterm and final, the best thing to do is read the book (besides pay attention in class), and try to keep track of some relative sense with the numbers\/statistics even though they're a bit overwhelming.",
    "If you're potentially interested in global health or anything health related, I'd highly recommend this class. It personally helped me decide that global health was definitely a field I could see myself dedicating my life towards. Furthermore, this class does not need any pre-requisites so everyone is on the same page at the beginning of the semester.",
    "This is a great course to take if you are interested in learning about the field of Global Health. Professor Skolnik has extensive experience working with the World Bank and is incredibly knowledgeable. The workload was very light-- weekly discussion section, one midterm, one final, and three policy briefs (5 pages double-spaced each). Overall, a very easy writing credit. Grading was straight forward and it is not difficult to do well in this course. There were a lot of readings (textbook and supplementary readings)-- while the supplementary readings were very interesting, they definitely are not necessary as the textbook and lectures are very comprehensive. That being said, in general I was very disappointed with this class. Having read the past reviews, I came in with very high expectations for this class. However, many of the concepts that we covered were obvious (poor people from rural communities who are marginalized have poorer health than those urban people of higher wealth quintiles, lower income countries have poorer quality health services, maternal and neonatal health are extremely important)-- and were (rather frustratingly) repeated over and over again. We also learned about global health problems and solutions in very general terms (vaccine programs are a global health best buy, insecticide treated nets are important against malaria), and it would have been more valuable if we had examined case studies of specific global health intervention programs. Overall, I don't feel as though I learned much from this class. Classroom participation felt very forced, with Professor Skolnik insisting on name cards and calling on students to answer very simple questions.",
    "You should definitely strongly consider this class. It teaches you a lot in a concept-based way. The only issue is that it's an enormous time drain to read all the articles and write the policy papers and study for the data-intensive midterm\/final. Grading is very generous (the midterm median was between B+\/A-, and the final median was between an A-\/A), so that shouldn't be a worry. Still,you definitely get out what you put into it.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in global health, it's a phenomenal course.",
    "This class will give you a great intuition for thinking about global health. We mainly focused on low- and middle-income countries. Skolnik has insane experience in the field (he wrote the book we use), and he often talked about in relation to class that day. Some people found that annoying or egotistic, but I thought it was helpful. The policy briefs are basically highly-structured five page papers but doing the research for them can be very informative and interesting. The class structure is Skolnik talking with a sprinkling of him calling on random people and asking them questions. Sometimes I got bored in class, since I couldn't stand listening to him speak for that long. But overall, I got a good sense of global health, so the class was worth taking.",
    "Interesting and basic intro to global health.",
    "Professor Skolnik is a very charismatic man. Prof. Skolnik is also a very experienced man. Lastly, Prof. Skolnik makes himself as available as is humanly possible to his students. The lecture style, however, was not fit for a class of 140 students as it may have been for 40. What was intended to be a discussion turned into a largely unstructured dialogue on highlights from the textbook and the GBD heat map. While I could see constructive back-and-forths occurring between Prof. Skolnik and 40 students, it was not the case with 140 students. It was also often difficult to see what we could take away from each session. Greater education inspired greater health. Makes sense. Priority action steps should be evaluated for cost-effectiveness. Makes sense. Most of the lessons felt like common sense, and it often felt like the time in class could be better spent (no more heat map overviews! Perhaps present a pre-made list of data from the heat map for different regions for brief discussion). The best thing I took away from this class was the clear and concise writing style required for policy briefs. I find that it is useful in all areas of my studies and my life, including writing this review (although it is not very well written!). In brief summary, take this class if it is capped at 40. Don't if it is not, it's not the same.",
    "I recommend it as an intro course. It's good, exciting. There aren't too many readings. Just three policy briefs, a midterm and a final. And there's section, too. Try to get the most engaging, fun TA. They're really fun and knowledgable in current events and careers in global health.",
    "Great course, learned a lot about a subject I knew previously very little about and most importantly learned how to think like a professional in the field of global health, skills that transcend to other fields in development and business. Surprisingly engaging for a lecture format class, and sections were way better structured than any other section I've taken at yale where the focus was on group activities involving research and presentation skills.",
    "YES!!! Take it. Professor Skolnik cares a lot about his students, and is just an amazing person to talk to-he has a wealth of experiences that he'd love to share with you. The class also is very eye opening. It's a great introductory global health class because it not only gives you a foundational understanding of the health issues the world faces, but also a sense of urgency that is so important if you want to make a difference in that field.",
    "We learned useful, important things, but I feel that it could have been done more efficiently. It's hard to be interactive in a large lecture, as Prof. Skolnik tried to be. I think we could have covered way more material given the class size with just lecture. It might have made class more interesting too, since I felt a bit that we learned a few ideas and then just went over them many times in great detail (even for someone who had no background in global health coming in). Skolnik is clearly very dedicated to the class and students, and very knowledgeable and experienced in global health, just see if his teaching style fits yours.",
    "It's a good, basic global health intro course, excellent lecturer (Skolnik is hilarious and also really cares about his students), although it's a bit repetitive. I would say it's worth it, though. Final counts for 40% of the grade which is a TON, so study for it. SECTIONS ARE OPTIONAL. Don't make the mistake I did and feel like you have to go. YOU DON'T.",
    "I would say this class is an introductory, application-based course to global health. The best part of it is that it provides a strong framework for thinking about and studying global health in the future. I would recommend this to any student who is interested in the field because Professor Skolnik sets a strong foundation for study and provides so many opportunities for students who want to delve deeper.",
    "A GREAT CLASS!! Workload isn't bad and is pretty spread out, 3 papers, midterm, final. Definitely an easy writing credit (because it doesn't have a huge final paper). Pretty basic, so if you have a huge global health background maybe go for a harder class. However, it really gives you an intuition for the issues that impact global health in the world and how to cheaply fix them. Skolnik really cares about his students and there isn't busy work. Also, you don't have to do the reading, but the textbook is a great resource. Classmates create a cohort for global health peers, which is a fun environment to be in.",
    "HLTH 230 is a course that will allow you to view health in terms of its various determinants and will give you the capability to know which diseases primarily affect specific regions of the world. I highly recommend this course to any student as it is an engaging class that is enjoyable to attend. You will leave feeling empowered to take action to improve the lives of poor people in poor countries who are subject to certain diseases based upon where they live. Professor Skolnik is a fantastic lecturer and extremely knowledgable in the field of global health.",
    "You probably won't learn too much you don't already know in this class. This course fails to provide the content and structure that the syllabus promises. Lecture usually involves a lot of tangential discussion about superfluous things and is lacking in clear organization. Different, ideas are discussed without a clear link. Additionally, the course is unfortunately too far on the broad side of spectrum of detail that a class can provide. To some extent, we learn about different problems in different regions of the world, but this is a very broad discussion as large regions of the world are grouped together and categorized by broad groups of health problems they suffer from. More problematic is the lack of specific, tangible ideas discussed to improve health care around the world. Overall, there is very little teaching and more an assumption that you already know the answer, and a focus on how you might possibly be able to explain it slightly more clearly than you already can. The 3 policy briefs that you have to write throughout the course are good in that they force you to learn to write in a terse manner. However, this gets repetitive after the first one and too specific to the context of health as most developing countries face the same issues and the best solutions are also the same. In this case, students must force themselves to write about the same thing in a seemingly novel way. This is tedious and unrewarding. The midterm and final are entirely multiple choice and do little to asses your true understanding of what is supposed to be taught in the class (which you may have learned through reading the textbook or you may already know).",
    "Take it! Great class, average workload, awesome professor (and sweet WR).",
    "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Definitely take HLTH 230 if you're at all interested in global health\/public health or just diseases and health in general. Skolnik's teaching style is different in that the lecture is more conversational and he doesn't teach strictly from a PowerPoint. This allows you to think on your toes and really absorb the information better. There's a midterm, a final, and 3 policy briefs (5 pages each). The briefs are very concise and follow a specific formula, so once you finish the first one the last two will be a breeze. The course covers major themes like the global burden of disease, risk factors, child and maternal health, mental health, emerging infectious diseases, neglected tropical diseases, nutrition, etc. I can honestly say that it's one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The discussion sections are quite engaging and informative as we often tackled key health issues like members of the World Health Organization. The TAs are awesome and are willing to help you construct your briefs or to simply help you comprehend important concepts. Take this class! You won't regret it!",
    "It's a ton of fun. I only wish there was more time in the semester to explore the topics more in-depth. Highly recommended.",
    "Aaaa, so I feel like I'm the odd one out. I actually didn't enjoy Skolnik's class very much, despite the very high reviews for the course from previous years. I didn't find the lectures or the discussion sections very stimulating. (This isn't meant to be harsh!) A lot of the material felt very common sense. And even the material that wasn't common sense was generally straightforward. I guess I wanted to address more of the nuances? Accordingly, the policy briefs were terribly formulaic. We were supposed to \"research\" countries, but I never felt like I was researching. I knew exactly what I was going to say for each policy brief. I simply needed to scrape together the statistics to support the conclusions that I knew I would reach. I knew rates of undernutrition in Haiti would be higher in rural areas and among the poorest in the country. I simply needed to find the statistics. Likewise, I knew that community-based programs were the most cost-effective solution. Again, I just needed to find the statistics. When I registered for the class, I envisioned something more analytical. At the same time, I think that's one of the class's main messages. We know what the problems are, and we know what the solutions are. We just aren't implementing them. The portion of the class that I found most interesting was, not surprisingly, the portion on ethics in global health. The corresponding discussion section was one of the few that actually felt like a *discussion*. During other discussion sections, we were simply repeating the same things because we all knew what the trends \/ problems were, and we all knew what the solutions were. There wasn't anything to discuss. In addition to ethics in global health, I wish we delved deeper into the intricacies of health systems. Again, this isn't meant to be harsh! I should add that Skolnik and his team of TFs were very dedicated. Despite the larger size of the class this year, Skolnik made an active effort to meet with as many students as possible. Likewise, the TFs were very helpful and resourceful. And while I didn't necessarily enjoy the class, I do have a general sense of the biggest problems in global health and their corresponding solutions.",
    "The policy briefs were hard at first, but easy to learn and incredibly helpful to know how to do. The exams didn't seem to test knowledge in the middle, i.e., if you knew everything, you would get an A or A-, if you knew nothing, you would do quite poorly, but if you knew a good amount or decent amount, a B, B+, B-, C+, or C all seemed equally likely. Basically luck because of multiple choice...even if you could explain your reasoning (to partial-credit standards), you would do worse than someone who didn't understand the reasoning really but was good at feeling out the answers. The lectures were excellently done and the book well-written.",
    "Different type of course than most of the ones offered at Yale. It is a survey that covers a wide range of issues in global health but Prof. Skolnik forces us to think like the policymakers who decide how to allocate funding and resources within their respective countries. The course provides a strong framework for breaking down the problems and effectiveness of solutions, but this does get a little repetitive. I would definitely recommend this course to become aware of what is going on in low and middle income countries.",
    "Very interesting, almost exactly what you expect when you sign up. A great way to get a writing credit for non-english people. Policy briefs are an interesting way to learn the information and are not super stressful.",
    "A good class to get a greater perspective on real issues facing health on the global level. Take it if you're at all interested in public health, international affairs, or medicine. The workload is fairly low but there's huge room for time you can put into the course, and thus a lot you can get out of it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a new student. In fact I thjnk Yale needs more similar classes in the health studies department. It's becoming crucial for people to have a background in global health and this class provides that.!",
    "A study of global health: burden of diseases in the world and interventions for each one in a region of the world",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! The class is a wonderful course if you are wanting to learn a lot about yourself, the world, and the state of healthcare everywhere.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This was an interesting course about important global health issues. Professor Skolnik puts a lot of effort into teaching and makes himself very available to answer questions and meet with students to discuss global health careers. If you keep up with the textbook readings, the class sessions and discussion section will reinforce what you learn extremely well. The discussion sections give you an opportunity to apply the material to different scenarios and practice your public speaking skills. It's the sort of class where if you enjoy the material, the work will just get done.",
    "Absolutely take this class! An excellent course! TAKE IT!!!! I learned so much about what people get sick and die from everywhere in the world. The material is fascinating and I actually enjoyed doing the readings and papers (only 3 that are 5 pages!!) because I felt I was learning so much and the material was interesting. Professor Skolnik is incredible; he knows what he's talking about, is clear and fair, and he makes an effort to learn everyone's name! It made the class feel like a seminar instead of a lecture. Absolutely take this class. I learned so much about the world and the subject and it has inspired me to take more classes in Public Health.",
    "In the first or second lecture, Skolnik says that this is only a class you should take if you really, really care and are going to do all the reading and the work. Take that seriously. This class is only rewarding if you put in the work, time, attention and effort to make it so.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in global health.",
    "I would recommend it. It is an interesting class and a very easy writing credit.",
    "The course is not too difficult. Just pay attention in lecture!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Why, you ask? Let me tell you. Professor Skolink- This man is amazing, has worked with the World Bank for 20 years, has written the textbook we use in class, and genuinely cares about his students. He meets with many of them over coffee to discuss their interests and career goals. He's also willing to impart his expertise in the field for those wishing to pursue a career in global health. Skolnik is engaging in class, making the over-100 lecture feel like an intimate seminar with his mandatory, sometimes unexpected calling on students. He takes participation very seriously, but it keeps the class fun and the students alert! The Class - Even if you have no plan on further studying global health or don't even know what exactly this is, you will still be able to appreciate the amazing introduction you get. The class explores child and maternal health, nutrition, the burden of disease, etc. The textbook is written very clearly and you will get a lot out of the case studies in there. It really is a joy to come to class. Section - The sections enrich the content in the class and weren't repetitive. You get to watch videos, practice presenting as if you were at a world conference with restricted time, and delve deeper into a few topics. I really liked having section on Monday before the Tuesday class because it made me feel more prepared to participate in the discussion in class. The Workload - Quite a bit of reading. I suggest you at least do the textbook chapters. Do NOT fall behind on those at all. The other articles and reports that Skolnik posts are interesting and helpful, but honestly not realistic to read all of them. There are three policy briefs, each of which is fairly easy as long as you get started on your research fairly early. I would suggest meeting with your TA to review it before handing it in. The midterm and final were both multiple choice this year, and both were fairly simple if you pay attention in class and keep up with work.",
    "MUST TAKE! Different than most other take courses but amazing. If you have any interest in global or public health at all, definitely take this class. Not too much work and course work is graded very fairly. Great 5th class. Take it before you graduate... And sooner rather than later. I'm a senior and regret only taken it now. Take take take!",
    "A good class that presents a lot of random information about the field of global health. Not super organized as far as material and assessments go, however.",
    "HLTH 230 is a good class that gives an overview of the health-related challenges in the world. Near the end of the semester, the class became a bit repetitive, but it's not too hard and I came out of it with some useful information.",
    "Great class! Recommend to anyone interested in development and global health.",
    "A solid way to get a writing credit and also explore an interesting topic.",
    "A course that establishes a sturdy framework for further explorations and independent learning in global health. Intended for self-motivated students.",
    "This class is worth taking. It's not necessarily easy, but Skolnik teaches so well that everything makes sense very easily. A lot of the concepts seem like basic common sense. The workload is very manageable, even with a 5.5 credit semester. Take advantage of meeting with Professor Skolnik; he talks a lot about his previous work in the field, but you realize that it's merely to help students, not to brag.",
    "I would not recommend this class. You can easily read about lecture material on your own.",
    "I would recommend HLTH 230 as a good introduction to the world of global health, as it lays a very strong foundation and touches on many different aspects\/possible careers of the field of global health. However, I do think the class was damaged by being expanded to 150 or so students this year, rather than its usual cap of 40 or 50 students, and so I would probably recommend it more strongly if it were to be capped again.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in global health and want a complete overview you will enjoy this class. If you have a more advanced understanding and want something a little meatier I wouldn't recommend it though. The grading is very transparent and we got a lot of feedback.",
    "This is a great survey course into Global Health. It does a great job laying the framework for global health.",
    "Easy a- for writing credit. The tfs are just so erratic with grading the policy briefs though. Material is mind meltingly boring. You basically learn that if you're not white and living in a wealthy country, your life is gonna suck.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. I took this as a Credit\/D\/Fail class without any background in global health because I'm interested in international development. I definitely learned a lot (about the landscape of global health such as interesting facts and policies, how to write a policy memo) and it was a good pass\/fail course - I learned a lot without having to do a lot of work. Professor Skolink is very helpful and wants you to succeed.",
    "Great introduction to global health, definitely worth taking",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who thinks they may be interested in health or medicine at all. It was a very exciting, engaging, and inspiring course and it is a great opportunity to be able to take the course from someone who is so experienced in the field. Professor Skolnik is definitely passionate about the subject, which makes it even easier for his students to become passionate as well. In addition, the policy briefs were fun to research and write, and a good way to experience a different kind of writing."
