   "comments": [
    "Strengths: interesting, engaging, updated with current issues Improvements: choose one or two topics to delve deeper",
    "The strengths: 1. we learnt about the most relevant and current topics of the global financial system 2. we were trained to argument about different topics 3. we had to read papers\/documents\/articles and watch videos of important actors of the global financial systems 4. Professor Garten is great and his assistants as well, always helped us when needed. Weaknesses: 1. Just one class per week of 3hs is quite intense 2. The homework was just making summaries, sometimes having questions to answer or a particular assginment maybe could guide us better",
    "Strengths: Course Instructor is excellent Very Well structured course Grand Overview of the topic Weakness: Technological developments were discussed for less than two hours in the class. The readings in technology & global finance - were not adequate. Emerging economies was dealt for less than two hours. The readings were highly inadequate in this subtopic."

    "ABSOLUTELY! Take this class if you can. Great survey of topics on the frontier of finance.",

    "Highly recommend this course to students aspiring to have a broad overview of the topic. But this is not the most relevant course for those who are looking for expertise in specific topics such as - Emerging economies or Fintech"
