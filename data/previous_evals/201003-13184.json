   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this class, and although incredibly difficult, I would recommend it to another student. The way this course interplays with Lit and particularly Philosophy was an incredibly unique aspect that gave me the greatest bang for my buck.",
    "This class is a great introduction into ancient history and political philosophy. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, however with the warning that is very hard work. If you are willingto put in the time and effort, though, you will gain a lot from this class.",
    "YES! Most certainly. A lot depends on who ends up in the class, but McCarty does a wonderful job keeping enthused and the coursework is challenging but rewarding, as it should be!",
    "A good course, but not as lucid for me as the other branches of DS. It sometimes seemed to me and many of my friends in DS as though H\/P was, if you will, \"the dustbin of history\": all of the works that were important but didn't fit in anywhere else. The main themes start to become evident as the term winds down; even thought H\/P is the weak point of DS, I would not consider it a reason to pass over the program as a whole.Professor McCarty is a good instructor. He took the class seriously and tried to give us as much guidance as possible. The class improved as time went on and I feel that he will become better at working with students as he gains more experience in the course. In section, especially towards the beginning of the term, it seemed as though he would ask questions with very specific answers in mind and would dismiss comments that did not line up with what he was looking for. This, and the impossibility for many students of completing the gargantuan reading assignments, made some sessions a bit painful. His comments on essays were often somewhat helpful, but at times baffling. Though he returned papers quickly, I felt that he did not make enough of an effort to understand my ideas and that he was unwilling to accept even the slightest deviations from the standard essay structure. He gave a very good review session for the final. Students who do not mind a more \"high-school-style\" course may enjoy his teaching more than I did.",
    "This class is the most important aspect of first semester DS curriculum. If you want to understand how the ancient world affected the shape of our world today-- this is your class.",
    "This class is a perfect match\/challenge for any student who loves substantial readings, dynamic and challenging exchange, and new levels of nuanced analysis. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Take directed studies if you like the humanities. It's challenging, but nowhere near as scary as it's reputed to be. It is what you make of it, and whatever you make of it, it will be fun and enlightening.",
    "There is definitely a lot of content in this course, but the discussion groups make it much easier to understand. After reading and analyzing the material, students will understand the background of Western history and politics.",
    "DS History and Politics is very interesting, though it's difficult. The weekly readings are sometimes very long, but usually they're fun, especially Plato's Republic and Aristotle's Politics. Professor McCarty's section is really fun, but it's important that you do the reading because he calls on people if they're not participating.",
    "The texts read in this course at times feel disjointed, but they are all extremely valuable works and ought to be read by any student pursuing a liberal arts education.",
    "Compared to the other courses of Directed Studies, it was in between the rigorousness of philosophical thinking and the creativeness of literature. I would recommend this course for anyone who is interested in a having a good foundation in classical conceptions of politics, historical recording, society and empire - which are the main themes studied in this section. It really lived up to my expectations.",
    "history is probably the toughest of the lot. be prepared to be bored by a lot of the reading. mccarty is not an easy professor by any means but he is very very knowledgeable and helpful with papers.",
    "I do recommend DS, for it is extremely interesting and rewarding.",
    "This course was difficult, but will make you a better student in every class. I would recommend it to any serious student.",
    "DS History and Politics was very valuable in that we got to comparatively study the major works of ancient history with knowledgeable professors in productive discussion with our classmates. I would not have read these texts without DS, and I can't imagine a more effective way to tackle them.",
    "A great overview of history. I would definitely recommend it."
