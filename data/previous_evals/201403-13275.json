    "I cannot say enough good things about this course!!!!! I took elementary japanese without any good reason---I wanted a language and Japanese sounded like an interesting one. But after even just a few weeks I was so excited by learning japanese and the prospect of going to japan! Part of that is thanks to Japan's rich culture and the cool stuff about the language itself, but the majority is thanks to the incredible professors (senseis). They were all unbelievably helpful, kind, brilliant. I swear it felt like they spent as much time correcting my homework and giving me really really helpful feedback as I spent doing it! Really, if you don't learn a TON in this course it's only your fault. The professors and the structure of the course are incredible and make it really easy to get out even more than what you put in. That being said, learning japanese at such a fast pace is really challenging! JAPN 110 is NOT worthwhile if you are not going to put suitable time into it. It's definitely a worthwhile class to take even if you aren't trying to go to Japan or Japanese isn't your passion (plenty of seniors took it just for fun), but you will still definitely have to put a lot of work into it. Even if you take it credit D. I took JAPN 110 without knowing a single word of Japanese or speaking any other east asian language, and it was really difficult, but there were so many opportunities to help me learn more. Honestly all I can say is that this is an incredible course. Every single class is so FUN it's such a refreshing break from other classes!! You might have opportunities to learn Japanese later in life, but probably never with professors as incredible as these. They really make the course what it is. I can't recommend JAPN 110 highly enough.",
    "Absolutely, but the time commitment is high"
