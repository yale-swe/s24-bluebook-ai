   "comments": [
    "If a student wanted to learn about cryo, I would definitely recommend this course to them. It's low pressure and very informative.",
    "A lot of the class was focused on math, so unless you have a math background, a lot of the lectures will go over your head. I thought the demonstrations of negative staining and single particle cryo-EM was really cool because you got to see the process in person. Grant Jensen's videos were also an extremely good resource (to be honest, probably more helpful than the cryo-EM course itself). While the material is hard to understand, the homework, discussion papers, and the exam were fairly straightforward.",
    "I would summarize MB&B 710 as a deeper look into cryo-EM theory, techniques, and applications. I would recommend it for another student because the material was very relevant for anyone involved in structural work.",
    "This course is very much learn-it-on-your-own. We watch the Youtube video series on Cryo-Em done by CalTech, and this is probably where I learned the most to be honest. The classes were rather dull and filled with mathematical proofs. But the course will expose you to some pretty sophisticated and challenging material. Workload is not much at all, just watching the video lectures and a couple of papers to read. This course starts in the second half of the semester.",
    "Currently, I would not at all recommend it. Most of the very valuable information can be found in the videos we watched; I think it would have been more efficient do watch them independently of any course."

   "comments": [
    "I certainly have an appreciation and breadth of knowledge of cryo I previously did not possess. I doubt I will use this information in my current research, but that is not a reflection on the technique, course, or instruction.",
    "I most likely won't be working with cryo-EM, but I wanted to take this course for general interest and also because of how crucial and upcoming cryo-EM as a method is.",
    "This course was very helpful for looking deeper into cryo-EM and if I ever collaborate or personally work on a cryo-EM project the material will be very helpful.",
    "It was nice to get a taste of all that goes into techniques like electron microscopy. I am working on structural biology research projects, and this has definitely helped me understand how structures are derived. This is a unique course on a unique topic, and in that sense I am glad I took it."
