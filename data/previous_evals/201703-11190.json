    "I learned a lot about isotopes in this class, and I feel like I learned about a lot of different types of isotope systems, which was nice. I feel like I can use this knowledge in a lot of different fields of geology and work, so I'm very glad I took this class.",
    "background on how isotopes fractionate mechanism, uses and limitations\/uncertainties of a host of radiogenic and stable isotope systems",
    "I learned how to think about isotope geochemical systems (radiogenic and stable) both quantitatively and qualitatively. This involves the ways in which you could date a formation, and the ways in which you could pick up paleoclimatic\/paleoenvironmental signals from rocks as well as the theory behind the chemical proxies.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to the stable and radiogenic isotopes which are geologically significant. The class explored most major isotopes: oxygen, carbon, boron, lithium, uranium, thorium, strontium, and more. The classes started with a first principles explanation of isotopes, their detection, and their uses. This served as the backdrop for a series of discussions about a wide array of isotopes. While each isotope series was not connected directly to the others, they all would reference the original material."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Noah and Alan are very fun and I enjoyed having them as professors. They always made time to answer my questions. I also felt that a strength of the course was how many different systems we covered. We learned about a lot of different types of isotopes that can be used for lots of different things. I also like the take-home exams in this class. I think it allows us to cover more material in class; since we can use our notes on exams, we are not limited by how much we can memorize. The take-home exams offer a less stressful way to learn more material. The only weakness of this class is that both Noah and Alan present the material quickly and in confusing ways at times. Sometimes the lectures are disorganized, contain extraneous slides, and\/or are covered too quickly and with too little explanation, making it difficult to learn the material. Noah and Alan sometimes struggle to explain things clearly. I'm not sure why this is; maybe they assume we know more than we actually do to start with? Perhaps build in more time for questions during class time. I would often find myself having so many questions that I felt I would take up too much time asking them.",
    "Despite being at 9 am, this course was really fun! I thought the subject material was really interesting and the presentation was good. Slides were organized and professors were both very enthusiastic (again despite it being at 9 am). I find it rare for a course to take you through the theoretical basis of a subject to the forefront of scientific discovery in that subject, but this course did that which was great!",
    "Strengths: The lectures were excellent and well delivered. Often, the lecture would quickly summarize the previous lecture and this was extremely helpful. The instructors clearly are experts in the field and were helpful and ready to answer questions of all types. Weakness: This course had few structured problem sets and the assignments were sparsed. The textbook was miserable. It would have been helpful to have more papers about the material that we were covering. This course could use a more comprehensive and instructor-led review of the material. Perhaps a review session of some sort."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course. Isotopes are very applicable to many fields, and I found them fun to learn about. If you don't mind the disorganization of the class, you'll be fine. Alan and Noah are fun professors, and you'll definitely learn a lot, either from them or your own studies.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Isotopes are a useful tool in almost all aspects of geology and understanding how and why they work is important for any geology student. Its also a fun course, and does a good job of combining the chemical theory behind isotope geochemistry with lots of applications.",
    "This course is great! You'll cover the basics of isotope chemistry in the first few weeks and then quickly move into individual isotope systems. This course moves slowly at first but rapidly progresses to the bleeding edge of geochemistry. The course is accessible for anyone with basic geologic knowledge and gen chem. You should be ready to pay attention in lecture and understand that you cannot skip lectures."
