    "I wouldn't base whether or not you take this class on my review, because Dave is visiting for the semester and how much you learn will be dependent on the professor. We got through the entirety of Fulton's Algebraic Curves, and did a ton of its problems. The book is super dense and gets really hard towards the end. Nonetheless, AG is pretty dank and you should take it.",
    "Take this if you have a good background in algebra and are curious about what algebraic geometry really is. The take home tests definitely have some problems that seem really hard, almost out of the blue, but if you can do the homework then you should be alright.",
    "Good class, but very difficult material. Apparently taking a semester of commutative algebra (380) is helpful.",
    "This is a very challenging yet beautiful course. The material is some of the most interesting and mind-blowing I have encountered. Dave also is a really nice professor. But you should also know what you're getting yourself into. This class demands a very good understanding of abstract algebra (mainly commutative rings). Additionally, you almost certainly will need to spend a good deal of time reading over notes outside of class, given the level of this class given how quickly material is covered. The workload is generally reasonable. Many weeks the problem sets will take an average to below-average amount of time, but occasionally there will be a very difficult question which will take hours and hours. There is a take-home midterm and final, both of which will be absurdly difficult. Expect to spend 15+ hours on each and still be unable to do some of the questions. But he curves them generously, so it'll be fine in the end."
