    "I gained an improved understanding of what defines conservation in the United States across different sectors, regions, organizations, and strategies. I feel more equipped to engage in conversations about conserving land and ecosystem values, and have a better understanding of how various benefits of ecological conservation collide and intersect. I also gained a technical foundation for understanding sources of conservation funding, and the organizational structures of land trusts.",
    "It was interesting to go back to FES after taking most of my classes at SOM and get a different perspective. People at FES are certainly very passionate about the specific subject they pursue. It was great learning how each of them engaged with their own project.",
    "I learned a ton in this class about land conservation and how to think critically about what it should look like.",
    "The clinical project of this course pushed me into a field that I didn't know much about and I learned many practical skills from this project - how to reach out to people, conduct phone interviews, and also start a research project from scratch. The course was incredibly insightful and I learned so much about various different topics related to land conservation. The variety of offerings really helped make the class feel well-balanced.",
    "I learned tools and concepts surrounding private land conservation in the United States. The course laid the groundwork for what aspects are required for doing deals, all of the aspects involved with management, and brought in a variety of speakers of varying areas of expertise.",
    "Many, many insights. Lots of knowledge. Skills also, but to a lesser extent and mostly incidental to what i was doing for my clinical project. I truly loved this course in every possible way. This course bisects the many angles of private conservation in a highly structured way that makes it manageable for students. So I got up to date on many issues that I knew were going on and others that I didn't knew existed to well. So yes, many, many insights from guest speakers and vast new knowledge about their topics, readings included!",
    "Basics of conservation finance concepts, introduction to Land Trust Alliance standards, introduction to major land conservation organizations in the U.S.",
    "I developed an understanding of land conservation on private lands, and I learned how to work with professionals in the land conservation community through the clinical project.",
    "General sense of land conservation principles and practices in the US",
    "I gained a better understanding the conservation world in the United States.",
    "I learned so much in this classit was one of the most transformational courses I took at FES. I learned transactional, practical skills, as well as new ways of thinking. I learned about the process of doing a conservation deal, and how to fund those deals from a variety of sources. I learned about who to engage in conservation and how to make sure conservation meets community needs. I learned to question convention and ask questions to find new ways of problem-solving and getting people (funders, stakeholders, staff, etc.) on board.",
    "I didn't know anything about land trusts before coming into this class. I had the chance to learn about stewardship, finance, and land trust law. I also left with ideas about what land trust employees should consider when they conserve land, like the social\/political climate of the community.",
    "Comprehensive view of conservation and all its forms: on levels from local to federal, different legal tools, generating policy and public support, inviting new communities, considering the \"public good\", evaluating land and water on its merits, public-private parterships, ecosystem services of land and water.",
    "A working and exceptional knowledge of how to \"do\" private land conservation. Brenda Schick's one-day workshop was a summary of the entire course. The legal and financial knowledge was invaluable. The content of this class is excellent and shouldn't be changed."

   "comments": [
    "Quite well. I took this class because my peers had spoken very highly of it and told me that these were exactly the skills I could expect to pick up throughout the course.",
    "I expected more detailed information on financing examples and how these are unique to conservation.",
    "My expectations were exceeded! I expected to learn about conservation strategies; what I didn't anticipate was the degree to which we would interrogate those strategies as a class and constantly be questioning the status quo.",
    "They exceeded my expectations.",
    "I had very high expectations for this class and they were exceeded by the strong content of the course and clinical aspect of the project.",
    "They met or exceeded my expectations consistently throughout. There was only one session that didn't make much a difference to have sat through, but even that one held lessons to be learned from it!",
    "The course focused more heavily on conservation finance than I expected.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class aligned very well with my expectations. I gained an understanding of private conservation from a legal and financial perspective.",
    "I'm glad I got a general sense of land conservation from the course, but I wish we had learned some fundamentals before delving into student-led discussions",
    "Tremendously!",
    "These knowledge, skills, and insights far exceeded my expectations. I expected a fairly standard course on the procedural structure of doing conservation deals, but ended up learning the in's and out's of working in conservation organizations and having a positive impact for people and ecological resources in the conservation field broadly.",
    "I think the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class align fairly well with my expectations.",
    "Very well.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - the TA, the dinners, the guest speakers, the conversations, the format of the reading, Prof. Gentry's lecture. Look, this is a strong class! Weaknesses - sometimes during class discussion it is difficult to get everyone to speak up.",
    "The lectures and feedback can become a bit conversational, some more structure would be helpful.",
    "The greatest strength of this class is its structure of a lineup of guest speakers followed by discussions. The class discussions were some of the most engaging and insightful of any class I've taken at FES. I think the weakness is really the variability of the projects, but that's going to be true of any clinical class and isn't specific to this one.",
    "The ability to network with the speakers after the course was amazing. I really enjoyed getting to talk to speakers after the lecture and learn more about their organizations\/their work as well as get to explain in a smaller setting my interests. I think the time dedicated to the clinical project report outs in class could be utilized or done differently. Because not everyone was familiar with each other's projects, it was hard to keep continuity.",
    "One of the strengths of the course is clearly the speakers. It was an amazing opportunity to hear different insights from people working at different areas within the private conservation sector, and it was great to hear . Although I benefitted highly from the discussion portion of the class, often we tended to gravitate towards the same content. These ideas are critical, and will remain a challenge for conservation moving forward. However, I would have liked it if the readings were integrated into the class more.",
    "The guest lecturers were really an amazing part of the course. There were aspects of the group project, however, which felt more about intern-type work and perhaps less about what we as students could learn from it.",
    "This course has many. many more strengths than weaknesses, by far. The only way I would improve itif at all and based on my particular semester's guest speakers\/session topicswould be to combine the land stewardship and the baseline report sessions into one single workshop\/lecture. This not because the land stewardship session or the baseline reports workshop had any flaws to themthey didn't! But just thinking about how many of their lessons do overlap and that could open up space for a workshop on, say, \"community engagement\", which is something a lot of people are currently interested in and which we ventured into quite effectively in one session that included a workshop-type exercise (that a lot a people really enjoyed, me included). Yet everyone wished he'd had more time for it! So those are my two-cents: combine stewardship\/baseline reporting into one day-long thing and expand on community engagement with an additional day-long workshop that can also include other aspects of the matter. The landscape-scale conservation session was the one that wasn't worth anyone's time because of the presenters, but it is still an important topic. I really enjoyed so many guest speakers so much that it is very mention some and not others, so I'm just mentioning the single one I (and others) didn't like.",
    "Most of the guest speakers were excellent. I did think that the class length and timing (almost 3 hours in the late afternoon) was a little rough. It was difficult to stay attentive for that long so late in the day. Perhaps switching to a morning block or breaking up the class into two 1.5 hour sessions a week would facilitate greater sustained engagement.",
    "The main strength of the course is that there are so many engaging speakers. Professor Gentry really took the time to arrange for top-notch speakers from around the country to come visit our class. One weakness of the class is that the readings don't always match up well with what the speaker talks about.",
    "This course provided very little flexibility in terms of catering the topic to each student's knowledge and learning goals. Would have appreciated an option to focus on learning fundamentals (laws, policies, financial instruments) instead of required discussion-based style. One way to achieve this would be if we could choose either a client-facing project or a research paper for our end result. The class discussions could have focused more on the readings than on our general feelings. I feel I did not get enough basic knowledge for the time I invested in this course.",
    "Too many strengths to count.",
    "The strength of the course is it shares insights from working professionals who have specialized experience and knowledge in the topic that they are lecturing on that week. The downside of this strategy is that sometimes (rarely) the visiting guest is less effective, which doesn't become apparent until after the fact. The only way to get around this is to learn from experience and invite the guests back who you know will thrive in lecturing\/engaging students. Also, a somewhat neutral but constructive piece of feedback is that this course was a lot of work. Unlike in many other classes, students begin working on their final projects within the first few weeks of classes (on top of weekly readings and discussion posts), and the project work remains consistent throughout the semester. For this reason, I put much more time into this final deliverable than in most other 3-credit, non-capstone courses. The quality of this deliverablethe amount of time and care put into itwas definitely capstone-worthy, and I would encourage the school to consider making this course eligible to be considered a capstone in the future.",
    "The amount of weekly reading assignments for this course was pretty excessive, though they were useful. The projects for this course were also very well organized. In this course, the outside organization's go through an application process, which helps to make the projects more structured. And while some students may have run into some issues with their projects, the overall experience seemed to be pretty positive.",
    "The structure of the class (3-hr meeting 1x\/week+weekly reading recaps) let me really sit and immerse myself in the topics for a longer period of time. The lineup of speakers was so strong--I felt lucky to be able to hear from experts across the map of conservation work and understand their standpoints. Is there a basic \"finance module\" that incoming students to the course could be required to complete? Would help with \"language barriers\" during the finance-oriented sections of the class, which I think limited some students' learning (including mine). I loved the partnership project and its length--initially I felt very underqualified to take on a report of its magnitude but felt my competence and confidence increasing week-by-week through conversations with land-trust partners and my project partner as well.",
    "My four suggestions are: 1. Greatly reduce the time spent reviewing last week's speakers. This part doesn't need to be a big, organized exercise, just a quick review of the key takeaways. Their needs to be much more time for the current speakers--they were all cut short before they got to the meat of their lecture. 2. Remove the time spent talking about students projects. That's what the Canvas assignments are for--we can catch up on our peer's work there. Set up one to two individual meetings with Brad and TA to discuss progress. 3. Revise the weekly readings. Reading 5-6 40+ page reports per week is not feasible and not a good way to spend time. And we don't have time to figure out which ones are the useful ones. By making so many \"required\", it actually reverse incentives us to do the readings. Just make one or two specific pieces \"required\". 4. Don't make social\/political issues secondary to the rest of the classes foci. These need to be their own section of the class. And we need to have a specific class on the beginning of the semester to discuss the historical problems\/limitations of 'conservation'. The school and world is demanding us to be able to answer this."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you have any interest in land conservation.",
    "Brad is pretty much what makes the course. Perhaps have him guide the speakers' presentations a bit more to keep the class engaged and the presentation aligned with the subject matter.",
    "I recommend anyone interested in conservation to take this class!!",
    "Sign up for dinners whenever you can! Make sure to reach out to and connect with the speakers you truly find interesting.",
    "Devote time to reviewing the course application and the clinical projects. Make sure you apply for those that you are truly interested in. Come into the discussions with an open mind and make sure you engage fully with the guest presenters.",
    "This class is a must for anyone planning to work on conservation, regardless of their desired organizational size or if she or he aspires to work in the public sectorit doesn't matter, you have to take this course! It will put you in direct contact with top practitioners and highly experience people in the field and they all come in sharing their life-long lessons and valuable insights. To boot you can keep conversations going with guest speakers after each session. There is however a decent amount of materials to read for each session and you have to turn in weekly reaction essays to both the assigned readings and to the previous week's lecturer, so there's that seminar aspect to it. For the same reason, as with any other seminar, much of the quality of the discussions will depend on you and your classmates and on how much into the readings you go. The clinical project is also something to be thought about. It does take a lot of time if you want to come up with something decent by the end of the semester, so do consider this also if you have too many other term projects or papers for other classes. Highly, highly recommended. TAKE IT!",
    "Do the readings that either appeal to you or cover subjects with which you are most unfamiliar. Don't try to read all readings every week because there are just too many to reasonably keep up with.",
    "Pick a clinical project that you are really interested in because you will spend a lot of time on it.",
    "You should already be very well versed in land conservation basics and enjoy discussing environmental justice topics to get the most out of this course",
    "I think all FES students could benefits from taking this course.",
    "This class was transformational for me. It exposes you to a breadth of topics and career paths in the conservation field, and it gives you and classmates a space to ask fundamental questions about what conservation is, who it's for, and who is it done by. Strongly consider taking this course if you would like to work for a conservation non-profit, land trust, or TMO.",
    "The reading load was a heavier than I expected, so may want to try and not have other classes that also have large reading assignments. You also need to decide pretty quickly what project you want to work on. Dr. Gentry is also easy to talk to, so I would suggest asking him questions if you are unsure about anything. And although the workshops can be time consuming (although there are only two), I found them useful. But be careful selecting other classes that also have outside workshops or field trips that may overlap with these workshops. Take advantage of the opportunities for dinner with class guests. Even if they are from a field you may not know a lot about, they can still offer good advice and insights.",
    "Do the readings and look for examples of the topics from class in your home communities to provide context.",
    "This is a class on private land conservation--think conservation easements, land trusts and stewardship."
