    "I would recommend this course to individuals who are okay never knowing what was going to happen. I would also recommend this to students if they have a strong background or affinity for chemistry. I was disappointed that we really didn't discuss health until the very end. I personally struggled writing the first 10 pg. paper because I had no experience with college-level chemistry and didn't know how to write a chemistry paper."
