   "comments": [
    "\"Brahms and Schoenberg\" is somewhat of a misnomer as almost all of the serious analysis will be Schoenberg; there were a few interesting Brahms examples dealing with metric conflict, phrase structure, and unorthodox tonality in recapitulations that were enjoyable, though.Iwould not recommend this course unless you have significant performance experience with Schoenberg's music and\/or have taken Friedmann's sight-singing course. It is a lot of work if you want to do well and the crowd it drew this year (overwhelmingly, excellent performers, grad students, and composers) was intimidating. Not a great way to expand your horizons as it might prove too daunting to be enjoyable.That said, if you listen to the string quartets, Op. 25, Op. 33b, and the string trio and love them, get excited about identifying hexacordal and trichordal partitions, and really want to live this music, this is the course for you.",
    "This class is a little bit intense, but pretty interesting. If analyzing Brahms and Schoenberg very carefully once a week and writing a big paper on it at the end sounds like a worthwhile endeavor to you then take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in Brahms and Schoenberg. If you are ready to commit to studying new pieces almost every other week than you can take the class. If you don't prepare ahead of time, you end up clueless in group discussion which is pointless. If you know Prof. Friedmann, then this may also be a reason!",
    "Take this course if you have a strong background in Schoenberg's music or if you have a strong desire to acquire such knowledge. It's challenging but fascinating if you put in the effort.",
    "Professor Friedmann is the reason to take this class. It doesn't really matter what he is teaching, just that he is teaching and has some really amazing reason for zeroing on the topic and making it a course. Take his classes! I would recommend this course extremely highly to any student with a strong theory background. This course is a wonderful experience for any lover of theory and any musician will be converted into a lover of theory by this course. The course extends way beyond the classroom, in a literal sense, because the majority of the class often attends concerts together, and in a phenomenological way as well: Every analytical idea put forward in the course is meticulously scrutinized according to how the music is actually heard. This makes it possible for the course to have a palpable effect on how students will later perform and hear the music as well as affecting their own compositions. (It is imperative to keep up with the listening for this reason, with the pleasant and useful result that you will know a great deal of music by ear by the end of the semester.)"
