   "comments": [
    "If you want to learn about the details of medieval pardons, the differences between pena and culpa, and how a medieval audience would have interpreted the Pardoner as a eunuch, be my guest. Also- a bizarre amount of work for how little reading there is.",
    "A good pre-1800. Professor Minnis leads fun and interesting lectures.",
    "english 170 is a very good pre-1800 course. it's also good to take if you took enlgish 125 because you probably would've already read some of the tales. professor minnis is really nice and cares a lot about the class. the papers are long but not too bad, no final, and the midterm is open book",
    "Definitely avoid this class at all costs. It might be good for someone who had already taken like five classes on Chaucer, but the points covered are, for the most part, too specific for a normal English student. More like a Medieval history class than an English class. Very boring. Also required much, much more work than most other English classes: two \"short\" papers, a midterm, and a 14-18 page final paper... just absurd. Perhaps the worst class I've taken at Yale. Minnis might be good in a seminar, but not in a lecture.",
    "English 170 has its pros and cons. You'll get a lot more history than you perhaps bargained for in an English course, but it isn't uninteresting and you can see how it links to the Canterbury Tales.",
    "English 170 is a great course for students interested in Chaucer. I would not recommend the course simply to fulfill the prerequisite for the English Major.",
    "I would recommend it, though I think it is better if it is not your first experience reading Chaucer, as it was for me.",
    "English 170 is a look at Chaucer's Canterbury Tales taught by an incredibly knowledgeable, great, helpful, adorable professor. A lot of paper-writing. The reading can be a drag but you don't have to do it. I took this class to sub out for Eng 125a, and I'm glad I did. It's Chaucer, so most people taking it are taking it because they're English majors and they have to, which means that they see it as a drag, but it's really not a bad class, and like I said, Professor Minnis is the best. I did learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! Even if you do not think you are specifically interested in the Canterbury Tales (I was however so may be colored by that interest) I would recommend it for the terrific professor and teaching assistant. You even get to listen to music in lecture and see how it relates to the tales and time! Very interesting and a delight!",
    "Not pure Chaucer: Professor Minnis talks about other aspects of the medieval period as well, so you receive a broad exposure to Chaucer's age. One of my favorite things about the class is that you focus only on about six of the tales, so you get to read one tale deeply over two weeks. The workload is reasonable; I would take this class again. I recommend it."
