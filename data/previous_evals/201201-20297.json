    "I found it to be a good introduction to the field of morphology, one that allowed for an informed understanding of the field and its concerns. I would definitely recommend this to another student for this very reason.",
    "I would recommend the class if we discussed more of the problem sets in class.",
    "I highly recommend this course because it provides another aspect of the language system, and the instructor is very illuminating!",
    "It\u00b4s a class where you obtain a broad view of the field of Morphology, even though Stephen Anderson focuses more on the idea of a-morphous morphology. It\u00b4s the kind of class that I wanted to be exposed too due to my interests in the field, and I felt I learned a lot during the semester."

   "comments": [
    "It helped to see so many counter-examples to all the theories and realise that no one model can solve all our problems (yet). It really highlights the fact that there's still so much work to be done, and although I don't know if I'll keep pursuing this at the moment, it's a lot to think about",
    "I know feel I have a better understanding of what morphology is with respect to the rest of linguistics and what it, as a field, is concerned with.",
    "The course enriches my understanding of the language system, deepening knowledge of another aspect of lexical items.",
    "I was already familiar with Stephen Anderson\u00b4s research, so I\u00b4m happy his class helped me understand better the field. I would like to continue doing work on Morphology, and for that reason this class is very relevant for my future research."
