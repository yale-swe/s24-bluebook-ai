   "comments": [
    "an appreciation for a wide variety of topics in relation to food; a way to look at the environment in a relevant way for public health too; good presentation practice",
    "I learnt a lot about the sources of risk to human health in food systems, and what can and cannot be done to address them. I also learnt about the ways that we should be holding governments and corporations accountable.",
    "A much broader understanding of various food related issues Pesticide residues, plastics and other toxic chemicals, palm oil, antibiotics in meat, certification schemes, etc.",
    "As someone who came to FES to study food systems, this course was SO valuable to me in terms of the knowledge, skills and insights gained. The course did a great job diving into a number of issues related to food systems - global regulation, chemicals, plastics, waste, meat production, deforestation, etc. It would be appropriate for students who are already quite knowledgable about food, or students who are just becoming interested and want to learn more about how food connects to other environmental issues.",
    "I gained knowledge about several different topics related to food and human health including contamination from nuclear testing, plastics, and pesticides. I also gained much deeper insight into complex problems around regulation, certification, and supply chain\/labeling\/traceability. I feel like much of this knowledge can be applied in academic, policy, and personal settings. I found lectures really engaging and also learned a lot from the comments of my peers. I felt like I was challenged to develop skills on how to break down and approach complex problems. I also benefited from the process of writing a final paper -- from narrowing down a question to the process of writing.",
    "This course investigates various problems in our food system related to human health and the environment, from pesticide use to the palm oil crisis. I learned about toxins in food and household products, both in terms of their properties and effects on the human body and ecosystems. The course provided a great introduction to complex regulatory systems in the US and abroad. We also examined and analyzed various certification schemes. Through the assignments and guidance of Professor Wargo, I improved my research skills and adopted a more critical framework for thinking through environmental problems.",
    "I learned about the complicated nature of global food production in the last half-century, and the complex histories of law and regulation, corporate innovation and secrecy, and human exposure to hazardous substances among many other things. I learned about the piecemeal regulatory response to some of the most pressing environmental issues of our time, and the myriad abuses of animals, laborers, and immigrants associated with these issues.",
    "I developed new insights into the ways our food system is flawed and endangers human health. This class is content oriented and covers a range of interesting topics"

    "exceeded my expectations",
    "Fairly well, I was expecting to deepen my knowledge of food issues, and that's what I got.",
    "Very well. I also appreciated that not every subject on the syllabus was obvious or overdone - it was really refreshing to think about how things like nuclear energy, plastics and antibiotics have a profound impact on the food system and on environmental and human health.",
    "This class exceeded my expectations. I also thought the readings were well chosen.",
    "This course exceeded my expectations. I learned about all of the topics in the syllabus with more depth and nuance than I expected.",
    "They exceeded my expectations, and directly influenced where I chose to spend my summer internship.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "does a pretty good job of exploring many topics in this area but it might be helpful to focus in more on certain ones",
    "Strengths: I really enjoyed the presentation aspect of the class, and found this opportunity to deep dive into specific aspects of the topic fascinating. Weaknesses: During the sessions where we broke up into groups to discuss a policy issue, we often never reached any satisfying or even promising answers, which led me to conclude that there was pretty much nothing that we could do about it - I'm not sure if that's actually true. Perhaps more examples of ameliorative action that has worked?",
    "Strengths - the in-class presentations by classmates was my favorite part of the course. Each person got to dive deep into a specific issue under the week's topic and share with us what they learned. Because we needed to present to others, to teach them, we needed to really learn the subject matter. Weaknesses - sometimes in class discussion didn't really kickoff, which made for some rather dull classes where Professor Wargo just lectured. Finding a way to really drive inclusive discussion with students in each class would be good.",
    "Weaknesses might be that we didn't have guests to class that could speak on particular topics. Strengths, the topics discussed in class were incredibly varied.",
    "I really liked the format of this course - one week of lecturing from Professor Wargo and one week of student research\/presentations. It allowed us to gain from Professor Wargo's deep knowledge on these topics, while also diving into research ourselves and tackling particular elements of each issue that personally interest us and align with our studies. I also liked the format because it allowed us to spend two full weeks going deeper into a particular topic, instead of ping-ponging to a new subject every single week. One thing I would've liked to do more of is have small group discussions\/challenges. We had a few classes where we broke out into small groups, and I really liked that approach of tackling a problem together, plus it helped to break up the 3-hour class time into some more interactive blocks.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! I can't think of anything I would change.... Perhaps greater depth on the lecture about GMOS.",
    "This course is very well structured. The topics are organized thoughtfully, class time is well-utilized, the assignments are clear, and feedback is provided throughout. I liked that students were given a lot of flexibility to explore topics that interested them and then present their findings to the class. I learned a lot from the student presentations and got to know my peers and understand their interests and perspectives.",
    "Having a weekly session with bi-weekly student presentations gave us ample time to digest the material outside of class, and come prepared to discuss and learn. I liked the student presentations as a chance to see how other classmates were synthesizing material, and foster discussions that might not have happened otherwise.",
    "Freedom to explore areas of personal interest through presentations and the final paper was a strength of the course. The topics selected were also generally very interesting. I sometimes felt like the discussion sessions could have been better structured, perhaps by anchoring them more in the readings."

   "comments": [
    "do as much of the reading as possible, it is worth it!",
    "Do the readings! Raise your hand in class! If you have a comment, let other people hear it! If you have a question, ask it! Get involved with the class, it's how you can learn more from it.",
    "Choose you topic of research early on the semester.",
    "Even if you're not directly interested in food, taking a class with Professor Wargo is a great opportunity to learn from someone who is deeply engaged in a variety of environmental health issues and who cares deeply about his students. Think about how the different topics on the syllabus relate to your interests, and how you can make connections between different parts of the system. Volunteer to present during weeks that you want to learn more about so you have the chance to do some deeper research.",
    "Take advantage of the final paper to choose a topic that really motivates you and you want to continue working on...",
    "Anyone interested in food systems, agriculture, or environmental health should take this class. Professor Wargo is a wonderful teacher and is adept at leading thoughtful and respectful discussions on complex issues. You will develop a more critical eye for examining environmental problems and evaluating solutions. This course will benefit you professionally as well as personally, since you will learn about exposure to toxins in your everyday life.",
    "This is a great course if you are interested the soft underbelly of the legal and regulatory landscape of food systems. It offers a chance to understand how large institutions function that are involved with food and the cartilage between these institutions.",
    "You will get out of this course what you put into it. If you are interested in the subject matter, it's a great choice!"
