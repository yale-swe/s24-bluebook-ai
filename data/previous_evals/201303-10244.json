    "Yes - I would recommend Math 120 as I think the topics covered in that course are important and necessary for the further study of many subjects (ie math, econ, physics, etc.)",
    "It depends. If you like math, take the class. If you feel confused or struggle at the beginning of the year, don't wait until the end of the semester to ask for help. The office hours and problem sessions are helpful. Based on my limited knowledge of math, this seems more like a class for \"pure math\" people. The concepts, particularly as the course moved into vector calculus, have many practical applications, but none were really mentioned in class. Difficulty-wise, it's one of those classes that doesn't always seem hard, but in order to do well on the midterms and final you really have to understand the ins and outs of the concepts - all those pesky \"fine print\" parts to theorems, etc. You'd be fine taking this class after BC.",
    "Math 120 is not a bad class. You just need to make sure you can do the homework problems and you'll be set.",
    "First half of the semester is remarkably easy, second half is quite difficult.",
    "I would, but only because I think that it is important to understand multivariable calculus.",
    "Really really hard. Don't take it. The final was insanely difficult.",
    "I would say this is a challenging math course, but that it is something great to learn. I would recommend it if someone wanted to challenge themselves.",
    "It is a good course on multivariable calculus. I recommend it to another student. If you either pay attention in class or read the book you should be fine.",
    "Take this class!"
