    "Awesome! Loved it..",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Professor Brown is really good and the material is very interesting. The last exam covered six chapters of the book, which really sucked, and I think the class could have been better if they broke down the material over more exams, but overall everything we went over was fun, interesting and pleasant. The Memento paper at the end was a good closing assignment that summarized everything in detail. But even that was only 3-4 pages single spaced.",
    "This is an ok class. It's not particularly rigorous for a 300-level class... It's basically fun and relaxed though.",
    "Take this class if you like psychology and if you like the movie \"Memento,\" for which you write a final paper. The exams are not easy, but the virtual labs are fun and the textbook is very good.",
    "I would reccommend it to a student who has taken some courses in psych or neuroscience and who is prepared for a fairly heavy workload; I found that the lab reports and short assignments took quite a bit of time.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it if the student is interested in the topic. If they're not interested in it, the lectures can get really boring and repetitive really fast. That said, it's not a bad Sc credit; the tests are sometimes difficult but there are plenty of homework assignments that are easy to get full points on and boost your grade.",
    "Definitely recommend. Professor Brown is great, the material is really interesting, and you'll learn a lot!",
    "I would recommend this course to a student .",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you have any interest in the title. You get to explore in depth the true nature of memory and what we know about it, which for many psych majors is probably very interesting. The material isn't too difficult to understand and the exams, labs, and paper aren't that difficult.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are very much in love with the subject and don't care how it is presented. Lectures and the book are exactly the same thing (down to diagrams, pictures, and wording of sentences), so reading becomes boring at best, and at worst a waste of time. Labs seem somewhat pointless, and are basically just an exercise in using APA formatting, which you probably already know and don't need to reinforce by writing 2 page (single-spaced) lab reports about experiments that have been done hundreds of thousands of time and whose results you know before you begin. However, the material is very interesting.",
    "Basics of Learning and Memory is that: a basic course. I would recommend it if you are interested in a survey course of the phenomena of learning and memory, without too much (though some, and usefully, from journal articles) of the neural processes. The course could be frustrating if a student has had a lot of psych background, but it is still unique for its lab component and other hands-on parts of the course. And Prof. Brown brings in cookies! It's a laid-back, very manageable course.",
    "Why is a 300-level course called \"Basicsof\"? This sums up the main problem with this class-- it doesn't know what type of student it's aimed at. Is it for non-majors? Unless you're used to reading& writing scientific papers, don't expect to follow many of the blazing-fast lectures, do well on the lab reports, or even understand what is required of you on the lab reports. Is it for psychology, cog sci, and neurobiology students? As a science major who's taken several semesters' worth of neuroscience, I found the intro-psych levels explanations and focus on psychology concepts endlessly frustrating (we probably spent four lectures\/labs on operant and classical conditioning). I also didn't appreciate the four \"dry labs\" wedged into the course-- conditioning a virtual mouse or doing the Stroop task on the computer does NOT call for a full writeup.The workload starts out okay (although we read some 20-page scientific reviews-- again, not for non-majors) and quickly gets ridiculous, with busywork-feeling assignments every week or more. The lectures follow the textbook slavishly, so either do the reading or go to lecture-- to do both would be redundant. This should either be a fun, reasonably easy course for non-majors, or a tough, high-level, neuroscience course with neuroscience prereqs for junior& senior majors. Instead, this class assumes you have no background, and yet would be impossible to follow without one."
