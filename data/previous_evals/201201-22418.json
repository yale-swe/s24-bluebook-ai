    "I LOVED THIS CLASS! TAKE IT!!! BEST BIOLOGY CLASS YOU'LL TAKE AT YALE!",
    "Many considerations should go into a decision to take this class. It is first and foremost an enjoyable class in which you will learn a wide breadth of reproductive topics. The class can also be little to no work up until its time to study for the exams at which point a solid amount of preparation is necessary. In the sense of quantity of work this class may even be considered a gut. BUT it is difficult to get a good grade in this course the class averages are always very high and thus this course becomes a very competitive one.",
    "SO INTERESTING, especially if you are a woman or a man and have reproductive organs (I assume that's most of you reading this). Different lecturers every week. LOTS of material, but relevant to our lives. The exams are very specific, and I did not like them. Still worth taking though since there are only three midterms, no final, and no weekly work.",
    "It's great, I'd definitely recommend it but go to all the lectures and study hard for the exams.",
    "I would recommend this course. I think the material is awesome and you learn a lot of stuff that relates to life. Their is no curve but the test are not to to hard. if you study and go to the review section and don't just cram one night before take at least 2 night but preferably more. you should be fine. 3 test and that's your grade. no homework and no final and no they are not cumulative. good class to take. go through all of the slide shows before the test. also go to class preferable it is not long and you will learn things",
    "Definitely take it. Very interesting material, especially if you're pre-med. The tests require lots of studying, but otherwise the workload is minimal. However, be warned about the tests -- the average on the second test was a 91, so the professors made the third one ridiculously hard. It was hard to predict the difficulty of the exams, so you basically have to take notes on everything and memorize it all. But apparently the final grade distribution is generous, so definitely take this! I have no regrets.",
    "trivia based class that is unnecessarily cut throat.sooooo many uteruses.",
    "Interesting material. But beware, the class is totally taught by guest lecturers, so it is difficult to figure out how to learn the material best for the tests ( since it is presented in so many different ways).",
    "Guest lectures vary in quality. Textbook not required. Attend lecture, take notes, attend review sessions, and study hard for the three midterms. Three midterms (non-cumulative) and no final.",
    "Great course for beginners in Biology. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take this course! Really anatomy based- great for pre-meds!",
    "The course was extremely interesting in bringing to light an aspect of biology that was at once more medically focused (thus very interesting), while bringing incredible research that is happening at Yale. However, it's flaws are mainly that it is team taught. The reasoning for doing this when addressing the real-world applications of reproductive biology is clear towards the end when we hear from experts in the field; however, the basics at the beginning do not need to be taught in this format, making it disjointed and confusing.",
    "The course was really good. The tests were a little ridiculously detailed (oh hey, can you remember this one fact on the corner of this one slide that I may have not mentioned in class?), but helpful TAs that give you hints about what to study made the course manageable gradewise. Finding the continuity between lectures was a little difficult, but the material eventually came together. If the instructors make sure to update the slides each year, and if they make sure that each guest lecturer actually has slides, then this course would run very smoothly.Just make sure they actually put up the right slides. Go to the section review sessions, seriously. And make your TAs tell you what to study for the tests.3 midterms (not cumulative), no final, section not mandatory. Class on Friday, but it was worth it, I think.",
    "Take this class! The rotating lecturers means that you'll have some crappy lecturers (by this, I just mean fairly dull), but you will also have AWESOME lecturers, and that makes the whole experience worth it! Also, the biology of reproduction is just really interesting and cool, so I would definitely you take it to be astounded by how crazy and amazing our human body is! However, know that there are only 3 midterms, and you should study hard for them, because some of them are really easy and others are hard, and you just don't know what you're going to get.",
    "If you need a bio credit, take it. You will learn a lot of interesting information and its not that much work, except for before the 3 exams.",
    "This is a fairly easy lecture class, and it's definitely worth taking if you want to do the lab that goes with it. I wouldn't take it as an elective by itself because it dabbles in many concepts without giving you a full, detailed understanding of anything. Since it's team taught, each week is really hit or miss, and the lecturers can get frustratingly repetitive. I'm not a fan of MCDB classes that require a lot of memorization and relatively little in-depth understanding, but the exams were fine.",
    "Not HARD, but the tests are annoying. Study the slides a LOT and go to SECTION, because the TAs are the ones who write the tests.",
    "I would recommend Repro Bio for anyone looking for a fairly easy pre med course. You don't really have to devote that much time to studying for the exams (unless you don't attend any lectures), and you end up learning some pretty interesting stuff.",
    "The lectures are a little boring, but there is no work besides studying for the three tests.",
    "You will learn some interesting things and if you are a woman you will be grossed out forever, but its worth it.",
    "I definitely recommend Repro Bio if you are interested in a biology class (definitely better than MCDB 120). It was very interesting to learn of the different facets of reproduction from different professors with very different teaching styles. You may be frustrated with a few professors but most of them are very engaging and knowledgeable. Definitely take this if you are premed.",
    "the least work for any bio class, only 3 tests and no problem sets. the course was really interesting too",
    "Take it if you want an easy bio class. 3 midterms, no final, midterms are pure memorization - nothing tricky.",
    "Yes this is a great biology class, with or without the lab course. It covers a lot of material but at a good pace. It's also very interesting!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in biology. It is a good class but a lot of material is covered and all of it is liable to be tested on.",
    "Very much a survey course--really easy.",
    "Great class if you are pre-med looking for a bio course. This course goes into great detail about male\/female anatomy and the processes of sexual reproduction, along with useful medical facts about STDs and contraception.",
    "This is a great class for people interested in medicine, reproductive health, etc. While the material is fascinating, be prepared to sit through some boring lectures with people who do not know how to talk to anyone but themselves. The midterms this semester were pretty easy, so be careful that you study ALL of the material (each and every point matters). Overall, if you can get over the fact that the many lecturers will sometimes say the same things or present material in varying degrees of skill and that you will pretty much never seen Klein or Taylor, this class if for you. Plus the lab is great. Take it with the lab. You will enjoy your life so much more.",
    "Good bio credit. Relatively easy. I f you have to take an upper level bio class, take this. It's not amazing, but it's good for a Yale bio course.",
    "Good and interesting, but can get redundant and scattered.",
    "Repro Bio is ok. The class itself is very variable because there are so many different professors; some were fantastic, some were quite bad, and most were fine. There's no homework, which is great, but the tests are a colossal pain- memorization of the most random facts. You're basically penalized for actually understanding the material. The class is fine and often interesting, but I have no idea what my grade will end up being since they didn't say if there's a curve.",
    "Yes, take it. I took it because I'm pre-med, and I think it was a great bio class.",
    "Memorization. Vocabulary tests. Fragmented-- constantly shifting lecturers. Some lecturers barely speak english. They didn't communicate with each other so a lot was discussed multiple times-- often with contradictory information.",
    "Reproductive Biology was a great course. You learn a ton of really cool things, and the work load is very reasonable. The tests are fair, and there is no final! I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only do you learn a lot about the science of reproduction, but you also learn about things that are relevant to life in modern society such as birth control and STDs.",
    "A good mid-difficulty biology course. If you're interested enough in the material, you could still do well even if you're not a bio major or a premed. It's a great course!",
    "Take it if you're interested in the material, because things can get pretty scattered with multiple lecturers. Sometimes, having multiple lecturers\/multiple perspectives on different issues within repro bio research is kind of cool though, so don't let that turn you off!",
    "I really enjoyed the subject matter and did not mind the revolving door of professors- in fact, I enjoyed seeing all these scientists at the forefront of their fields lecture on a subject in which they had a lot of experience. I wish, however, that the TFs for this course we more visible\/reached out to students more. It's one thing to have office hours, but another to host a mass-advertised study session before an exam.",
    "Interesting course about human reproduction, although the lectures are incredibly spotty because they're mostly guest lectures. Some of them are awesome; some of them made me want to tear my hair out. I'm an English major who took this course for a science credit because I didn't want to take a gut science, and I didn't have much trouble at all (that said, I took AP bio in high school so you do need a basic knowledge of bio). It's no work besides cramming for the midterms, and the questions come exclusively from the lectures (and by that, essentially memorize everything on the lectures). Most of my non-bio major premed friends took it as an easy bio course to fill requirements, which is an accurate assessment.",
    "This class is good for people interested in reproductive medicine because you talk about the biology and also defects\/diseases and treatments. Each lecturer teaches 1-2 classes and they are mostly good and interesting, experts from the med school, etc. Some talk too fast and it's hard to keep up, but you're given the slides and the TAs will always help if you have a question. There are 3 tests, no homework, no reading and no final (there are textbooks but the TAs will tell you if there is something specific to read before the test). Test material comes directly from the lectures and is generally straightforward - basically memorize a lot of details (like, as much as possible) before the test and you will be fine. The averages were VERY HIGH, though, so I'm not sure how this will work out for final grading, but I imagine they won't curve down. Like the average on the first test was an 86% and the average on the second test was a 91% (don't get the third back). The TAs were very helpful about what to focus on before the tests because they write the tests and don't want to send you off to study something they know isn't relevant. So go to section and the reviews. Megan, if she's still around next year, was excellent, so try to go to her sections.",
    "Excellent class. If you're not a science major but are looking for a \"real\" science class then you should definitely consider taking this.",
    "Great class. A bit disorganized because of all the guest lecturers, but the good outweighed the bad in the end. I learned so much from this class. Even non-science majors will learn fun tidbits about reproductive health, though I wouldn't recommend this class to a non-science major because it is very science heavy, especially in the first half of the course. There were some great lecturers (MaryJane Minkin, especially). And some not so great ones, as to be expected. But on the whole I really enjoyed this class, and I am very interested in going into ob\/gyn. The exams varied in difficulty (some were quite difficult) -- definitely need to study. The textbook is basically optional; I never read it. There is some interesting information in there if you are interested, so it's not a bad resource. Just not necessary for this class. There is no other work for this class other than studying for exams.",
    "A very relaxing MCDB class. Go to the review sessions, they really help you determine what you need to know and what you don't for the exams. No psets, you don't need to do the reading and just three non-cumulative midterms and no final! Why not?",
    "Pretty interesting, not a lot of work at all.",
    "Definitely take it--interesting course, lectures are engaging for the most part, and not a huge time commitment in terms of outside problem sets or anything as grades are based on 3 midterms.",
    "Relatively easy class but you DO have to study the material in order to do well. Not a total breeze. Quality of lectures varies dramatically between the different lecturers, which can be a little disappointing. Don't fall too behind, even though it's tempting to cram everything into the day before the exam (though yes, it can be done).",
    "So-so MCDB class. Nothing much to learn. Rotating professors so there's not much continuity. Three exams, no final... exams test minutiae and whether you memorized 12 different slide decks. Don't take it unless you really need a bio credit...",
    "The material can be fascinating and clear depending on the lecturer of the day.The TAs were not equal in their review sessions: one pair would prepare presentations summarizing all the important data and slides, while the other pair would only do Q&A format and casually mention what's good to know for the slides.Every professor should have updated slides available on the Classesv2 site. It was difficult to review for certain lectures as the slides were not updated, or there were no slides to review afterall (and you had to rely on taking notes the one time they're mentioned in class).It was very discouraging that since the class did really well on the second midterm, the TAs began to write trick-questions for the final midterm that tested your ability to read through convoluted sentences or memorize obscure details rather than your knowledge of the overall important concepts in each lecture. Just take really good notes and make sure you understanding everything.",
    "Very manageable biology credit. 3 midterms that make up your entire grade. I suggest trying to find someone who has taken the class before to get a sense of what the midterms are like, because studying for them gets significantly easier when you know what kinds of questions to expect.",
    "Not a bad bio elective. Watch out for the tests though. It's not super easy but not a super tough bio course either. Pretty middle of the road.",
    "Absolutely! It is the best biology course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Super interesting material, studying for exams wasn't actually that bad. Lectures are short and although it's MWF, they're pretty easy to attend and pay attention. Really successful lecturers, all doing cool research in OB\/GYN-related fields. The quality of lecturers vary, but most are really good. There are three exams, all require lots of memorization. But the TAs are good at holding review sessions, and narrowing down what you actually need to know for exams. It's a good bio course, especially for premeds interested in reproductive and sexual health, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This class was awesome: very low work load, (probably) very high payoff. I only studied the weekend before the three midterms, no final and no homework. No book reading required, I didn't even buy it. The material was interesting and relevant.",
    "This is one of the easier science\/bio courses in that the exams were simply a regurgitation of facts that are presented in lectures (which are posted online). I would recommend this to a student looking for an easier bio course.",
    "This is a really interesting class that has much relevance to our lives. Make sure you pay attention each lecture and take detailed notes! Don't buy the textbook.",
    "Repro bio is a great MCDB course, especially if you're taking other demanding science courses in the same semester. Nohomework, no quizzes, just three NON-CUMULATIVE exams -- so make sure you go to lecture and study hard for these tests, because they're the only chance you have to build your grade! Some of the lecturers are fantastic, others are very difficult to understand and long-winded. Keep in mind that some lecturers provide a lot of information that is beyond the scope of an undergraduate course, so make sure to go to section whenever possible, because the TAs will help you narrow down what information is most important for you to grasp. Also, don't waste your money on the textbooks -- I didn't open them once because the TAs made the tests entirely based off the lectures.",
    "Take it! Especially if you are looking for an easier, non-intro level biology course. All you really have to do is ask questions if you don't understand something and study really hard for 2-3 days before each midterm. Be warned, it's biology, so there's a lot of memorization. However, the novelty and complexity of the subject material really keeps it fresh.",
    "Interesting course. It was taught on a very basic level, but there could definitely be better unification among the material and lecturers. The first two exams are straightforward but the final is much more specific and detailed.",
    "This is not an easy class but it is not work intensive. There are only 3 non-cumulative exams and no final. This is good for someone like me who doesn't like to have to think about a lot of different things for a class, only having three due dates was great for me. On the other hand you really have to study and put work in if you want to do well with only 3 graded events. The tests were not difficult but you absolutely need to put in the work to be familiar with the information and prepared for the tests. If you are willing to do that this class is an excellent overview of many different topics in reproductive biology. The guest speakers were excellent and the information was absolutely fascinating. Overall I loved this course",
    "Great class! It is refreshing to learn about bio that is directly applicable to a specialized topic in medicine. Most of the guest speakers are great, and they all definitely know what they are talking about. Takes a bit of studying to do well, but it is definitely possible.",
    "This class is an in-depth look at the biology of reproduction: physiology and illness. I would recommend it to pre-meds, as it covers a lot of interesting and pertinent health issues. I would also recommend it to someone who is generally interested in the material. It is a solid Biology\/Sc class.",
    "This class provides a very in-depth teaching of the human reproductive system. It comes with a lot of information, but it's fun, as long as you keep up with the lectures.",
    "dumb course, don't take it, really unfair test questions, dumb TAs that don't know their stuff compared to all the other TAs I've had, a lot of the lectures are fine but a lot are terrible. You should try to get into Strobel's Amazon class which meets at the same time. the content is interesting enough though.",
    "This course is extremely hard to stay alert in because you never develop a relationship with the professor. There are too many professors. Some are outstanding but some put the entire lecture hall to sleep. The tests are like trivia quizes. They do not test your understanding, they test your memorization. Some of the questions basically test whether you read one specific sentence.",
    "Repro Bio has very interesting material. Some of the lecturers are great, some are confusing, some are interesting, some are boring, some have excellent slides and notes, and some have unintelligible slides. My main problem with this course is that a) as someone who had never taken any high school bio, I was frequently confused and had to constantly google the meanings of words or ask for help and b) that studying was very difficult because it was hard to tell what would be important on the tests -- lecturers did not give a good sense of what would be tested.",
    "This a great course! The material was relevant for me as a pre-med student as well as a science major. It was great to be able to focus on one system in the body for an entire semester. Sometimes there may be repeated material between two lecturers but it really helps you make all the connections and understand the system. If you are shopping this course, take it!",
    "Its a good class, just make sure you leave enough time before the midterms to study.",
    "Yes! It is very interesting, not impossible in terms of workload, and you will really learn a lot. the exams are hard and the averages are very high, so I don't know how that will work out, but otherwise a great class.",
    "take it for an easy bio class. it's really interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. It gave me an interesting perspective into the reproductive process, especially the way that hormones have to work together in order to make it all happen. The exams were nice in the sense that materials were taken directly from lecture, so if you came to class, took good notes, and reviewed the slides before hand you would do pretty well.",
    "I had read previous reviews and thought this would be an interesting class. Sadly, my time could have been much better spent.",
    "Great overview of reproductive biology, including the anatomy, stages of development, common issues, and current ethics. Not a particularly hard bio course, so it's perfect for rounding out your schedule.",
    "I absolutely loved Reproductive Biology. I would recommend this course to science and humanity majors alike. It is a very accessible, fun Biology course. There is a new lector for every topic, some repetitions, but I loved this format. It was nice to get a new perspective, new lector style, and new expertise for each topic. In terms of grading, there are three midterms. Do not underestimate these tests, they can be hard if you are unprepared. But they are very do-able if you prepare well. Overall, I would recommend to course to anyone, I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "This is the easist MCDB class aboive the inrto levels. It is also useful. Take it.",
    "Terrible course, DONT TAKE ITThe tests design not to test the student but instead to be easiest to make by the professor and easiest to grade by the TAs.Quite disappointing to see a professor make such a decision.",
    "This class is a mess in terms of the ten (yes, ten) different lecturers you have that all have various lecturing styles. Many of these professors are doctors or accomplished researchers, but it doesn't necessarily show in their lecturing styles because they are so disorganized. There is no work and sections are optional. There are only three exams, and no final, which means that if you mess up on one (or have it on the same day as another), it will significantly mess up your grade. Finally, the exams are pure memorization of random facts. No joke. It's even hard to figure out what you need to know since the lectures are so organized, so FIND A GOOD TA and listen to their hints. I definitely regretted taking this course and thinking I could do well - again, if you miss a point or two on true\/false, it makes a difference since there are only three exam scores.",
    "To summarize, this is a great class if you are interested in reproductive biology and I would highly recommend it to students interested in the material. I would warn students to study more extensively for the final exam because I felt like they made more difficult because people did so well on the first two.",
    "This course provides a broad introduction to reproductive biology. The organization of the course follows the path of development, providing information that progresses from the development of the gonads, to sexual maturation, to conception, to menstruation. Students are able to gain insight into all aspects of reproduction.",
    "This is a solid bio class. It is a gut for a science major and a legit class for a non-science major. The fact that the course uses so many guest lecturers can be jarring. I am glad I took it though because there is a lot of useful information.",
    "Overall, an interesting course. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about reproduction.",
    "Great class, interesting material. The many guest lecturers with many different styles can be a challenge. Lots of pre-meds, so expect the curve to be little to none.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you're looking to fulfill a pre-med bio requirement. It's both interesting and relevant.",
    "It's pretty easy IF you put in the standard pre-med amount of work. If you treat it like a gut the first exam will probably destroy you. It starts off pretty full but by then end it's like 75% females 20% gay-males and 95% pre-med."
