    "I would definitely recommend taking the course, and if I could make one recommendation, it would be to make sure to make use of the Yale College Math tutors (especially in the first few weeks). They are fantastic in helping you make sure you understand the, at times, challenging material.",
    "I would recommend Stat 242 if you are interested in statistics and have a very good mathematical background. It is a theory course and you will not do much in the way of applications, but it will give you a very good grounding in statistical analysis.",
    "This is a good course if you are looking to get an understanding of the theory behind statistics. It goes much more in-depth than the introductory course, but there is still a good balance between theory and application in this course.",
    "You should probably take this course since it offers a good introduction to statistics.",
    "Definitely",
    "I'm not a particularly big fan of statistics, but this class is reasonably straightforward and if you have no statistics background, like me, you could learn a lot. Definitely follows math 241."
