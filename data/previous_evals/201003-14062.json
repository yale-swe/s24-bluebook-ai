    "2) I think the most needed change in the professor's delivery is to provide a critical piece of feedback once in a succinct sentence. Often times the feedback was stated several times over repeatedly, which reduced the power of the initial feedback and often times made people more embarassed than necessary.5) The calzones and salad were a fun change!7c) Elaine was a standout TA. She provided extremely valuable feedback--both orally and written. She and Mark proved to be an extremely adept team in providing well-rounded, thoughtful advice. Her willingness to provide one-on-one help with statistical analysis is absolutely invaluable.10) I think this course should be more highly encouraged for all students pursuing the MFS and MESC degrees. It should be considered a second year segue from Research Methods and some efforts should be made to make sure that the first two weeks of this class aren't too much of a review for those who have taken Research Methods."

    "It provides a timeline, guidance, and opportunity to advance MESc research.",
    "Gives student the opportunity to think through their research projects",
    "The fact that it's keeping my research work on schedule. In many ways this class provides the guidance I anticipated receiving from my advisor.The written feedback from my peers on my last draft in addition to Mark and Elaine's commentary.Seeing my peers grow and improve over the semester. It was very inspiring and exciting!Again, I can't emphasize enough how important this class has been in keeping my research work on track.",
    "1. Mark Ashton is remarkable in his ability to provide insightful feedback to students studying in such an incredibly broad range of academic fields.2. Dr. Ashton will tear you apart during your first presentation to your peers, but you will finish the course a much, much improved presenter. (You present 5+ times during the course.)3. Given all the presentations, you get a lot of peer feedback. It will sharpen your research and communication skills."

    "Keeping presenters to the allotted time--both for their learning and for the sake of those wholisten to the presentations.More notice should be given about preliminary results being expected in the last draft.It would be tremendous if students were given the option to being working with Elaine on their data analysis at the beginning of the semester. Even though it wouldn't be discussed in class until the end of the semester I would have appreciated the opportunity to work on it all along.The name of the course should be changed! Even my advisor didn't know what the class was about and based on the course title advised me against taking it."

This would be aided by a change of the course name to something that more closely matches what the course actually tackles."

If it isn't widely offered approach Elaine about getting started on your data analysis right away in September.Provide good advice to your peers. It's just as valuable as the feedback you receive from Mark and Elaine!Be prepared to be patient with your peers and with the class on the whole, because they will be patient with you.",
    "It is essentially a more structured independent studies course where you benefit from a ton of professor, peer, and TA feedback. That should be your expectation for the course."
