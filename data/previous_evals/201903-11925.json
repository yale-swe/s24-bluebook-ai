   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: HW sets, good class structure",
    "More time could be spent on the coding aspect of the stats and the exams should reflect what's actually taught in the class.",
    "Easy to understand and applicable homeworks. The exams were too hard compared to the homeworks.",
    "Strengths: The coding instructions were very detailed. The examples we studied in classes were great for beginners.",
    "I loved everything about this course except for the exams, which were highly stressful and contained a lot of challenging and\/or intentional trick questions. While I understand the need to achieve a grade distribution, it felt like the exams tested somewhat arbitrary and esoteric information and did not do a good job of measuring students' overall understanding.",
    "The lessons were very clear and the p sets were well designed for learning. The tests\/grading system was kind of hard to understand and prepare for.",
    "Strengths - R was taught in an accessible way by Prof Meyers that was easy to understand (if you put in the effort and time) Weaknesses - because the Professor is new to teaching at Yale\/teaching using grades, there were many challenges in organization and logistics that were confusing during the semester.",
    "Strength: - The instructor is smart and experienced. Weakness: - The class is too big - Wording of instructions\/questions for homeworks and tests are often unclear or puzzling - Too many platforms must be used at the same time, e.g. students must do one part of homeworks or tests in canvas, other in rstudio.cloud, and must comment in Piazza, and then submit another part to gradescope. Sometimes, I thought that I had already submit one part in one platform, but then I was wrong, so I missed certain percentage because of that. But I understand that's the only way the instructor can handle the big factory tasks.",
    "His class was very well organized and dedicated. The every-week psets were kind of tough, but they were definitely helpful to make sure we were on the right track. The coverage of the class was also great; there was no time to do advanced stuff, but based on what we learned in this class, we could develop our skills. Though his teaching was very good, there were some logistic issues. First, the psets are graded back really late. Probably he should hire more TFs to make it. Second, his exam operations, especially on the final, were awful; (1) It was obvious that in-class programming would cause so many unpredictable computer issues and actually it got so messy. It was hard to tell who got the technical issues and who was was just struggling with problems but pretending to have those issues. The coding exam should be a take-home exam. (2) He sometimes gave very unfair indications. During the final exam, some students kept asking him the reason the code did not run as they intended, but that was just their coding problem and they needed to debug by themselves. However, since there were so many students asked the same thing, he told the right code to the class, which was of course a part of the exam. No sense of exam and nothing fair about it. He should definitely work on the clear, fair, and effective logistics on exams.",
    "it's great",
    "This course definitely does a fairly good job at teaching r commands and basic statistical tests. However, for more advanced statistical tests, not enough mathematical\/statistical reasoning was given to truly understand or remember it except for in the understanding that when I see this question, I use this test usually. Further, I felt that the instructor generally organized the course in such a way that the things emphasize least or mentioned as passing statements were that which was put on the exam, while the material that was emphasized and appeared to make the bulk of the class wasn't. I'm frustrated at the miscommunication between learning (e.g. understanding and reviewing and thinking through the course material) and testing (e.g. basically a load of trick questions). I also never got timely feedback on graded assignments, so mistakes couldn't be corrected over time.",
    "The class moves too slowly because it caters to students who have a very weak statistics background despite that being a pre-requisite. That being said, the statistics was a good refresher despite the pace, and the amount of R covered was decent.",
    "Content not particularly suited for large class format",
    "Class size too large",
    "More weightage to projects. Less homework.",
    "My biggest problem with that course was that I am afraid I was never able to understand how deep this course intended to go in the topics we covered in class. From time to time we had in depth discussions on some important and basic topics, but there were also topics which were equally important but we did not really talked about the mathematical explanation or the reasoning behind it. I guess because of this reason I could not assess how well I was doing in that course for quite some time. Similarly, even though we talked extensively about the practicalities of some topics (e.g. we were required to write R codes for Bootstrap) I don't really think that we have talked enough about the ways in which we would use them or when to use them while working on actual data. (Note: especially for bootstrapping, maybe I feel that way because they are used rarely in my own field)",
    "This course provide students with multiple ways to solve problems.",
    "Strengths: it combined the theory and coding. Weakness: the explanation about the theory is not extremely comprehensive.",
    "I liked that the homework helped to solidify the subject and gave us real life examples.",
    "I think this course is perfect!",
    "strength: hands-on weakness: the knowledge part of lectures is not well organized"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, good comprehensive introductory stats class based more on application",
    "Maybe, learning R was fun but there was a lot of work and the final\/midterms were not reasonable.",
    "Yes. It help me with courses that requires reseach",
    "Yes. This class teaches basic but important data analysis method to students.",
    "Definitely, but I would warn them about the exams.",
    "Yes. It's a good course and well-designed. You should take it with JDRS though if you don't want to show up to a 9am class because he records the lectures.",
    "If you are interested in learning R and in learning statistics alongside, yes, but you need to be ready to put in time and energy to gain this",
    "No. They can find many free good online courses for learning Statistics with R that cover the same topics.",
    "This is a great course to start your programming, especially for social science students.",
    "I will. It's very helpful and not so much workload.",
    "No. This course will help with basic statistics and R-programming. However, the statistical tests are covered in a very rushed manner so you may as well take a different course for that part. The data wrangling component was also very rushed and maybe would be good if you don't do a whole lot of work with R anyways, but most of the commands I learned in my 538 class instead.",
    "I believe the course is being taught by someone else in the Spring, so in that case, maybe.",
    "Yes, because you cover lots of material in a short period of time.",
    "Maybe, its a decent intro to R and review of stats",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, if you need any sort of data analysis.",
    "Yes, it is very helpful to learn R programming.",
    "Yes. It's good for students who are not overly familiar with R and who wish to be able to do basic analyses.",
    "I would probably recommend them to look for other courses. Especially for graduate students, maybe taking a more specified course rather than such a survey type course would be more beneficial, as I feel like I do not have the necessary skills to conduct the statistical analyses that I would need to understand the data I'll collect in the upcoming years.",
    "Yes. It's a good course for beginners to start learning coding.",
    "Yes, it is a good class for a novice like me to learn some basic statistics and coding.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes!"
