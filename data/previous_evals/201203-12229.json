    "If you want a challenging but rewarding Microeconomic theory class, this is it. If you're looking for a GPA padder to increase your chances of getting into Phi Beta Kappa, look elsewhere. Kareen Rozen is a fantastic lecturer. She's very clear, and the class generally flows at the right pace. THe problem sets are definitely doable, and the exams were medium to easy as long as you studied all the material. She's also really nice! One day we had a make-up class, and she bought us pizza!",
    "Do not under any circumstances take this class. If you are an Econ major I apologize. If not prepare yourself for some really troubling problem sets. Some are fun, most should be put directly into Mathematica and never given a second thought. Class is not useful. Book is good.",
    "A review of all of the topics of Chris Udry's intro micro with more math.Take it if you want something very mathematically rigorous (still, you won't need too much math to start with). You don't necessarily need to be considering graduate school in economics to appreciate the class, though. I would say the class is more theoretical, and if it's not required for your major, give some serious thought to whether you are looking for something more theoretical or more applied.",
    "Excellent course. Definitely one of the hardest in the department and filled with some very smart people, but extremely worth your time. It gives you an excellent mathematical grounding for microeconomic models and challenges you in a good way. You definitely need to know multivar because there's a lot of math, but linear algebra rarely comes up (and only tangentially). Professor Rozen is one of the best lecturers I've seen at Yale.",
    "GREAT class. Take it if you enjoy intuitive\/math classes. The curve is artificially very low because there are a lot of clueless freshmen in the class (a midterm mean ~75 for a VERY straightforward exam) Exams and assignments are very easy for someone who's done a medium level of math (intro analysis or similar.) It's still doable without any of that, but it's a VERY easy class if you do.",
    "Great class. Decently tough, sure, but well-taught and well-structured. Prof. Rozen is an excellent lecturer and explains the material clearly (if somewhat drily, thought that is more a function of the material than anything else). Problem sets were rather long but not horrible, while the tests were somewhat difficult but very fair if you knew the material. Don't take if you want an easy curve, since everyone else seems to be either brilliant or really committed to learning the material, but for me the extra effort necessary was worth it. If you want to actually understand the derivations behind microeconomic models (or at least begin to understand them), you should take this class.",
    "Fine course, if you're mathematically inclined you will like it a lot more than intro econ (they actually use the word derivative!). It's basically what you expect. Very fair.",
    "Micro Theory is a rigorous second year micro course. There are a few significant differences between intermediate micro and micro theory. Micro theory, as the name suggests, focuses less on the \"plug-and-chug\" approach of intermediate micro and more on the underlying theory behind the theorems and laws etc. If you like hardcore math proofs and variables more than numbers, you will like this course more than intermediate micro. Micro theory is much smaller than intermediate micro, roughly 40 kids to intermediates ~150. You cover roughly the same topics in the two courses, though micro theory goes into some obscure topics than intermediate does not touch. The last three weeks are spent on Game Theory, which is a nice \"treat\" after doing general equilibrium theory for endless weeks before. Professor Rozen is pretty good - she isn't funny and doesn't do much to enliven the sometimes (or, maybe more than sometimes) boring material, but she knows the stuff and is organized and clear and helpful if you go to office hours. She was also a triple major valedictorian at Columbia, which is pretty badass. The problem sets are difficult. Maybe if you are just like naturally good at math and econ you'll breeze through, but expect to spend maybe 6-8 hours on them a week. The tests aren't that bad, which is nice. The bluebook says you need math 120 for this course, but you don't. You can learn the few techniques that micro picks from math 120 in maybe an hour on your own if you've taken differential calculus before. You also have VERY different peers in the two courses. Micro theory is probably 75% male and 75% non-caucasian, while I can only imagine that intermediate micro is>75% caucasian. So who if you liked intro micro, did well in the course, and like feeling like a major nerd and doing math proofs and hearing the professor say \"Quasiconcavity\" or \"Local Non-satiation\" multiple times per class, then micro theory may be for you. And if you are doing the Econ-Math major, then you are required to take it.",
    "Yes, only if you plan to major in Econ-Math or are interested in Math. I was thinking about being an Econ math major but I decided to change my major to physics. I'm planning on doubling that with Econ so this course was not totally necessary. It's an interesting class if you want to understand the mathematical concepts behind micro and not just solve problems to reach asolution. The problem sets are very challenging but the midterms and final were pretty fair.",
    "Tough course, sub-par instructor, too few resources. Again, only take it if you really like mathematical economics.",
    "I would not recommend it. It is the hardest class I have ever taken and I don't feel I have learned that much from it because even though I understand the concepts I can't do the math to solve problems.",
    "I thought that I would enjoy the challenge of Econ 125 as I've always been intrigued by the idea of applied math. Despite adequate preparation, the class was miserable. Unpleasant students, an apathetic teacher, confusing lectures, and no outside resources made a wholly negative experience.",
    "This is an intensive, math-heavy economics course. I have gained a very strong knowledge of microeconomics, but as I took this course as a freshman, it took some time to get used to. If you want to be an Econ major, or are looking for an in-depth economics course, take Econ 125, but be prepared for some long nights trying to make sense of the theory.",
    "This is a hard class. It reveals (but not necessarily questions) the assumptions underlying Intro Micro and explains their implications in a mathematically rigorous manner. Parts of the class are proof-based; don't let that scare you off if you have never had such a class before (I hadn't), but it certainly makes it more challenging. The first midterm was significantly more difficult than the second one or the final. If you commit to the class you can do it, but be prepared for a hard class with some dry material.",
    "A very mathematics intensive treatment of microeconomics. If you plan on pursuing economics (or the math-econ joint major), you should definitely take this course. Real economics is mathematics, not a gut, and this class is proof of that. Be prepared to spend several hours on each problem set. That being said, Kareen Rozen is an amazing professor who is able to clearly communicate the material to us in mostly digestible amounts (find her CV if you ever feel like taking your own ego down a notch), which is definitely a welcome presence in both the mathematics and economics departments.",
    "If you have a strong math background, this class is great! If you don't, intermediate micro is probably a better choice.",
    "Kareen is not the best teacher. She has trouble explaining important things in a systematic and coherent way. Choose this class only if you are a good self-learner. It's not worth the trouble and time.",
    "This class is horrible, run away now. It consisted of rather boring lectures that were unnecessary (at least the textbook is good..) and THE WORST PSETS I'VE EVER HAD TO DO. LITERALLY THESE WERE AWFUL, involving totally absurd and unnecessary computation like the constant (12\/37)^2.....If you're anything like me, you do psets and are interested in them because, in solving problems, you learn a great deal and get a better insight into the subject. These are not those psets. These involve the same rote Cobb-Douglas computations week after week and then a few 'proofs' of trivial things scattered in. The exams were at least well-written and I felt like I learned a little while writing them, but it is not worth it. It's not even that the class is hard. The psets take two to three hours at most a week if you're remotely competent at math, the exams are very study-able even if you never attend lecture like me. However, this class consists of tons of econ\/math majors who devote their lives to it, attending office hours, section, and spending hours on psets. Add this set of classmates to the trivial psets and exams and you get a class that requires like a 95+ for an A. The class does notreally reward your grasp of the material. The exams are written fairly, and are MUCH better than the psets, but they're generally too easy, so the curve can be a bit absurd.Sometimes, taking classes like this are worth it anyways because the material is something you have to know or because they're a requirement. This class is not one of those. Take intermediate micro, don't be an overachiever, don't think this list of horrible reviews you're reading will not apply to you, seriously, run away. now.",
    "Yes! If you like mathy econ, take it over the regular intermediate",
    "i guess. the smart\/hardworking kids will get 115\/100 on tests and the other people will get 70\/100. she always gave extra credit on the exams.",
    "Econ 125 is a math-based micro class. The class is full of proofs and theorems, so if you don't like math, then this class isn't for you. The class is challenging, but the problem sets are interesting and if you put in the work, the class is extremely rewarding. Professor Rozen explains everything well, and in the end, I really loved the class.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are up for a more rigorous treatment of microeconomics than what you had in intro. It would be helpful if you had some mathematical background (esp. if you've taken MATH250), but the professor is so clear that you would still be able to perform well without.",
    "Microeconomic Theory is the more math intensive version of intermediate microeconomics requirement for the economics major. Although the material in this course is difficult, the instruction is great - Just be sure you are comfortable with calculus and mathematical proofs.",
    "This was unlike any economics I had previously seen-- It was a rigorously invigorating mathematical take on a subject I had almost lost all faith in after the AP economics sequence, where the entire course seemed like a load of voodoo magic, never giving clear mathematically-backed explanations to anything explained. It's safe to say that I found a new faith in the discipline of economics, a completely new way of looking at the field. For those who are more mathematically-inclined thinkers like me, and always was ready to shun economics as a steaming pile of non-rigorous bullcrap, I urge you to give economics a second chance through this course. Who knows-- you might even find your life's calling through learning the fundamentals of crafting a quantifiable and logical theory to explain what it means for us to make rational decisions in this course!But for those of you who run at the mere sight of numbers as if they were cooties: BEWARE. This course is not for you.",
    "Econ 125 isthe theory version of Intermediate Microeconomics. It's more math-based and definitely harder. I've heard it often called the hardest undergraduate course offered in the economics department; from personal experience I completely agree. It's recommended for those who want to go into graduate level economics--it probably gives a very good foundation for this, but again this means it is very difficult. If you like theory\/math, you'll probably enjoy the material. If you're dead set on taking this course, definitely shop intermediate micro as well--it is by no means a gut and also gives a very solid foundation in economics.Personally I liked the material, but I thought the professor was not helpful at all. I spent 10-12 hours a week on this course (which was nothing compared to the amount of time spent in the week leading up to an exam) with a friend teaching myself the material and doing the problem sets. This is made worse by the fact the class has zero resources: Rozen refuses to give class notes and the textbook is convoluted, written for a much higher level of econ knowledge, and regardless doesn't follow the class at all. The combination of no class notes and no textbook means if you're confused or if Rozen was sloppy with notation\/messed up while doing a proof, basically you're on your own to figure it out. Moreover, Rozen was often snarky when replying to emails and our pleas for more resources--including receiving even one graded pset before taking the first midterm--went completely unheard. The TF, Johann Caro Brunett, was also not particularly helpful, but at least had office hours at a reasonable time so you could attempt to get some answers (his sections was more often than not totally useless). Had I not been able to find resources online from other professors at other universities teaching similar, but not identical, classes, I would have undoubtably failed this class.If you're willing to put up with a singularly unhelpful professor (I once waited for an hour at her \"office hours\" for her toeven show up), deal with having no resources for a class, and are willing to put a large amount of hours and effort into teaching yourself the material using resources you have to find online from other schools, then you can learn a lot from this class. But you should know that you will largely be on your own, which makes forming study groups particularly crucial. Also, it is important to know that this class is very self selecting, as it is a harder version of an already hard class required for the econ major, which means the vast majority of students taking the class are either the econ professors of tomorrow or very smart applied math majors. This made the curve incredible hard\/basically non-existant. And also why this course probably gets good reviews--I think these people did enjoy the class.tl;dr: incredibly difficult class with an incredibly unhelpful professor, no class notes, and no useable textbook that can be rewarding only if you're willing to put in an unprecedented amount of time teaching yourself the material by piecing together notes and psets from other professors and other universities. PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION. I do not particularly recommend this course.",
    "TAKE IT! Professor Rozen is one of the best economics professors you will find at Yale. Her lectures are neat, clear and very precise. You will definitely learn a bunch of a econ and finally understand some of the overlooked details in intro to micro. The level of difficulty will depend on your level of comfort with proofs and theoretical mathematics. If you think you are good, then this class should not be so hard. If not, then you are like me and will take you a good time to get used to the class. Once you are pass learning curve, it gets easier, but expect to put a lot of time into it regardless. PSETS took from 6~8 hours every single week.",
    "This course is a mathematical look at many of the ideas from introductory microeconomics with a few new concepts. Since I am a prospective math major, I did not find the math too difficult but many of my friends struggled. For many people, this was their first time doing any real proofs (geometry ones don't count). Although the requirements say that only multivariable calculus is required, there will probably be math in this course that you have not encountered before and are expected to accept on faith such as a form of the Hessian commonly used in economics. Overall I think this was a good course that is both challenging and rewarding."
