   "comments": [
    "H&P isn't why I would take DS, but it complements the other two classes very well. In H&P, Burt is worth having.",
    "Okay",
    "I have mixed feelings about DS in general (although I am glad that I took it). Whether or not I would recommend it to another student depends entirely on how much they feel they can manage their own time and be happy with decisions they do make about it. I definitely went through stages of working really hard and efficiently to finish the readings, and others of totally giving up and resigning myself to not finishing when I thought it was over-ambitious \u0096 but I think the main thing for a student deciding to take DS is assessing whether or not they can be happy with a) having no life outside of DS; or b) not finishing all the reading or writing a brilliant paper every week. So much of it has less to do with time management than work ethic and comfort with one\u0092s own level of work and decisions about it.But, that said, DS did introduce me to writers who now mean so much to me, who I might not have encountered if I hadn\u0092t taken it, and also gave me the experience of having incredible professors who make themselves amazingly accessible, and really do dedicate so much of themselves to their students.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. This is one of the best class I had in Directed Studies. The reading is the best among all DS courses, and one should definitely do one's homework that way he\/she can take out the most.",
    "DS H&P is great - you read really important and thought-provoking works from Machivalli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Smith, Nietzsche, etc. You consider themes like \"what make a government legitimate?\" and \"how can one be free in society?\" Highly recommended.",
    "It is a crash course of political thought from Machiavelli to Arendt. Compared to the first semester, there is less focus on the historian and writing style, but more focus on the political theories. I didn't quite understand all the theories until right before the final, but it is very useful to be able to understand various political thoughts and see how it evolved throughout history.",
    "Professor Burt's section is definitely worth taking. This was my best DS section of the semester. At first I thought the class moved too slowly and was too much lecturing, but I grew to like it a lot. Once the class became engaged, the discussions were good, and Professor Burt never allowed a bad point to go unquestioned, so everyone ultimately came to understand the question at hand quite well. Perhaps at timesthere was still a bit too much lecturing, but it was at least usually a very interesting bit of lecture. I really liked the discussions we had about related modern or historical issues. Professor Burt quickly shut down the kid in the class whose comments were rambling, pretentious, and annoying. He encouraged everyone to really think about what the writers at hand had said rather than just accepting a common interpretation. On occasion I wondered whether it might have been valuable for me to learn a more common interpretation in addition, but I'm sure I can do that in my own reading and in future classes, too. Professor Burt was great to talk to during office hours, too, and his comments on papers were often quite interesting.",
    "Definitely, a great overview of some important and interesting thinkers worth doing for anybody."
