    "The material covered in Math 222 is essential for any math\/ applied science major. The class itself is simpler than 225, though all of this truly depends on the professor teaching the section. Prof. Garland teaches a very difficult section of 225 (in which you will arguably learn more than in any other section), whereas Kfir teaches an easier section. As far as 222 is concerned, Lee teaches an easier section than Schultheiss, so you may find the latter prof's class more useful down the road. Hard to tell at this point, but I think I could pretty easily pick up any linear algebra I need down the road after having taken this class.Overall- Recommended.",
    "A fairly easy course and somewhat frustrating as there is a time in the middle of the course where you just seem to be learning different ways of saying the same thing, only really becomes interesting in the last 3 or so weeks.",
    "Mathematics 222 is a class on linear algebra. It deals heavily with matrices and analysis of them. I would recommend Math 222 to someone interested in a math major or an econ major, not to just a causal student looking for a QR, because it is very specific stuff that would not be used much outside of those fields.",
    "A solid, introductory course to the applications of linear algebra concepts. Take this class if you're interested in pursuing anything remotely linear algebra-related; it is extremely useful in mathematical and scientific fields.",
    "Math 225 is a large step up from 222, so if you can handle it, go for that. However, in most cases, if you need to take lin alg, just suck it up and endure this course.",
    "It is basically a high school level linear algebra class. Professor Lee moves very slowly (we only covered through eigenvalues and eigenvectors) and the homework is a breeze (very mechanical). This course really only teaches you how to solve matrix problems, basically no proofs or explanations. It is very boring and Professor Lee has an accent which can put you to sleep. It is required for many majors though so you probably will have to take it. Professor Lee's section is very easy, the tests are easy but have a wicked curve (each point off drops you down about half a grade so like from an A to an A-) so be careful not to make any silly mistakes.",
    "A fairly simple class. The class is hard because the curve is ridiculously high. If you miss more than 2 points you are unlikely to get an A on the exam. Prepare to teach yourself the material.",
    "This class is somewhat gut, if you are looking to take math but want an easy time go for this class",
    "MATH 222 was Prof. Lee was great. Overall, he is an outstanding professor who makes the theoretical material really approachable. He explains things so clearly that it is impossible not to understand the material. The class is definitely meant to be challenging, but not in the way that you will feel defeated on a regular basis. The homework assignments were occassionally tedious, but definitely reinforced the material. I would strongly suggest taking Prof. Lee's section if he is teaching the course in the future.",
    "Not one of the more difficult classes in the math department but well-worth taking.",
    "Linear Algebra, as taught in this section of 222, is easier that you would probably initially think. The professor makes the tests very easy, so almost everyone gets between 85-100%; thus, the curve is terrible.",
    "Easy course, that is so easy it becomes difficult, because everyone finds it easy. Only take it if you feel extremely comfortable while shopping, and are a very careful person who is unlikely to make careless errors on the exam.",
    "Very nice course, but don't get anything wrong, or your grade will suffer... a lot.",
    "Lecture is very similar to the textbook, though the textbook will teach you faster than lecture will.",
    "I don't think Professor Lee is as bad as some people make him out to be. He's actually a pretty good teacher, though he's quiet and classes are sometimes awkward because for whatever reason people don't speak out much in his class (maybe because it's 9 AM?). It's not a bad class either; I took linear algebra in high school, but I still learned a lot because our textbook used a lot of techniques and terminology that were different from what I was used to. Also, the textbook is free and it's really great; if you happen to dislike Professor Lee's teaching or not go to class very often, the book is great at explaining everything. Biggest problem with the class: it's extremely easy, so you pretty much have to get 100 on the tests to get an A. Just don't make a silly mistake!",
    "Math 222 gives you a great introduction and practice with linear algebra. The course may not cover the field completely, but it gives you more than enough to use the principles of Linear Algebra going forward. If you need to take this class I would recommend taking it, though if you really want a complete overview of the field, I would take another section or a more challenging level class.",
    "Take it, but dont take it with jaejeong. you'll know why after shopping his class on just day one.",
    "Awful. This class taught me next to nothing and destroyed my faith in the Yale math department. It did, however, act as a useful study hall to work on assignments from more legitimate classes. I spent about 10 minutes on homework a week.Jaejeong might be the worst professor at Yale. He teaches at a pace that seems impossibly slow, until at the end of the semester you look back and realize that it was probably even slower than it seemed. He is unbelievably dry, extremely boring, and comes across as frighteningly uncaring. I learned next to nothing in this class, and, after figuring out how the class operated, skipped the majority of sessions to catch up on sleep -- where I probably learned more.",
    "If you have to take linear algebra, wouldn't be a bad idea to take it with Jaejeoung. First, the textbook is free, compared to the other class with a textbook costing two hundred dollars plus something. Second, all the answers to the psets are in the book, which makes life a lot easier. Third, Prof.Lee is very clear. He speaks slowly and he writes very neatly on the board. The pace is also rather slow, which helps for people like me who are not the best at math. In fact, we didn't really cover a whole lot of material, so it is very manageable work load. Last, the exams are reasonably easy. So yes, do take math 222 with Jaejeoung.",
    "This class was pretty horrendous. I would avoid it, esp. with this professor, unless you absolutely have to take it. The material was relatively limited and not too hard to understand, but one of the midterms was bizarre (all the questions were based off the answer to the first question) and the class somehow became a pretty stressful experience. Again, avoid if possible.",
    "Linear algebra. Simple.",
    "yes, by all means",
    "Yes. Linear Algebra is useful, the workload is manageable, and the material is not overly difficult.",
    "Take it if you want an easy A. Seriously, this is the easiest class at Yale.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. However, Lee is surprisingly coherent and is completely by the book. He will never throw a crazy test question at you. Linear Algebra is quite interesting but dont expect any \"applications\".",
    "I would not recommend someone to take linear algebra with Professor Lee. He is a good teacher, but he moved the class far too slowly, leading to a negative curve on each test, which is unfair--a 93 percent should not be a B+. Further, he created tests in which not knowing the answer to one question could prevent a student from even beginning the next three, which is unfair.",
    "It was good. Professor Lee goes slowly through the material in a way that is very helpful. I would definitely recommend the course. There is always help if you need it, and the material is quite interesting. Overall, it was a very good course."
