   "comments": [
    "I would always recommend DS",
    "DO DS! Even with a mediocre section, the works we read this semester are really unbelievable.",
    "I have mixed feelings about DS in general (although I am glad that I took it). Whether or not I would recommend it to another student depends entirely on how much they feel they can manage their own time and be happy with decisions they do make about it. I definitely went through stages of working really hard and efficiently to finish the readings, and others of totally giving up and resigning myself to not finishing when I thought it was over-ambitious \u0096 but I think the main thing for a student deciding to take DS is assessing whether or not they can be happy with a) having no life outside of DS; or b) not finishing all the reading or writing a brilliant paper every week. So much of it has less to do with time management than work ethic and comfort with one\u0092s own level of work and decisions about it.But, that said, DS did introduce me to writers who now mean so much to me, who I might not have encountered if I hadn\u0092t taken it, and also gave me the experience of having incredible professors who make themselves amazingly accessible, and really do dedicate so much of themselves to their students.",
    "Directed Studies, of course. The second semester had brilliant, indispensable material. So glad I stuck with it. But section was uninspired most days.",
    "I would definitely recommend the second semester of DS. Although it's hard and the pace picks up considerably, the works we read are fabulous.",
    "DS Lit is a lot of reading, but a good class. There's no depth to the readings, and you might be better off reading them on your own time, but the holistic DS experience is probably one of the best things you can ever do.Wood was a moderately good section leader, who goes in depth on several, short passages out of very, very long texts. His class can be frustrating at times because of the fluff that people bring in. He doesn't control the BS sometimes, which is annoying.",
    "This in general is a good class. While an incredible amount of reading, the works are absolutely fantastic -- do your best to get through as much as possible! Professor Wood is a quite good seminar leader, althoughseminar does sometimes have a tendency to get bogged down in the opening pages of the works we read.",
    "DS Literature second semester is amazing. We covered more of the excellent writers you've always wanted to read - Petrarch, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Goethe, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Proust, Eliot. The lectures were great, and the papers will help you grow as a writer. Section with Christopher Wood was also very good. He is extremely knowledgeable in so many areas, and asked many interesting questions. Sections consist of close readings of a handful of passages, which I enjoyed but may not be for everyone. My only critique of Professor Wood is his time management - in reading short passages, we often didn't get all the way through the works to the most important scenes. While this was helpful when I hadn't finished the reading, I worry that I missed vital conversations that my peers in other sections may have enjoyed.",
    "Sure! I would recommend it!",
    "4. Directed Studies will re-teach you how to read, write, analyze, discuss, and \u0096 above all else \u0096 think better than any other freshman course or program at Yale. I know it sounds cocky, but I\u0092m finding myself better prepared as a rising sophomore than mypeers who didn\u0092t take the course \u0096 even those who came from far more rigorous high school backgrounds. It\u0092s intense, though, and you have to want the immersion in the Western canon to enjoy the course. It\u0092s not worth it if you just want the kudos. I\u0092d take it again, though, without a second thought."
