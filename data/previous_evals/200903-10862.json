    "The course was primarily lecture based with a few discussions on relevant papers. I would have preferred a few more class discussions. The professor was very receptive to questions and really knows the material well. Overall, this class is what you make of it. If you're serious about using the final paper to expand your knowledge of forest dynamics, then can really get a lot out of what you learned. The biggest criticism of this class is that we never once got into the forest! We were supposed to but never did for one reason or another. I think that the professor should just pre-plan a nearby excursion to any nearby forest in New Haven, as that would be better than nothing. What was planned were bigger excursions into either Yale Myers, Great Mountain, or Harvard Forest. None of them materialized. For next time, press her on at least doing one half-day trip to a nearby forest.I also would have liked a few practice exercises throughout the semester in order to practice the material learned. These only happened right before the final.",
    "best class I took this semester, the lectures were always mind blowing.",
    "10. This is a course that is rarely offered by other, similar programs and I think it's a great, distinguishing feature of Yale's program. It's tremendously valuable and the material is engrossing and extremely practical.9. A field trip was attempted, but never made. It would have been a very nice supplement.2. Often students were referred to Professor Berlyn for answers to questions asked in class. It might have been good to have Graham Berlyn guest teach a lecture to address some of these questions. But all in all, the class much appreciated Ann's honesty and willingness to admit when another member of the faculty would be better able to answer a question.We appreciated the efforts to make apical dominance and control less confusing and I can tell that significant improvements were made over last year's class, but some work is still necessary.",
    "Field trips would have been very useful in this course. So much of the course was abstract because we did not get to go see real stands of trees. Very confusing--we have vans, we have forests, we have Fridays with no classes.",
    "Frustrating not to get a field trip in on such a rewarding class! This class was amazing both because of the concepts, how they were taught and the class dynamic. The interest and enthusiasm of the other students allowed Ann Camp to really display her range of knowledge on so many topics - it also allowed us to grapple with a lot of conceptual nuance. (Apical control vs dominance; carbon dynamics; ecological succession).This class was the best forest ecology foundation i could have asked for as a newbie in this field and I hope that's a great sign about my chosen field of study!"

    "The subject matter was fantastic, and I loved it!",
    "Ann is very open to questions and discussions.",
    "The final paper gave you the best opportunity to dig into an area of forest dynamics and practice using what you learned.",
    "the lectures",
    "The material was fantastic, the readings provided prospective, and the Oliver\/Larson text was engrossing and very helpful. The discussions that we had about our readings were a definite highlight. Ann's extensive experience shone through.The exercise we did in class during the last week was fantastic! It really made you synthesize everything you had heard over the semester and turn it into practical decisions and conclusions. It was a great way to wrap up the course.",
    "Ann's enthusiasm, energy, and field experience were very useful for the course.Group discussions of articles were very useful.",
    "The conceptual discussions and debates - the question asking and answering.The integration exercise was a terrific practice in applying our understanding in a supportive context where we really got to learn from the mistakes we made in the exercise. I highly recommend that it stays as a part of the classwork."

   "comments": [
    "Time to respond to student questions\/confusion.",
    "Some of the concepts were fuzzy, and sometimes there were contradictory explanations given of the material.",
    "I strongly recommend a field strip in addition the theoritical classes.",
    "The assignments helped, although I thought the Compounds Revision was a complete waste of time and didn't enhance my knowledge at all. It seemed more like we were doing the professor a favor with that assignment than anything else.The field trips were, on the whole, great and I loved the variety of places we saw. Driving 2.5 hours to see the Living Machine for 30 minutes seemed absolutely ridiculous. I would cut that trip out next time this class is offered.",
    "Field trips are essential for understanding this information. We were not able to go on a single one when really we should have had a few.",
    "a few more assignments during the semester to practice using forest dynamics theorygetting into the forest!",
    "Field trips would have greatly complimented the lectures.",
    "we never managed to get through all the material in lectures, so I guess what needs improvement is culling the material down to fit into 80 minute lectures. Or maybe just less questions, which lead to tangents during the alotted time.",
    "There was never enough time. We weren't able to complete some lectures and I think it stressed both the instructor and the students. I left every class wishing wecould have kept going. If more time was allotted for the class then perhaps more discussions could have been incorporated - and the discussions were extremely enjoyable and allowed us to synthesize the information and learn from each other.",
    "Too much reliance on Powerpoint slides. Slides make class flat and undynamic and give the impression that we've seen the woods without us ever actually seeing them. Slides should not provide pacing to the course--the professor should provide pacing and use slides to illustrate points. Also, Powerpoint slides are not good as study guides--one person's way of abbreviating something (the professor's way) is usually not the same as someone else's (a student's way). With all their photos they are cumbersome to work through on a screen and use a ton of ink to print. It is better for the professor to spend more time on the concepts at a slower pace, let students write down the ideas in their own way and use those notes for studying.After taking this class, I have the impression that there is a whole quantitative side to stand dynamics that other schools teach but FES shies away from. We had a very brief look at it but this was not enough, and I come away from the class with the impression that stand dynamics is almost as post-modern as the humanities.Very confusing presentation of apical dominance and apical control. Still not sureI could say what the difference is.",
    "Time, too much to cover, too little time.When we ran out of time at the end of a session, I became a bit frustrated by any duplicate material that we spent time on at the expense of new material."
