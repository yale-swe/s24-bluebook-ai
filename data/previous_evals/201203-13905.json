   "comments": [
    "very interesting course. it was a fun course too with interactive style of teaching",
    "I felt that going into the course, you needed to have some knowledge of the current health care system even though it is an introductory level course. I did not learn much.",
    "Good.",
    "Easy grade. Course was not great.",
    "The course is really needed if you are going to be in the health care industry!! I think it could be more helpful if we had to write short paragraphs on many specific topics rather than just writing papers on broad topics .",
    "too difficult for international student",
    "I found lectures to be quite boring. Dr. Gusmano could benefit from following his slide better because he often strays off topic and students get lost. That being said, Dr. Gusmano has an incredible amount of knowledge--I think we all benefit immensely from this, but a more organized, easy to follow format would be more suitable for students. Additionally, \"presenting the facts\" is more appropriate than presenting opinions in this lecture format.",
    "This was my favorite course of the semester. It gave me a much better understanding of important health insurance programs, like Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. I liked that historical and political context was given for each of the topics, but at times I found it difficult to follow the sequence of the lectures and be able to synthesize the main points; there was a lot of background and political information to get caught up in. I especially enjoyed talking about issues that are current and will play an important role in my career as a public health professional, like pay-for-performance and the Affordable Care Act. I liked the lecture format of the course, but think the course could be even more effective if we had spent the first week or two covering the basics of the healthcare market in the US (the basic structure and evolution), though I know this would be hard to do in this short time. I do think that if we had a very clear outline of these two topics I would have gotten even more out of the course.I really liked that the course assignments were papers. A paper, as compared to an exam, gave me the chance to really think about the issues and my arguments, and develop them over time. I learned more from the papers in this course than I learned from any assignment in any other course.",
    "It was a decent class. I expected to learn a lot more. The classes are usually disorganized and while the Professor is evidently interested in policy, his enthusiasm normally led to ramblings and somewhat unorganized lectures.",
    "The course was great. I liked the lectures were structured. This is very different from our other classes and I think it was difficult for some of them to cope. The professor leaves room for you to do more if you are up for the challenge. Like if you did all the readings and read the book you would know a lot more. I think a lot of kids didnt rise to the occasion and complain. I mean seriously we are supposed to be adults. Just because this class didnt have scheduled exams there were students who didnt take it as seriously. I am not saying the class needs scheduled exams I am just saying take this in mind when looking at other people's comments.",
    "I wish that the topics were organized a little differently starting with existing policy and systems, like topics on Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA, were discussed first and then get into theory later. I would like to have learned more about healthcare systems at state and local levels more. The professor is obviously very very knowledgeable and is entertaining to listen to.",
    "Strengths:Great knowledge of policy concepts.Allowed the students to be accountable for their work.Weaknesses:Very long. Could have benefitted having the course twice a week.Didn't really take time to grade our papers as well as he could have.",
    "Overall, I was a little disappointed - I didn't learn as much as I had hoped to about America's health system (honestly, I feel like I learned more about those in Europe!) The papers were the most valuable part of the class, as they forced you to grapple and understand issues and to develop arguments about things you might not be totally comfortable with.",
    "The course is very interesting. However it sometimes lacks a certain degree of continuity (sometimes seems classes are jumping from one theme to another...and then going back). Very interesting reading material.",
    "I thought that the course as set out in the syllabus was fantastic, but that in the end we did not learn all that we were meant to. There was a graduate student who spoke at one class that was basically teaching at a high school level. I appreciate giving a young guy some experience, but it seemed more like the prof couldn't make it to class and just filled in the time.",
    "strengths: gain broad understanding of health policy issuesweaknesses: only talked about a couple of issues in depth, really overlooked some current issues",
    "The course was interesting but did not provide the health policy foundation that I had hoped for. I was very naive to health policy and still do not feel well-versed or comfortable in the subject after attending every lecture. Gusmano is very knowledgeable but the course is not organized in a way that is easy to follow. I liked the paper assignments for reinforcing the material and requiring us to demonstrate understanding. The take-home final also seems like a fair assessment.If I were to recommend changes to the course it would be to start with more basic subjects about how our health care system is structured before delving into the details. I would also recommend requiring short reading responses or some other strategy to motivate students to read the articles.",
    "This course could be improved if we were given some kind of organized, general presentation of the American healthcare system so that we can build on this knowledge throughout the rest of the semester.",
    "Class was extremely interesting, but a little more on the history and more structured explanation of different health system components would be helpful.",
    "Strengths: engaging approach to American healthcare policy.Weakness: the one class per week, 3 hour session was a little strenuous, especially in a very large class.",
    "It is good but a little bit disorganized in terms of the overall framework.",
    "This class was extremely hard to learn anything from unless you had a background in policy. As someone who had never taken a policy class before I struggled to follow with the lectures and really only learned from the reading and what I did on my own. Having a straight lecture for 3 hours is really ineffective especially in a topic area like policy which leads itself to debate.",
    "3 papers and a take home final. There should have been more information on the ACA which was the most interesting lecture.",
    "I think the class does a wonderful job of providing an overview of health policy material. However, I was surprised at the extent to which the professor presented political bias. From a professor, I would hope for a little less political opinion, and for the conversations to be a little less leading so that students can ideally form their own opinions. That said, he was VERY fair in grading papers, even if you didn't agree with him :)",
    "The 3 papers were helpful...I felt like the only things I learned were through researching for the papers.",
    "The course is slightly disorganized.",
    "Instructor was clearly knowledgeable, communicated very well, and was great to listen to. The course topics moved fluidly and the paper assignments were great learning tools. I genuinely enjoyed the class and don't enjoy policy.",
    "- Good overview of the US system and health policy making- I like the political science focus- The essays were a great opportunity to reflect and apply learnings- I also liked that the essays focused on argument structuring rather than research. It's a good skill to practice.- It's easy to feel small in this class. Not a lot of personal touch, but that's the nature of big core classes.- There were a lot of readings, which was hard to keep up with at times.",
    "I learned very little about health policy.",
    "I thought the course was a really interesting introduction to the main issues in health politics, policy, history, and economics. I loved the Deborah Stone book and its framing for the course - I would have liked to see it even more integrated into the course. I thought she had some really interesting ideas about policy that were really applicable and a cool way of thinking about things.The lectures were a bit stream-of-consciousness, but I actually really enjoyed them. I thought the content was fascinating and took a very holistic approach to understanding policy and the current healthcare situation in the Untied States. I particularly appreciated the political science lens to the course.",
    "I thought this course was incredibly interesting. My biggest complaint would be the lack of structure for the lectures. It is very difficult to learn from when the topics are presented in a stream-of-consciousness format.",
    "Not much of introduction to policy.I didn't have any of the basics prior so I had to figure it out for myself.",
    "This course doesn't seem designed for people who know nothing about health policy. For a introductory course it should provide more basic information rather than more theoretical concepts. Also, not enough feedback was given for assignments.",
    "This is an extremely important and informative class. It is extremely relevant to all of us. The writing assignments are good ways to solidify our understanding of the material covered in lecture.",
    "Good course, great intro into Health Policy.",
    "Gusmano lectures for 2-3 hours from the stage. The content is very important, but delivered relatively poorly. He uses lecture slides with really monotonous color fonts that are barely helpful to him and to the audience in paying attention. He throws out words (example: EMTALA) without giving background\/foundations for it. It is impossible to take notes during his lectures because he is just continuously talking. With clearer powerpoints with better background information a lot more could be conveyed in this course so that people leave it feeling like they understanding the basics of the US Healthcare system as well as some foundation in policy. The papers are NOT read thoroughly. Two of my three papers have zero comments on them and just a grade. Clearly a smaller, discussion based course would be much better for this. I came to Yale to study health policy, and this could have been one of the best courses here, but instead I did not learn much beyond the background I already had, did not get any feedback on my work related to it, and overall feel like this course was a waste of time. Very disappointing.",
    "the course is good, it might be nice if lecture notes are more organized (class reader?) Some us are very new to the subject and it was a bit of a struggle to make order of the information.Class is very engaging and paper topics help guide our progress in understanding the material. The reading he provided are wonderful, and very helpful.",
    "I think this course was a good introduction to Health Policy. I think the weakness of the course is something that is difficult to change; the topics lend well to discussion, which is difficult to do in lecture format.",
    "Clearer organization of concepts would be helpfulIt could be helpful to have a discussion portion of the course where students could debate different elements of the course",
    "Don't really feel like I learned much. I definitely did not learn much from the lectures. I did enjoy the papers, how they were theoretical and sort of philosophical, outside of the papers, I don't think I got much out of the class.",
    "It was hard to learn about the policy structures without a textbook. The 3 hour lecture once a week made it hard to pay attention, as opposed to an hour lecture more than once a week.",
    "The course provided an interesting overview of health policy topics. Unfortunately, the lectures tended to jump between topics quickly and it was difficult to understand overarching themes. Also, while the papers provided an interesting opportunity to explore health policy issues - the topics did not necessarily build off of topics discussed explicitly in the course. It would have been helpful to have more of a connection between the assignments and lecture.",
    "Interesting conversations about politics and health. Very relevant to contemporary discussions happening in U.S. health policy.",
    "Incredible course - my favorite thus far at Yale!",
    "Awesome",
    "The class hour is too long for students to focus on the content",
    "really useful",
    "This was not an introductory policy class, it was an opportunity for Prof Gusmano to give his opinion on health policy and politics for 2-3 hours each week. There was no structure, the readings were often one-sided, the essay prompts were one sentence long, there was no need to attend lecture to do well in the course.",
    "It's a really interesting course with a lot of material that is relevant to healthcare in the US today.",
    "The class needs more direction for assignments.",
    "This is a great course and a good introduction to health policy and health systems for anyone who is interested in pursuing a public health career. I think some more background could be provided as an introduction to the American health system because a lot of us international students do not have any background on certain terms and definitions that were used during class lectures. I also think the class time of two hours and fifty minutes is too long and could be reduced to two hours or the class could be divided up into two class sessions.",
    "I thought some of the readings were fascinating, especially Stone's book. Others were fine. I didn't learn that much about the actual structure of the health care system, though. Additional concentration on that would've been nice.",
    "Strengths--great readings, they were the perfect balance between current research and conceptual components. Assignments were straightforward and clear.Weaknesses-power points were disorganized and did not necessarily overlap with the readings.To improve-Better to have two classes per week, instead of one class that meets for 3 hours.",
    "It's a great course, I'm not sure that it really delivers what it says it will but you definitely learn a lot.",
    "The class had great material and the instructor knew it well. However, the lack of an outline for each class was not the most effective way to teach the material. Overall, the course felt disjointed",
    "I personally wasn't able to get all of I could out of the course because I wasn't very familiar with Health Policy coming into the course. Even as a U.S. citizen I felt sort of lost, even with the U.S. policy stuff.",
    "It should be held more times a week so students have more incentive to stay engaged",
    "This is a good introductory course to the American healthcare system, but it assumes students know a lot more at the beginning than what is actually the case. I was eager to take this course to get a better understanding of the innerworkings of the HC system, but Gusmano is so knowledgable that I was almost lost immediately. Great breadth of knowledge, but I lacked the baseline information to absorb as much as I wanted to get out of the course. Also, the structure of a 3 hour lecture once a week made it hard to grasp the material. I think hour and a half lecture twice a week would be a more enjoyable and efficient structure.",
    "Great course overall.",
    "I enjoyed this introduction to health policy and the 3 papers in place of exams. I wish the class had not been quite so long and once a week, though.",
    "Excellent course. An outstanding review of the US health care system, including more politics and history than I was expecting but that provided much more context for why we have the crazy system we do. Michael Gusmano is an outstanding lecturer (probably the best lecturer I've had in any class, including undergraduate, medical school and now public health). Listening to him talk for two hours straight is incredibly interesting.",
    "The course was very informative and interesting. I feel that I learned a lot about the history of healthcare policy in the US.",
    "very good course - sometimes it ran a little long, but those days were rare.It was worth it - I really liked the course",
    "Strength of the course is it's main content. Gusmano does a good job at offering insight and trying to break down complex material. Weakness is there is little room for discussion. Class is mainly just lecture format for three hours.",
    "The course lectures did not follow a logical sequence or provide an introduction to health policy.",
    "Course has great intention but was instructed poorly. 80% of material was on Medicare and I believe the US health is way more than that. The time period of 3 hours is too long for passive class. We need to break the session t",
    "This course was very interesting. Students with little health policy understanding could come into this course and enjoy themselves. It was a little long at three hours and focused a little too much on Medicare, but the professor still made it interesting.",
    "This course presents an enormous amount of information, which is both a strength and a weakness. It is a bit confusing at times, and a more systematic overview of how the pieces of the healthcare system fit together may be a better place to start, but to its credit the course covers a lot of systems mechanics, political theory, and health Econ research.The lack of a discussion section is a huge weakness of this course, especially since the only real way of engaging with the material in a discussion-oriented way, the three midterm papers, were given pretty minimal feedback and no discussion opportunity.",
    "Weakness: I didn't learn that much. Really just learned about the difference between Medicare and Medicaid. There is a lot more to health policy that I didn't learn about.Two lectures a week might be better. The lecture was too long.",
    "It was a very good course. I learned the American health care system",
    "a great course to have a overall understanding of the health care system in US and it provides deeper insights into medicare and medicaid.",
    "Strenghts:- Great course textbook. The policy paradox written by Deborah Stone is an eye opener for those trying to understand health policy- Prof Gusmano is very easy to listen to. Exciting speaker that can talk about a subject at depth and make it relevant to the audienceWeaknesses\/Areas to improve:- For a class which is 3 hours long, there should be more audience interaction to keep the class engaged for the full duration.",
    "The course could be more organized in delivering the information",
    "Not bad. Didn't like the all-essay format. No incentive to pay attention in class\/do readings. Maybe a bit too lenient of a grader. Other than that I liked it. Good selection of readings.",
    "This course was very helpful in understanding the American health system but, as an international student, I struggled because I had no previous knowledge. An overview of the health care system at the beginning of the class would be helpful. It could also be improved if it covered other health systems as well, in that way one could compare among them and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.",
    "The structure was very intuitive, and flowed nicely from one topic to the next.",
    "I found the course disorganized. The subject matter was very interesting but the way it was presented and when it was presented made it difficult to develop a strong understanding of the material.",
    "There were a number of strengths. It was very interesting. I learned a lot about the history of America's healthcare system in the 20th& beginning of 21st centuries. The articles were interesting and of a high calibre. Dr. Gusmano is clearly very knowledgeable about this area and conveyed a passion (mixed positive and negative\/sarcastic?) for the field. Dr. Gusmano is also quite entertaining\/humorous. There were a number of weaknesses. While there was a general organization to the lectures, the organization broke down at times and it often wasn't totally clear what the main focus at any one time was - though in the long run, we covered a lot of topics and going over things a few times in a few lectures helped to hit home some main points. Also, the topic for the first paper wasn't very clear. Plus, it took a very long time for Dr. Guzman to grade papers and get them back to us - I think he made a lot of work for himself by requiring 3 substantial essays and a final.I think this class would benefit from more opportunity for discussion. It is a very big class and the topic calls for more discussion.",
    "Interesting discussions of current issues.Would have appreciated some more background information. For those not familiar with the field, it was difficult to follow some of the lectures, especially when it was assumed everyone was familiar with the abbreviations or the roles of certain parties\/persons.",
    "The class was initially very intimidating especially for people like me with no policy background. Given that this is a core requirement, I feel like it should cover policy from a more general and basic level.",
    "Overall, the class was below average. There was a heavy emphasis on Medicare and Medicaid, while ignoring more pertinent topics of health care systems. The lectures strayed significantly off topic as well. The papers added strongly to the class, however. I felt like I learned a great deal in the process of writing the papers.",
    "Overall, I am happy after taking this course. We were able to cover a lot of material, and we gained a thorough background on important US Health Policy issues. Because we were dealing with real-world problems throughout, the class had an air of urgency which made it fun to be a part of. The Professor has a great sense of humor which shines through in the lectures. He is also very knowledgable about the subject matter and is very approachable. He was great about answering questions and engaging in debate about various ways of looking at problems. He was also more than happy to provide further readings if asked and really provided students with the freedom to develop new ideas when writing the papers. Overall it was a great experience - I can't say there were any weaknesses.",
    "STRENGTHS: I learned a lot in this course via the lectures, readings, and writing assignments. WEAKNESSES: The lectures were a bit long, but Dr. Gusmano did his best to make them engaging. IMPROVEMENTS: The papers should be returned a bit quicker just to give students more time to reflect\/ask questions and begin the next paper.",
    "This course got me to start thinking about the health policy system in the US. The information was dense, but I feel like I walked out with a better understanding of Medicare and Medicaid.",
    "covers the us health care system very well"

I felt very lucky to be able to hear his thoughts on health policy each week. At times, I did find it hard to identify and synthesize the main points of the lectures, as the class was a long lecture with few PowerPoint slides used and often diverted into conversations about side topics (which were interesting!). I did feel that the course was very political in nature; I would have gotten more out of it if the basic concepts around health policy (important programs, evolution of the system) were presented from an objective viewpoint early on in the course so I had a basic understanding to go on.Professor Gusmano was always open to answering students' questions, and provided me with feedback about my ideas for the papers whenever I asked. I very much appreciated his willingness to help.",

He seems genuinely knowledgeable and passionate about the topic. I was offended by the multiple misspellings in the final exam - it seemed really sloppy and made me feel like he didn't really care what students thought of him. Having said that though, I thought he was great - but he could have been much better so I feel like it was a bit of a missed opportunity.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Lecturing style is not agreeable with most students. Although he is very articulate and \"real\", his lectures ended up being rambling off topic and not follow any chronological order or logic.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano has a great command of the material. He speaks articulatelyabout the subjects and makes good use of the existing evidence. He also responds well to questions posed in class. I think he could speak more basically especially in the beginning to better convey the state of U.S. health policy. I was impressed overall with his expertise.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano was a great instructor. He made the subject material interesting and helped me see topics from different angles. He was very willing to help students and I was appreciative of his email responses to questions and even phone conversations regarding paper assignments. I enjoyed having Dr. Gusmano as an instructor.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano was a very engaging lecturer, who allowed for individuals who did not have a great grasp on the topics to become more acquainted with the current problems in healthcare policy.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Michael is an extremely knowledgeable, articulate, humorous instructor. Although he likes to dive deep into a narrow topic instead of giving us the basics or fundamentals of health care system first which I think is more important for students without this background.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0You could tell he is brilliant, but a very ineffective teacher. Lectured for three hours and barely took any comments. Hard to follow.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He was good.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He CLEARLY doesn't want to be there, he doesn't read the papers, and he spends his time name-dropping and rambling instead of presenting a cohesive lecture to students who are entering the health policy field.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He adores talking and gets carried away by different topics.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Fantastic.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0- Deeply knowledgeable on the topic and clearly very passionate- I want to one day be able to get up in front of 300 people and off the cuff talk about health care topics. It's very impressive.- There could be more feedback provided with the papers. I understand that there's a lot of them, but I feel like we could involve the TAs more and improve our writing skills.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano had a really unique lecture style that I found a nice change from the many hours of powerpoints we have in our other classes. He had more of a story-telling lecture format that I thought was really interesting and provided me with a lot of context for the content he delivered. He presented on very relevant and interesting topics about which he clearly has done a lot of research and has a broad understanding.I would have liked more communication from him though - I know it's a huge class and he can't grade every paper. But it would have been nice to get more feedback on each paper. I think it would have been a really great class (instead of just great) if it had been smaller and he had really had the chance to interact with all the students.Overall though, interesting professor with some interesting thoughts on policy and politics.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I thought Professor Gusmano was one of the smartest people I have ever learned from. He knows the subject manner absolutely inside-out. Because he clearly understands the material so well, his lectures sometimes went a little fast. I also would appreciate more feedback about our papers.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0One of the most amazing lecturers I have ever had. I wish the class was more up to date. The take home final asked about MMA and SCHIP!",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0A very interesting and engaging lecturer, but at times gets off topic or hard to follow.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is extremely knowledgable and his lectures are filled with relevant information.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very smart, knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Cares a lot about the material and is impressively able to talk for long periods of time.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He is an excellent lecturer, and the story telling style is great since our class is long. I think if his lecture notes are separated per lecture and also a little bit more clear it would be much better. And he lost some of our papers, but was very helpful with sorting out the situation.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is a very engaging professor. My only suggestion would be to minimize tangents as a result of questions asked in class, which sometimes tended to throw the lecture off topic sometimes. I have no background in Policy, so I was lost at times.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I think a successful class requires a large among of effort on part of both the student and professor. My perception is that Professor Gusmano put little effort into the class, which is understandable given that he is employed elsewhere. And he didn't expect too much out of the students either, which makes it fair, but it also meant that I got very little out of the class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano is a great lecturer and is very knowledgeable about policy and governmental policy",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano provided the class with many interesting lectures throughout the semester, but many of them lacked a cohesive theme. He also illustrated many concept through political or historical stories, which while engaging, where often filled with acronyms and names that I struggled to follow. He responded to emails and questions promptly, but unfortunately did not provide substantial feedback on the essays.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Loved his sense of humor, and the style of teaching (mixing political history and health)",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Great teacher, a true gem. It is very unfortunate that he will not be returning, and I wish that Yale would have tried harder to get him to stay. He is the best listener to student comments in class that I have ever witnessed, and his ability to respond to questions is unparalleled.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Excellent",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0full of passion",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Seemed obvious that he didn't care about the course. Class was supposed to be 3 hours but it was usually only 1.5. His \"lectures\" were hardly prepared and facts were scarse. I learned more about his opinion on various health laws than I did about the actual policies. He was not accessible to student, didn't have regular office hours, and I felt he imposed a very one-sided view to the class. Discussion of the assigned readings was rare.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He is great! He's so passionate about the material which makes for a really interesting lecture. I'm not a policy person, but I loved the class. Michael made it so interesting and relevant and he's very real about it.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He was an expert in the field and I enjoyed his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr Gusmano is a great lecturer and he does a good job of keeping the class entertained.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano is a fantastic lecturer, although he can sometimes drown himself out. 2-2.5 hrs of non-stop policy lecture can be overwhelming. Great speaking style and sense of humor though",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Passionate instructor, although sometimes that passion made him be really explicit about his political beliefs and ideology. He read every assignment, something that is admirable given the large number of students. He provided feedback in all of our papers, which I appreciated. He clarified all of our questions in a very straightforward manner and he was an encouraging instructor.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is one of the most impressive lecturers I have listened to. His ability to get up in front of the class and lecture in a structured and relaxed manner is uncanny.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Prof. Gusmano is an extremely knowledgeable instructor that can provide a great lecture from memory. My favorite lecture was the last one he delivered regarding the ACA. I feel material like this is what made me want to pursue an MPH.However, most of the time the wealth and quality of material was lost because of the lack of a clear road-map of organization for the students to follow.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Excellent professor. We need more people like him at the school of public health.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0There also was somewhat of a disconnect between the slides and what Dr. Gusmano would lecture about. There was a circular logic and at times it would take a moment for everything to come together. In the meantime - I personally - would get lost\/confused about one part and it would take while for me to catch up. I know most of that was ignorance on my part.I felt like Dr. Gusmano was a wealth of information, but at times I would get lost in his rants and couldn't use the slides to get back in focus. Though, his rants were usually on point.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very funny, engaging and enthusiastic a great person to teach Policy",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano knows EVERYTHING there is to know about the American Health Care system and all related policy, but his high level of understanding makes it difficult for him to break it down to a very basic introductory level. I highly enjoyed his lectures and found his teaching style to be very engaging.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Great instructor. Very knowledgeable on subject matter.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I found Dr. Gusmano very helpful and approachable, and extremely knowledgeable. I very much enjoyed his lectures and paper feedback.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0excellant teacher",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I was a big fan of Michael. As mentioned in the previous answer, he is the best lecturer I've had in any course in 10+ years of post-high school education (undergrad, med school, public health). He is engaging, highly intelligent, funny and sarcastic. There are many professors who are painful to listen to for 2+ hours, but I actually looked forward to Michael's lectures.I do wonder if I would have followed the lectures as well without prior knowledge of how the US health care system worked; I already knew the mechanics of Medicare and Medicaid from my medical training, and therefore the historical\/political context and international comparisons were what I found the most interesting. I also would have liked to learn more details about Obamacare and hear Michael's commentary on it, although I understand why we spent one lecture on this topic.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is very informative and a very good lecturer. He's a very engaging speaker and I enjoyed going to his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is great!! Very knowledgeable and effective instructor",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Gusmano has a lot of information to share. The format of the class makes it difficult however. Work for class was well distributed. Unfortunately because the class was so large, I feel like I mainly learned Gusmano's opinions about certain policies rather than ways for formulate my own or break down existing policies.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Good lecturer. Very engaging",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0The instructor was engaging, but often got off-topic during lectures.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He started the class on time, except that time he showed 10 mins late with out warning. His in class discussion were often different from the material required in the papers and readings.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0One of the best lecturers I have ever had the pleasure to listen to on a weekly basis. He was extremely knowledgeable and very easy to listen to even for multiple hours. The lack of lecture materials or a structured lecture limited the amount of information I could take away from the class, but it was still very enjoyable.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano was always an interesting lecturer. His lectures were always vivid and impassioned and well-informed.That said, he did go off on a number of tangents, especially when students asked him questions, which made for long responses that, while through, were more often confusing, and made it hard for more students to participate and ask follow-ups.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He was all over the place and hard to follow. He knows a lot and seems really interesting, but really hard to follow his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is a good teacher. He is also funny and made his lectures very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0passionate, humorous and clear.A good speaker to carry out complicated concept in a easy and logical way.It will be great if the the last slide of the class would be a take home message slide with important summary of that class. i.e. things need to be rememberedAnd it will be great if the well written paper from students can be demonstrated under their permission. This could help us better understand the assignment by looking at other's work and compare them with our own's.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is very knowledgeable in health politics and offered great insights throughout the course.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I liked him. He was extremely responsive and very knowledgeable. Class format didn't do him any favors, though.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Very good. Very open to feedback and willing to help",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is clearly very knowledgeable about this area and conveyed a passion (mixed positive and negative\/sarcastic?) for the field. Dr. Gusmano is also quite entertaining& humorous, which made the class more enjoyable. Although there was an overall organization to the lectures, it was not always clear during each lecture what the main point was - however, the material was complex and interconnected and going over topics a number of times was helpful in many ways. It took a very long time for Dr. Guzman to grade papers and get them back to us - I think he made a lot of work for himself by requiring 3 substantial essays and a final in such a big class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Good lectures, critical discussions, responsive to student input.Some lectures however were filled with references which were unfamiliar to non-US students, which made it difficult to understand the issue being addressed.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He could be entertaining but also a bit offensive. There were seldom lecture slides and it made it hard to follow.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano was a good professor and was quick to respond to questions and give feedback via email. However, I felt that his lectures deviated heavily off topic and had a political tone that was biased.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano is very knowledgable and has done a great job of selecting readings that provide a broad overview of the current state of health policy in the US, while focusing on futures issues that we will need to address as health policy makers. Professor Gusmano is very approachable, and does a great job of keeping the class engaged. Even though this was a lecture course, I found myself forgetting that we were in a large group setting because Professor Gusmano took questions throughout, and actively engaged his students in discussion. He also had a great sense of humor, and every now and then would insert some humor into the lectures. While we covered a lot of material, the material was presented in logical segments so that we were able to seamlessly transition from topic to topic. Also, Professor Gusmano made it a point to read every paper that was submitted and provided personalized feedback for the students. I found this very helpful, and appreciated the thought and effort put into critiquing my work. Overall, it is clear that a lot of thought and dedication went into making the course what it is.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano was a fantastic instructor for this course. He knows so much about health policy and did his best to share as much of this knowledge as possible with us during the lectures. Although the lectures were long, he presented the material in a very engaging way, detailing the history, technical aspects, and some of his own research regarding the course topics. The selected readings were also very useful and eye-opening on some of the topics. I also thought it was great that he took the time to personally read and respond to each of our first papers. That shows dedication and commitment to the students.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. He got me genuinely interested in learning about health policy. The assignments he assigned were mostly opinion based, so it was much more than just regurgitating information.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0brilliant instructor"

    "A pretty good introduction to health policy--but be aware that most of the learning is done outside of the classroom. Reseraching for my papers was a very good educational experience, but I did not find lecture to be very informative.",
    "This is a challenging, but extremely valuable course on health policy. It covers the US healthcare system's most important public insurance programs, it touches on current issues in health policy like the ACA and pay-for-performance, and also refers to other health systems around the world. I would absolutely recommend this course to other students.",
    "It is a fun class if you are interested in policy.",
    "It is a good overview of health policy in the US, and you have to take this one or one thatis very similar.",
    "Yes I would recommend it if it was taught in a smaller class.",
    "Disappointing",
    "Very useful and \"down-to-earth\" insight into the U.S. health care system.",
    "The course was about health policy, both the making of policy and the history of U.S policy.",
    "Health policy 510 was a lecture course with a non-demanding work load. It was interesting but hard to follow without a basic understanding of health policy. I definitely learned some about the state of our health care system in the U.S. but not as much as I had expected. I would recommend it because it is a core course and because I think any understanding of health policy is important to all public health professionals.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was interesting and I felt I learned a lot about health systems- something I knew nothing about before and felt a great deal of confusion before I started the course. Dr. Gusmano also made the material enjoyable and interesting.",
    "This course is a good introduction into American healthcare policy, its history and current development, and the issues that it focuses on. It definitely allows students to become more aware of the intricacies of current policy.",
    "This is a course you will easily get lost. If you are looking for a fundamental understanding of how the health care system works in the United States, this might not be the best place to start with.",
    "Take this class if you already have a background in policy",
    "An overview of health policy.",
    "A waste of 3 hours....take a different class if you can.",
    "It is a very relax course. Work load is not heavy at all. Going to class is like attending a talk show, just sit back and relax, maybe think a little too, and then write few papers on the topics covered in the show.",
    "Yes, because I learned so much about the US health care system. I can now speak to someone intelligently about it and I appreciate that!",
    "An interesting look into health care policy and in the United States (and a little bit globally, too). Interesting essay assignments on topics very relevant to current issues in American politics and current events. Yes, I would recommend it to other students.",
    "I think this course was incredibly useful. If the lectures were a little more structured I think I would have learned more. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "This is not good for someone who has no policy background such as myself.",
    "Not the best course for teaching the basics of health policy. Requires a lot of outside work or motivation to learn to come away feeling as though you learned enough.",
    "Good intro to health policy",
    "This course is a requirement. Has the potential to be an amazing course, but due to its structure it is awful. Please see my overview comments.",
    "Great course, come prepared to listen and distill the information your self. Recording key part of the lecture may be better than notes. and do the reading he assign because they tie the discussion and papers together.",
    "I think this course is a good introduction to health policy, and I would recommend it.",
    "The papers really help to learn policy structure and help provide different perspectives on heatlhcare.",

    "It was a good course for students to get exposed to health policy for the first time.",
    "This is a good course and I would recommend it to another student.",

    "Nice overview of main issues in health policy. The assignments were useful to our learning process. I would recommend that students read the whole Stone book, it is amazing!!",

    "Great foundational course on the American health care system.",
    "Very good to have a baseline understanding of the health care policies happening right now",
    "Yes, would highly recommend.",
    "Great introduction to health policy. Definitely recommended.",
    "Great course. If you can take it from Michael Gusmano, I highly recommend it. Unfortunately, I believe he told our class that he will not be lecturing at Yale next year. He leaves big shoes to fill.",
    "It's an interesting course that provides you with a good base on the history of healthcare in the US.",
    "Course deals with policy related matters in health care - you learn the intricacies of medicare, the new health care bill, medicaid, and other important health care related policies. There are three essays and a final.The professor is a fair grader, and everyone does well.",
    "I think I would recommend this course to someone who already has a base knowledge of policy. Some found it hard to keep up that were never exposed to policy before. Overall the course was good. I think it'd be a much more meaningful course if it were smaller or had a discussion component.",
    "No, I would not recommend it because most of the material was on Medicare. Dedicating theintroduction to Health Policy class to that topic, for the most part, is not fair to student's time and effort.",
    "This is a great course taught by a great professor who knows just about everything that has to do with health policy. He kept the topicsrelevant to health policy today, and the three papers for the class are great to write.",
    "This course provides a well-informed overview of a number of interconnected policy and systems issues. It doesn't always present the clearest thesis, which would be okay if it offered more opportunities for students to discuss the issues and formulate opinions. The workload is extremely light.",
    "Take it for a course requirement.",
    "I highly recommend this course",
    "Great course to cover the basic concept of the health care system and policyin the USA.YEs",
    "Consider the course.The evaluation is based onparticipation3 term papers (5 pages max, double-spaced)a take home final which consists of defining 4 terms and doing one essay.You learn alot of interesting things and get to learn from someone who has so much experience and is able to consolidate that information for a introductory class.After this course you are likely to re-evaluate who the way you view health care, politics and your own assumptions.",
    "I would recommend it to students interested to know more about the health care system in the U.S.",
    "Not a bad course. Important information covered.",
    "I would recommend this course to students that have an interest in the American health system, it provides a great overview of how the system works.",
    "I would recommend it. I learned much regarding the state of health care locally and globally.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It was interesting and I learned a lot. The articles were good and of a high calibre. The lectures, while not always clearly organized, were interesting and entertaining. I learned a lot writing the Medicare paper. The topic for the first paper was not very clear and I didn't get much out of that one.",
    "Interesting course, but challenging for non-US students because of the assumption of being familiar with US systems, persons and historical events.",
    "I had little interest in policy prior to this class and even less now. I wouldn't recommend it per say but I'm glad I got the requirement out of the way.",
    "Yes, I recommend you take this class. It covers interesting material and Professor Gusmano does a great job of presenting the material and engaging the students. You will enjoy the class, and will enjoy the lectures. You'll find yourself thinking about practical ways of solving real problems, and will have fun doing it as the Professor has a great instinct for presenting the material in a way that is accessible without diluting the material. It is a great plus that the Professor has a great sense of humor which shines through in the lectures. You'll enjoy the class because of the material, the freedom for creativity that the assignments provide, as well as the superb instruction.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students looking to gain a basic understanding of the some of the major health policy topics in the US. Attending the weekly lecture and having to write three papers and the final exam really helped me gain a solid understanding of some major health policy topics, and now I will feel much more confident discussing some of these issues with other public health professionals. This class has made me contemplate taking further policy courses.",
    "I recommend this course taught by Dr. Gusmano.",
