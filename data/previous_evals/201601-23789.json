    "The class was a work in progress. Things kept changing, and it might have been helpful to have a better idea of where we were going at the start of the semester (a more flushed-out syllabus, that didn't change so frequently). Also, it seemed like we were trying to tie science and policy together, but the course was not very successful at doing that. I think we would have needed to read more policy documents, especially since most students did not have experience in policy. We often discussed policy implications of the science we read, but without a background in policy, the discussions were uninformed and not very useful. Maybe bring in a guest speaker who works for Pennsylvania's DEP and could explain fracking regulations, challenges to regulation, etc? Something along those lines (for each unit) would be incredibly valuable.",
    "I think the timing of student presentations may need to be adjusted. Sometimes we wouldn't get through all the papers, or would not have enough time for discussion on a particular topic. Discussion could be improved by moving away from granular details and focusing more on big-picture ideas.",
    "no changes needed",
    "At times, it felt as though discussions tracked in circles because no one was really an expert on the topic. Questions would be raised without someone able to answer them.",
    "I know this was the first time this class was offered but it would have been helpful to be able to sign up for our presentation dates and topics in advance. People didn't really have much say in what they presented on or when, which made it difficult to plan\/coordinate assignments for other courses.",
    "Sometimes the three hours felt like a long time - when it was hard to get people to talk.",
    "More clarity around the format of presentations and best way to focus executive summaries would be helpful",
    "A little more structure about the lecture needs. Some students didn't have the same material knowledge, which sometimes dragged discussions down a level. Requiring WRM (Shimi) as a pre-req would be good.",
    "The course too US-focused. The course focuses mainly on US problems\/challenges and at some extent, China. I would have preferred to learn more about the energy and water nexus in other parts of the world as well and be able to identify the challenges that developing countries face and understand the differences of these challenges to what US has to deal with. The course is graded according to individual participation in class what may favor domestic students since the course is mainly focused on US issues.",

Spend a good amount of time digging into the readings, and you'll get a lot out of the class in terms of scientific knowledge.
