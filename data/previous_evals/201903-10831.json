    "I became more disciplined in my economic concepts and learned much more about the mathematical side of microeconomics.",
    "All the basics of microeconomics.",
    "I learned the basics of microeconomics - pretty straightforward and standard curriculum.",

   "comments": [
    "The course provided a thorough introduction to microeconomics. I learned a lot. However, the course and problem sets operated at an entirely different level than any of the assessments we took.",
    "I think the biggest weakness was the lack of real world examples. It often felt as if I were taking a math course. This seems a problem to me, considering that for many people this will probably be the only economics course they take. I had to read the textbook to make economics fun. To be sure I learned a lot from the course, and it was challenging. But the learning was not always thrilling. I also want to point out that in the first lecture, the professor said that the highest level of math needed for the course was simultaneous equations. This was not really true. You needed to be able to take derivatives. At least in Britain, derivatives are taught in the second year of high school, whereas simultaneous equations are taught in the first few years of middle school. Although you did not need derivatives in the exams, you definitely did need them to solve the problem sets, and they were used in the slides. It would have been helpful for the Professor either to have gone over them briefly, or just to be clear that they were necessary, so that I could have gone off and refreshed my memory (not having done math at school for the past two years).",
    "I learnt a lot about the basics of microeconomics, but felt that the course in general was too fast-paced to allow a proper grasp of concepts",
    "I think the course is centered around good and important content, but I think its weakness is the lack of organization in the course. I didn't feel like I had concrete things to study from besides the slides created by my teacher, which I thought were unclear, since the course does not line up that well with the textbook, especially in the second half. More practice problems and practice tests could be made available for extra practice.",
    "The course itself could have taught the math better so that the mathematical concepts matched the Economic concepts better.",
    "More practice questions and a revision guide would be great.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Saez attempts to make the class interesting by using examples that connect concepts to the real world. Weaknesses: Lectures are incoherent and difficult to understand due to the disorganization of information and lack of depth in-class which leads to confusion during problem sets and exams. Questions on Problem Sets, Midterm, and Finals usually are not readily solvable through simply what is explained in class and Professor does not attempt to clarify how to do problems during office hours. I ended up having to use outside resources like other Yale econ students\/tutors in order to understand how to do problems.",
    "Not enough emphasis was placed on student use of the textbook. Slides were not extremely helpful.",
    "The way in which the course was taught didn't improve learning"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it was very interesting.",
    "I would recommend taking this course just because of the fact that it's an intro Econ course that I think provides you with basic information that you need to in order to take more advanced ones. For someone who does not want to take more econ, though, I would not recommend the course because I don't think the content is particularly interesting outside of its immediate application and I don't think it's organized or taught exceptionally well.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, as the instruction did not suit the student's needs.",
    "Yes, it's a great course.",
    "Yes. Economics is an essential subject and the information learned is very useful. The office hours are helpful and the course is very engaging and intellectually challenging.",
    "Not at all there are no benefits"
