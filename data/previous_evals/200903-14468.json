   "comments": [
    "A great class to explore some parts of music history off the beaten track, with very nice opportunities for original research; but a very heavy workload and with paper topics pretty tightly circumscribed.",
    "Anyone looking to take this course should be warned that it is very time-consuming. The research projects both require significant flexibility in one's schedule, because appointments will have to be scheduled with curatorsof various library collections. The amount of weekly reading is also significant, as is the weekly listening, which would usually take several hours on its own.",
    "This course is an exploration of three different genres in American music of the 20th century and the critical, methodological, and aesthetic issues related to these genres.I would recommend this course; in addition to compelling teaching and material, it provides a useful mix of necessary tools for musicology: source study and archival research; lots of listening and film viewing; different critical approaches; and a mock conference presentation.",
    "An excellent introduction to many of the issues afoot in three strands of American music. The archival work is helpful and a good opportunity to get one's feet wet in that regard.Some of the assumed cultural knowledge can be rather foreign to non-American students, but this is a great opportunity to become more familiar with concepts and examples from the local area (in the case of Ives and Porter, very local!)"

   "comments": [
    "Gave me familiarity with repertoire I had not previously had much experience with, and also gave me some good case studies for various methodological approaches and issues and experience in working with manuscript materials.",
    "The course provided opportunities to work with primary documents from the Charles Ives Papers and the Cole Porter Collection, a rare scholarly opportunity, and one not to be missed. The emphasis on hermeneutic analysis was particularly valuable and always made for lively discussions in class.",
    "Introduction to archival work was very helpful. Introduction to some trends in sociological\/musicological\/cultural studies work as they pertain to music was very interesting. Discussion of the role of musicologists within these interdisciplinary fields of enquiry was thought-provoking. The 'Cole Porter symposium' was an excellent way to combine an end-of-term assignment with valuable conference-style presentation experience."
