    "The course is necessary if the student is interested in or is on scholarship with Yale Naval ROTC, and enables the midshipmen a separate course to learn about naval news, policy, and naval culture, and has low-to-zero amounts of outside work. The only real weaknesses to the Naval lab is the time schedule. At 1230-230, the class occupies prime scheduling space that could be used for language or STEM classes. In addition, some of the presentations, from cyberwarfare to sexual harassment prevention, while necessary, are quite dry, and more effort should be given towards breaking these up into smaller groups, for both discussion, and to enable the midshipmen to interact more with the officers.",
