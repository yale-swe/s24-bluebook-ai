   "comments": [
    "Very very good class. Sigga is awesome",
    "Definitely take this class with Sigga, she is great and always eager to answer questions!",
    "I would recommend it to a student who doesn't mind a fast-paced class and wants a room full of classmates who have generally already had a background with economic experience in the classroom. What separates it from the lecture is that there is a lot of room for discussion and asking questions. The problem sets are hard and the class is actually both very technical and theoretical.",
    "smaller class",
    "Its a great class, especially if you plan on majoring in Econ. Ignore the haters who say that Sigga is a bad teacher, its just not true, what you should take into account however is that this class is more math and more difficult than the Intro to Micro lecture. You learn more, but the trade off is more work. I would especially recommend it to people who have plans to major in econ or something of the sort.",
    "I took the Micro seminar in the fall and hated it (poorly taught, annoying problem sets, etc). I was going to take the lecture in the Spring but I took this instead because the lecture conflicted with Psych. Sigga is an amazing and really nice person, but I don't think she is very suited to teach intro macroeconomics. Her slides were just summaries of the book to the point that it wasn't even useful to go to class. That said, the book is very good. If you are deciding between the seminar and the lecture, I have no advice because I never took the lecture. But this was better than the micro seminar. Also I have not gotten my final grade back yet sooo who knows.",
    "This is a great class. It is much more interesting than Microecon, and though it can be confusing sometimes, it is very comprehensive and clear. Sigga got bad reviews when this was last offered last spring, because she was traveling back and forth to Iceland which took a toll on her teaching, but she definitely doesn't deserve the reviews she got. She's very friendly and approachable and while she is sometimes unclear, usually asking further questions for clarification does the trick.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are looking to continue on with economics at Yale! I received a strong background that will help me with future economics classes at Yale. The small teaching environment really helped understanding difficult concepts. I really really liked Sigga as an instructor! She was always very dedicated to make us understand the material. Sometimes she would even come into the classroom, say that she was not happy with how she had explained something last time, and explained it again just to make sure we understood. She was always extremely helpful at her office hours and the open office hours before psets were due were a lifesaver.",
    "Yeah, I'd recommend it. But liberal artists beware: be prepared to do a mind-boggling amount of algebra at a couple points.",
    "YES! You learn so much about the financial crisis and get a greater picture of how the world and governments function.",
    "Take this class over the lecture. Take it with Sigga. Pay attention during the year and keep up with the work. Otherwise things won't make sense and it will be a frustrating experience until everything clicks right before the final.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS WITH SIGGA. She makes the material entertaining in class and is always there if you need help - I had to reschedule the midterm, and she was very understanding and accommodating. The problem sets are harder than Micro, and I found that I got more out of class when I actually did the reading beforehand (I never even opened the Micro book). Although the class is definitely harder than the lecture, Sigga makes it worth the trouble - she's great!!",
    "This is a good class, and Sigga is a good teacher. A far, far better option than the lecture. I felt like I learned a lot, though would have learned more had I payed better attention in class.",
    "If what you are looking for is a chance to ask questions and engage in class discussions this is definitely a better option than the large lecture. I would recommend it but reading the book is definitely a must.",
    "i would recommend because it is a fun class but very difficult",
    "A must have course.",
    "It's a basic overview of the major areas that drive the study of the economy at large and how they affect people in a smaller classroom setting.Take it. The professor's great and the subject matter is very relevant and exciting.",
    "Absolutely. People need to know this stuff, and sigga teaches the material well. The seminar is 400x better than the lecture, and everyone knows it. The small setting forces you to actually learn stuff.",
    "If you have taken econ before, and you and very interested in econ or want to be an econ major you may really enjoy the seminar. Everything int he semeinar is explained at a more advanced level. But if you are like me and you just wanted a basic understanding of macro, you have never taken macro before, and you are not at all interested in majoring in econ don't take this class."
