   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Fantastic exposure to many biological concepts and types of organisms.",
    "Take it if you have your heart set on research do not take it if you do not want to sit in a lab for 5 hours looking through a microscope.",
    "Chances are you're taking it because you have to. Just try to take it when you have a light course load, and DONT TAKE IT AS A FRESHMAN. You will dislike ALL labs forever.",
    "An incredible first lab experience that parallels the BIOL 101 and 102 modules quite well. With a lab report nearly every week, the workload is quite heavy but the lab is so worth it\u00e2\u0080\u0094you get to actually perform all the cool experiments you learn about in biology with amazing equipment and even an iPad for the semester (thanks to grants secured by Dr. Moreno).",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you want a survey course on conducting experiments and on various research methods - you get to use really cool equipment and do a lot of experiments you hear about in bio classes. It's a good amount of work though (the labs take forever, don't listen to the TAs\/profs who say they should take 2 hours. HAHA I wish).",
    "This lab can be very tedious at times - lab reports can be long, and you may find yourself staying up all night to finish them. That being said, I feel that this is a very TA-based experience, and your experience may vary in class, but while I had a great TA, the reports were sometimes very troublesome.",
    "intro bio lab that introduces you to bio lab techniques that no other lab would teach you. if you want to start research, you should do this before so you can see what you enjoy before entering a certain field",
    "Take it if you want basic lab experience with professors\/TAs who really know what they're doing! If you're interested in doing research at all, I would highly recommend this course. Lab reports are almost weekly though, be warned.",
    "An pleasant intro biology lab that gives a nice overview.",
    "Solid introduction to bio lab stuff, but hard. Lots of work. Good course, Maria is dedicated and puts so much effort into the class. Truly depends on the TA you get--some were good (I hear), whereas others were very sub-par.",
    "don't take it if you can help it or if you simply don't care enough about basic research, too much annoying work, not particularly challenging tho",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. A lot of work, long class, and the experiments are generally not all that interesting. Wrote 7 lab reports over the course of the semester (so there's not one due every week).",
    "Don't take it unless you can't get into any other bio lab. I liked the idea of this course, which was to use different types of models to help us learn how to craft a experimental question and experiment to address that question. It also helped me learn how to interpret quantitative results in a qualitative way. My lab report writing skills also greatly improved. However, this was much too much work for a half-credit class. There were too many experiments fit into one lab session, and the lab reports took on average 10 hours to write. Also, many of the experiments seemed a little pointless and redundant (i.e. finding an example of each stage of development and taking pictures of it under a microscope--took hours to do something we already had pictures of). Overall, good concept, faulty execution.",
    "This was the first year the class was being taught so the kinks were still getting worked out but overall it was a decent bio lab. The labs were sometimes tedious for the first half and then the second half focuses on designing your own experiment so the class often ran over the allotted four hours which was frustrating if you had commitments after class. I would take it if you're looking for an introduction to doing work in a lab.",
    "Great course! As a lab know that it is a huge time commitment.",
    "I would not recommend this lab to another student unless absolutely necessary, Prof. Moreno is great, the TFs are great, however, Prof. Moreno writes the lab procedures so that much of the time is used on meaningless assays rather than the actual experiment in question thus causing many of the experiments to finish late, usually around an hour late. Also the would be full lab reports due for almost every lab which made the courseload very heavy, definitely not justified by a half credit.",
    "It's good class if you want to learn more about bio research, but it was way too much work for a 0.5 credit class.",
    "Challenging course at first, but after the 3rd lab you start to settle in and become comfortable with the methods. Really fascinating experiments to look forward to, and very dynamic and engaging.",
    "It was a good class, but it requires a lot of work and the lab sessions usually run over the allotted time. I recommend it as it really gets you to learn to design your own experiments and write good lab reports, but a lot of work goes into this.",
    "it is very useful to master major bio lab techniques such as transformation and PCR but the work is very time consuming. be prepared to spend 10+ hours on your lab report each week to get a good grade. i would recommend it for the in class experience but not for the extreme workload outside of the lab. if this could somehow be lessened i would wholeheartedly recommend this lab as an introduction to bio lab techniques.",
    "Lots of work. Long lab reports. Be expected for long labs that last 30min-1hour past 5:30pm.",
    "BORING! But it's a pre-req so whatever.",
    "The labs themselves were fine, but the first few would be helpful to those with no lab experience. The lab allows for a lot of group work on with different model organisms which provides an opportunity to diversify basic experience. The workload for this course, however, far exceeds the amount of work for a half credit class. To cut to the chase, lab reports are very tedious and while simple, will become a large dent in your week if you take the course.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student with the stipulation that that student be willing to put an inordinate amount of work into this course -- more work than for a full credit class to be clear. The lab reports in the class took up whole weekends sometimes and that was while working effectively. 15 page lab reports were cranked out on a consistent basis and they really don't write themselves. I had already taken biochemistry lab so a lot of what I was covering was review, but if you haven't learned the material, it is really quite good to know. I would imagine, however that it might be overwhelming be presented with all that material week after week. A freshman in our course, though he was smart, was always asking questions and constantly having to put more effort into his work.",
    "More time-consuming than one might expect for a introductory biology lab - the TAs expect a lot from your lab reports, and will grade them harshly. But you do legitimately learn a lot about answering research questions, which is interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend MCDB 221 if you want to learn a lot about science writing and are willing to put in the work. It will take up TONS of time, but pays off and it feels good to walk away having learned a lot.",
    "MCDB 221 is a good biology lab that deals with a lot of topics including enzymes, genetics and gene regulation, and embryonic development. The labs are interesting and engaging, but the lab reports take a very long time to write up. I would recommend this lab to a student who is looking learn more about topics in biology in a lab setting.",
    "Definitely take it, especially if you're taking the Intro. Bio modules in conjunction. The ideas presented in lab complement the concepts covered in class and overall, help you appreciate the scientific model.",
    "I would recommend this lab overall. The experiments are interesting (especially toward the second half of the semester), and if you plan to do research in a real bio lab, you'll be well prepared. However, this isn't the lab to take if you haven't had much prior lab experience. in addition, reports are quite strenuous, so I wouldn't recommend taking it along with other courses with heavy workloads.",
    "Don't take this unless you need to. This was by far my most time-consuming class of the semester--and it was only one-half of a credit. The labs routinely go over 4 hours and they are extremely tedious. The lab reports are even worse, as there is a full lab report due each week. The professor and TAs mean well and this course could be good, but as it is currently designed it has far too much work to be considered a good option for a bio lab. It will take over your life.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this course. Every week you experiment with a different lab technique and the labs are usually pretty interesting, or have interesting links to modern issues, which you learn more about as you write your weekly reports. That said, this course will take up a lot of time. Some of the earlier labs were pretty long and sometimes went over by half an hour. The lengthy weekly lab reports can also take a long time to write. None of the work is difficult, just time consuming."
