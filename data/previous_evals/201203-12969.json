   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who has at least three years' of Russian (less seems like it would be a real struggle -- with only three years, my abilities were tested) and is serious about learning to read real Russian prose quickly and efficiently. Moreover, this is a must-take for anyone interested in the ever-popular revolution of 1917 (provided he have the prerequisite language skills). I thought I basically understood what happened, but things go well beyond the tsar, Rasputin, Kerensky, and Lenin (though all of those figures are discussed).",
    "This course, though I'm not sure when it will be offered again, is a great way to improve your Russian reading and speaking abilities. Highly recommended.",
    "I never thought I'd take a \"history\" themed course at Yale, but I really enjoyed this class. Be prepared to do a lot of reading - at the beginning of the semester, it takes a lot of time but if you stick with it you'll be able to read in Russian much more quickly at the end. It's also a very important topic. Discussions are fun, grading is not super hard, and the oral exams are really actually useful and not terribly stressful.",
    "This is a fascinating course about the course of major political events in Russia in 1917, February through October. You read a lot in Russian and you get to read first-hand accounts! I would definitely recommend this course for students interested in the February and October revolutions or even subsequent Soviet history as this gives you a deeper understanding of the historical background. Plus, you get to take this with Constantine!",
    "Definitely recommend--will definitely improve your Russian and is interesting to boot.",
    "Marvelous. Reading-intensive, so keep up, but incredibly informative, and Constantine is wonderful.",
    "The Language of the Russian Revolution is for students who are interested in Russian history in general, as well as studies in socialism, post-communism, etc., specifically because it concentrates on the transition era to one of mankind's greatest social experiments. In fact, this transition era reflects some main deficiencies of the new to-be-installed regime. Students who have studied USSR or contemporary Russia will definitely find this course very interesting.Other than that, even you are not interested in Russia or Russian history, but only trying to learn Russian as a foreign language, the course is conducted in Russian, and you get to read texts from political figures of 1917. This means that you are introduced to certain vocabulary that you may not easily find in novels.Of course, you must have obtained at least intermediate\/advanced level of Russian already, to follow the course and read the texts. (even then you will frequently use a dictionary. Which is good, it means that you are learning.)"
