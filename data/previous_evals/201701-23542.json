    "This course allowed me to really delve into a client-based project.",
    "Exposure to working with clients",
    "The clients you work with are top notch - all brand names that have very interesting projects under your belt. This is the type of class that you relationship with your client breaks or makes.",
    "The guest lecturers were the best aspect of this course. And the incredible organization by the professors and TAs. I always knew what was needed of me and the deadlines and deliverables. It was very well-organized. The funding was also very helpful for my project and allowed my group to travel to Chile for two weeks fully funded. When our group reached out for meetings when we began to encounter difficulties with our client, the professor and supervisors were quick to respond and meet with us as soon as possible (regardless of what kind of response we got in those meetings, they were mostly available to us to meet and discuss).",
    "The success of this class is predicated on your topic, your client and your group. Fortunately, I lucked out with all three and I learned more about electricity markets than I would have in a class on utilities, because I had the chance to work with leading experts, explore the subject through the view point of a specific topic, and conduct a large amount of research.",
    "You gain an enormous amount of firsthand experience working with real environmental issues with real world clients. The class was very well organized thanks to the dedicated efforts of all TA's and the professor. They were also always available to help iron out client issues and provide support when needed.",
    "I really enjoyed working with our client and our subject matter. The course itself offered some insights into that process, but I got the most out of the group work and research into our project itself.",
    "The opportunity to gain client experience, engage deeply with a current environmental issue, and collaborate extensively with students from different backgrounds."

    "I actually would have liked a little more readings and content for students who aren't law students, because when faced with doing some of the legal research I was pretty lost in the legalese and didn't know what I was looking at. Luckily this doesn't seem to have been a problem, but I was hoping to learn a little more about environmental law than I did. Of course the class is already a fair amount of work, so a lot of additional work probably isn't a good idea.",
    "The designated supervisors for EPC need to be advocates for students. I had a bad experience with a supervisor who often side with the client. Eventually said person realized by the end of the semester that the client overstepped. Scoping NEEDS to be clear in the beginning, but also there needs to be an understanding that scopes evolve. This is the nature of consulting and the nature of the students' abilities to devote time when appropriate. I HIGHLY recommend following the format of Maureen Burke's Business and the Environment Clinic. That clinic is so well done and EPC pales in comparison in terms of student wellbeing and happiness.",
    "The projects are hit-or-miss. I found our project valuable, but not for the amount of time and effort spent. I also think that the weekly courses needed improvement. The course is great if you want to be familiar with NRDC, but lacked a diversity of perspectives. Some of the lectures (Professor Galperin's) were great, but some of the lectures I thought were really lacking. I also feel like I was a bit pressured into taking the course with the application process. I don't think that it is fair to make students commit prior to knowing if they have been accepted to work with a particular client. I understand however why this process is in place.",
    "some of the class lectures were not particularly helpful",
    "The guest lectures are not very useful. There is just so many times one can listen to someone from NRDC before it becomes repetitive",
    "I thought this class was perfect the way it is - perhaps less recording hours.",
    "1) More support from supervisors. Lisa Suatoni was our supervisor for our group and we had several issues with our client and although she was responsive when we reached out to her, she was not involved enough in our project from the beginning to be able to really help us through the difficult times we were having nor conceptualize how difficult communication with our client had truly been from the beginning. She offered advice and lessons when we reached out and when she was copied on emails from our client that were complex, but her advice rarely, if ever, acknowledged the extent of the difficulty that our group was dealing with. Often, it felt as if she was writing off our problems and acting as if everything could be a learning experience, when at times, it was too negative and confusing to really be a learning experience. She did not take the necessary time to really understand where we were in our project and our process and it showed in how she responded to us, both through email and in person. 2) Only one supervisor, instead of a main one and a supporting one. We had Jorge de Vicente as our supporting supervisor and this did not work out for our group. Jorge did not support our group as a supervisor should. He was at times unresponsive. He was also unprofessional at times with how he responded to our group and our concerns with our client. He had a close relationship to the client and often contacted him directly and did not share what he would discuss with the client. This created a difficult situation for our group and put us in a strange situation with our client, causing us to look disorganized and unprofessional. Jorge also was hard to deal with on our Chile trip. He was not helpful with logistics, never offered to help with anything, including communication with the client, and mostly was on his own throughout the trip, or talking directly with the client, leaving our group out. His interventions at meetings with stakeholders were aggressive and left stakeholders often feeling uncomfortable. We, the group, had to step in multiple times to smooth over the situation. When we asked for his help with client communications, he sided with the client and did not offer to help us, rather would explain at length why we, the group, were in the wrong and why the client was right. He often made us uncomfortable in meetings because of his aggressive attitude and demeanor. This also proved difficult because it allowed Lisa Suatoni, our main supervisor, to take a less involved roll because she thought that Jorge was supporting us as he was supposed to. 3) Explanation from the beginning about what to expect with an small international client\/NGO. Lisa Suatoni explained to us at the end of the semester that international clients, especially small NGOs, like our client, were very difficult to work with. Yet, nobody shared this information with our group prior to working with our client. We were not warned and the semester turned out to be a very difficult one and had anyone explained this previously, we may have been able to approach the project differently and had more success. 4) Acknowledgement from the beginning of the semester that although the client is ALMOST always right, it is possible that the client may be wrong at times. EPC began with a presentation that taught us to always defer to the client and what the client needed, because as \"consultants\" that is how things work. Thus, when our group had serious difficulties with our client, we deferred to the client and did not push back nor discuss boundaries. This led to a very uncomfortable relationship with the client in which he took advantage of our time and treated us disrespectfully and did not acknowledge the work we were doing for him in any way. Had we felt from the beginning that we could push back against unrealistic expectations or to a client who often crossed boundaries, we could've avoided some serious problems and maybe arrived at a different end.",
    "The class readings. I also did not find the classes in which we discussed our research projects to be helpful.",
    "The half-supervisor role needs to be eliminated. Our team had two supervisors, Lisa, who was our official supervisor, and Jorge, who was our half-supervisor. Lisa's role was clearly defined, so we understood exactly when we needed to reach out to her for support or advice. However, Jorge's role was not clearly defined. It seemed like his role was described with a lot of descriptive language; however, this might have contributed to the lack of clarity of how he would be supporting us this semester. We assumed to take Jorge on as almost a sixth member of our team, which was fulfilled when he initially helped bridge the gap between us and the client and organized our research resources. However, towards the middle and end of the semester, he was failing to support our team with both of these efforts. We were further confused about what his role was during this time, which contributed to a significant amount of confusion when problems arose between our team and the client. I think much of the confusion between the team and client would have been reduced if we had been working with the client directly from the beginning and only under the supervision of our main supervisor Lisa. Additionally, more background research into the client should be done to ensure future teams do not have to deal with the level of unprofessionalism and inappropriate communication that our team experienced between the client and the team. Although I believe in supporting smaller NGO's, I think EPC should make a more significant effort to seriously manage client expectations from the moment they consider taking on a project. Our client's expectations were impossible and counter to what EPC can reasonably deliver. Managing expectations when the expectations are already so high is stressful and can lead to a number of problems that our team experienced. Lastly, the contract that clients must sign should be more detailed to include realistic expectations for the students and that the learning aspect of the course be emphasized to a greater degree to the client. For many students, this is a first-time experience working with a client so reiterating this to the client can hopefully help manage expectations.",
    "The lectures could be improved to build better cohesiveness and continuity to give students more direct direction on their projects. Not sure exactly how to do this given that there were so many projects, but if they could be grouped by subject matter and somehow have the guest lectures scheduled to cater to individual projects, that would be a cool way to try. Overall they were very good though."

I am disappointed by the lack of support from the beginning of this clinic and wish it had gone a different way. I know that Professor Galperin acknowledged all of our difficulties and extra work and this indeed was a representation of his understanding of how hard this semester was for our entire group based on the problems we had throughout the semester.

    "My group was great - very easy to work with. The downside was that we had one member who was only taking the class for 1 credit so she was barely present - which was confusing.",
    "The group that I was assigned was a wonderful group. It was the reason that I made it through this semester. We supported one another greatly. We were really there for one another and that made all the difference. Unfortunately, two of the members of our group took a different approach to this project, which was reflected in a lack of dedication and much less work on the front end. Three of our group members were very dedicated and we took on the brunt of the work, both writing and editing and researching. We had to address this with the two members that did not put as much work into this project and when we did, we noticed some improvement. But at that point, it was probably too late. The three of us that were doing most of the work ended up having to invest much more time into the sections that these two individuals had developed and edit and change the work to improve it. It is likely that the lack of dedication came from the extreme difficulties that we had with the client. Regardless, it was unfortunate to have to spend more time fixing work of our group members and making edits that shouldn't have been necessary. This may have been a result of the fact that our group was a five person group. It was difficult to write a paper with five people.",
    "I learned to work with people from diverse backgrounds on a really challenging issue.",
    "The advantages were learning from one another as I had very knowledgeable and experienced students in my group. The disadvantages were trying to coordinate everyone and trying to even out the workload.",
    "We had a rather large group; however, this worked our in our favor since our client's expectations would have been impossible to meet with fewer members. Additionally, our team worked efficiently, and well together. I would say teams of five should not be an anomaly for the class, but they should ensure they can work well together before confirming they want to be on a large team.",
    "The advantages were primarily that we all got to learn together and push each other and advance a product collectively. The disadvantages were that at times members of the group had competing demands or interests that didn't fully coincide with those of the entirety of the group, and this caused some abrasive interactions at times within the group.",
