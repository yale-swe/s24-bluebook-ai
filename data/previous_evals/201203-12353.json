   "comments": [
    "It's a great philosophy course, it is pretty advanced so despite P. North claiming that anyone who's interested should take it, it certainly helps to have background in the thinkers that are covered.",
    "Great class. Take it if you're willing to put time into the readings. the amount you get out of it is really dependent on the work you put in.",
    "if you like philosophy, definitely.",
    "This class was really great. Professor North is very thorough and careful, which really adds a lot to the material. I only wish that perhaps the syllabus had been more stable. On other hand, I understand the need to adjust the syllabus to circumstances and it was nice that professor north invited us to make our own contributions to it.",
    "take it to see how much has been said about time over the years, how it is all so true in its own ways, and how wrong you might have been by thinking about time in a singular way. professor north in not only a genius but also a fantastic teacher and the entire class is an incredible experience.",
    "If the course title and description interest you, you should definitely take this course. The readings are hard but you don't really have to do them to enjoy the class (obviously you'll get more out of it if you do). This class changed the way I think about time in my daily life and in small ways made me a much more confident person."
