   "comments": [
    "It teaches you the basic methods of research and how development works. I would recommend it to someone only if they knew they had to spend a lot of time on this course. The name \"intro bio\" is very deceiving. This is definitely not intro level stuff.",
    "The material in this class is interesting. However, the research proposal homework was not beneficial and more work than anticipated. I would take this class if you need to, and only if you are very interested in genetics if you don't need to.",
    "BIOL 103 is a solid foundation in genetics. I would only recommend it to those who are looking to further themselves in science, though, as I believe 200 level genetics classes will be much more interesting than BIOL 103.",
    "BIOL 103 requires a lot of memorization of key concepts. I would recommend BIOL 103 to another student because it is the best of the biology modules",
    "BIOL103 was my least favorite module. The proposal homework is very vague and not helpful to solidifying the concepts you learn in class. The quiz and test questions are reasonable, but the time constraint is not. I think what could have made this class more enjoyable despite all this was if we had an engaging professor, but this was not the case as it has been in past teachings of BIOL 103.",
    "Biol 103 was the best module so far (of 101 and 102). The information that you learn is relevant to current and the field of biology, not as specific and heavy as 102, but more in depth than 101. Lectures could be boring at times but the content in the end was always fascinating. The best part of this course was being able to form your own research proposal and being able to understand how to form and carry out genetic experiments.",
    "A prereq for the bio major and necessary course to take for background. The material was presented as interestingly as possible given its scope. Definitely better instructors than some of the other bio sequences, though weekly quizzes were hard and sometimes a bit unreasonable.",
    "You probably aren't taking this for fun (and if you are planning to\u2026just don't), so just deal with it -- it's not that bad. Professor Irish can come off as pretty monotone and un-engaging most of the time, but she also has her good moments. Overall decent course.",
    "YES! organized and interesting",
    "103 was more interesting to me than the first two modules and Prof. Irish was a good lecturer. If you're premed, you have to take the intro sequence anyway, and I'll say that this definitely was not a bad class (certainly better than Mooseker's 102).",
    "BIOL 103 is one of the better modules. Professor Irish does a good job in lecture. The weekly quizzes are actually pretty helpful because it forces you to stay on top of the material.",
    "Try to take it with a different professor.",
    "In a perfect world, I would suggest you stay away from this class at all costs. However, it is not only a pre med requirement but also a requirement in order to take intermediate and advanced biology courses. It is a shame that this will be many Yalies first encounter with the biology department, as the department offers some fascinating courses and is filled with many of the world's premier scientists. If you are lucky maybe you will escape this course unscathed. If not, then it will feel as if you are attempting to treat a 6 inch knife wound with a single cotton swab. The one solace I can offer is that this class is only five weeks long.",
    "You pretty much have to take this class for your major or premed I'm guessing so just get it over with. Genetics is interesting if you can get over the terribly boring lectues and annoying quizzes",
    "Bio 103 is my favorite bio module so far. The material is fascinating but not impossible to master. I liked the research proposal because I'm interested in genetics research, but it might be difficult\/less interesting if you're not or you don't have previous research experience.",
    "I'd recommend it if you're premed or if for some odd reason you need 1\/2 a science credit. It's not too tough for non-science majors, but it does assume some experimental techniques discussed in 101 & 102. Professor Irish is nice, Surjit is fantastic, the quizzes can be tough due to the time constraint (15 min), but the homework and final exam were reasonable.",
    "If you, like me, are a student who is more interested in the large scale effects of biological principles, then Biol 103 is a welcome respite from 101\/102, which corner you into micro and cell biology. Don't get me wrong, all of these modules are very helpful in introducing the field of biology from various angles, and anyone majoring in Biology or STEM should take these courses. All I'm saying is that 103 is really a fresh take on the field, if you've kept up with the modules thus far. You apply a lot of the same concepts from 101\/102, but in much clearer ways. Professor Irish and Surjit are a dream team, and really make the class engaging. Don't go in with preemptive ideas about the quality of the class from earlier modules, it's really in a class of its own.",
    "BIOL 103 is format-wise quite similar to BIOL 101, while difficulty-wise I'd say it's pitched somewhere in between 101 and 102 (with 102 being the most difficult). Professor Irish is a clear lecturer who organizes her material well, which makes the student's life a bit easier. Weekly quizzes are often pretty long and challenging, however, and I found that despite studying considerably for all of them (or at least as much as I thought a 15-minute quiz warranted) that I was still very pressed for time and had trouble understanding some of the questions on the quizzes. You also read papers for discussion section (experience probably varies by TA; my section was not so good) and weekly homework consists of gradually writing a full-length research proposal on a developmental gene of your choice, which I actually found to be fairly fun and rewarding, in contrast with the homework assignments from 101 and 102. Overall, BIOL 103 is not a course I would recommend to be taken on a whim or \"just for fun,\" but if you need it for your major\/other requirements or feel that genetics and development genuinely interests you, it's definitely a manageable course, as long as you make sure to put in some effort.",
    "It is much more pleasant and coherent than Bio 102. The class is much more organized and the teacher is clear in her slides and explanation.",
    "Definitely the best module so far. Enjoy this class because it is your reward for making it through the shitshow that was 101 and 102!",
    "You learn about genes and the forces that regulate them both through the class and by writing your own research proposal. I would not recommend this course if you are not interested in biology because it's not easy. But if you're pre-med, this will be one of the courses you'll enjoy a little more.",
    "For a prerequisite intro class, BIOL103 is a good class. The topic of development is very applicable and led to many interesting examples - I definitely feel like I have a deeper understanding of developmental biology now. I did not like the style of weekly quizzes - however, the final exam is much better and less time pressured.",
    "Only take it if you have to for your major. If you want to get a basic understanding of biology for fun, look into another class.",
    "I think BIOL 103 was a very interesting class in terms of the lecture material. Quizzes, however, were difficult - due to their fleeting nature (five or so multi-part critical thinking questions to be completed in 15 minutes is a trying task), disconnect with the fairly easy-to-grasp lectures\/readings, and lack of application the homework comprised numerous steps of a research proposal - not much reinforcement of the terms discussed in class).",
    "It is a class that you probably have to take if you are taking it. Overall it is somewhat confusing in its grading and testing and does not really seem geared towards understanding or learning the material but rather towards figuring out exactly what the TAs want. In my opinion, learning the exact words the TAs want is kind of a waste of time but you need to do it for this class.",
    "BIOL 103 is a course about genetics and development that negotiates a successful balance between the scientific information and its every-day relevance, making it all the more interesting. I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in a ground level understanding of genetics and development or anyone interested in the sciences. It is a challenging but manageable course.",
    "Biology 103 is a fast-paced genetics and development class in the introductory biology module sequence. The class moves REALLY fast and the quizzes are pretty tough so make sure to review your notes outside of class and don't wait until the last minute to study (or do the big homework project which is incredibly time consuming). Overall, the material is really interesting but the class definitely requires a lot of effort and time to get the most out of it.",
    "The lectures are presented in very simple terms, giving a very false sense of confidence when studying for the weekly quizzes and final. The questions on these quizzes are the most vague and complex that can possibly be asked, and there is never enough time to finish them. The homework every week was absolutely pointless to understanding the material of the class (no matter how great of a skill it is to be able to write research proposals). Thus, with the utter lack of practice in applying the material quickly covered in lectures and being given a very vague and poorly directed homework project with extremely high standards, be prepared to develop a relationship of pure hatred with genetics and development. This is an absolutely awful class. Do not take it unless you absolutely have to.",
    "Chances are you're taking this class because you have to, but for a required class, it could be much worse. Out of the four modules, I'd rank this one second (after 104). It was nice to delve deeper into the field of genetics. Much more interesting than 102.",
    "Most people take this because they have to. It is a generally interesting course.",
    "BIOL 103 was a challenging intro biology class. Professor Irish's quizzes were not easy, especially with the time crunch, and the material was dense for certain lectures. Overall, this class was much harder than I thought it would be.",
    "Very very hard. Only take this class if you absolutely need it.",
    "Biology 103 should have been a very interesting class, but instead, it became a class that I never looked forward to. The material was confusing and lacked depth, while the workload is pretty heavy, with written assignments due on Monday and quizzes on Wednesday. I took the class because it is required for my major, but I wouldn't recommend it to a student who is simply interested in science or biology.",
    "If you have had BIOL 101 and 102 already, you're in for much of the same. Professor Irish is a good lecturer, but not outstanding. The class moves slow at times, and the homework is less useful than in previous modules. On the plus side, if you did well in those modules, you should be fine for 103. It's a class that's not too exciting, but also not too painful. Overall a middling experience."
