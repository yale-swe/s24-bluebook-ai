   "comments": [
    "The class name is very straight forward. This is a class geared toward students who want to learn methods in statistics that directly apply to sociological endeavors. I would definitely recommend it to someone who wants to be able to understand quantitative sociology and Stata. I do not think this one course is enough to be able to conduct your own research, but you will learn a lot! The workload is also very fair and manageable. There is a midterm, final, and weekly problem sets.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student! Vida is wonderful!",
    "A challenging but not impossible class that is great sociology majors with no quantitative experience. Can be intimidating but Professor Maralani and the TA are very helpful and so organized.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in the relationship between qualitative and quantitative research : that is if you are interested also in the theory of statistics. And professor Maralani is amazing professor! take it!",
    "Sociology 162 is an excellent introductory statistics course. What sets this class apart from comparable classes in other departments is its focus on application -- from the first problem set, you are asked to analyze real sociological data. Professor Maralani is an excellent lecturer and is very reachable via office hours or email. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "This class is a great way to learn about statistics in application. The concepts are explored through interesting and relevant examples, and you work with real survey data in class and on assignments. The coursework is manageable for undergrads with real interest in how quantitative analysis applies to the social world.",
    "This class is useful for students who will be conducting their own social science research and using quantitativemethods specifically. No previous knowledge in statistics needed, and you will learn statistical data analysis and interpretation from this class."
