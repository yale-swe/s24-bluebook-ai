   "comments": [
    "In this course I learned how to understand and work with medieval historical records, especially charters and cartularies. I also learned methods for determining the authenticity of such documents and what use they can be for answering certain types of historical questions. Overall, my awareness of the historical documentation of the Middle Ages expanded greatly, as we discussed a variety of source types, from papal bulls to early cookbooks. It was also illuminating to visit the Beinecke several times and view actual charters, cartularies and other notarial manuscripts. Furthermore, the class discussed the joys and challenges of pursuing archival research in Europe, which will undoubtedly be helpful knowledge for carrying out my own doctoral research.",
    "I gained a good amount of knowledge about diplomatic sources, but moreover a conceptual grasp on their place within medieval society, and their role for in research today. I also enjoyed the discussion on the state of the field that we sustained throughout the course. We took a good variety of approaches to the material that I found very rich and helpful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course had many strengths, including the small class size, the many trips to work with medieval materials at the Beinecke, the reasonable amounts of reading combined with ample time to discuss them in class. I have found in classes that it is most effective to split long readings between students and have them present their subject matter to the class because it reduces the overall work load, communicates the most essential information from a given reading, and also provides practice in presenting material to a group. Having two professors with different specialties also added value to this course because together they can offer insights into the material from more than one perspective. I think that it would be difficult to improve this course; it could perhaps include a greater focus on early medieval material and also address the topic of bilingual charters and other non-Latinate historical materials. The class might also benefit from more discussion about editing charters and cartularies.",
    "Sometimes the readings were very long, or they seemed only tenuously helpful for our subject matter. All in all, though, this was a very strong course. It was greatly enriched by the trips to the Beinecke, by the deep expertise of the two professors, and by the small class size."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this to another student, particularly one interested in the social or economic history of the Middle Ages, although students of medieval literature, art and law would also find aspects of this course to be of interest. It teaches information that would be useful for anyone studying the history of the Middle Ages, and also provides an opportunity to develop research and writing skills. There is the added bonus of many visits to the Beinecke to examine a variety of documentary materials.",
    "It is a very \"niche\" topic but I think for anyone working on the Middle Ages it opens up new and important avenues for studying the period. You also get to see a lot of neat documents."
