    "Would have liked one class period early in the semester dedicated to talking about how authors choose the outline for a full story. We read many pieces and examples but didn't sit back and think about the roadmaps these authors use enough. This exercise would have been very helpful when, mid-semester, we were asked to start full drafts of our work and all I had was a handful of scenes and no sense of what I was trying to say. I found myself doing this exercise later in the semester than I would have liked."

    "You learn from the experience of the instructor, the insights of your classmates, and your own process as you work through a full length article over the semester.",
    "Fred is an incredible teacher of writing; and he is incredibly engaged with students and their work. He edits work in detail EVERY week, providing structured feedback and areas for improvement. He's also incredibly positive, quick to complement and to solicit complements from others. Working with Fred is an honor, and the highlight of this course. Additionally, each student in this class is working on one long-form piece of journalism that is unique to their experiences\/interests; so I learned a huge amount from reading and editing my peers' pieces.",
    "The course is a writing course. The foci are writing, reading good writing, discussing good writing. All excellent.",
    "Great example readings, cool to dive into what makes a sentence great, how to create your audience, etc. Very good for the lit nerds among us. Fast paced could be good and bad. Loved having workshops at the end, wish we had met more often. Or maybe full workshop one week, partner workshop the next, etc.",
    "Convivial learning environments - Fred does not let you off the hook until you have fully developed an argument. A great mind!",
    "The input from fellow students! When we were workshopping each others texts. Fred's individual detailed input on all of our work The readings were very fun, and so was the in-class discussion",
    "This course is an incredible opportunity to explore writing a piece of environmental journalism if you already have had the experience (that your planning on writing about) and have conducted the research. FS is an excellent and attentive editor, who will give you ample time and feedback. I was amazed at his diligence. It was a pleasure to be able to work with him over the course of the semester, particularly one-on-one or in the larger classroom setting while workshopping our pieces."

   "comments": [
    "Nothing needs to be improved, in my opinion.",
    "the in-class portion often felt crazed\/rushed and some students felt that Fred could talk down to them\/dismissively. I think it's his style to rush us towards the answer he wants but he often didn't notice when a student felt put down by a comment. See section above above in Q13 about having a class devoted to roadmapping your story. Please please please give us a 10-15minute break in the middle of the 3hour long class. We need it desperately.",
    "Better wrap-up of discussions - e.g. the take-away messages from the analysis of the texts. More in-depth theoretical explanations. Maybe using Word control changes function for editing and commenting on the drafts, which has its limitations but is not as messy as using the variety of fonts, bold, italicized styles that Fred uses, and make it look really cluttered. Stating from the beginning how to keep track of sources. Cover methods for being organized in keeping track of sources, how to take field notes, photos, quotes, etc. - tips for when we are out in the field soaking everything in to write a piece.",
    "I thought that the discussion sections of this course when discussing readings were the portion of the course that needed the most improvement. Often reading discussions would cramp the time available to actually discuss our pieces particularly early in the semester. Discussions often felt forced. While I appreciated that FS was trying to get lead us a particular direction, I often felt stifled by this, as I may have something that I wanted to say but didn't know what exactly FS wanted me to say. This is particularly pertinent, as we do not discuss matters that have right and wrong answers. While I greatly appreciated many portions of the course, I often felt frustrated during the reading discussions. The readings are great, but also would have appreciated if the instructor had just chosen which readings we were going to be discussing. To get through readings I was often glossing over some incredible pieces or would just select the pieces that were of interest to me. Would have been great to actually know which pieces we were going to discuss so that I could have focused my reading and then used my remaining time to explore the supplemental readings. Also, assessment was completely unclear as we did not actually receive a grade on any portion of work all semester. I would have appreciated a more clear outline of how grading would be conducted."
