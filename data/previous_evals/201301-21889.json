    "French 151 is exactly what it purports. Take it with Schneider. She is tough and fair. Your French will improve!",
    "Yes, I recommend the class if you're willing to put in the full effort. It's not a course to just take to get a credit for. A great range of grammar and culture and literature and film is covered.",
    "French 151 is a great continuation of French 150, in which you study various French works of literature and watch some interesting French films. There is a heavy emphasis on grammatical specificities, which really help improve your written and spoken French. Class was always enjoyable and lively, and while there was a lot of work and many assessments, I definitely learned a lot. Try to take it with Madame Schneider if you can; she is super dynamic and makes the class so enjoyable. Definitely recommend it!",
    "French 151 is a great course, and from what I hear, every teacher for it is excellent. Prof. Schneider happens to be one of the most strict in that she might seem a little more harsh in correcting you, but she will definitely improve your French, or at least make sure you're aware of what's wrong. Her grading is fair and she has reasonable expectations of her students. Take the course ifyou have a pretty good background in all the tenses and need practice in applying the grammar that you know.",
    "French 151 is an intensive language course with great reading and films. I would definitely recommend it to another student, and also let him or her know that it is a great amount of work and the student gets out of the class what he puts in (especially true with language courses)."
