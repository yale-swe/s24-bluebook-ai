   "comments": [
    "It will probably frustrate you more than it will help you.",
    "Incredible exposure to the text. Wonderfully enlightening experience.",
    "Only take this class if you love Shakespeare and are willing to spend a lot of time on it.",
    "It depends on who else is taking it. I had a great time with the students in the class, and I love Shakespeare, so that was fun. But overall, I found it frustrating and unhelpful.",
    "Theater Studies 315 is a great, low-pressure environment in which to develop one's ability to act and analyze Shakespeare and his contemporaries. I would definitely recommend it to any student interested in performance or Elizabethan literature.",
    "good course -- helps to know some stuff about shakespeare but not required",
    "Be prepared to spend a lot of time memorizing text, a substantial amount of text. Also be prepared to choose your clothing as a costume for every class. Shakespeare Acted is a great opportunity to workshop Shakespeare every other week.",
    "As a non-Theater Studies major who hadn't had the chance to take other acting classes I really enjoyed Shakespeare Acted. It doesn't require much work--really nothing outside of the scenes and monologues you prepare--but I still found it rewarding. For better or worse, the grading and evaluations remain a mystery until the bitter end. Although there is feedback on individual performances it is difficult to discern how you are actually doing in the course, if that is something that matters to you.",
    "If you want to do a lot of Shakespeare in one semester, take this class. If you don't, still take this class.",
    "The course is fun and interesting. You start with monologues and by working through sonnets and \"duologues\" - short two person scenes - closely with the rest of the class, then you prepare, memorize, and perform sonnets and duologues, and finally edit and perform longer scenes. Professor Biggs is a bit eccentric but is fun. It's a good mix of majors and non-majors from a variety of backgrounds.",
    "This class does offer a great deal of shakespeare scene and monologue work and the chance to begin critiquing the work done by others in this field, which is very useful. It can at times feel that the class is placing too much emphasis on real world audition contexts and not enough on text work.",
    "Yes, I would, definitely. Great course. It's a place to work on your Shakespeare, both in a scholarly and practical way."
