    "Yes. Good course, definite keeper. Just remember that it's not a sociology class; you'll be talking about the literary merits of these works more than the relative merits of the Utopias they represent. But as long as you can frame your arguments about the Utopias in terms of the literary structure that speaks them, even the single-minded sociologist can find things to think here.",
    "Great class where you can read a lot of very interesting literature. The unfortunate part is that the classes are very short compared to the amount of literature we read, so for a lot of the books, we only have time to discuss a small section of the novel before we would have to move on to the next. The reading isn't too heavy (100-200 per week) except the last book was a 400 page guy in a week. That plus 4 essays from 3-7 pages double spaced wasn't bad at all. Overall, good fun class on Utopia.",
    "If a student is considering taking this course, they ought to take a thorough look at the reading list. The utopia genre is definitely not for everyone, and a sincere interest in the books on the reading list would make the course a lot more valuable. I would recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their essay-writing skills, but only if they have genuine enthusiasm for the utopian genre."
