   "comments": [
    "I would recommend 472, both for thesis and for independent research before that. As long as you find an interesting project with a good professor, you will have a good experience.",
    "The course enables you to do research with a lot of freedom - just make sure to find a good advisor and start the project early enough so you don't have to cram it into the last few weeks.",
    "Physics 472 is great if you are planning to do research. It isn't much more work than you should already be doing if you are working in a lab, and it ensures that you write a paper at the end of the semester about your lab work, which is useful to have for the future.",
    "Sure, if you have a choice and want to do research Prof. Zeller is really great.",
    "Professor Zeller is pretty lax. You just need to submit a progress report and a final paper.",
    "If you are in physics and need independent research you will do it.",
    "It's research. Take it if you like science.",
    "I absolutely would. I only wish I had taken it sooner."
