    "For those who have been fleeing from science class after another, this is the class for you. Best way to get rid of your sci credit.",
    "MBB110 is a fantastic opportunity to teach yourself a topic that interests you with a professor who is excited to answer your questions.I would recommend it if you are interested in a particular science topic that you usually could not learn about without taking a few pre-reqs first. (Genetic Engineering, PTSD, How flu vaccines are made).But the course is unstructured so it is what you make of it. If you're interested in learning any new topic that counts for a science credit, you may be better off in one of the lecture courses.",
    "Yes definitely as long as you are self motivated and do not need a definite structure.",
    "This course is what it claims to be: a science course for non-science majors. Every week students must do research on topics of their choice and then present their findings to the entire class. Although class sections are repetitive (as every student has about 10 minutes to present their research), this class is perfect for non-science students who do not want to spend dozens of hours doing problem sets or studying for exams on topics they have no interest in.",
    "This course presents a great opportunity to practice the sort of self-education that will be all we have after leaving college\/grad school.",
    "If you are a non-science major, TAKE THIS CLASS. It is a gem.You get to work on independent research in a really supportive environment, and Bill Summers is great. The final paper was long, but interesting because each student gets to choose his\/her own research topic. Literally I can't complain about anything in this class. As a non-science student I found this class infinitely more manageable and useful than the science lecture I took for my other SC credit.Seriously -- TAKE IT.",
    "find out how grading works for a student from last year, otherwise absolute win.",
    "I highly recommend Current Issues to another student. It is a great class that is rigorous and allows you to research a scientific question of your own."
