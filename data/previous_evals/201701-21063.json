   "comments": [
    "Learned how to apply the act of close reading to artifacts of pop culture. Got way better at closely analyzing my surroundings, and truly thinking about every detail of the subject of my writing. My creative non-fiction writing also improved drastically. Lofton says that pop culture criticism can be a form of art, and I definitely think I honed that skill!",
    "How to appreciate what objects of popular culture do for us. We shouldn't dismiss them so readily as \"vapid.\"",
    "I learned how to read a variety of dense theory and light texts in a sociocultural light; interact with classmates in cultural analysis; write cultural analyses",
    "Wow. I have learned more in this course than in any other course at Yale. I've learned how to write, how to argue, how to critique. I've learned how to think more broadly and how to better recognize my own biases. I'm not being dramatic in the slightest when I say that Lofton's class has reshaped me as both a student and a person.",
    "New way of looking at the landscape of popular culture around me. I immediately jump to trying to explain and understand the bizarre when I encounter it; this class made the world more interesting for me.",
    "I learned how to critically examine items of popular culture, and our lives as its consumers. I learned also how to write to drive home a point, and to be efficient with my language and reasoning.",
    "I learned how to do more concrete and specific cultural criticism and extrapolate from my experiences and ideas into something more meaningful and engaging to a broader audience.",
    "I learned how to be a better, more critical writer - and I learned that we can, and should, always ask questions about why we do the things we do, why we watch the things we watch, why we read the things we read - questions that'll stick with me for a long time. I didn't learn what I thought I was going to learn - any specifics in particular about religion - but the writing skills and questions that I learned to ask will stick with me.",
    "Strengthened and expanded critical thinking skills. Developed new ways to approach cultural texts, was familiarized with extent schools of thought and philosophies regarding cultural analysis. Learned to consider my place in relation to the cultural object",
    "I learned to think much more critically and thoroughly than I did before, both of academic texts and examples of pop culture. This class helped shape the way I approach studies in the future. It was so interesting to take a microscope to people or fads we interact with everyday. If anything, this class was a little meta but that's not so bad."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths are its creative and dynamic discussions, led by a most charismatic professor.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Lofton is amazing, and really makes the discussion each week interesting. I feel like everything that comes out of her mouth is brilliant. Weaknesses: I would've like to spend a little more time on each object, rather than going for quantity.",
    "This course engages students at a multiplicity of levels (class discussions, group discussions, amazing readings). Lofton carefully crafts each class to push students and help us think critically about the material.",
    "The course is really great in that you form a community with your classmates and Professor Lofton where you learn together how to dissect and discuss the topics for each week. It truly was a discussion-based seminar, and the readings each week were interesting and applicable to discussion and papers. I enjoyed the fact that we were able to explore things relevant to our everyday lives as millennials, while still being academic and learning to think about the world in different ways.",
    "I really enjoyed Professor Lofton's engagement with the material and the way she outlined conversations. I do wish, however, that we had engaged with the question of religion a little bit more in the class.",
    "The strengths of this course were how it challenged us to think, and write, more critically and with more precision. This all comes from Kathryn Lofton, who is an incisive, intense, and critical thinker and a great teacher. She thinks more quickly and develops arguments with more clarity than most anyone I know, and she's put together a course with assignments and readings that push students to think hard and to challenge themselves. The weaknesses of the class were that it was a bit too big to have really great class discussions -- it's a class that'd benefit from being closer to 15 students than 20. The other big weakness was that, content-wise, I don't feel like I got much out of the class, and it wasn't clear from the start what we were going to learn.",
    "Definite strengths are its emphasis on close-reading and the type of in-class discussion that it fosters. While I'm proud of most of the writing I produced in this class and thought how we were asked to approach each prompt was helpful. I, at times, wished the essay prompts were slightly more confined",
    "One of the strengths of this course is how Professor Lofton meticulously structures each class. The syllabus gives you questions to mull over before each class, and unlike so many other professors at Yale, Lofton never begins with the dreaded, \"So what did you think of last night's reading?\" Instead, she'll ask us to journal to ourselves, split off into working groups, run through a group simulation she found in the appendix of one of our readings about charisma... She lets us preheat our intellectual ovens so that by the time we get around to group discussion, we're on fire with ideas, and we're raring to go. One suggestion for improving the course would be letting us revise at least one of our papers. I loved how our essay topics sprawled from Pokemon Go to encountering an unfamiliar cultural object, but I would have loved the chance to workshop my paper with Lofton's thoughtful feedback in mind rather than trying to transfer that feedback to an entirely new paper."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Learning how to do good pop culture criticism is really fun and useful, especially when its set through the lens of religion. Lofton is amazing, take the course!",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS. You won't be seeing the world through the same eyes.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can get in - Professor Lofton is an incredible teacher and the course material is very engaging\/interesting.",
    "YES. PLEASE PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS. It will change the way you think about pop culture, religion, Yale, life, yourself. It's incredible, and you will be pushed and moved and changed.",
    "This is a fantastic class for those who want to be pushed, think differently, and write more sharply. I am someone who loves writing and thinks they're a good writer, and this class challenged me. Studying with Prof. Lofton is not an opportunity to be missed; she's one of the most intelligent people I've met in my life.",
    "Take the course for sure! It will teach you how to think about everything in your life in a different way. Weekly topics are applicable, humorous, and intriguing, and this helps make the preparation something you want to do rather than something you must. Professor Lofton is strikingly intelligent, and will help you learn how to communicate more effectively both in class and in writing.",
    "Yes, but be prepared for Prof. Lofton. She's a whirlwind, and moves quickly. Also be ready to engage heavily with the material, especially at the beginning, so you can get your feet under you and figure out how you actually write about something like Pokemon Go.",
    "All in all, I'd absolutely recommend this course. It's worth it just to be in the presence of Kathryn Lofton, who thinks more quickly and with more clarity than most anyone I know. She has strong and thoughtful ideas about how we should think about the world, and pushes her students to think critically, too - she's just fascinating to learn from. I came out of the class not at all learning what I thought I was going to learn -- it's really a class about how to think through and write cultural criticism, and, especially, about how to ask good questions -- which isn't at all bad, but it's just something to be prepared for. I don't feel like I learned or will retain much content-wise about religion or about popular culture, and sometimes class discussion feels like it isn't really going anywhere, or that it was unclear what we were getting out of each class section. But beyond content, I learned how to write and think through cultural criticism, and how to ask questions about religion and pop culture -- which is really valuable, and will stick with me. The readings are fun, the assignments are challenging, and you'll become a better writer and thinker. I'd absolutely recommend.",
    "Yes, Professor Lofton is incredibly thoughtful with her feedback. In class, she displays an ability to grasp and then rephrase a student's thought in a more distilled form that is incredibly reassuring and helpful for everyone else. She is funny. The syllabus is filled with great texts. You get to analyze texts that you are presumably interested in.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you can and are interested. Professor Lofton is one of the best professors on this campus. Conversations are always engaging and above all RELEVANT.",
    "Best class I've taken at Yale. Lofton is a literal genius. Life changing. If you can get in, you need to take it.",
    "This class is fantastic. To give you an idea of the work, some highlights from our discussions include Pokemon Go; Kanye; the Kardashians; Yale's Admissions video; self-help books; memes; and so much more. The class is so responsive to the outside world and allows students to bring in examples as they see fit. It's not so much about established religions (really not at all) but about the spiritual aspects including fulfillment and devotion that we find in other secular parts of our lives. Professor Lofton may not be an easy grader, but she provides tons of feedback and direction and makes herself readily available to meet beforehand.",
    "Best class I've ever taken at Yale, and I'm a graduating senior. Take the course, or you'll sorely regret it for all of eternity.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT If by some miracle you get in, do not squander your chance! Professor Lofton is a truly original thinker, and her relentless questioning, SNL-worthy comedic timing, and stunning compassion left me breathless at the end of each class. One of the great surprises of this class is that Lofton gestures to religion very subtly. At its heart, this is a class about fandom, and she only reaches for religious reference points (the Bible, the phenomena of prophets, Talmudic debate etc) when we all desperately need it, when our discussions about popularity come up short without it, which makes the pairing of Relgiion and Popular Culture feel essential rather than forced by the end of the semester."
