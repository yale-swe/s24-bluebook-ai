   "comments": [
    "Pretty boring, Stern makes it pretty fun most of the time.",
    "Survey course on modern Jewish philosophy. Note: this course is more intellectual history\/philosophy than history, with a focus on people and ideas rather than places and dates. If Eli Stern is teaching it, definitely take it--he's really knowledgeable, will work individually on paper topics, and is easygoing about due dates. I took this course for fun, as a side academic interest, but it would probably be even more productive for religious\/jewish studies majors.",
    "The name of the course basically tells you what you're getting yourself into. The course started from Spinoza all the way to basically now. Definitely a lot of readings. And some readings, you'll enjoy more than others. And the class is super chill. The professor gives you a long period of time (longer than what you normally get in other courses) to complete two paper assignments (a midterm paper and a final paper). And he tells you exactly what you are expected to do. So you should be fine as long as you follow his directions (exactly).And yes, I would definitely recommend this class, because it is one of the best course I've taken here at yale. Though I don't think Professor Stern will be teaching next year. And in that case, I'm not sure what thisclass will be like (b\/c in my opinion what basically \"sells\" this class is Stern's lectures).",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who would like to have a foundational knowledge in intellectual modern Jewish history, such as the origins of reform\/conservative\/orthodox, of hasidism, of different strains of zionism, and of post-Holocaust thought. Really interesting material.",
    "I loved this course! Although it was structured as a lecture, the small enrollment enabled us to ask questions, and to some extent, have discussions. Professor Stern is an excellent lecturer and a fascinating person. His lectures connected ideas across philosophy, history, and politics for coherent explanations of complex topics. I frequently left class feeling enlightened and excited about the material. Although demanding in class, his grading is very fair.",
    "Yes",
    "This course is well planned and executed. It provides both a good overview of the large historical trend and in-depth analysis of individual thinkers. Professor Stern's lectures are fantastic\u0097erudite but plainspoken, and always engaging\u0097and if you like the first few, stay, because they\u0092re consistently good throughout the semester. I especially recommend the course to those unfamiliar with this intellectual tradition, because you learn a lot in an accessible, easygoing manner (workload is light) and get to know some really important, colorful thinkers.",
    "It's a good course, but be prepared to PAY ATTENTION. You can't get notes from slides later on."
