   "comments": [
    "Storytelling, basic filmmaking (shooting, lighting, sound, editing), analyzing conflict and where to find a story in real life events.",
    "In this course, we developed the requisite technical skills (including video\/audio capture and editing) for creating films. More importantly, we discussed at length matters of storytelling, interviewing, subjectivity, and ethics that any filmmaker has to consider while creating her work.",
    "I learned the technicalities behind documentary film making but also the ethics of film making.",
    "The most important thing I learned was what goes into a good narrative. I learned how to introduce conflict and how the filmmaker can really show their point of view.",
    "The knowledge I developed by this course is in an ability to analyse, find a complexity in the art of film and connect these skills with my musical principals and priorities. We learned how to see tiny details of a movie, tried to explain these details and what they contributed into the movie.",
    "I think I am better prepared to critically think about my work as a filmmaker and move forward with more of the skills necessary to produce pieces that are worth watching and engaging with.",
    "I learned how to make a film. It's something that I've always wanted to learn but felt was so daunting. Sandra built up our confidence little by little with small projects and we ended the semester by making a 10 minute documentary. It was a lot of work but well worth it. I look at movies completely differently now, much more aware of the technical and artistic choices being made.",
    "I learned how to plan and follow through with a documentary project. I learned a lot of technical skills that made this possible, for which I'm incredibly grateful."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very personal, individual interaction with Sandra and with individual projects\/topics. Weaknesses: Sandra is amazing in my opinion, but I know she rubs some folks the wrong way - she's very upfront and doesn't soften her opinions when she has them. Some students have a hard time with that.",
    "I really liked the small class size of this course and getting to know the other students through their work as the semester progressed. Obviously the material is also very interesting, and I appreciated how much self-reflection was incorporated into the class. There are definitely things I learned in this course that I will carry with me in both my personal and professional lives. One area where this course can be improved is its inclusion of a \"hands-on\" class session. I would have liked to use one of the early classes for supervised experimentation with camera equipment so that we could get live feedback from the professor (rather than just feedback after our assignments). I think this would have only sped up our learning curve as we became familiar with the many decisions one has to make at once when shooting footage.",
    "The discussions were phenomenal and very engaging between the students and the professor. I think that there could have been more lessons that involved actual workshops in class with using the equipment and possibly creating practice scenarios that we could apply to our homework assignments.",
    "I think that the smaller assignments throughout the first half of the course were helpful to do but could have been geared toward helping us with our final projects. I think they could have served the purpose of teaching us how to see through the camera but also could have been used as an opportunity to advance our final projects. I also think some extra sessions for more technical help with the equipment could have made a huge difference in the quality of our films as well.",
    "The strengths of this course is in opened discussing the purposes of any movie creation, with a lot of friendly and exact advises. We spent a lot of time to clarify our goals and ways to reach them. That was very helpful, useful and interesting not only for film creation but for general life also.",
    "The main strength of this class was definitely the actual workshopping of our projects and exercises. The insight from Professor Luckow and the other students in the class is invaluable in improving your own work. A weakness of this course could be its sometimes seeming lack of direction, which I didn't have so much of a problem with, but if a student were looking for a clear directive for each class, this might not be the course for them. I, personally, enjoyed the free-flowing nature of the class. It allowed us to spend more time on what we found interesting.",
    "Strengths: Sandra is so so so insightful, can draw out the conflict and focus of a clip in an instant, gives helpful feedback on the film projects. Our class of 10 students became very close by the end of the semester through watching each others' film projects week by week and I felt like I was able to see parts of Yale through their films that I would have otherwise never known about. Weaknesses: the class is 4 hours long, which is a long time to stay focused and be able to critique other peoples' work. Also, it was disorganized at times, and I wish we spent less time watching the filmskills modules which we can watch anywhere and more time learning things we can't learn on our own. But all in all, a great class!",
    "Strengths: It is great to get to practice this medium in a hands-on way. Weaknesses: class feels very long and class discussions were not fruitful."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If you have the adequate time available to execute the assignments, yes!",
    "Absolutely. Through film making, we can learn how to create new perspectives of the world around us and how to successfully tell a story through factual content.",
    "Yes, I thought the course was fantastic. I really enjoyed it, especially as someone that is not in the film school because it really does connect with other design disciplines. As an architect, I can make connections to things like story arch and structure relative to my own design work.",
    "In my opinion to be involved in any different (but in some way very close) environment is very useful. The course lectures and discussions were awesome! In class, I felt a lot of connections with real life examples and I'm grateful to the teacher and all classmates for very friendly atmosphere and creative process.",
    "This class is definitely not for everybody. It's pretty niche, but I enjoyed it. Professor Luckow has plenty of cool insight on documentary filmmaking and the workshopping that takes place in this course is really useful for improving the quality of your work. The four hour class each week can sometimes feel like a bit of a slog, but the time usually passed pretty quickly. I would definitely emphasize the importance of picking a topic you really care about for the final project because you spend much of the second half of the semester working on it. Professor Luckow is a fun instructor who definitely lets the class focus on what we want. She has a big personality, so if you think you're going to clash with that, be careful because this is a small class. Overall, I would recommend this class to someone interested in getting hands-on experience with documentary filmmaking.",
    "It's a lot of work and it's frustrating work at times (because anything that can go wrong with your camera, editing software, sound, battery level will go wrong at some point) but well worth it in my experience. One of the criteria I use to evaluate classes is whether I walked away seeing the world a little bit differently after taking a class and that has been so true in this case. I am much more observant of my surrounding after being behind the camera, appreciative of the insane amount of work that goes into making a film. And I walked away with basic film editing skills and camera skills. I feel confident that if I needed to make a film in the future for whatever reason, I can, and that's really rare at Yale-- to walk away with a tangible skill. Of course, this class isn't perfect. It's disorganized at times, really long, but no regrets whatsoever!",
    "Yes I recommend because if you're interested in pursuing documentary work, the course is a great introduction to the field. You get to actually practice the craft and you get good feedback from the instructor and your peers."
