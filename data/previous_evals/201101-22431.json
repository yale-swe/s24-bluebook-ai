    "It's something that all BME majors have to do. Be sure to have looked at labs ahead of time to find the right one for you. Try talking to people who already work in the lab for advice.The requirements, in comparison to the other senior requirements, are not that bad. Just a 10-15 write-up of your work and a 12 min oral presentation at the end of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are already doing independent research. Seniors are required to so its not much of a choice - but Professor Duncan\/Staib are nice so it's pretty enjoyable.",
    "",
    "Do it if you want to do research for credit.",
    "highly recommended, but you have to take it anyway",
    "If you're a BME major you have to take it as your senior project.",
    "Research for credit. How much work you do depends on who you work with.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student considering the BENG major. I took this course before senior year and it was great - it helped me understand methods for experiment design, the BME laboratory, and my specific project topic in great detail. It is also good preparation for the senior project."
