    "Deeper knowledge of field of American studies, met future mentors and scholars whose work I would like to emulate",
    "Very little. I did, however, get to meet so many of the lovely faculty in the department.",
    "Through this course, I became aware of the history and current scholarship of the American Studies field. Weekly presentations from American Studies faculty were very invigorating. Learning about the variety of disciplines and interests that make up the department help us first-years become acquainted not only with our future professors and colleague, but also got us thinking about the writing process, the teaching process, and further professional development. I learned how to pitch one's research from various perspectives, and how to synthesize different fields into one American Studies lens.",
    "This course allowed me to engage with Professors from across the American Studies department. Additionally, this course did provide me with a good deal of information about the inner workings of American Studies as a field in academia."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor was given a pretty big task of gathering professors to cover all sorts of sub fields in AMST. She did a great job. She was kind and tried to engage students at all times. She even made time to meet with us after classs and give in-depth and helpful career advice. No suggestions for improvement",
    "The course could stand to be improved in so many ways. First, we should receive some sort of exposure to the history of the field, the \"schools\" that orbit its formation, and we should absolutely read a Keywords text. Second, spending the second half of class discussing the professor's work does not make sense, maybe it can be focused on pedagogy or student led conversations about praxis or texts we found interesting? Lastly, while there is no established canon, can professors coming in assign a text that feels like their primary \"AMST\" interlocutor? We can also read books about AMST, such as Lipsitz's \"American Studies in a Moment of Danger\" or the newly released User's Guide",
    "Strengths: Being introduced the the faculty in the department was invaluable. I was also very happy to be in a class with my the entire first-year cohort. Weaknesses: There was not that much structure to actually exploring the history and keywords of American Studies. The visiting professors could have been assigned a keyword or a key field to present on, in order to expose us to the multifaceted academic perspectives that find a home in American Studies.",
    "American Studies pro-seminars in other PhD programs provide, if not a canon, a number of texts that are considered American Studies from the 1970s onward. I would have appreciated a similar list of books that might provide a loose lineage of American Studies scholarship that we could discuss together.",
    "Ideally, this course would provide more background on American Studies either through writings on the field or through a sustained discussion of the fields history. I wish that the course was stronger in its ability to orient new students to the department."
