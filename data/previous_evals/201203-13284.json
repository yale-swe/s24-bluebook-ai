    "I would definitely recommend it! One of the best seminars I've taken at Yale.",
    "If you can get into it, take it! Just be warned, you might suddenly find yourself wanting to live in the gulf coast. Also, food is involved. Delicious, southern, often homecooked food. As if you need another reason to take this interesting, awesome class.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn why the American Gulf Coast is so vital. Take it if you want to learn about desegregation in a multi-tiered racial setting. Take it if you want to learn about Jelly Roll Morton and spend a week on music. Take it if you want to spend a week on college football, and learn why the ground shook in Death Valley in the 80s or why a head coach became a god to the state of Alabama. Take it if you shed a tear during Hurricane Katrina. Take it if you want to learn how easily an important region in the United States can be brushed aside in the scheme of your cookie-cutter American history class. TAKE THIS CLASS. You'll never take one better.",
    "American Gulf Coast is a fantastic senior seminar. Brasseaux is a joy to be around. He is funny and engaging, and the material we cover is unique. You'll never get to learn about the deep south like you do in this class. Food every week also made a huge difference. Yes, it was at 9:25 every Wednesday, but I didn't mind waking up early to take this seminar. It was worth it.",
    "It's an amazing and VERY unique course. It's unusual just because of the type of history it takes on, rarely do people talk about \"the gulf coast\" as an entity, so the class is experimental because of its topic, but it also mixes everything: music, food, movies, anecdotes, primary sources, news articles, sports coverage, we looked at everything! It was wonderful, will change the way you think about history and ethnography. Take it!",
    "Awesome class, Dean Brasseaux is great, pre-register so you can definitely get admitted to the course.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Probably the best class I've taken at Yale. TAKE IT. You won't regret it.",
    "i would recommend the class, but you must be ready to do readings about subjects that you might not find interesting. the first half of the class is chronological, and i found it very hard to be interested in early texas history. the second half of the class was more thematic, and i found that way more interesting and more easily digestible.",
    "I would definitely recommend the American Gulf Coast for another student because it covers a variety of very interesting topics, unified by a geographic theme that all too often slips under the radar in American history courses. Dean Brasseaux makes class fun and interesting with clips, slideshows, and music, ensuring that the members of the class can really get a feel for Gulf Coast history and culture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The workload is manageable, and the material is extremely interesting. I learned so much from this course!",
    "Once a week seminar built around a semi-chronological look at the American Gulf Coast. Topics range from oil to football, with emphasis on colonial history \/ legacy, race and crises.",
    "Learning about the American Gulf Coast is important for anyone who wants to understand modern-day America. Not only is it one of the country's most historically and culturally distinct regions, but it is a major United States economic center, the center of the American oil industry. Finally, scholars are beginning to pay more attention to the region, which has been long-neglected by historians, and Dean Brasseaux has designed an amazing class to bring the study of the American Gulf Coast to Yale. Beginning with European explorers fighting to gain control over the coast and ending with coastal residents attempting to overcome the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and the BP Oil Spill, the course covered everything from religion to language to racial dynamics to Jazz to environmental issues to football. Readings were varied and enjoyable, and class discussions were interesting, especially because the class was a mixture of students from the Gulf Coast and students from other parts of the country. Dean Brasseaux is a wonderful instructor, and his passion for his home region was contagious."
