   "comments": [
    "I gained lots of great printmaking skills! Also, I gained a better understanding of the discipline in general, what kinds of things can be made using printmaking techniques, and how to start and move forward on projects even without a clear idea of the outcome.",
    "I learned how to do multi-layer woodcut printing, how to use blocking fluids to screenprint, and how to use Photoshop to create screens.",
    "Great intro to basic printmaking skills!",
    "I learned how to make digital screen prints, how to use photoshop and illustrator for printmaking, how to make a woodcut successfully and how to make mono prints.",
    "Having had very little printmaking experience before taking this class, most of what I learned were technical skills: woodcuts, monoprints, screenprints, found object printing, etc. That said, I also learned a great deal about the theory and history behind the different techniques, and the cultural context surrounding their development and popularity. Perhaps most importantly, though, I learned the etiquette and best practices of critiquing and accepting criticism in an art-based discussion.",
    "I learned how to do screenprinting and woodblock printing, and how to use a printing press",
    "I certainly learned a lot about different printmaking techniques, including how to troubleshoot when something's not working. I also learned to offer useful critiques and think conceptually.",
    "learned various screenprinting techniques with hand-drawn or stenciled liquid, monotype drawings, photo emulsion! plus woodcut printing with multiple layers learned about some of the history and context of printmaking and ways of thinking of it as a social\/political\/collaborative media area",
    "This class teaches a few methodologies of printmaking. Primarily silk screening, woodblock, and photographic emulsion. It challenges students to engage with and experiment with developing their practice with these techniques."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: the small class size and the three blocks of two hours. I think the only weakness was that there wasn't a well-defined timeline, so there wasn't a lot of motivation to finish projects on time. I think we could have gotten through a few more techniques\/projects had we been encouraged to stick to deadlines a little bit more.",
    "This course offered a lot of freedom to students to pursue the type of work that we wanted, which could be a strength or a weakness depending on the individual student.",
    "Really appreciated that units focused on method, and that everyone could create whatever they wanted imagery-wise. I think we could have done a little more with the time, but overall a great experience.",
    "A strength was the freedom we had to create art and the lack of artistic direction, so that each student could really express their artistic vision. I thought the course could have been more directed, with stricter deadlines so that we could learn more and work with more kinds of printmaking.",
    "This course's strengths lay in its hands-on approach. There were no lectures, per-se. Everything we learned, we learned through attempting, through trial and error, and through direct and practical instruction. If the course has any weaknesses, they result from the huge amount of material we tried to cover in only 13 weeks of classes. It was a lot to try to cram in, and certain aspects of the printmaking process fell by the wayside due to time constraints.",
    "I liked the format of the course, and that we got a lot of freedom to explore the things we wanted to and create our own projects. It was structured well enough that we didn't have to spend a ton of time outside of class working on projects if we didn't want to, but there was always the opportunity to stretch ourselves. I also really liked being able to see everyone else's work during critique and to see the different styles of everyone. I would have liked a little more structure - there was sometimes confusion as to what we were doing that week or the next week, and it was difficult to plan ahead.",
    "Strengths: free-form, independent, allows you to follow your own creative interests. Weaknesses: I sometimes would have appreciated a little more structure and clearer expectations--it was hard to know whether I was on track in the class or really missing the mark.",
    "strengths: helpful instruction and cool techniques interesting critiques very technical skills-based and physical class weaknesses: could be hard to stay motivated to keep producing when given so much leeway you really have to seek out help with artistic direction, as the class is very open-ended",
    "The biggest weakness of the class is that it doesn't push students to move fast or produce a lot. There are few assignments given and no real hard deadlines. However, if one is inspired then they are free to be as productive as they wish, which can lead to a lot of development. I think maybe the class had been a bit crowded (at least at the beginning before drops)"

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class. It's a lot of fun and you will learn a lot. It does take up a fair amount of time, but it's definitely worth it.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed this class and would recommend it as an introductory course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with even a vague interest in printmaking!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in art making techniques, and who wants to really learn the minute of processes. It's a rewarding class,. and I'm very happy with the art I made at the end. I was able to think seriously about print media and be immersed in that kind of art making.",
    "This course is a whole lot of fun, and if you're looking for a really exciting way to fill up your schedule, even if you have no previous art experience, you should totally take this class. There are few classes at Yale that leave you with practical, tangible, hands-on skills, and this one instills a whole bunch. That said, though the work is fun and exciting, it takes a whole bunch of time. You get out what you put in; if you want to learn all the methods super deeply, you're going to find yourself going to the print shop after hours for a couple hours a day, and all your time will get sucked in. Don't make my mistake and take this as a fifth class, but if you're looking for a fourth class, go for it. It really rocks. *I am not an art major.",
    "Yes , definitely!",
    "A great introduction to printmaking, good for people who have never printed before and for those who are more experienced. We learned screenprinting and wood block printing, and there always seemed to be enough time to finish projects without working too much outside of class, which was nice. The time commitment is pretty big - six hours a week in class - but since you get most of your work done in that time it's not too bad. The whole class is just a series of projects and critiques, designed to help you explore the materials and your own artistic ideas. I really enjoyed it - this was a fifth class for me and I found it pretty chill.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone with a bit of experience\/talent in art looking to learn new and exciting techniques.",
    "Yes, it was exciting to learn new techniques. The print studio is an amazing place and you can come in during extra hours and just experiment and have fun. Alex and Felipe are kind and creative people who are great to learn from. You can basically take this class anywhere artistically so you have to think about where but that's pretty exciting.",
    "Yes, I think Printmaking is a valuable skill for any artist and the class really does provide individuals with plenty of opportunity to experiment."
