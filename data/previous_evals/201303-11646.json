    "If you're interested in the topic and like physics, take it. If not, don't.",
    "A lot more physics and a lot less weather and climate than I expected. There are a small number of interesting concepts, but I came out with much less knowledge and understanding of our climate system than I wanted or expected. The physics and math part is not impossible, but definitely challenging for anyone who is rusty with those topics, especially because there is minimal guidance for the problem sets and the topics tested on the exams seemed to come out of left field. It was a constant struggle. I would not recommend this course to the average person, especially not if you are just looking for a science credit. There are easier and more interesting Geology orSC credit classes out there.",
    "This class is a great overview of the dynamics and mechanics of climate and weather systems. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a decent physics and calculus background with an interest in these topics.",
    "It's a challenging class. G&G 140 should be taken before or concurrently... it definitely puts things in perspective.",
    "Awesome class if you feel comfortable with basic physics and partial derivatives. Math 120 is not actually a requirement; from what I could tell, you just had to understand partial derivatives and the concept of divergence. Anyhow, I would take this class if your major involves the atmosphere or climate (e.g. environmental things), but you should be aware that if you don't like math, you won't like this course. Also if your major doesn't involve the atmosphere or climate, don't take this course thinking it's an introduction; that's what 140 is for.",
    "If you are looking for a class that teaches you the concepts and some math and physics behind atmospheric dynamics, then this class is not for you. Physics of climate weather is much more like a math or physics class than an earth science course. But if you're looking for math and physics intensive look into how radiation, radiative transfer, large-scale dynamics and wind work, this course should be right up your alley.",
    "It's a good class. The material is complicated, but Boos does a good job in explaining it so that you understand it. It is also very interesting material.",
    "A small lecture (about 15-20 students, including several grad students) in fall 2013. Covers selected topics in meteorology and climatology- not a cohesive survey of climate. Taught at the level of upper undergraduate\/early graduate. Lots of vector math- if you took multivariable calculus and have had exposure to ordinary differential equations, you will be fine, but expect to be challenged. When taught by Prof. Boos, there were only 5 psets, weighted at 40% of the total grade, which was a bit frustrating. Class was taught from two textbooks, although lectures followed almost exactly the main book. Since we only read selected chapters from each book, this could get a little confusing, especially since the secondary book was taught at a much higher level of depth than our class, so we ended up really skimming through the chapters we covered. I would recommend this class to someone interested in weather and\/or climate, who doesn't want to take the intro G&G class (GG140) (or has already taken it). It was not the most organized class, but Prof. Boos was always on hand inside and outside of class to answer questions and explain things again. Lectures made nice use of blackboard writing and slides combined."
