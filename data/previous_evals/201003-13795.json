Rather than providing real skills, I feel that instead, it provided an introduction to negotiation and conflict resolution topics. That said, I think this was a very interesting class that really made me think about the way environmental issues are approached.",
    "There was very little time to cover a great deal of material. The late Monday hour sometimes made class a bit more difficult. The professor was always very attentive to student needs and ideas.

    "The opportunity to learn about a subject that is not often formally taught.",
    "The subject matter - few people have the skills to manage and\/or understand processes. This needs to be continued and expanded beyond a one-credit course.",

    "The flexibility of the course design, as well as the instructor.",
    "Gave us a valuable framework of analyzing environmental issues that I haven't seen in other classes, from the perspective of groups' interests, sources of tension\/conflict, power, and also gave us a number of useful tools and resources that could definitely be applied in our work in the future. I think we will notice the value of this class in the future when we actually are dealing with conflicts or negotiations, and Ona offered to be available to discuss these issues down the line. I also enjoyed the simulations and case studies and that Ona was able to fit so many themes into a very limited timeframe.",

    "The materials in the class were presented well and offered very useful tools for practitioners.",

I felt like I walked away with a clear skillset. Mock negotiation was extremely useful. I learned a great deal from Ona and really appreciated her coming to FES. Thanks so much!",

   "comments": [
    "The instructor wanted to cover a lot of topics during a short amount of time (only 5 classes). As a result, we covered a lot of things in very little depth. I think it would have been more helpful to pick fewer topics and delve deeply into them.I did not find the homeworks to be very helpful. They may have been helpful to the instructor and TA but I didn't learn from them.The class was also taught towards conducting community meetings because that is the instructor's specialty. I would have liked to cover other types of negotiations apart from community meetings like country-country negotiations, classmate group work issues, etc.",
    "There was a lot of conversation about very little information. The instructors aversion to lecturing limited the amount of new information that we could discuss.",
    "I thought this class was going to be more about negotiations, in terms of negotiating your angle. I wish the lessons were less about hiring an third party facilitator and more about resolving conflicts on your own.Also, the time and location were challenging. Having a class start so late in the evening made it hard to focus during.",
    "The discussion session is kind of pointless",
    "Classes often felt unstructured. Instructor expressed willingness to shape around student interests, but given little feedback in such a large group setting this often led to an \"I don't know... what do you want to do today?\" feel to the class.",
    "I think that the assignments could be modified or better described. The flexibility was nice, but I may have gotten more out of another type of assignment. I can't think of what this would be... just my thoughts.",
    "Need more than a sampling - have required discussion\/TA sessions, to provide arenas for additional discussion and simulation.",
    "The material covered is more conducive to extended class time - to begin to apply what we were discussing, longer sessions would have been helpful. Would it be possible to include a weekend \"retreat\" in addition to the weekly meetings?",
    "The teaching method should be improved, so that students are really challenged by the concepts of negotiation and conflict resolution. more practical exercises with teams and discussions could be an alternative.",
    "Spending less time talking about what we want to look at, and more time delving into what the instructor thinks is important.",
    "Perhaps lectures could be more structured and flow a bit faster. It could also help tie more targeted readings that people do beforehand to exercises in more of the classes. For the negotiation simulation (which was my favorite part of the class), I think this worked pretty well. However, the readings that involved lists or explanations of processes (e.g. conflict assessment, running meetings) were less helpful. It would be more helpful for readings to give background information about a case and how the tools of assessment and mediation etc were applied to the case. Then the more prosaic lists could just be resources we could reference in our own time. I also think we could use some detailed case studies from other countries, either developed ordeveloping.",
    "More specific case studies should be examined in class.",
    "Because the class needed to be completed a shortened time frame, we didn't have a chance to go into depth with some of the negotiation concepts. I think this class would make an excellent MODS choice. Similar conflict and negotiation courses offer 3- to 4- day training workshops.",
    "More discussion of real life situations, and a little less simulation. Also, if there is going to be a simulation, allow more time for it to fully develop?",
    "It's hard to really grasp the concepts without being able to practice all of them in class time.",
    "Perhaps fitting more information into each course since I think we only met 5 times. Perhaps making the course longer.",
    "It would have been great if we had had textbooks or similar, maybe a reading packet?",
    "- Better format and classroom set up. We oftentimes couldn't hear the instructor because she was so soft spoken.- The pace of the class was slow and low key which is hard during a night class because people are already tired\/sleepy.- Use a projector or powerpoint presentation instead of flip charts to keep track of ideas in front of the classroom (these were hard to see and read in a large auditorium setting)",
    "It is hard to have a long class late at night, especially when dinner is not provided.",
    "The time the class is held - at the inhuman hour of dinner time on the first day of the week. When food was provided it was better.",
    "It would be great to not scheduled on Monday evenings for 3 hours.",
    "It's a course in progress--not sure the once weekly, 2.5 hour, dinnertime class was the best format.",
    "It is hard to manage this type of course with more than 25 people. It should have been split in two groups of 25 instead of one of 50.",
    "1. Though great, it will be helpful to have some more structure to the syllabus",
    "The course could improve the organization and its structure. Though it was built to meet student's expectations of the topics that were interesting to the class, the lectures could be more organized.",
    "Improve on the time allocated to the course. Make it a semester long seminar.",
    "The teacher did provide us with readings, but the allotted time for the class did not allow us to go through them as we should have. I believe that better extra material would be multimedia and perhaps one book we can use. Otherwise, putting all the lessons in ONE PDF could be also useful, this would give us only one place to look for all the information, see how they connect and help us organize our thoughts. The handouts were helpful but were hard to follow.I understand that the teacher was not a lecturer, and so she was more comfortable reading from the handout. The lessons would have been more enjoyable if she had just used that time to provide examples from her experiences, rather than going point by point on the hand out. That lost some of the students' attention.If the class can be upgraded to 3 credits I feel it would be really interesting to make a group project where the learned skills can be used in the real world.",
    "I think the transfer of specific skills could be improved. With more simulations and a focus on a smaller number of topics, I think students would feel like they were walking away with more hard skills. Also, I think students would get more out of the class if it was at the beginning of the semester rather than the end when work from other classes is starting to get really intense.",
    "Different time of day, and perhaps earlier in the semester. I found it very difficult to feel attentive and motivated for a long evening class at that point in the semester.",
    "Perhaps a bit more structure to the written responses, not only to provide guidance, but to hone in on key issues, topics, etc."
