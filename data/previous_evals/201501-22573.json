    "You know how this goes. For some of the details: As it stands now juniors and seniors both take this for a letter grade; sophomores take it under pass\/fail. The requirements for the class are pretty simple; all you need to do is write a one page project proposal, a 2-4 page midterm report, an ~10-15 page final report, and present your research in a 15 minute presentation in front of the rest of the research class. Overall, pretty standard for a research for credit course!",
    "This isn't a course in the normal sense, as it doesn't meet regularly throughout the semester. Each student finds a faculty adviser under which to conduct physics research, at the end of the semester producing a report and presentation on what he or she actually did and accomplished. Most are enrolled in order to satisfy the requirements of the physics major. Unless your research adviser is very strict, this is almost an entirely self-motivated endeavor, and I recommend keeping up on your research instead of leaving it to the last couple of weeks of the semester. It takes an appreciable amount of time to get results and produce a well-done report and presentation.",
    "Pick a good project; you'll be living with it for a while. Can be a really great experience. Know in advance how available your advisor will be; mine was very busy (but super helpful when they were available ... also I didn't have a grad student or post doc to go to for help).",
    "It is what it is.",
    "A research experience you have to do if you're a physics major. I had a bad time because I didn't particularly like the topic that I chose or the people that I was working with. Make sure you choose those things carefully. And, even though it's just research, it will be more work than you anticipate. Trust me.",
    "You spend two days a week in lab working on something you like, and then you write 10 pages on it. It's great.",
    "Research for credit. You get out of it what you put in. Good opportunity if you take advantage of it and find a lab you like\/is willing to mentor you.",
    "Required for majors. I wish I've taken a semester of it Junior year.",
    "A great exposure to physics research. Your experience will depend almost entirely on your lab group and project but a few things should hold generally: -Carve out a set amount of time for lab each week. If you aren't disciplined, independent research is the first thing to slip and it's easy to get behind. -When searching for a lab group, consider not just the focus of their research, but the culture of the group and the type of work available to undergrads. Things like the size and stage of the project will affect your experience a lot, and are difficult to get a feel for without speaking to people currently involved. -Take care to find group with good mentorship, from the PI on down to the grad students you'll be working with. There's a lot to think about when choosing a project, and it's a totally different type of work from problem sets, but if you put in the effort it will be a rewarding experience."
