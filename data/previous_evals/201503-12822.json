    "Introduction to modern architecture with a focus on Yale and New Haven.",
    "I would recommend this course if you would like to have a survey of the field of architecture and an \"awareness tour\" of sorts of the School of Architecture and its facilities. The course was an intellectually stimulating one and a great opportunity for freshmen to gain exposure to architectural design and theory without having to commit to workload or rigor of an actual architecture course. If you are seeking a comprehensive seminar strictly on modern architecture, then consider taking a course in the School of Architecture.",
    "Since the intro to the architecture major course sequence isnt open to freshmen, this new freshman seminar is a great way to test the architectural waters before committing to the major as a sophomore. I knew absolutely nothing about architecture, or even art history, coming into this class. But Prof. Britton and Abdul (TA brilliant and incredible) gave us so many opportunities to study architecture from different angles. The class started off slowly for me, because I just dont find the history of architecture and planning of Yale and New Haven that interesting, but what made the course worthwhile for me were the guest speakers (past students, graduate students, professionals, professors, curators, experts, Dean Stern, etc.), field trips (woodshop, YUAG, YCBA renovation site, Glass House, Grace Farms, Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects), and most of all the student presentations. In our class of 15-16, each student had to give a 7-10 minute presentation on his or her midterm research paper (we were able to choose whatever topic in architecture we wanted), and these in-class presentations took up the last third\/half of the semester. I guess the quality of the class will depend on the composition of the class in future years, but I loved our class dynamic and some people chose fascinating research topics that sparked discussions we otherwise wouldnt have had if we continued to focus on traditional Euro-centric architectural history and theory. We had a particularly socially conscious class (or maybe thats just Yale), because a lot of the topics revolved around the role of privilege in architecture (affordable housing, schools, museums, Native American reservations, egalitarian city planning, etc.) and other sociocultural impacts of architecture (prisons, cemeteries, memorials, etc.). I loved being able to research any topic I wanted for the midterm paper, as well as the flexibility of the final project and what media we could use. Prof. Britton could be a bit difficult to work with, as she can be both picky and ambiguous at the same time, but shes willing to meet frequently, and Abduls advice and guidance were extremely helpful supplements. If youre interested in architecture at all, whether as a potential major or simply a discipline, I would highly recommend this class, because there arent many other opportunities as comprehensive as this seminar to explore architecture that are available during your freshman year.",
    "This was a great freshman seminar that exposed me to many new ideas and brought on great discussions, both inside and outside of the classroom. There was a good mix of lectures, discussions, and presentations, and the course introduces you to a variety of 20th century architectural ideas. It is well planned for people who have not had much exposure to architecture in the past; it might move a bit slowly for people who already have extensive architecture experience. The lectures are a little bit slow and monotonous, and sometimes it feels like the main idea is lost within the history of the buildings. In addition, the course sometimes feels as if it meanders around a little bit too much, without really getting to the main point. Things that are NOT covered (that I thought would be): * Architectural styles through history * Famous architects around the world * Modern skyscraper architecture * Evolution of the meaning of city Things that ARE covered very well: * Meaning and purpose of architecture * Ideas and theories behind some architectural choices * Architects that came from Yale * Architecture OF Yale * Life of an architect Professor Britton does a great job in providing a lot of different options for exploring architecture in this seminar, and I truly appreciated it! Highly recommend for those who are interested in architecture but don't have much prior experience.",
    "Arch 005 is a good introduction to the Architecture program at Yale.",
    "The course started out very systematic and cohesive, and ended sort of disjointed. We started with a thorough study of the planning of New Haven and Yale, and dove into the philosophy of space and architecture. Each week we had readings, a written response, and in-class discussions. I liked that systematic approach. Towards the middle of the semester, it seemed we were improvising on the syllabus, adding random (although important) architects to our study, but doing less discussion. The last month of classes consisted of student presentations which, while interesting, were on quite random topics. I thought it was a fair class with a reasonable workload, and a certainly got a great foundation in the study of architecture and planning, but the problem was that I learned \"a little about a lot\" -- I think the course lost focus and we stopped diving deeply into topics. Still, I would recommend it as a great foundational class, with the opportunity for rich discussion and personal exploration into a topic of your choice for midterm and final papers.",
    "Yes and no. If you are absolutely set on being an architecture major, and are on the design track, and want to get a history and theory credit out of the way, this is a solid choice. If you are on the fence about architecture and know little about the technical aspects of the field, wait until the intro sequence sophomore year; you will get a much better taste of what architecture is holistically then.",
    "I would recommend ARCH 005 to any student. It is an architecture class, but you don't have to have any knowledge of architecture beforehand. The course goes over interesting material and teaches you about a time period of architecture that tends to be under-appreciated in today's world.",
    "This course solidified my interest in architecture by providing me with a great overview of the architectural 'Greats' and allowing me to see the ready integration of this field with others, namely urban studies.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend the course to freshman with an interest but little exposure to architecture. I'd warn the student that if they are expecting an urban studies course, this is not it, but as a sampling of modern architecture was a good course.",
    "A good introductory course to architecture, with emphasis on Yale architecture and the work and influences of the architects behind it. Recommended for people set on or strongly leaning towards studying architecture, but not for those who are not interested in pursuing it in the future.",
    "If you are interested in actually pursuing architecture in the future then probably take it, but if you just have a passing interest, there are probably better classes. This class mostly spoke to architects that have some connection to Yale, which is limiting, for sure, but did also provide a solid foundation in Yale's architectural history which is quite interesting."
