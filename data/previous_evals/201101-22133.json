   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It is much easier than L3, but I was not prepared by my high school for L3. I had a good time in this class, and kind of looked forward to it each day.",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "learn a lot of chinese",
    "Yes, you must take this class",
    "AMAZING! Great way to continue, Mu and Chen laoshi are phenomenal!",
    "I enjoyed this as much or more than CHNS 130. No more weekly voice recordings; you do dictation homework instead which is good practice for the dictation quiz. It's always hard really getting into studying and speaking Chinese (or possibly any foreign language) while at Yale, but spend a summer or a semester in China and you'll be hooked.",
    "Take it only if you are planning on going to China. Much the same as Level 3 (Chinese 130). Same book and repetition in classes.",
    "Studying a language in a classroom can never be as good as learning it through immersion, but if you can't go to China than this is the only other option. Generally, this class requires a lot of time and effort,but if you put in the work you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "It's a solid course on learning Chinese. It's easy if you put in the time each day to practice and review. Don't let the calendar fool you--it seems like only bits of work each day, but it adds up because they take a while to complete. A little bit too much of repetition in class, and you're bound to fall asleep if you take a 9:25am section...",
    "Chinese 140 is very similar to Chinese 130. Chinese 140 is really about learning a lot of vocabulary and grammar patterns to reach the advanced level of Chinese. Although not always a lot of fun, there is a lot of vocabulary covered, which is very important. I would recommend the course because it is key to spend the time dedicated to building off of the beginner base established in the L1 and L2 levels.",
    "Intensive pace, great teacher and overall very exciting course",
    "Very good class, although think twice about Chinese in general unless you're serious about learning it. It's a class that requires a lot of work over a long period of time to pay dividends, although having the level of access to China that fluency in Chinese gives you is worth it.",
    "I'm a freshman who placed into L3 after studying Chinese over my gap year, and am planning on continuing to study Chinese for probably the rest of my time at Yale. So this was a great intermediate step for me, and I feel like I really consolidated and improved upon the foundation I had from living in China. But I don't think anyone should take Chinese just to fulfill the language requirement and stop after 140...this is supposed to be a stepping stone to greater things. I really was bothered by the difference between students who were actually invested in learning Chinese, and students who were trying to fulfill the requirement and didn't take it seriously. There's no point in taking Chinese just to fulfill the requirement, and you definitely shouldn't stop after this course, every Chinese student needs to spend an extended period of time in China.",
    "Chinese is a great language, so I would recommend this class to someone who was interested in Chinese. The class can be tedious, but overall expanded my Chinese a lot.",
    "Excellent class if you are dedicated to learning Chinese. Atmosphere is very relaxed but you get a lot done during the semester.",
    "Chinese 140 is hard, but reasonable. Take it if you really want to learn Chinese. It's a good, instructive course.",
    "Definitely take this class if you took L3 Chinese. It is taught in the same way and has the same workload. If you are looking to continue your study of Chinese, this is a great class.",
    "Chinese 140 is just the continuation of Chinese 130. I would really recommend this class if you have gotten this far. Frankly speaking, studying Chinese just up to L3 isn't enough, as L3 in Chinese is at a lower level compared to, say, L3 French or Spanish. The class is pretty enjoyable, and Mu Laoshi and Chen Laoshi make them quite fun as well. Overall a really good class to take.",
    "If you are willing to put in the work and pull a few all nighters I would definitely recommend Chinese 140 because you do learn.",
    "Lots of class time and lots of little assignments. I would recommend the class to someone dedicated to learning Chinese."
