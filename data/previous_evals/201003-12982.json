    "A rewarding and excellent L1 course in French to set the foundation for further study of the language. There is quite a lot of work, but you will not be disappointed. You will learn A LOT",
    "Yes, but be prepared to do a lot of work (in terms of practicing) in your free time..",
    "Great class. Great professor. Good amount of work, though if you keep up with it it's honestly not too bad.",
    "I took this class to learn my fourth language, and I definitely loved it. It's a lot of work, but as long as you do it all, you're fine.",
    "I would recommend French 110 to a dedicated student.",
    "Yes, learning a language by immersion is definitely difficult but its the best to learn as much as possible in such a short time. I took french in high school but I feel like I've learned more in this last semester than in all of my high school french classes combined.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to students who do not have any or little exposure to French. I had taken some French in high school and I still found this course very hard to keep up with."
