    "Interesting course. Hard to teach \"lab methods\" in a lecture setting. Liked the student presentations, learned a lot from presenting.",
    "Class was informal and informative, Dr. Yu was very knowledgeable",
    "great course",
    "This course provided a good overview of important topics in molecular epi. A strong background in biology and epidemiology is critical to getting the most out of the lectures since material builds off fundamental topics in these disciplines.",
    "The course is good, but could be improved by clearer teaching objectives and more structure. Sometimes, it is a little vague what the course wants us to focus on.",
    "Good course to introduce these concepts.",
    "great! maybe slides can give more details about practical public health assessments instead of just outlines",
    "I liked how Dr Yu chose articles that used the specific principles taught in the course",
    "I was confused by this class due to the lack of feedback from the professor but the concepts were taught well."

    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0Good instruction. Knows the material very well. Maybe the class should have a lab component? Didn't think the test reflected material learned in class well, but again hard to test and teach lab methods without doing them.",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0Dr. Yu was very friendly and easygoing, answered questions well and was aware of students' understanding of material",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0good teacher",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0Dr. Yu was responsive to student inquiries and very knowledgeable. At times, lecture notes were difficult to follow, but overall, I enjoyed attending lectures.",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0Great work!",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0very helpful",
    "Instructor: Herbert Yu \u00a0strengths: very helpful, generous with his time, very understanding",

    "n\/a",
    "if you like genetics or have research interests in the area, this is a must!if you have minimum interest, I am not sure how you will ever use this class...the skills taught are fairly specific to molecular epi, not too many general epi concepts..",
    "The format was confusing and feedback on assignments was minimal but the concepts of molecular epi are clearly presented.",
    "This course is a very good overview of molecular epidemiology and I would recommend it to a fellow student."
