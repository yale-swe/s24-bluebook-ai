    "I love this course. I think this seminar, unlike any other, has proven to me what \"reciprocity\" means. It was all too clear how many students in the class came prepared for each discussion, and Ali was great at turning classes into mini-lectures when it was clear debate would not happen because students didn't read enough to discuss the ideas she put forth. I don't think it's the fault of the planning at all, though; there were wonderfully planned classes EVERY WEEK, and the arrangement of the readings did a good job integrating different methodologies into the same day. Shop it, if you can!"

    "This course gave me a wonderful insight into the international human rights for sexuality world, which I hope to be my career path. This course brought different methodologies into the room, and it was fascinating to have my ideas challenged, to defend my position and methodology, and to hear other wonderful positions that I might be able to participate it in my own some day."
