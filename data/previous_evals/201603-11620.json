    "Good professor but the coursework is difficult.",
    "This course was very strong in the way that grammar was taught--I really understood each concept before we moved on, but we didn't spend so long on one thing that I was bored. Although we spoke a lot, we may have read out of the textbook a little too much during class; it would be nice to do more informal exercises to practice grammar concepts rather than reading straight out of the textbook (even though this would be more difficult). Overall, I thought the course was very well taught, it just would have been nice to try speaking outside of scripted dialogue a little more.",

    "Yes but they should know the amount of work it is.",
    "I would recommend this course, but only to people who are not afraid of a challenge. Russian is very difficult, and Russian grammar is very complex. Although they taught it very well and in a really understandable way, there is still a lot to keep track of, and if you start to slack off you can fall way behind. But it was a fun course, and it definitely helped me improve way more quickly than I was expecting to.",
    "Yes. The class is very well designed and the instructors are quite dedicated."
