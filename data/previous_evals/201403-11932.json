    "I would recommend Spanish 120 to any student. It's taught very well and is interesting.",
    "I absolutely would recommend both taking the class and taking it from Sra. Asensio.",
    "Do not underestimate the workload of the introductory language courses. That being said, however, the nightly homework isn't extremely difficult or challenging, but will eat up a good amount of time, especially when there are some additional readings or the presentation to prepare. In the end, the daily classes and regular homework payoff, and you will find that your language skills have improved greatly by the end of the semester.",
    "It's a difficult class because you cover so much material, but if you work really hard and study every detail of the grammar lessons, you can get really high grades on the tests and learn a lot in the class. The teachers want you to succeed and will help you if you make use of the resources and office hours provided. I found it really useful to work with a partner outside of class while studying for exams.",
