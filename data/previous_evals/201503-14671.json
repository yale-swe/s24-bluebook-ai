   "comments": [
    "It's a great course, you should take it.",
    "Phase transitions, Renormalizaation Group. Covers \"recent\" topics such as BKT transition. Depending on the work of the students, this could be very useful for them.",
    "An excellent, insightful course regarding phase transitions and critical phenomena. Would highly recommend to those interested in the general subject matter. I would argue that it is an absolute must for condensed matter\/solid state\/materials (theorists or experimentalists). I wish I would have taken this class earlier in my career.",
    "Phys 628 is a great course, and the methods you see are useful across the board in modern physics. The intuition behind renormalization group transformations was very useful in quantum field theory, and the discussion of phase transitions easily generalized to things like the Higgs mechanism. I highly recommend the course even if you have no intention of going into statistical physics.",
    "Interesting course with a great instructor but a bit slow.",
    "If you plan to study anything related to magnets, you definitely want to take this course, because that's all we studied for the entire semester.",
    "An overview of ways of thinking about phase transitions, and techniques for analyzing systems which exhibit them. Highly recommended. Interesting subject matter, not horrendously difficult or particularly tedious, taught by perhaps the best lecturer in the department.",
    "i would recommend it to people who are interested in phase transition, because this course is highly relevant; otherwise, no."

   "comments": [
    "In the intellectual way.",
    "Phase transitions is ubiquitous in various systems. It does not seem to be directly related to my work, but knowledge from different fields may always prove to be useful in the future.",
    "As mentioned earlier, I wish I would have taken this course earlier so that it could contribute more to my research. However, I have already started thinking about and applying the ideas to my own work. Allows me to engage in the literature on phase transitions, superconductors, superfluids, magnets, in fundamentally new and more interesting ways. I have no doubt that what I have learned in this class will contribute to my future research.",
    "Concepts, where I had some superficial knowledge\/idea, are now clear.",
    "I now understand mean field theory, and have a provisional understanding of some of the corrections people made to mean field theory in the cases where it breaks down, at least when it comes to magnets. I understand phase transitions on a mathematical level, but not a conceptual level.",
    "As I have taken this class before, the course didn't deepen my knowledge of Statistical Mechanics. It was however a good reminder\/practice of what I have seen before. Also, this course did not contribute to my dissertation\/research."
