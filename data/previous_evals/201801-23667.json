    "Ramos-Ruano was a great professor, but the structure of this course was immensely stressful and difficult. Class time should be made more collaborative and homework should be assigned where it is actually constructive. Often the assignments were so time consuming in a busy week many students did not have any time to actually study independently or learn the material.",
    "Could be improved by adding more of a focus on oral practice. I don't feel confident in my Spanish speaking skills.",
    "Weakness is that there isn't a ton of practice talking, conversing in spanish",
    "Strengths include speaking regularly",
    "Strength-in class speaking Weakness-too much busy work",
    "the course is overall difficult and some of the activities such as the readings were a bit too difficult for a beginner.",
    "The course was taught very well and through a dedicated course packet, all sections of SPAN 120 were on the same schedule and the quality of instruction between sections did not seem to be an issue. I felt like the course spent too much time covering Miguel Cervantes and Don Quixote.",
    "weakness - professor spoke very fast and it was unclear to students what her goal was often times. strength - speaking with other students often"

    "No, save yourself. Run. Avoid the Spanish department at all costs. I don't mean this to disparage the faculty. The professors I've had have been great. But with the average Yale student's busy schedule, grade expectations, and opportunities to support further study, taking Spanish at Yale is a huge mistake. It will unnecessarily sap tremendous amounts of your time. It will still sink your GPA. Several students dropped this course halfway through, causing them to lose their L1 credit from last semester, just to avoid the abyss this course would create in their lives and on their transcripts. Do yourself several favors and just take one of the obscure, easy languages.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 120 with professor Ramos-Ruano because she is a very passionate professor, probably the best professor for 120. However, if you want a professor who grades very leniently, look elsewhere.",
    "People who have to take it will take it",
    "yes because spanish is spoken in many places around the world",
    "Yes",
    "I believe this course was much more difficult than L1 so for students who are either jumping into L2 or are really taking Spanish as a new language it is pretty difficult.",
    "I would recommend the SPAN 120 with Julianna Ramos-Ruano, as she is an excellent professor dedicated to student learning. The course itself is great, however at times it had trouble balancing between material appropriate for L2 and what may be more advanced.",
    "Yes the course, not the professor"
