   "comments": [
    "More work than a 1\/2 credit course should be, but not to bad. Obviously, don't take it unless you have to.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you need it for your major or pre-med requirements. That said, the second semester of orgo lab was far more enjoyable than any other science course I have taken at Yale. Because we were already familiar with most of the experimental procedures, we were given a lot of independence in the lab, which made for a relaxing, enjoyable experience.",
    "It is a good class to practice to practice organic lab techniques.",
    "You get to apply all of the techniques first semester of orgo lab and do real synthesis reactions. It's better than gen chem labs.",
    "The most enjoyable chemistry lab course that I have taken thus far. It nicely complements what we learn in 221. You get to apply the techniques that you learn in 222L to interesting syntheses. The process of writing EPs and Lab Notes can be time consuming and mechanical. As a consequence, I would not advise taking two labs concurrently.",
    "Obviously you'll take it because you have to. But I liked second semester a whole lot better than the first. Maybe the labs were more interesting since we were actually applying what we learned last semester to real synthesis problems. Or maybe I was just much more comfortable with the procedures, since we already had a semester's worth of experience. Most likely both. I liked my TA (Nick) a lot better too, he was more encouraging and a fair grader. DiMeglio changed up the playlist from last semester too, so overall I had a fantastic experience! The lab final was just harder than last year though.",
    "lots of mindless work. not too hard could get tricky. you probably have to take it anyway so be prepared.",
    "If the student needs to take Chem 221, he needs to take Chem 223L-- it's not an option.",
    "Chem 223 is a good course - I would recommend it to another student. It is well taught and pretty much as painless and pleasant as a lab class gets.",
    "Take IT!",
    "This is probably one of the better lab courses you will take while at Yale. The reaction and techniques learned generally complement what's learned in lecture and the workload is far less that most labs and appropriate for half a credit.",
    "I feel much more comfortable with the second part of organic chemistry lab than I felt with the first part. The course is also more interesting as we start to do more synthesis, and it is always exciting to collect your final product. It also well prepares us to do scientific writing and analysis of testing results. I will recommend taking it along with the organic chemistry class.",
    "Does not involve a lot of thinking, is pretty unengaging, but is also not a lot of work or very difficult. Lots of repetitive assignments and busy work. If you have to take it, you'll get through it with a minimum of stress, but I wouldn't take it for fun.",
    "Yes, this lab course is fun and low-stress. Just be careful of tricky grading schemes.",
    "Great course. The labs are more interesting than the first semester because you actually get to use techniques to synthesize compounds. The lab manual is very helpful and the expectations are clear and reasonable. You probably have to take it anyway, but I found this class enjoyable.",
    "This is a great lab! One of the best labs I've taken at Yale - a fair amount of work and interesting experiments. Enjoy!",
    "yes, it is much more interesting and fun than the first semester.",
    "Chem 223L is a good lab course with fair expectations about the amount work required. While lab reports could be tedious, they required little actual thought. The atmosphere in lab in generally laid-back and not very stressful. I am a slow worker, but I never felt pressed for time. The final exam at the end of the semester is very fair; all of the questions are drawn from those given at the end of each lab module.",
    "Great! I'll really miss it...the only downside was never knowing how I was doing in the class because we were never returned any of our lab reports.",
    "Definitely take CHEM 223L. It builds seamlessly upon all the techniques and concepts from CHEM 222L and combines them into bigger and more rewarding synthesis labs. The format of the course is the same as CHEM 222L, with EP's, LN's, PL's, and one or two full reports, and the only new technique you learn is 1H NMR, but the way NMR is covered in lab really helps with the lecture. Also, if you have a terrible professor for second-semester orgo lecture, the lab helps tremendously. I learned more about some of these reactions from the lab manual and lab textbook than I did from lecture. And the exam for CHEM 223L is extremely well written and fair; if you did all the required work throughout the semester, you should have no trouble acing the exam. This is one of the few labs I will actually miss."
