    "I would recommend the class - although it certainly won't teach you everything there is to know, it's a great introduction and helps you begin to think of and hear music in a different manner than the casual listener.",
    "A lot of fun, really hard if you don't have any music background but not impossible, and if you have a music background\/do music currently this will give you a solid theoretical backing. I play an instrument but definitely benefited a lot from taking this class. And it's not too tough if you have a musical background.",
    "If you know how to read music, you will likely find 110 to be easy. However, the higher level of theory, 218, will probably be too difficult for you if you don't know much theory. I'd recommend taking 110 in that case because you'll still learn something, and it will be at an enjoyable pace. It's a fun class, at least with Esther!",
    "It's a good course with a good hammering down of the foundations of music theory. Great course to learn more about music if you have little past experience."
