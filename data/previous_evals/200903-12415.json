   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend! You will never be bored and the workload is very manageable.",
    "Highly, highly recommend. I usually don't fill out these surveys, so the fact that I am is a testament to how good of a class I thought this was. Everything you'd want in a seminar - interesting subject matter, interesting reading, good discussions, and above all, a professor who knows how to hold it all together. McMeekin is a dynamic lecturer and really interested in what he's teaching. Quickest and most engaging two hours of my school week. And for the more practically minded students:the workload is not terribly heavy and he's a fairly forgiving grader.",
    "This course was fantastic: the subject matter was fascinating, the readings were always very good and interesting, and Professor McMeekin did a great job directing the seminar and providing feedback on work submitted for class. I would certainly recommend taking the Soviet Union course under him in the spring.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. Although the reading list seems daunting,the books which Professor McMeekin chose are informative and interesting. You will learn a lot from the class discussion alone!",
    "Would definitely recommend this. There isn't really a cohesive thesis that links the entire syllabus together; but it presents a lot of interesting information. McMeekin selects the reading not only for the material content, but also for how well-written and interesting the text is. The work is definitely manageable, and discussion is generally lively and engaging.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Turkey and Europe is a really good class. The strengths are McMeekin who is a really sharp professor and the syllabus which is packed with excellent readings. That being said class discussions can be off topic meaning that sometimes you will walk in having read about turkey in the start of WWI and he will be talking about British politics or something. That being said, usually such tagent are interesting, it's just not the class for firey debates or people who love to participate.In generally, there was a one-page reading response each week and a 15 page paper at the end. Everyone who writes responses has already seen their final grade so take that into consideration while reading the review. It's seems like in general he is a generous grader.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. The class is interesting and covers topics that you usually would not come across in other classes. The structure of the class is split half in lecture form, half in discussion. Professor McMeekin is wonderful and lively which makes this one of the best seminars I have taken at Yale. The workload is also very manageable.",
    "This was a really great course. I learned a TON about an entirely unfamiliar era of history. The assigned readings were perfect -- extremely enjoyable and informative. Professor McMeekin kept class interesting and fun, though I sometimes (rarely) wished that he would keep his tangents more to a minimum so that we could spend more time on the topic at hand.The workload was very fair, and Professor McMeekin was very forthcoming with offering help and advice outside of class. Overall, again, a great class."
