    "Take it! This class has a relatively heavy reading load, at least by my standards (usually one book a week and some critical essays), but Professor Pravinchandra is an enthusiastic, knowledgeable section leader and the literature is wonderful. Besides the reading the workload is very fair, perhaps evenlight: two essays, six one- to two-page reading responses, and a fun project. It will affect the way you view the world around you and expose you to some great novels. The opportunity to read The God Of Small Things for a class should not be passed up.",
    "This is a solid, very engaging introduction to 'postcolonial' theory and literature coming from the English-speaking world. There's a lot of reading (usually at least one novel a weak, plus some theoretical essays) - you probably won't be able to do it all, but you'll want to, both because the reading list is very interesting and because it's a pretty discussion-based. I was kind of an anomaly in the class, because I was both a sophomore (this is a Junior English seminar) and this was the first English class I've taken at Yale. Discussion got pretty intense at times - if you don't have a lot of background with literary theory, you might feel a little behind - but, unlike a lot of seminars, I found people managed to be opinionated without being section a-holes, so I learned a lot from our discussion. Papers were pretty free-form, and Professor Pravinchandra is very cool and passionate about her field, though can seem a bit flaky at times. I'd definitely recommend this class to someone who's willing to put a lot of work into it and study literature which is not otherwise very prominent in Yale's English department.",
    "Great reading list and professor, but be prepared to talk a lot about post-colonial studies as a field. It can be a little frustrating at times, but overall a good class.",
    "Absolutely take it. No one else in Yale's english department is teaching stuff like this. It is radical and will make you the resident postcolonialist in all your other classes.",
    "I think most English majors should be required to take a course with this kind of theory and reading list. It's a good junior seminar because it will definitely advance the way you've been taught to think about English. Still, not the most wildly fascinating discussions in class and Prof Pravinchandra isn't incredibly inspiring.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a student interested both in reading great literature and in thinking about how it is politicized, both inside and outside the academy. As with all seminars, the success of the class will depend upon the students in it, but I don't think a lack of experience with the postcolonial should be considered a detraction. I had not even heard of the field before taking the course, and I feel that I got a lot out of it. Professor Pravinchandra strives to question and be questioned at every turn, and takes a serious interest in ensuring that her students are being engaged. You'll do the reading because you won't want to miss out on the great discussions.",
    "Postcolonial Studies is a phenomenal class and very unique within the English department. I had never taken a class focused on modern literature, much less postcolonial literature, so this course was quite difficult, but Professor Pravinchandra does a truly wonderful job when it comes to helping her students understand the subject matter and reading materials (and is very considerate regarding papers, though she isn't an easy grader). If she teaches this class again (as I hope she will!), I highly recommend you check it out, even if you think you have no interest in that area of English studies. The way that it is taught by Pravinchandra, it's hard not to become absolutely engrossed. Postcolonial Studies really changed the way I think about literature, for the best.",
    "Absolutely --- with the sole caveat that this class is a literature, not a theory, class"
