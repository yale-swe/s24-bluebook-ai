    "I would not recommend the course.",
    "This is an interesting class about Chinese film and modern history. Your writing skills will definitely improve with the weekly essays, but the workload is not small and the standards are set high. Take it, but make sure you have the time to put into it.",
    "It's a great course overall, even though the movie selection could be improved. The small class size and many assignments help you maintain a sophisticated level of Chinese. Key weakness was the subjective quizzes that frequently had very ambiguous and difficult questions.",
    "Take it if you want to watch movies, and don't mind having a lot of homework. Class discussions are fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chinese Through Film to other students. Kang Laoshi will demand a lot from you in terms of writing, reading comprehension and speaking skills but that is what every student of Chinese wants. This class has much more interesting lessons than the regular society readings you get in previous grammar classes. Kang Laohsi won't coddle you and he can be tough in his critique, but his class is one that you will feel glad having made it through.",
    "Take this class. It's not that hard and the material isn't boring."
