    "Great discussion about thorny questions that you might not have thought about before.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, and most of it is down to how incredible Prof. Kalmanovitz is. He assigns really great readings, and manages the seminar pretty well, although sometime I wish he called out people in seminar for making inane comments when adding to the discussion. I think he's a very fair grader, he'll call you out in your papers if he thinks you haven't put enough work into it, but rewards you when you do work hard. Every seminar starts with him summarizing the readings for the week, and having a back and forth initially with the person presenting for that week, and then with the entire class, though as discussion builds, he tends to remove himself from it, mostly acting to synthesize arguments.Take this class if you have any interest in the field",
    "The discussions and readings are fantastic and Pablo is great! It is definitely a pretty narrow topic, but if you think you'd be interested in it, you should definitely take this seminar - I promise you won't regret it!",
    "I came into Transitional Justice knowing almost nothing about it and left far more knowledgeable of its complexities and limitations. Although this class could get a little technical or tedious at times, I definitely learned a lot. Pablo was really sweet and great at guiding discussion. The structure of the class also really worked--we had a midterm paper, a final paper, and a reading response paper for one class that we chose to lead the discussion for. Pablo was also able to conclude our seminar in a really satisfying way, despite how frustrating and depressing the subject matter could be.",
    "As a student interested in justice systems and comparative politics, this class was a perfect fit and probably my favorite class this semester. Students were engaged, the workload was not overwhelming, and the projects (10 pg midterm, 20 pg case report) were very manageable. Of course, the best part is Professor Kalmanovitz himself. He is incredibly knowledgeable about transitional justice (and in fact, most IR topics) and incredibly kind. A great seminar.",
    "PLSC 425 was a solid course that used each session to delve deeper into the multiple components of transitional justice and its many issues. The structure of the course was great with a few people specializing and presenting on the readings each week. Discussions were a little less fluid, but there was more time to digest and rehash what wasstated, making for interesting discussion material. I would say that those who know little to nothing about transitional justice and are interested in the topic should shop the course to see if its right for them.",
    "Transitional Justice is a fascinating theme, and it is wonderful to have the opportunity to have a class to focus just on that theme. We briefly touched upon this topic in Post-Conflict Politics, so it was nice to spend some time on it. This is a rather niche topic, so make sure you really want to spend 12 weeks discussing it before you decide to take the course (it also helps if you have a country\/case study that you want to explore going in). Prof. Kalmanovitz is a great seminar leader, and is unfailingly friendly and helpful. It is definitely worth taking the class with him.",
    "Transitional Justice is likely a subject you've never studied which is why I would recommend it! I was looking for an seminar that would count for my major but also be interesting. It wasn't the best seminar I'd ever taken, so I wouldn't chose it over something you are more interested in. But as always seminars depend a lot on who is selected (my group was on the quite side). However, I learned a lot from the readings and enjoyed Pablo as a professor (though he can be tough grader, this was good for me\/pushed me to work harder). I suspect this class will only improve, so if you're interested in the subject, I would take it. With one response paper, midterm paper, and final, it was definitely manageable."
