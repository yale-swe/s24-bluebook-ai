    "Intermediate Chinese skills in speaking\/listening, reading, and writing.",

    "More speaking",

    "If you put in the work and love that the department puts into the course, you will reap the benefits.",
    "It is a lot of work, but it is necessary for the growth in the course.",
    "Strengths: very straightforward class, put in the work and participate in class and you'll do well weaknesses: none except your own",
    "The experience of the teacher was very helpful, she knew when to push, and how to keep people engaged day in day out. Classes moved quickly, and the tone was usually lively. The weaknesses was potentially the workload, it sometimes felt as if we were being stretched too thin and could've gained a better mastery of the material if we covered less in a given period of time."
