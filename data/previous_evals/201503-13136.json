   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to fellow students. I think that the course is a great way to learn a lot about quantitative methods in sociology in a relatively short period of time. I think the course is also a very encouraging and supportive environment for students who are new to statistics or other quantitative methods.",
    "While statistics can seem daunting, Dr. Maralani makes the material easy to digest and use in sociological situations. While the homework's push you beyond what you learn in class, the value of stretching your mind to accommodate those new questions (and interpret them substantively) cannot be overstated.",
    "- Best statistics course I've taken (and I've taken a few). Highly recommended. Great instructor."

   "comments": [
    "This course certainly helped me to gain experience with quantitative methods I hope to use in my research. I feel that the course has provided me with a strong foundation from which I can continue to develop and hone my quantitative analysis skills.",
    "My interests require an understanding of statistics. I am so glad that I took this class with Professor Maralani and her TFs as I now feel so much more able to use the power of population level data to understand the social world.",
    "- Very useful introduction to quantitative methods, though unlikely to be useful for my dissertation."
