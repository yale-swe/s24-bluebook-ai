    "yes.",
    "I would recommended it to those who have the right background",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Highly recommended.Very well-outlined and thoroughly taught course emphasizing fundamentals rather than more complex phenomena.",
    "I would summarize it as: a complete and deep study of the nature and charateristics of all kinds of intermolecular forces, with emphasis put in surface interactions.I would definitely recommend it to anyone working in a field where intermolecular forces and surface interactions play a role, but I probably would not to someone working in a totally unrelated field, since the class deals with a very specific topic.",
    "I strongly recommend this course. Students can gain a wide range of knowledge in surface and colloidal science, and get their presentation skills improved a great deal through this course."

    "I learned some things that I did not know about at all before taking the class, and which could be very useful in the near future for my research.",
    "My research topic is related with surface science. Learning this course can help me understand some papers more easily."
