    "The information and knowledge the class received in the course was unique and beyond compare. I learned more through our speakers on the given topic in this course than any other course.",
    "This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.",
    "This course presented an incredible opportunity for learning, providing access to top-level experts in the field we were examining. It was above all my knowledge of the subject matter that was expanded and enhanced. The problem set that we were dealing with was complex and current and thus provided new and unique insights into a quick-moving situation."

   "comments": [
    "The structure of the course was lacking. The syllabus provided was a draft, lacked a final agenda, and by the second week we were off the syllabus. The expectations of the instructor and graded portions were unclear and appeared to change often. How the professor will objectively grade each of us remains unclear.",
    "Not that this is necessarily a big deal, but the course really did NOT effectively even out the workload. The end of the semester clearly included the vast majority of the work that had to be done with a tight deadline. This is sort of the nature of a consulting-style class, though. The rest of the course, however, was thrilling for me personally.",
    "A fellow student (not a TA\/TF) ran the course. Dont allow that to happen. The course didnt build on itself to a conclusion as a project. Pace the work out throughout the course, so the final deliverable isnt compressed into the same time as other classes that have finals and research papers.",
    "The key strength of the course was its access to valuable sources of information and the incredible team dynamic. The main weakness of the course was unreliable leadership and inter-personal drama."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course content and client experience but I would not recommend taking the a course with Professor King.",
    "While I doubt the course can be replicated, I would certainly take this class again.",
    "A course like this with a client like we had was truly remarkable. We brought in some of the best & brightest in the entire world on the topic and synthesized analysis for a client that truly cares.",
    "This is the best course I've taken in three years at Yale.",
    "No - this course was disorganized and annoying due to the disorganization. We had great access to amazing guests, but the pre-work that should've been done when putting together the syllabus, or at the latest in the first weeks of the class, to define the project outcomes was missing. This led to a lot of confusion and in the end, a very disorganized and frustrating experience."
