   "comments": [
    "Yeah! It's a really interesting course.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE IT IS SO INCREDIBLE. LOFTON IS SO INTELLIGENT AND FUNNY AND REALLY ENGAGES YOU. YOU WILL NO REGRET IT AT ALL. WHO KNEW RELIGIOUS HISTORY COULD BE SO COOL.",
    "If you want to get a comprehensive narrative about religion in America, this class won't really give it to you. However, it will come closer to giving it to you than will any other class at Yale. This class is a fair bit of work; there are four 3-5 page writing assignments, plus a midterm and a final. That's a lot more than most lectures. The grading is also pretty harsh, at least in Kathryn Lofton's section.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Lofton is INCREDIBLE, energetic and fun. You get to read really interesting passages and books, and watch movies and clips of Oprah and music videos. Interestingly enough, it all connects back to American religion! This class changed my views on a lot of religions in the United States, and really informed me of the extent to which religion is embedded in society. This class was not only fun and interesting; it was incredibly practical and applicable to my everyday life.",
    "Really interesting course on the history of American religion (though you probably got that from the title). Professor Lofton has a tendency to go off on tangents, but her enthusiasm for her subject is infectious. Highly recommended.",
    "Dynamic lecturer who focuses on creative applications of \"religion\" rather than nuts and bolts denominational histories. Great assignment structure with lots of medium sized papers (so the final is not a big deal) that have interesting prompts such as to find an article and argue why it would be a good addition to the syllabus of this course.",
    "I would recommend it if you don't find feeling a little lost at times as sometimes you are only able to get 3\/4th of what is going on in lecture because of Prof Lofton's speed\/ the nature of the material. Its really not a difficult class if you are willing to come to class and go with the flow. If you are really type A its probably not for you\/ will drive you insane.",
    "Take it. Brilliant.",
    "This course is great. Professor Lofton uses the whole semester to make a really compelling argument about religion in modern America. While at times (especially during the middle of the semester before the ideas start converging) the class can be extremely stressful because you have NO idea what is going on, it all comes together so nicely that it is worth it. Furthermore, the reading is all extremely interesting. Professor Lofton has assembled the most important historical events that no one knows about, and they are great case studies to prove her point. She has organized the reading so that you switch off reading a primary source and a secondary source analyzing that first source, which gives great insight into the academic process. The writing assignments also help with that because you must analyze different parts of the Academy (such as text nomination, source analysis). The exams are extremely fair.Professor Lofton is an incredibly dynamic lecturer. She is so much fun to listen to that a number of times I even brought friends to class. Again, often lecture can be maddening because you don't know what's going on, but things come together beautifully by the end of the semester. Professor Lofton is also incredibly accessible for help through email or office hours.TAKE THE CLASS. It literally will change how you look at the world.",
    "If around midterm time you have no idea what this class is teaching you, hold on to hope. By finals you should have a better idea. I enjoyed this class. It gives you a way of looking at the world around you, but it doesn't give you a clear set of answers and definitions to regurgitate onto exams. If you need concrete definitions, this class will drive you nuts. If you're willing to swirl in an abyss for a while, this class is worthwhile.",
    "Definitely. This class was one of my favorites. I now look at the subjects of religion and history differently.",
    "This class takes an interesting approach to American religion -- many of the texts that are read are not obvious ones, and often obscure. It is also a very piecemeal approach -- Lofton presents no sweeping narrative or chronological arcs, but focuses on individual elements that are often tied only together by theme.",
    "Take it. The proffesor and TA are so interesting and knowledgable about the subject. Lofton presents a great class of case studies and very interesting perspectives on the study of religion in america , anywhere from civil religion in the south after the civil war to the atheism per-sea of Mark Twain to redefining native american culture as religion to a super cool analysis of the matrix. though some lectures are a bit extreme, they always begin with great music and with lots of enthusiam that will definately wake you up if you haven't already had coffee in 9:25 in the mornin. Also Lofton is great to meet with for further exploration in your own interests.",
    "YES.",
    "You should absolutely take this class! Lofton is incredible and you'll learn a lot AND have fun. The subject matter is also really awesome and something everyone should have exposure to.",
    "I'd recommend it, but expect to be frustrated with the pace of Lofton's lectures. In the end, everything comes together.",
    "A theme-oriented approache the the study of religion in America, focusing on unique material and example. Lofton will definitely give you HER take on the whole thing - and she'll admit it - so be sure to work through the material with yourself. Dominant focus on Protestantism. Class teaches you how to approach the history of religion in America, and does not give you a concise historical, social account.",
    "Definitely take Religion in Modern America. Professor Lofton is very enthusiastic and her lectures are never EVER boring. It's more than a survey course, the readings are very interesting, and the course ends with The Matrix!",
    "The class is an introduction to interpreting different clues as to the role of religion in America. You will learn very little about religion or religious movements in America and instead focus on interpreting a scattering of cases. The enthusiasm of Prof Lofton is great but I foundthe class way too scattered.",
    "It's more a class about how to think about American religion, as well as a survey about some religious patterns in the US. You might want to take it Credit\/D.",
    "A phenomenal class that single-handedly convinced me to become a Religion Studies double major. Much less about memorizing dates and facts than about understanding the social and psychological engines behind religious practice.Even at 9 AM, I never resented getting out of bed for Kathryn Lofton's lectures. She's unconventional and passionate about her teaching in the best kind of way. Likewise, section was consistently enjoyable.Also as a plus, the workload in this class is steady, but never overwhelming. Your grade is determined by a number of smaller assignments, as opposed to one test and one giant paper.TAKE THIS CLASS. NOW. So worthwhile, if you're a major or not.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to someone who wanted to learn about religion in America as a whole. It doesn't focus on individual religions or the question of God, etc..but it does a really good job of giving students a picture of American religion.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who was A) very interested in the readings and B) ready to discuss religion from a stance that asks unusual questions. Do not take the course just because you fall in love with Kathryn Lofton when you shop it \u0096 she teaches plenty of courses on other scintillating topics. This course looks at some very specific components of the development of religion in America after the Civil War, focusing almost entirely on the predominance of \"public Protestantism\" and culminating in the explosion of Evangelicalism. If that's what you want to talk about, go for it.",
    "Definitely a must-take. Professor Lofton is both brilliant and hilarious, the material is enlightening, and the workload manageable. I feel like this is the type of course that really makes one a better American citizen. Even though, or perhaps especially since, I had no previous background in religious studies, I felt that the course did a great job of making us realize the way in which the impact of religion cannot be untangled from American society. Though a few of the readings were a bit dry, others included a novel and a memoir and the class ended with us watching The Matrix. This class will change the way you view everything from Oprah to televangelists like Joel Osteen to any mention of religion-related cases in the NY Times. In my opinion, quite worth the while.",
    "I'm not sure what I expected when I signed up for this class, but I definitely got a whole lot more than I bargained for. A lot of the concepts and situations that we studied were very intriguing, but sometimes it was hard to wade through the heavily skewed opinions of Prof. Lofton to get to a more untainted version of the material. Take this class if you're interested in the cultural phenomenon of religion in America; however, make sure to talk about the issues that come up in this class with friends and other mentors who may be able to provide opinions outside of Lofton's carefully crafted syllabus."
