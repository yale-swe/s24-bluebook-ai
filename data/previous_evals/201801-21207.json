   "comments": [
    "This history course caused me to think about history in a much different light than I had previously. The ability to evaluate a historical event from the vantage point of the people living in the time period, as much as one can, is the most significant skill I have learned from this course. Being able to hold two (or more) different views of what occurred historically and critically evaluate them is another aspect of this course that I feel will stay with me. The ability to combine different historical interpretations of events and realize one may still not have all the answers or a definitive interpretation is really instilled in students.",
    "I learned about the American Revolution through perspectives that I had never been exposed to before. Viewing this event through the eyes of not only white colonists, but also women, children, African Americans, Native Americans, and many other minorities was incredibly interesting.",
    "After spending a significant amount of time in high school studying colonial american and the Constitution; this class offered new insight and nuance to the events I thought I knew so well. It also offered a more holistic perspective of the revolutionary period.",
    "I improved my critical reading skills. I also improved my essay writing, particularly my argumentation and word precision.",
    "I learned a nice overview of colonial America, the American Revolution, and the very early Republic. Nothing I learned was particularly earth-shattering or fundamentally changed the way I viewed the American Revolution, though this class was thought-provoking and very interesting.",
    "I learned about American government and critically evaluating historical narratives.",
    "While I learned a lot of factual (and anecdotal!) information about the American Revolution, I think that above all I learned how to approach studying history in terms of reading primary sources and scholarly works, and writing about them as well. I learned to be critical about terms such as \"The Founders\" or even \"liberty\" and \"democracy,\" and to investigate what these terms mean and how they originated.",
    "I learned so much in this course. Not only did I learn about the events of the American Revolution, but also I learned about the mindsets of the people who lived through it. I learned how to study history and enjoy the process.",
    "I learned how to more effectively study for history courses. I learned a lot about the American Revolution, broader scope than in high school",
    "I have learned to compare and contrast several different themes as they develop throughout this time period.",
    "I learned a great deal about what the revolution was like from the point of view of the regular people. I learned how the revolution developed over time as a social and political change. I also learned how it affected different groups of people, such as women and African Americans.",
    "Completely altered my perspective on the story of our nation's founding--which is often glorified in high school education. Loved gaining insight into different social, racial, etc., groups and realizing how their experiences were (or were not) changed by the Revolution. Also nice to learn more about the British perspective.",
    "This course helped me greatly in understanding the founding of our nation.",
    "You learn a lot about the American Revolution in ways that you didn't learn about it in high school. You learn about the differing points of views and the vast number of differences between the colonies.",
    "I improved my historical thinking skills.",
    "Good reading skills",
    "I learned about the build-up to the American Revolution, the war itself, and the following years. We learned about the time period through a more nuanced and thorough lens than we did in high school, which drew in more complications as to the characters and motivations involved, and less of a fuzzy glow around the whole thing overall.",
    "I learned a detailed account of the people and the process of the American revolution",
    "I learned more about the revolution than I ever knew I could.",
    "Lots of DETAILS about the American Revolution--more about the build up to it than anything else. this is only",
    "The class provided a good survey of the events of the revolution, as well as a lot of thematic explanation of why the revolution took place.",
    "I learned a huge amount during this course about the American Revolution. I think it broadened my understanding of the importance of primary sources as well.",
    "This class is an excellent and relatively comprehensive overview of the Era of the American Revolution. It is an excellent way to get a better understanding of both sides of a conflict, as Prof. Freeman is careful to provide both sides' reasoning and story.",
    "This course was a great overview of the American Revolution especially thinking past the war and more about society, politics, and thought.",
    "Everything there is to know about the American Revolution",
    "This class is a great introductory-level history lecture. I learned to process large amounts of written information (the reading is on the heavy side) and hold an academic discussion about history while still feeling like the class was accessible to those without prior history or humanities backgrounds.",
    "Overview of American revolution, got to write a fun essay and a more serious one so a great balance as far as papers go",
    "Writing skills and section vocal skills",
    "I learned more details about the American Revolution.",
    "I learned how to evaluate themes of the past and how to express my thoughts in a fluid manner.",
    "I learned how to synthesize history in a meaningful way, and about the American Revolution broadly.",
    "I thought I was familiar with the Revolution before taking this course and I was so so wrong!!! I walked away with such a deeper understanding of what the Revolution meant at the time and what that should mean for us today.",
    "A better understanding of American Revolutionary history and new ways of analyzing history - as driven by people making the best decisions they can given circumstances (not to say everyone is holy and good in history).",
    "Incredible insight into the daily, ordinary lives of those experiencing the American Revolution! A wonderful outlook on historical analysis as NOT being merely a series of inevitable events.",
    "Much better historical thinking skills. Especially thinking about events as they were happening rather than taking a retrospective viewpoint.",
    "I think this course not only taught me about an incredibly impactful moment in American history, including how decisions made in the 1700's still influence our modern world, but also gave me a better understanding of history as a field.",
    "This course was helpful to learn about the American Revolution and how to approach history in general. I learned a lot about how historians approach historiography, which was really helpful. I learned about the specific events that happened during the American Revolution, but, more importantly, I gained valuable insight about the mindsets of revolutionaries, founders, and other Americans at the time, and how revolutionary the American Revolution really was. This class debunks a lot of common myths or misunderstandings that we have about the revolution, and focuses on groups that you won't learn about in your average U.S. History class, such as low-income Americans, women, African Americans, and Native Americans. I learned so much from this course and highly recommend it! It doesn't only help you learn more about pre-industrial history, but helps you develop many valuable insights."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course included the excellent (and thorough, yet manageable) reading list, the passion of the TF's, and Professor Freeman's vast knowledge and unique insights pertaining to the subject matter. I do think that the paper assignments for the course were pretty vague in terms of expectations and how they would be graded.",
    "This period in American history is super interesting and relevant to everybody, regardless of their major.",
    "The course has a lot of different readings from author's of different perspectives, which provides students with a more consummate understanding of the American revolution. That said, I found most of the readings quite boring and difficult to get through. Also, I feel like the class did not properly address the narrative of African slaves and Native Americans during the American Revolution.",
    "Strengths: excellent lecturer (Professor Freeman), she's highly entertaining. This class largely focused on political developments rather than social or people's history, which I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated. Weaknesses: lots of reading, can be very tedious and boring, and rather useless, so just skim it!",
    "This course benefits from a great professor and interesting lectures. The readings supplement the lectures well. The essays and exams are manageable and test your knowledge of themes and your ability to create an argument.",
    "One of the many strengths of this course was Professor Freeman's engaging lecturing skills. She was dynamic and enthusiastic, and in turn she made me excited about the material we discussed. I think one of the weaknesses is actually the fact that we don't discuss the readings in lecture. I understand that we have section in order to discuss the reading, but I think it would have really benefitted me to have seen how these authors and their conflicting theories about the Revolution were in dialogue with each other and how they related to the themes of our class. I would have loved to have heard Professor Freeman's insights on the reading and hear more about why she assigned us the readings she did.",
    "This course is fantastic. You must take it before you graduate. I am a STEM person and I took this my senior spring. It might have been my favorite course at Yale.",
    "I really enjoyed the professor's way of teaching",
    "Awesome lectures by Professor Freeman. Amazing TF Catherine Treesh.",
    "The course is excellent. Professor Freeman has done a great deal of research and she constantly pulls from her findings to read journal entries from the people of the time to further what we learn in class. The course asks lots of good questions to think about, like how radical was the revolution? It dives deeper into this time period than other courses such as high school courses generally do.",
    "Professor Freeman is amazing, and she gives great, engaging lectures. I think the one complaint I have is that the course didn't always have a linear flow, and we would jump around in time occasionally (i.e. with Common Sense) which made things confusing.",
    "The strengths of this course were the amazing lectures, but I wish the notes would have been projected via PowerPoint.",
    "There are great lectures, although I think the assignments can be improved. I would argue that the essays were a little too high-school... writing a letter from the point of view of a colonist seems as though it does not match the high level of the rest of the course.",
    "Freeman is an amazing lecture!",
    "The lectures and section were both very strong. There was too much reading. I would understand if some reading was suggested and some was required, but it would be better if it was clear which portions of the reading were important so we could prioritize those, as it became clear in section and on the exams that some of the reading was simply superfluous.",
    "Strengths is joanna freeman Weakness is way too much reading",
    "This course is awesome. Great teacher, great lectures, great TAs.",
    "Really interesting lectures and low workload. The tests had really really obsure details that came up in one line in a reading maybe 5 weeks ago. Other than that though, solid class.",
    "I found the lectures to be superfluous to the class - the way they were structured was so anecdotal as to be almost not informative, and at times unengaging. Most of what I learned came from the readings and from section.",
    "I think this class is perfect",
    "This class was excellent! Prof Freeman is an excellent lecturer, and I think this class is great because it follows the entirety of the Revolution-- frombefore the 1760s to after the 1780s. I think the only way it could significantly be improved is by focusing a bit more on the actual War, which seemed to be completely sidelined.",
    "I think that this course is well structured, readings don't feel wasteful, and the TA'S were awesome. The only thing I wish was different is that for the second essay I felt much more prepared to write it after lectures on the subject and I think that'd be helpful.",
    "Professor was amazing and so was my TA and the course material was interesting and very clear",
    "Professor Freeman is an engaging, exciting lecturer who clearly cares about the subject she teaches. The TFs are helpful and, although they can demanding depending on which one you get, are across the board fair with clear expectations. The one thing that I did struggle with somewhat was a disconnect between lecture and reading. Both are fantastic, but they seemed to be only loosely thematically or temporally connected.",
    "Amazing course, amazing professor!!!",
    "Writing skills improvement",
    "The course lectures are not very substantial. But the readings are very helpful.",
    "Perfect class, except maybe the lecture could be slower pace",
    "The lectures and discussion sections were wonderful, possibly the readings could be adjusted to be more concurrent with those.",
    "Strengths include an very skilled lecture and interesting reading material. My one complaint with the course and not even a very big one was the choice of prompts for our long essay: they were diffuse and completely uninspiring, especially in contrast to some of the fascinating questions that were raised elsewhere.",
    "Lectures are phenomenal, super engaging and entertaining in all aspects. Sections were a bit varied in their difficulty but generally were good forums in which to discuss and debate the material presented in class. I found the readings to be quite dull at times and not super necessary in understanding the class. The midterm was unnecessary tricky with a random identification topic that most scholars would have known and was very very briefly mentioned in the readings.",
    "I really liked it! Joanne gave great anecdotes and was so engaging. Assignments werent too hard.",
    "I enjoyed lecture I thought it was interesting in the sense that she tells a lot of history through stories. That also meant that when exams came around there was some research that you needed to do on your own. Also you defiantly need to read to keep up with the class.",
    "Strengths: incredible lectures, great readings Weakness: huge discussion sections",
    "I think the lectures for this course are OUTSTANDING. However, the readings are soooo long and dull at times. I really felt that the readings should have been cut in half. Even beyond the fact that reading so much is dull, there was no way to cover so much material in our weekly sections. I think the reading should have been reduced so we could more thoroughly engage with a smaller amount of sources rather than hastily cover such a breadth of material.",
    "Strengths: Professor Freeman is a very captivating lecturer, and I thought her lectures were perfect in terms of having the right amount of content and introducing us to new ideas. I think the course is very well thought-out and set up well."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. I believe this course teaches history in a way that is unique, but more than that, really accurate and invaluable to any Yale student.",
    "Yes, the readings and lectures were all fascinating.",
    "I would NOT recommend this class, but I'll admit I am in the minority. I will say that Professor Freeman is brilliant, charismatic, and kind. She is a great lecturer and she is so passionate and knowledgeable. Also, my TF Katie McCrudden was incredible as well. The issue for me was the content of the course. I guess I find American history kind of boring and uninspiring. There is so much reading and I found 95% of it very boring and difficult to get through. Also, I feel like the class did not properly address the narratives of African slaves and Native Americans. Lastly, I found the essay prompts kind of annoying and difficult to answer. The first one is a creative essay that tells students to pretend to be colonists and write letters to the mothercountry. Personally, I found the assignment boring and unexciting. Then, for the major essay, which was one of the most difficult and annoying essays I have ever had to write, we had to write a 7-9 page paper about the lessons the colonists learned during the revolution. I feel like the essay prompts could have been a little bit more pointed and a little bit more specific.",
    "If you're looking for a good history lecture, absolutely! Don't take this class if you're looking for an earth-shattering reevaluation of the American Revolution, but take this class if you want a better understanding of the formative events of our country. This class centers around political events and developments, not social history, which was exactly what I wanted.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Freeman is a great lecturer. Her lectures are well-organized and effective and her sense of humor keeps you engaged.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who wants to engage with history (but is not necessarily a history major).",
    "yes absolutely take this class! professor freeman is honestly the coolest professor out there and her lectures are her telling a story. the exams are really easy and very fair, just know the overall themes. 10\/10 would reccomend",
    "Yes! You must take this course before you graduate. It is an awesome experience to learn about the history of the United States. The is an entire lecture devoted to Yale during the Revolution.",
    "Professor is really cool. If you want some more info than basic details about american revolution, you should definitely take it.",
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in history. Professor Freeman brings a remarkable level of expertise that you cannot often find outside institutions like Yale. She is very engaging herself, and her scholarly knowledge shows in the nuanced lectures and lessons.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a quality class to fulfill the History major's pre-industrial credit. That being said, I was not convinced that the American Revolution actually deserved a full semester-long course, especially when that course did not include much discussion of non-white and non-male experiences.",
    "If you're at all interested in any perspective on the American Revolution other than white men, do not take this class. There's only passing mentions of how the Revolution affected women, Black Americans, and Native Americans, and one lecture devoted to that topic with a few readings. It's not necessarily the professor's fault entirely--possibly a flaw by design because of the subject matter--but I found it pretty boring because I'm not interested in any of these white settler colonists.",
    "Yes, would highly recommend, especially for someone who would like to expand his or her views on America's founding period.",
    "Yes. Absolutely. Really great course that you should take.",
    "I absolutely would, as it gives great insight into a major historical event.",
    "Yes. Professor Freeman is fantastic. The lectures are interesting and tell a great story. The essays are perhaps a bit basic, but the course as a whole is great.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I enjoyed it very much, the lectures were some of the most entertaining I've ever seen while still being informative.",
    "Yes if you are interested in early American history and if you dont get easily distracted",
    "Yeah, it's a great course.",
    "Yes! It's a great lecture that doesn't drone. Very interesting but also low workload, so a great 5th class (and humanities credit!) if you need one.",
    "I would not. I think the amount I learned I could've easily accomplished on my own, and I didn't walk away with any grand insights. A fine class overall, but there are many more interesting history classes at Yale, especially about American history.",
    "Yes! This is the best class I have taken at Yale Freeman is a great professor!",
    "Yes! This class is an excellent example of a history course done right. Anyone who wants a better understanding of the historical and philosophical underpinnings of the United States should take this class.",
    "Yes, if you take any history course at Yale have it be this one! Prof. Freeman is unbelievable--she is so knowledgeable about the subject, her lectures are so engaging and well organized, and she has such a fantastic sense of humor. For anyone who grew up in the US, or is just spending 4 years here at Yale and wants to know more about the history this is a must-take! Even if you took APUSH in high school, this will provide such a fresh perspective on iconic American Revolution moments.",
    "Yes! Medium workload, great professor, and if you're interested in American history it's a must take.",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "Yes",
    "I'd absolutely recommend the course to students without strong backgrounds in American history or history in general. Sufficiently challenging and stimulating. For those who have taken extensively classes in American history before, the lectures might be less interesting and engaging, but the reading alone is worth taking the class for.",
    "YES !! Professor is extremely engaging and loves teaching, which makes learning the material very fun.",
    "Yes would highly recommend",
    "Yes, only if they are interested in the subject.",
    "YES! I learned so much and engaged with the material in a fun way",
    "Take this if you are an American or live in America or have ever even heard of the American Revolution. Will not get a super sappy rendition of the Revolution like you may have gotten in high school. Professor Freeman really takes you into the moment with lots of first person accounts and incredibly engaging lectures. Readings are a little redundant at times, but all in all a phenomenal course.,",
    "Yes! enjoyable and worthwhile.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course - learned a lot and really enjoyed it.",
    "Yes I found the professor very sweet and interesting to listen too.",
    "Yes! Everyone ought to learn, through the methods used by Prof. Freeman (ie using personal accounts of ordinary citizens), how the foundations of the United States were disputed and formed.",
    "If you like fun stories, history, or even just have a sense of humor, you should take this class. Loved every second of lecture. The readings can get kinda dull and overwhelming, but the course is totally worth it.",
    "Take this class even if you're only mildly interested in the American Revolution. Going to lecture was easy because Professor Freeman's lectures were so interesting. You will definitely develop new insights about the Revolutionary War period and America in general. Highly recommend this course to a history major (which I'm not) or anyone interested in the topic!! Do it!! Take the course! It's so good!"
