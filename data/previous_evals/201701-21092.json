    "My written and spoken Russian improved considerably.",
    "I learned a wealth of vocabulary and confidence in spoken Russian, particularly in discussing advanced topics. There was a good amount and distribution of listening, speaking (both prepared and impromptu) and written work in the course.",
    "I learned how to speak Russian at a higher conversational level, using more sophisticated terminology to discuss politics, current events, and worldviews."

   "comments": [
    "We become conversant in many topical issues, and we learn the vocabulary to express ourselves in a wide variety of areas. Feedback is immediate and thorough; very little room for improvement.",
    "This class was the perfect language course -- challenging, but not unmanageable. Class was always very interesting, the size was perfect for discussion and exercising speaking skills, and I really feel like my language skills have improved."

   "comments": [
    "An excellent course taught by an excellent professor. If your Russian is sufficiently advanced to take his course, I would advise you to choose this class without a second thought.",
    "I strongly recommend this course--you quickly improve in your speaking and writing, and feedback is immediate and thorough. A typical class is basically a discussion of current events. Awesome course.",
    "I only wish there were more Russian courses like this in the department! Most of the Russian courses focus on literature, and while building those reading skills is important, after fourth year Russian, there are few courses in which you can build vocabulary that is useful in everyday or professional settings. The opportunities to practice speaking in Russian are also limited in other courses, especially since the courses are primarily half filled with native speakers. This course had none of these issues, and was a great experience.",
    "Yes. Professor Dolgova is an excellent and patient teacher, adjusting the class to suit all students' needs and at the same time challenging us to push our skills further. This is an excellent course to improve Russian and to not be afraid to speak the language to a native speaker."
