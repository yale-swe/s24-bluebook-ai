I would describe the course as one that explores that multiple languages that exist in South Africa and how that historically occurred and developed over time. It's a fascinating way to understand the complications of race and ethnicity in South Africa."

    "This course made me want to do more research into South African history. I am still unsure of what exactly I would focus on, but I have a greater appreciation for South African language and culture.",
    "Language politics plays an integral role in the study of South African literature. Because my master's thesis will be exploring how South African academics define and teach African literature in South African universities, understanding the complicated historical context of South Africa is important. The existence of 11 official languages in South Africa and distinct ethnic identities complicates the scope of South African writing. This course was absolutely needed for me. Without it, I would not have been able to give my project more depth and weight."
