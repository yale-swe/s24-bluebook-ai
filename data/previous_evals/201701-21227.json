    "I truly gained a different vision of colors through this course. We really do not think about the impact that they have in our lives, the things that they reflect about our conditions as humans and at the same time, how indispensable they are to us because they represent everything that is natural and artificial.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about color theory, as well as thinking critically about form, value, and design. It was such a pleasure!",
    "The entire realm of the color world and how our daily perceptions and lives are immersed and impacted by it.",
    "I'm much more perceptive to colors, and the world around me in general.",
    "I gained knowledge in a huge range of field from this class as color in present in all parts of our lives. This class made me much more aware of the use and presence of color, as well as the color relationships that define these colors presence. It taught me parts about the biology of color, the work of Albers and other pioneering color artists as well as developing my own artistic ideas and experiments. It was my first experience with collage, photography and filming which meant I learnt a lot about experimenting with each medium by focusing primarily on color. It has inspired me to take more Art classes at Yale and in-sighted a genuine intrigue in color.",
    "I am so much more aware of the role color plays in our lives and all the complexities it contains; after taking this course I've changed the way I literally look at the world.",
    "Honestly this class willl change how you look at the world. Now, wherever I go I notice the colors around me. How they interact with one another what they make me feel etc. art wise, I have never before taken an art class involving color and this was in part b\/c I was afraid of dealing wih it b\/c it involves so many variables. I no longer feel overwhelmed by the use of color in art.",
    "This course expanded not just my knowledge for color but my love of it as well.",
    "As an art major who was taking two other art classes this semester, Color Practice had a lot of overlap and helped me refine my work in my other classes. I've developed a deeper understanding of color and color interactions. I also just have grown to appreciate the color of everyday life and I am definitely more aware of it in my surroundings.",
    "I developed my intuitive sense of color through experience working with colors in various mediums as well as practical knowledge surrounding color relationships attained through working through many of Josef Albers' collage exercises. As an artist I also grew a lot by way of our use of so many versatile mediums and field trips to the Art Gallery and the Peabody Museum which contextualized the importance of color relationships in a wider arena."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course was really well paced and we had time to explore different topics while still getting to be out of the classroom. I think that experimenting in class was good, but we could have covered more ground if those experiments were left as homework.",
    "This course was super! The readings were meaningful and rich, always felt well worth doing. The project themselves were also incredible. Each one taught me something really new and tangible. I couldn't have asked for a better class!",
    "Amazing class - the perfect balance between work, excitement, and intellectual stimulation. Loved the field trips!",
    "The course is really about exploring. I love how I become much more creative and not conformed to any approach.",
    "There were many strengths to this class. The workload was very manageable and the homework assignments were fun. It was great to be working in a very intimate class environment and learning from other people. The trips to the Peabody, Albers foundation and art galleries were very informative and interesting. The Professor Anna and TA Vinny were very interesting people and great at making the class interesting. The only weakness would be that I would have liked to spend more time using paints and pigments. I really enjoyed working as a group for the final project as it relieved the pressure and allowed us to collaborate all sorts of different ideas. Whilst at first it was intimidating to show your work, by the end I felt very comfortable showing my work in this class.",
    "A great balance of studio time and class discussions; I am really glad we had readings and discussions about them because no other art class I've taken here has given me an even balance of theory and practice.",
    "This course is engaging regardless of your background, it pushes you toward reflection and ultimate bettering of overall quality of work (without feeling competitive or stressful). The only thing that can be somewhat nerve racking is the fact that you receive no grades and feedback only comes in the form of general in class critique.",
    "There's a lot of content to cover and I just wish it was longer. That being said, I think the wide range of color practice we got is definitely a pillar of this course.",
    "The strengths of this course are in the many different mediums it allows students to work within, the interesting readings that it uses to facilitate thought provoking discussions around art and color, and the welcoming environment that it creates. I was so happy that grades were never mentioned in this class, this was truly a studio space where students were encouraged to try new things out and even fail. The great teaching by both Anna and our TA Vinnie (who was an absolute pleasure to work with) made this experience invaluable. I think continuing to find related field trips to go on and supplement in class work time would better the class even more."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class! It was fascinating to learn more about colors, their properties, and most importantly, their interactions. :D! Plus, the field trip and the exercises make this class totally worth it!",
    "If you have the chance to take this Class while at Yale, you must! You will learn and grow as a student, thinker, and artist. Anna's support and guidance is unmatched!",
    "Absolutely!!",
    "Best class I took this semester - such a wonderful learning environment. Anna is not just an amazing artist and professor, but is also a visionary.",
    "Of course! The BEST class I've ever taken at Yale so far. You learn so much about arts and about yourself through the class. I also love how Color Practice is all about exploration: We went to Josef Albers foundation, to two special exhibitions in the Yale Arts Gallery on Josef Albers' and Thomas Wilfred's work, both of which is mindblowing, and to amazing grad students' studio. I learned so much from so many people.",
    "Take this course! Color was such a great way to break up my humanities-heavy courseload. I loved being able to work hands-on with materials, to produce something and to read creative pieces. We'd venture outside the classroom a lot and take fun field trips, and have productive discussions afterwards. It was an wonderful adventure everyday, and I learned so much about how to critically think about the world around me.",
    "Yes I loved this Art class. There were some really interesting trips, to the Peabody, Alber's foundation and various art exhibitions which taught me a lot about many different fields. We also covered a huge range of mediums, including collage, painting and colored light which made the whole semester very interesting. It has made me much more aware of the use of colors around me and helped me appreciate art in its different forms. It was a really enjoyable and relaxing class environment and probably my favourite class taken so far at Yale.",
    "Absolutely! The best art course I've taken here thus far.",
    "Yes, regardless of your background this course is amazibg. It manages to be intellectually challenging without being overwhelming workwise. All courses at Yale should aspire to be like this.",
    "This is the perfect class for anyone looking to take an art class. The professor is so charismatic and wonderful. The class is fun and almost never boring. This class is for art majors and non art majors alike. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Yes! Art majors and non-art majors alike should take this at it can reshape how you look at the world.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this class, and I think that it's a fun one for someone who hasn't worked that much in art theory. It's the perfect combination of art theory and making things. There's a lot of work for the projects, but they're all fun to do.",
    "I cannot recommend this class highly enough. It's a great art class that brings together people from many different disciplines on a topic that appeals to them all. Anna is wonderful, excited about teaching, and gives both concrete and general feedback that helps you specifically further your work while also giving you the space to choose which direction you want to bring it in. The class is highly focused on color but the various mediums allow new perspective on the topic and follow a logical progression throughout the semester. It's awesome! Take it!"
