    "it s great fun if you get Thiago but he's not teaching anymore :(",
    "Portuguese L2 was great. We had another great semester -- the class was organized, well-taught, and a lot of fun. Well done, Portuguese department. Well done, Thiago.",
    "Great way to learn grammar for Brazilian Portuguese and also very interesting in terms of culture.",
    "Pretty chill for a language class. I mean it's L2, right? Like, how many times can you learn the direct versus reported speech tenses for a romance language and stay riveted? Thiago Moyano is amazing though -- jump on his section if he ever comes back to Yale.",
    "Portuguese L2 is much more fast paced than L1, but still very reasonable. You start learning new tenses everyday. The class was still very enjoyable and I'd definitely recommend taking it. It's a lot of fun and not too much work.",
    "Portuguese is awesome! Low key, low stress class, but the language and culture are both really interesting and useful.Other than that, it's a pretty standard intro language course -- a couple of compositions, couple of tests, an oral presentation, a final exam, small homework assignments.",
    "YES!!! TAKE THIS COURSE. SERIOUSLY. TAKE IT.",
    "YES. It's fun, you learn a lot and Thiago was great!",
    "Portuguese is very easy to pick up if you have spoken Spanish before, especially the grammar."
