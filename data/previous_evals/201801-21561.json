   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Only having to read two papers a week makes the class manageable and allows you to put more effort into reading the papers well. Weaknesses: Student and faculty discussion skills are varying which makes it hard to have full discussions without the question:answer formula often used by teachers.",
    "A strength was the student only discussion session before we had the faculty discussion. I thought the faculty discussions were best when we didn't go around in a circle to describe figures, but actually talked about and discussed the paper."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes because it connects interdisciplinary fields well and exposes students to new methods not typically covered in department specific discussions.",
    "Yes, I think this course was both interesting and beneficial in terms of critical thinking skills. It was also a good way to be exposed to research out of your own field."
