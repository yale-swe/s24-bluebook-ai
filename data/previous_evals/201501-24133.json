This gave a chaotic feel and I never knew what exactly to prepare for. When Paul was lecturing or once we really delved into discussions, things were great, but the chaotic arrangement around that was a challenge"

    "Paul is bringing a very valuable set of ideas and thoughts that are innovative and are a much-needed injection of new ideas to the climate conversation at FES.",
    "Working with the client.",
    "In conjunction with this course, two classmates and I were able to travel to Bonn, Germany to run a workshop on new methods for environmental communication at the UNFCCC's annual adaptation meeting. It was an incredible experience, and we believe it will turn into a longer-term partnership between Yale University (in the context of this course) and the UNFCCC Secretariat.",
    "I felt it challenged me to think about climate change from a new lens, to pull different threads of the issue together and to craft clear communications around the issue. I appreciated Paul's sensitivity to how different types of communication resonate with audiences of different values, and how he was willing to let the course adapt to the types of audiences different members of the class would go on to communicate with. The lecture material was great. I didn't always find the time with guest speaker as useful, but a lot of that I think came from my entering the class with a very specific set of interests",

    "Group projects were fantastic! Loved that we were able to discuss our projects in class and learn from one another.",

   "comments": [
    "The course was disorganized and changed too frequently, and expectations were not always clear. The primary improvement needed is to bring in significant organization.",
    "The content and class was a little disorganized.",
    "Client relationships were not well-managed in advance, making it difficult and time-consuming to actually figure out project objectives. Our group was told we would be traveling to Bonn on an extremely last-minute basis because of such disorganization, making it difficult to coordinate plans and secure funding.",
    "Consistency in structure and framework. I could have used more of a cohesive plan and class meeting structure from week to week. I was also a bit frustrated by the amount of support I got on the project. I feel that parts of how groups were expected to work together on projects was left very ambiguous, especially when those teams included members of the undergrad course.",
    "Classes need to much more structured and predictable, with readings posted well in advance. It was a bit of a rollercoaster ride through the semester, and it wasn't always clear whether the course was more focused on the projects or the readings. It is very difficult to complete good work while learning core concepts simultaneously.",
    "The clients or specific contacts within each client organization could be more thoroughly vetted before the semester begins. My client organization seemed to lack clearly defined responsibility for managing our group."

    "Communications frameworks are useful in any field.",
    "Coming from an environmental sciences background but now finding myself at Yale Divinity School, I have been eager to find ways to bridge these two spheres of interest. This course allowed me to do that in a self-driven way that wasn't just another \"Religion and Nature\" course, but that challenged me to think critically about how I can connect my sense of vocation to effective communications around climate change. I see climate change and environmental issues as some of the most significant facing the church and the world, and having church leaders well-versed on and passionate about mobilizing the church on these issues will be essential for effective societal response on the issues. Thinking about how to communicate climate change to clergy and from the pulpit has helped me to connect interests, and broaden my formation for the priesthood"

    "For the reasons above. I took it to stay up to date on recent climate science and communications frameworks around it. I took it to continue thinking seriously about how I will be able to communicate about climate change to individuals within the church as well as leaders of that same church."

    "Working in a group was helpful in creating robust deliverables that incorporated ideas from people with varying expertise. Coordinating with the group was a bit difficult, but that is to be expected with any group work.",
    "Advantages: I loved the grad\/undergrad collaboration, and grew a lot from having the opportunity to take the lead on the project, and collaborating with students across different schools. Disadvantages: I was unclear of how the dynamics of the undergrad\/grad partnership were supposed to work; i.e, how much work was expected from each member of different programs, who was turning in what, how deliverables were to be shared or individualized, etc. I felt I could have used a lot more support on the project, especially when group members were rarely if ever present to collaborate.",

    "The course is a worthwhile foray into the world of climate change communications, and Professor Lussier has an amazing network of connections across the environmental field (many of which come to class as guest speakers). However, be prepared for a fast-paced, at times frenetic learning environment and some potential difficulties in coordinating with clients.",
    "For other Divinity Students, I would warn them that a reasonable background in climate science\/advocacy\/communications would help. TO go in cold, without a firm foundation in the science of and movements surrounding climate change would present a steep learning curve.",
    "This could be a high-risk, high-reward class depending on how students react to the instructor and if they like their projects."
