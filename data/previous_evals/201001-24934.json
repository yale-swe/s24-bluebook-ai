   "comments": [
    "An okay course",
    "You're probably taking it because its required. So I should not dissuade you. Please get reference books from the library.",
    "Don't take it unless you love math or really really need to take it.",
    "Math 300 is a course in Real Analysis. That means you pretty much start with defining R, and then prove your way through 1-variable calculus. I would absolutely not recommend this course to another student. It was interesting in the way that it enabled me to think about problems more sequentially and analytically, but I doubt that a 10 hour problem set every week was worth it. I'm not exaggerating, the problem sets typically are that long. Unless it's required or your really get a kick out of proofs, I would not recommend this course. However, Professor Le is helpful in office hours, and is flexible about when to meet with you.",
    "Take it if you like proofs.",
    "The thing about this class is that everybody is taking it needing to get a good grade to get into an econ PhD program. So everybody is pretty driven, and people who aren't doing well drop throughout the semester. The course really needs a TA to help with the homeworks and provide guidance and support. Triet was great and his office hours were helpful, but they didn't always fit in our schedules and we could have used more professional help. He was already going above and beyond, surely the math\/econ dept's could have sprung for a TA.",
    "Professor Le is not a hugely engaging professor, but he's clear and straightforward in lecture, as well as very available for office hours and extra help. He teaches well, even if class is sometimes a little boring. Class notes are online, so make sure you read those--the course doesn't follow the textbook all of the time, and the notes themselves are very helpful for understanding the material and doing the homework. Problem sets are easier if you have someone to work with, and the professor is generally helpful at office hours (as are the other students). This class isn't easy, but it's not as much work as I thought it would be, especially compared to other math classes.",
    "Pretty difficult class. Heard from my friends that even though 301 has harder material, the professor is better and the tests are actually easier.",
    "I really liked this class! You learn a lot of cool stuff and the homework is fun. Prof. Le is a really good teacher, but I guess he's going to be gone next year."
