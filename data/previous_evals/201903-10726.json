    "Learned how to better make connections across historical works and how they pertain to modern-day discussions and political issues.",
    "Learned a ton about Greek and Roman history and ancient political philosophy. Also developed writing skills.",
    "Historical analyses and speaking skills in class.",
    "I learned about the roots of Western historical and political thought and how different thinkers reacted to key moments and shifts in history.",
    "I learned how to read critically and how to approach historical thought with a political edge.",
    "I feel like I received a very solid education on the theory and development of history in the classical world. I enjoyed learning to adopt a more editorial stance towards history and evaluate the influence of philosophy on history.",
    "Analytical reading",
    "I gained a strong background in the historical and political thinkers of the Western canon, and my writing skills improved throughout this course.",
    "Key differences between the historical methods of various hellenistic writers, the intersections between religious thought and the historical, political, and moral ideals of the time, and beliefs around ideal leadership, warfare, and political institutions.",
    "I learned a lot about Greek and Roman history, as well as Western political philosophy. My writing became more cogent and I gained valuable essay-writing skills.",
    "How to draw connections between different historians",
    "I developed my ability to critically read history and link events and personalities together. The latter was my favorite part of the course; I enjoyed analyzing how characters shape events.",
    "Connecting various modes of thought across different texts."

   "comments": [
    "Wish that there were female voices on the syllabus- it's hard to go an entire semester without seeing yourself represented in the works you read. However, I think the professor did a good job of pointing this out and trying to make the course relevant.",
    "Felt both discussions and lectures were very hit or miss, and as the semester progressed, discussions became very slow with a general lack of participation. This reflects more on the vibe between people in the section than on Prof. Renaud he very much tried to spark discussion, but oftentimes only a few people would add anything. Perhaps applying the text to larger political or historical questions could prove valuable.",
    "The material obviously is really important, so that's a plus, but I didn't feel that the themes of the class came across as clearly as in other DS courses.",
    "The course is good at touching on big ideas, although we could talk about them more in depth during class.",
    "I wish we spent more time reading the books. It was also hard at times to engage, but that was in part because the class was at 9:00am.",
    "I found the curriculum engaging generally, but some of the earlier material was dry. Trimming reading assignments would have made it more feasible to process each work in detail before coming to class. The material cohered more evidently with the philosophy as opposed to the literature curricula, and much of what we read seemed to be philosophy with few direct historical elements. I don't necessarily suggest a change to that, but it wasn't what I expected from the course.",
    "Organized",
    "The small seminar format is fantastic, and I enjoyed our in-class discussions. The lectures varied in level of engagement. The reading load was very large and could have been minimized without detracting from the class.",
    "I overall enjoyed the course. I think that the coverage of different topics and interesting readings was generally good, and section meetings were helpful in covering the key ideas in each author's writing. I would suggest three areas professors could consider for improvement in the future. First, it would have been helpful at the beginning of the course to share some strategies for reading and note-taking that have worked for students in the past. This would have helped students who have not handled similar reading-loads or such content-heavy courses in high school. Secondly, as far as possible within time constraints, I think that lectures and section discussions could do more to clarify how each author's writing connects to overall course themes. As it stands currently, students had to do a large portion of the synthesis and categorization (how did Aristotle's political theories compare to Livy's, how did the notion of ideal leadership change in different contexts, etc.) on their own. I think professors could have done slightly more in order to facilitate students' understanding of course themes throughout the semester. Finally, the lectures are often quite difficult to follow, even for a student who is fully attentive and trying to take notes. This could be improved by setting out clearer structures and 'signposts' in lectures (e.g. noting the key claims and ideas in the lecture at the beginning of the lecture, and noting as we go through each one), or using presentation slides or more clear\/detailed handouts which correspond more closely to the content of the lecture. Handouts right now are often just collections of quotes, which can be confusing for someone who isn't incredibly clear on what is happening in the lecture at the time. The most useful handouts, I have found, delineate the structure and claims of the lecture as well as the sources\/evidence used. These are more useful for reference and understanding in lecture, and are much easier to study with. I believe addressing that this final problem that I have described in particular would help with the lecture attendance problem DS seems to face.",
    "I really enjoyed the pace and the exposure to different authors and styles. I wish we had had more time to be able to put later texts in conversation with their predecessors.",
    "Strengths a lot of participation and student involvement is required",
    "I found some of the lectures difficult to engage with while some of the others were incredibly fascinating. I think that if the lectures were more consistently interesting the course could be improved. I deeply enjoyed my seminar section; the greatest portion of my understanding of the texts and of history came from there.",
    "Great debates and discussions, loved the subject material and readings. The weakness was that the class was a 9 AM, so discussions sometimes started a little slow."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would, as long as they have adequate time to do the readings and enough time to write a draft of the essay enough in advance that there is time to proofread.",
    "Undoubtedly - I learned a lot and am looking forward to second semester.",
    "This was the least compelling strand of DS, for me. I didn't feel like our discussions were very engaging and insightful. Class was structured very similarly every time we met and made for rather uninspiring mornings.",
    "The topic of H&P is important in understanding the context for Western thought. The class fosters good discussion and the papers were fun to write.",
    "I would recommend this course because the texts we read are very interesting and Prof. Renaud does add an interesting modern edge to the ancient writers we read.",
    "I would always recommend Directed Studies to a prospective student.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I learned a lot from this course, and my writing skills improved throughout the semester.",
    "Yes, dependent on their interests. If someone seems like they would enjoy learning about classics, history, or political thought at a thematic\/broad level, I would definitely recommend this course as an effective way to do so. If they show less interest in these topics, I would think that they would gain much less from the course.",
    "I think that anyone curious about the general shape of Western history and thought from the Greeks to medieval times should definitely take this class! With H&P in particular, what you get is what you put in. Unlike in, philosophy, say, discussion won't save you if you haven't done the reading. The texts demand rigorous attention; if you think as you read (and do the whole reading!), you'll learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I find Directed Studies an invaluable component of my Yale career."
