    "this course provided a great overview of how economics factors into both public health at large and our own personal interest in public health. while i did not come into the class with a strong understanding of econ, susan did a great job explaining the important topics and giving examples that i could grasp. while i was not interested in every since topic we covered and some of the readings were a bit dense, the takeaway was great- i can now apply some basic econ principles to public health.",
    "This course is not a good course for anyone who already has some understanding of economics because it is very basic. It is more of a literature review course than an economics course. We learned very little economic theory or application.",
    "One of the best HPA courses at Yale. Small, great prof, relevant.",
    "The course was great.",
    "Good course! Covered a wide range of topics in health economics. I especially appreciated the fact that you did not need a strong economics background to get by in this course.Size and structure of the class worked out well - I enjoyed having a short lecture at the beginning of class followed by discussion of the week's readings. We also sat in a circle, which was nice.Weekly assignments were manageable and helpful in understanding the readings. However, sometimes it was not clear if we were supposed to provide written answers to all questions, or only to those assigned to our group (by last name).Final paper assignment was also very practical - I found it challenging to stick within the 5 page limit, but this is also very \"real world.\"",
    "excellent course; maybe insist more on the approach on the topic that an economist would have as opposed to someone else at each class",
    "The class is very informative, and probably gave me the most practical skills in health care policy than any other course at YSPH. I love that we looked at real examples of economic theory in practice, and how it truly plays out in policy. I also loved that we focused on reform. AWESOME, AWESOME class.",
    "Strengths: Course Readings were well selected and exemplary of the most important voices in the field for each topic.Weaknesses: Weekly assignments did not seem to improve class discussion. I thought a lot about how this might be helped, but was having trouble figuring out ways students would speak more freely with an informed opinion through the lens of the readings. Some students mentioned that they didn't talk because they were intimated by the way the professor spoke (at a percieved higher level than we understood), but I don't really believe this should get in the way of us talking in disucssion because the asymmetry is always expected. It might help to organize ideas on the blackboard or through slides. In this way, students can walk away with a strong bullet point about each topic. Professor Busch did do this, but for some reason it did not translate into discussion. the ony thing i would add to the curriculum of this class is a thorough 15 minute walk through of the math in some of the readings. In this way, students can walk away with example functions they can use as models in their own papers.",
    "the course was informative, but i would have appreciated more emphasis on techniques and quantitative information."

    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0susan was always responsive and sensitive to the needs and interests of us all. she was available to meet regarding papers and seemed to take an active interest in what we were all doing. i enjoyed the that the first half of every class was dedicated to teaching a lesson and then the second half was to drive the lesson home through examples and discussion of the reading. the workload and the overal set up of the class was great in that we had the ability to basically finish our final paper on our own time schedule which allowed me to balance my semester nicely.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan did a great job of guiding discussions and encouraging student participation.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0She's wonderful. Again, one of the best at Yale. This is a class for adults having conversations about health care economics.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Dr. Busch is a great professor and she teaches health care economics in a way which makes it easy for anyone to understand.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Professor was very willing to meet with students and was open to offering any assistance when necessary. One of HPA's best professors.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Organized, knowledgeable professor. Did a great job structuring class discussions. She was also very interested in making sure that she covered topics that we were interested in (and topics that other classes had previously neglected, like certain topics in health reform). This was great!My only complaint would be more consistent or clearer feedback on homework assignments - the check plus, check, check minus system seemed all over the place. I would receive checks on assignments that I put a lot of work into then received check pluses on so-so assignments.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0she's brilliant and it comes out at each class. course is rich and coherent, i learnt a lot from her. she is very open to questions and one-on-one help outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan Busch is amazing. She asked us what we wanted to learn about, which is so refreshing since other professors have their own agendas. That way, we could tailor the class around what we needed. She is also very much there to be a resource to the student, and help in any way possible, above and beyond what is asked of her. The only thing I would suggest is trying to make the class more interactive in some way.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Great lecturer, excellent readings for the course",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0The professor was reactive to students demand for current topics and interest in some areas versus others. The professor was patient with the class and offered a balance of strictly academic theory, and real-world (sometimes personal) examples of health econ phenomena.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0i liked that the course was very informal, but i wish there was more instruction and introduction to economic theories. also, the material a little too familiar, having taken healthcare finance and delivery."

   "comments": [
    "course provided a good overview of healthcare economics and allowed students with a varying background to learn at different levels. no specific background in econ is required and the professor is good about making sure everyone is on the same page. additionally, we are able to explore our own interests in the final paper (worth 50% of our grade) which made the class much more interesting, at least for me.",
    "I would not recommend this course to someone who is interested in economics or had already taken any economics course.",
    "This course covers a wide range of health economics issues and the small class size facilitates discussion well.",
    "Take it!",
    "This course was great. I would recommend it to anyone in the health policy division.",
    "Great topic based course in health economics. Well structured, interesting material, and a manageable amount of work. Small class size was great as well. I would recommend this course to students in HPA or HMP with a general interest in health economics - but also to students outside of these divisions who are curious about the topic. No need to have a very strong economics background - you're not excepted to know formulas nor must you come in already knowing theories.",
    "it's really fulfilling and makes you very interested in health economics!",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in applying economic theory to practical, real-world, health policy issues that you are sure to encounter as a health professional.",
    "Excellent opportunity to bridge economic theory and thinking with the latest policy questions revolving around health and medical care",
    "I would definately recommend this course for all students in the MPH program because its almost like a current affairs course in public health. The American health system is a business, and economists define everything from international aid, CMS, HHS, CBO spending to insurance actuarial models, and hospital device acquisition\/patient admission strategy. MPH professionals are expected to know the authors discussed in this class and understand why the healthcare decision-making climate is shifting away from the traditional model to social behavioral models.",
    "i think that it builds on microeconomics well and is a good introduction to health economics. i would recommend this course to those students with budding interest in health economics."
