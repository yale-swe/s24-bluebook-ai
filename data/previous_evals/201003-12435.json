   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this class. Professor Sabe Colom is incredible and the class was very helpful for my spanish.",
    "I would recommend it only if you really want to learn Spanish fast, and have a base in it or another romance language or are really good at learning languages because the material flies by and it's easy to get behind.",
    "If you can fit it into your schedule, take this class. So much less painful than taking two semesters, and I can actually say that I really enjoyed it. If you struggle with lots of memorization or work very slowly, the workload may be too much. Otherwise, it's an EXCELLENT class. So so so happy I decided to take intensive instead of regular.Also, Lourdes is the nicest professor I've had at Yale. She isn't a super easy grader, but you'll be very happy to have her. She's helpful, cares about her students, and is always cheery in the morning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I took Latin in high school and hated it, but this class showed me that language classes can actually be fun. If you want to learn Spanish quickly, this course is for you.",
    "I would however, only if you are truly willing to put time into it. I was never one to work every night learning vocab and putting in the time and so it became more difficult at the end. However, the people in the class are generally really hard working and the curriculum especially with Lourdes Sabe-Colom was really really great. Fun activities and engaging activities. However, an hour and forty minutes is a lot every day and there is a lot of information -- take it if you are truly willing to devot time!",
    "I would strongly recommend SPAN 125 provided that you know another Romance language or Latin, or have taken Spanish before. The pace of the class is challenging if you already have a grasp of the grammar and vocabulary of a related language, but it would probably be too fast if you were learning absolutely from scratch.It is important to know that this class will probably give you 3 or 4 times the grammar and vocab knowledge and speaking ability, not twice as much, as L1. This alone justifies the amount of class time \/ homework time every day. On the other hand, if you're considering taking this class and are short on credits, you should also be aware that L1-L2 in differentsemesters is 3 credits, but this class is only 2 (although it should be more given the class and homework time).",
    "1 hr and 40 mins a day of class.1 hr or less of hw. Class goes by quickly and is a lot of fun. Best way to learn Spanish at Yale. If u want to learn Spanish take this course with Lourdes!",
    "This course is a tour-de-force for the Spanish department. It is what it is, which is a difficult course that will pay huge dividends in your knowledge of Spanish. Speaking Spanish two hours a daywith a fluent professor who is unbelievably engaging is quite something, and I am shocked by how much I learned. Indeed, I was surprised two weeks into the course by how much I learned, and how I could already converse to some degrees with my suitemates in Spanish. If you want to learn Spanish quickly and are willing to put in extra time and effort, take it. It's not impossible, but you will have an hour to two hours of work each night. I can't vouch for people who haven't taken a romance language before, but if you have a high level in another romance language, it's quite doable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is planning to make a fast and strong start with Spanish. The amount of material covered and the fast pace of learning was the ideal way to start and build up an elementary language.",
    "Only take it if you're really dedicated to not just the language, but the class. It's a big time commitment if you actually want to learn and maintain the material. 2 hours a day, 5 days a week of class alone can be pretty grueling. Professor Sabe-Colom is engaging, but the activities get pretty routine and repetitive pretty quickly. I thought she was an understanding and accessible professor. Seriously though. Take it only if you are willing to make the time commitment, enjoy memorizing lots of things, and really really care about doing well in the class. You definitely learn a lot of Spanish by the end of the semester."
