    "Each week we would read a new chapter from Vol. 70 of Reviews in Mineralogy& Geochemistry, Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Water-Rock Interaction. We choose a chapter on which to present at the beginning of the semester. We also had a group project that required us to solve a simple problem using the program EQ3\/6. I would recommend this course to any student interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Besides the principles of water-rock reaction, we also learned the EQ3\/6 software, which could be used to model the water-rock reaction process.",
    "It was a good idea especially with class project but would have been better maybe with more discussion or focused reading of specific sections and not all chapter.",
    "This course covers many key questions of water-rock interaction which is very common in geochemistry study. For anyone studying low-temperature geochemistry, I think it is necessary to take this course. I would recommend G&G761 to fellow student."

    "This course strengthens my understanding of water-rock reaction and EQ3\/6 software will definitely help me interpret my experimental results to some degree. Along with the relevant papers,this course serves as a powderful guide for my research.",
    "Gave me foundations of mineral precipitation which is important for my research.",
