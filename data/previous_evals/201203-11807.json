   "comments": [
    "Unless you have an interest, no.",
    "I offer a tepid recommendation - but only to classicists or those who love military history.",
    "Take it if you're interested in western civilization.",
    "It's a really good survey of the period from Mycenaean Greece up to just before the time of Alexander the Great. I would recommend it to anyone interested in ancient history, or anyone who needs a humanities credit.",
    "Great class. A few spine-tingling lectures. Not a huge workload. Very fair in their grading of exams.",
    "A solid political history course taught by a brilliant lecturer. I found the material very interesting, although some of my friends complained that it was dry and boring. The workload of the course varies; during the first few weeks the reading was very manageable, and then suddenly, when we were supposed to read Thucydides, the amount of reading increased by ~300 pages a week and never quite returned to its initial level. While I did all the readings, I know that many people that didn't, and they most likely did fine with just paying attention each week in lecture.",
    "Ancient Greek History will leave you edified. If you want to understand the origins of Western civilization, this class is for you.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is well-taught and provides you with a good knowledge of Greek civilization, which can be very enlightening in everyday life. It is quite a bit of reading, but worth it if you are interested in obtaining useful knowledge.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "The course is a basic history lecture course. Kagan is of course very knowledgeable about everything Greek, but you will not get much more out of going to lecture than you would just watching the lecture online.You will come out with a good understanding of Ancient Greek History, which is fascinating, and it is always more interesting to go to class in person than to just watch it online as then you can ask questions! The paper is relatively easy as long as you choose a good topic.I would also definitely recommend taking the section!It helps a lot. You learn more and you have a TA there to help you out whenever you need one.(especially useful when studying, writing the paper and such)Also as long as you show up to section and participate a bit, you'll get those 10% of participation grade without too much effort!",
    "I'd strongly recommend this class to anyone who'd like to have a comprehensive knowledge of the ancient Greek history. Definitely a must-take at Yale!",
    "I'm glad I took this course, only because I think it's an important chunk of history to really understand. The paper isn't too tough and week-to-week the workload is fine. However, lectures with Kagan can be a bit dry and the exams require a TON of memorization.",
    "Yes. Amazing- you've probably already read many glowing reviews. Just do it.",
    "It was a good class, but I would recommend it with caution. Make sure you're at least semi-interested in the material because it's almost impossible to listen in lecture if you're not. Definitely keep up on the reading because it's definitely impossible to do well without doing the reading as you go along. Also make sure you're in a good section. Overall it gives a really good overview to Ancient Greek history, which anyone interested in history should consider extremely important.",
    "Take this class. The work is manageable, the Ancient Greeks are absolutely fascinating, and the privilege of learning from a figure as esteemed as Kagan is one you don't want to forgo. The reading materials assigned are also a joy to work with, and the wealth of primary sources covered makes this the consummate History class that anyone with even a hint of interest in the discipline would love.",
    "Yes. If you want to learn about Ancient Greece and are willing to commit yourself, I highly recommend this class.",
    "A great course - very informative! It is heavy weighted towards the Persian and Peloponnesian Wars, but there is some 5th Century Cultural content as well. There is a lot of reading required to keep up with the lectures, but it is worth it. Professor is hugely knowledgable! He is not very approachable if you have a query, but the TA's are fantastic and really enthusiastic. The final very quite stressful, purely because of teh amount of information needed to be memorised, particularly for the ID's. On the whole a great course though. I feel I have learnt a lot.",
    "i would definitely recommend it. great class",
    "Donald Kagan: the man, the legend. Ancient Greek History is a good class overall. TA David Kimel was excellent and Kagan is an engaging lecturer. He does sometimes let his global warming denial and love of true American freedom creep into his lectures, but he mostly stays on topic. It was disappointing that he didn't even go in to the Peloponnesian war, because of time constraints. The exams are not too difficult and the paper is manageable if you pick a good topic. I will tell you to take this class, but be warned that you'll be left with more than a little melancholy watching Donald Kagan get up there and belt his little heart out twice per week, for an audience that could fit in a room 1\/6th the size of the WLH auditorium, an audience that gets smaller every year. Just thinking about how he used to get applause after every lecture, and this year people stopped giving it after the first few classes. Ifthat doesn't make you cry a little bit inside, I don't know what will.He used to rule the world..."
