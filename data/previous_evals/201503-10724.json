    "This course provides both a theoretical and practical introduction to Digital Humanities from an interdisciplinary perspective. I would recommend this course to another student if they have a project in mind and\/or if they just want to learn more about the DH turn.",
    "The Mellon Seminar in the Digital Humanities has been an all-inclusive look into the discipline, starting from the rigorous theoretical engagement; to the introduction of an imagination about what technology can do for the humanities; to the pragmatics of actually getting ones hands dirty and trying some of these tools out. It has been about the embodied, the disembodied, and the in-between, a lively engagement with the critical, personal, ethical, material embeddedness of being and digitality.",
    "A good intro to Digital Humanities literature, excited to get to practical stage next semester."

   "comments": [
    "The DH project that I will work on next semester addresses some of the central questions I am asking through my dissertation except in novel ways.",
    "The big tent of the digital humanities has indeed been ever expanded with Inderpal and Laura. I am thinking both critically and personally about the digital humanities, and I may have never been able to do so without the safe space they engendered, and without the courage they instilled within me.",
    "The course did help me understand the theory and field of DH much better. However, I think with further exploration of the methods and the practice, I would be able to broaden my understanding. I am hoping to begin a working chapter for my dissertation from this project so my hope is with the existing knowledge from this past semester, and more focus on practice this coming semester, I can have a really strong project to build on for my future work.",
    "Will help my third chapter of my dissertation."
