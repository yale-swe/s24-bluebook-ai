    "Changed the way I think of music and the world. Also the first musicology class I ever enjoyed.",
    "This course raised (and aptly grappled with) a lot of very interesting and important issues in the field, including some crucial self-reflective ones--a really worthwhile course. I think the most striking takeaway for me was learning about the legacy of Nazi ideology as it affected American musicology.",
    "This course presented varied and important perspectives on the music of Nazi Germany (and related issues) that can potentially be methodologically useful to work in other genres. The practice of writing AMS-length abstracts for our final papers was also particularly welcome and helpful."
