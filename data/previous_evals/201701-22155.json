    "Appreciated the lectures foregrounding discussion. They were very informative. Enjoyed the presentation and Canvas posting model of the course.",
    "Strengths: The instructor's lectures in the classes are very helpful for me to see the general picture of anthropological approaches to certain topics. The assigned readings are both relevant and interesting. Aspects to improve: maybe some additional readings might be added to the syllabus as suggested reading, so that the students of this course can delve deeper into the topics that interest them.",
    "My only suggestion is to carve out a little bit more time for discussion among students. This could be achieved by making the course a little bit longer or by reducing the lecture by 10-15 minutes, though the lectures were very useful."
