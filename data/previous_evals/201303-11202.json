    "yes, but it is stressful!",
    "A fabulous course to strategic thinking and problem solving in global health. You'll learn to appreciate the importance of evidence-based policymaking and full problem analysis. Elizabeth Bradley is a rockstar.",
    "It's a good class. Bradley is an incredible lecturer. You learn a ton from the presentation and strategy paper. I'd recommend it.",
    "This course is a lot of work. Regardless, this course is incredible and I would recommend it to any student who is interested in global health or public policy. The class in interesting, you will learn a lot, and the group project and final paper really solidify the lessons that you learned in the course. Take this course!",
    "If you are willing to put the work into this course I think this course is definitely worth taking. You learn some pretty valuable skills, especially presentation skills, and get to better see how what we learn in class can be applied to the real world. Be aware though, this is a time intensive course towards the second half of the semester with presentations and papers being due around the same time.",
    "its informative, will help you grow, etc. but it is a LOT of work. A bit hypocritical in some cases, ideas are attacked and get used to people hating on your hard work. A life lesson but somehow bad ideas still got presented...",
    "A class that teaches you the key steps to logical decision making and then throws you into the gauntlet to prove you understand how to practice what you learned. Challenging group project and strategic paper may leave you feeling like you tried all you could and still didn't come away with the grade you wanted, but you will leave the course with a greater understanding of grand strategy.I recommend this course for the eager global health or business-intrigued student, not for the GPA-obsessed or for the faint of heart.",
    "I would recommend this class to students interested in global health. It provides people will good practice on how to approach global health problems and the background work and attention to detail that goes into designing and implementing solutions.",
    "yes. but be aware it is a lot of work.",
    "YES -- definitely take it! There's not other global health class like it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone seriously interested in global health and\/or grand strategy.The main focuses of this course are the group presentation and the final paper. Both of these projects are incredibly time-consuming and push you to consider every little detail in the topics that you end up choosing. This can be very frustrating and at the same time rewarding when you finally present\/turn-in the final product. This course taught me frame a global health issue in a very structured way (which could be a good or a bad thing - mostly in the end though, I recognized that it was a good thing).Prof. Bradley is a good professor and lecturer, willing to engage in conversation and providing some valuable (although sometimes harsh) feedback.",
    "The course is a crash course on how to create and sell lukewarm strategy to important people in global health who have probably tried similar soggy strategies. Only take if you actually want to be a global health practitioners. Otherwise, save yourself the trouble.",
    "I think if you are interested in Global Health then yes. Otherwise, you may find this course dull.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to a student who is interested in global health, is interested in honing his\/her presentation skills, and who likes to solve problems."
