    "Feminist Fictions is a FANTASTIC class, and I think everyone with an interest in feminism and\/or literature should take it. The books and essays on the syllabus are all absolutely incredible, and Professor Homans is wonderful. The theory and discussion can be a little bit lofty sometimes, but it always comes back down to something concrete.",
    "In Feminist Fictions, Professor Homans has put together and incredible syllabus of engaging and important information for English and WGSS majors alike. This is a course that allows us to delve deep into some of the most formative literature for women, ever. It really feels so crucial. I encourage men to take this course! It would be much more interesting with a male perspective.",
    "A LOT of reading, and Professor Homans is a tough grader on papers. If you can't read a novel or two a week, then this is not the class for you. But the readings are worth doing, and the seminar format invites engagement with these often challenging texts.",
    "Read the syllabus - if you're not interested in the books, don't put yourself through them. But I personally just wanted to get a chance to read about feminism, so it was enjoyable, especially because of the intimate class size. Professor Homans has a great deal to offer.",
    "This is no history course, and it isn't a survey course in the proper sense either. You'll alternate between feminist essays and novels from the 19th century to present day (though present day is really just the 1990s). Close reading is encouraged at the beginning of the term, but we spent most of our time reading for political arguments. If you have any background at all in LGBT studies or queer theory, it's a rewarding and interesting course. If you're no expert on any of that and just interested in feminism, you'll still like it. Professor Homans is a formidable feminist critic in her own right. She led discussion with a healthy dose of skepticism and humor, and she went to great pains to make sure students got the most out of the few short papers she requires.",
    "A solid English and\/or WGSS class. The small class size is great, Prof. Homans is great and so accessible! There is a fair amount of reading (though by no means excessive for an English class), but the three papers are super manageable.",
    "This class is a survey of French, British, and American feminisms as they evolved through fiction. It's a lot of reading, but if you have time in your semester, it's worth the work. Check out the syllabus before deciding - if you've read at least a few of the books, you'll be in a much better place for the course. Professor Homans is demanding but very fair and kind. Basically, it's a great class, but it might be difficult if your brain isn't wired towards analyzing literature.",
    "I think this class depends very much upon the mix of students in the seminar. I found the readings difficult and sometimes depressing or offensive. I think it could be wonderfully productive to work through such material with the right group of people. However, Homans has a somewhat hands-off approach to section, so this is not a sure-fire hit."
