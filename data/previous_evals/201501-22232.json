    "I would recommend if you are interested in malaria - but also failed eradication efforts and global health. Very history based so be prepared.",
    "You will leave knowing all the ins and outs of malaria.",
    "HSHM 437 is a class that describes the disease cycle and social, political, economic, and biological effects of malaria on the world. As much as it teaches you about malaria, it also makes you aware how much more there is to learn and how complex it really is. I would recommend this as a junior seminar for HSHM majors or others who find this subject matter interesting. It can be quite a bit of reading and work with reading responses and a long final paper.",
    "Would recommend for any HSHM major looking for their junior seminar requirement. Might be a bit more work than wanted if you were looking for an easier elective-type class.",
    "Take this if you can! Professor Snowden is an incredible scholar and a great person and classes with him are a real joy. Bear in mind that this is by no means going to be easy, though!",
    "An interesting class on the history on malaria taught by the brilliant Professor Snowden. It is probably more suitable for people with previous generalist experience in global health who are looking for a case study through the lens of malaria -- do not take this as an introductory course to global health issues. I did find malaria to be a sufficiently interesting disease to maintain my interest throughout the whole semester. Seminar was very chill, almost too chill for my liking. However, be warned: the final 20-25 page paper will stress you out the entire semester, and even then you realistically won't start it until the week before. Overall a reasonably good class if you want a global health case study that beautifully illustrates principles that you learned in more introductory global health classes."
