    "I think some people might initially be skeptical of this course, but if you open your mind you can apply the ideas discussed to so many contexts. This course completely warped the way I think about not only sustainability, but about people who construct rules and those who must abide by them.",
    "cool class!",
    "I would recommend this class. I had my doubts going in but it turned out well. Professor Fotos is a fun, relaxed professor. There is way too much reading assigned but you can get away without doing it all. You have to do a weekly memo which wasn't difficult and really helped with discussion. The first draft of your final paper is due really early which might be a good thing if you tend to leave everything until the last minute. Fotos was easy to approach. Take this class if you are interested in sustainability and conservation issues and why some institutions end up working and some don't.",
    "Democracy and Sustainability is a seminar that tries to tackle the issue of how we make policies to solve environmental problems. There is a large focus on the Maine lobster fishery and other New England fisheries, but there is also a week on climate change and one in which we discussed the question of the course--the issue of reconciling democracy and sustainability, using Chinese population policy as an example. Michael Fotos is a great professor. He is very organized in class: the seminar was a nice balance of prepared lecture and guided discussion. Professor Fotos is very willing to meet for office hours or talk by email. He is enthusiastic about both his subject and his students, which is refreshing.If this subject is just something you find just a little bit interesting, then it is probably going to seem like too much work (weekly one-page essays, heavy amounts of reading, and a term paper) and perhaps a little intimidating because most of the students in the class are EVST and PLSC majors who have taken related courses. That said, I would definitely recommend Democracy and Sustainability to someone who may be interested in these topics for major\/career because I found it one of my most worthwhile classes.",
    "Democracy and Sustainability is a great course especially for those interested in environmental management\/policy, etc. Be aware that most of the course is focused on fisheries management and institutional governance surrounding fishing. The point is that fisheries management is very applicable to sustainability issues on the larger, global scale, but it does turn out to be very fish-focused. Fotos is a wonderful professor who cares about his students and keeps the class very interesting. Workload is not bad either, just weekly readings with 100 word memo responses and one 12-15 page term paper on a topic of your choice.",
    "Take this class! A couple things to keep in mind before you sign up however: this class isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about democracies recycling and although the syllabus talks about the one-child policy and climate policy, much of the class is devoted to Northeast lobster and groundfish management. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in fisheries policy however, this class is fantastic and most of the work comes from the final paper, which you begin working on early in the semester and can pick on a topic of your choice so you can really delve into whatever subject you are interested in. There is a also a lot of emphasis on framework for effectively governing a commons \u00e2\u0080\u0093 political theory and framework that is interesting and useful for any type of management. Professor Fotos is a wonderful teacher who really cares about his students and about the material.",
    "This course has potential, and is probably worth shopping, but from my experience I can't recommend it. It is mostly about fishery policy and the theory of managing common pool resources. This is an interesting topic and many of the reading are interesting. However the discussion for me was so unhelpful every week, I did not learn much from the class itself. Past years had better reviews, but this year the combination of the group of people and Foto's relaxed and occasionally unfocused seminar management made for un-useful seminar each week.On the plus side, Fotos is really sweet and knowledgable and accessible, and the material is quite worthwhile. So if you have an interest shop it, and if the discussion pans out this could be a fantastic class. If not, you will end up with what I got. Interesting readings that you won't do all of because there are too much of them, useless class time, helpful one-on-one meetings, and an open ended paper topic which for me was very educational.",
    "This class came highly recommended to me but I have to admit I am confused as to why. The material is very dry and largely uninteresting. The readings are brutal. Fotos is really nice and loved this subject but it can't make up for the material. I don't recommend it.",
    "Be sure to read the syllabus and know what you're getting yourself into before you sign up. The workload is very manageable but the readings are absurd, and although there are mentions of the One Child Policy and Climate Change, the class is truly about fishing. It's all about fish. And Elinor Ostrom. Professor Fotos is very passionate about the conservation of marine fisheries and very knowledgeable on Ostrom's theory, so if you are interested too, then this is definitely the class for you. It's not a class on sustainability as a broad topic, but rather the sustainability of marine fisheries. Bare that in mind.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for anyone interested in policy, advocacy or natural resource management. While we focus largely on fisheries, the the lessons and IAD framework are extremely translatable to other fields and challenge students to think about problems in a completely new light.",
    "Anyone interested in the environment should take this. A lot of reading but the topics are engaging and Fotos is wonderful.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in fisheries. The course title and description are a bit misleading, but the syllabus says it all. The final paper is onerous, and the assignment is somewhat unclear so be prepared to go to office hours (professor Fotos is very willing to help if you ask). The political theory can be dense at times, but you don't necessarily have to understand all of it, since the grade is mostly your final paper. Bottom line: this course is not necessarily a lot of work, but if you want to get anything out of it it will be. Do not take it unless you are genuinely interested in fisheries. If you are it's great."
