    "ENGL 121 with Professor Spillane is an amazing class for those interested in art. Through the lens of writing, you approach contemporary figurative art in a manner that is engaging for the art history major, but also surprisingly accessible for those toying with art\/art history for the very first time.Perhaps what's most remarkable are the things you do beyond the classroom. We visited the Met and the Brooklyn Museum as a class. We met NY Times head art critic Roberta Smith as well as the British artist Hew Locke in class. We had frequent classes in the art gallery and the British Art Center. We even had the opportunity to pitch an acquisition to YUAG and YCBA. You don't get these opportunities in many other classes.As for the workload, you have a draft to hand in every week. You might find yourself in a mad dash towards the end of each week, scrambling to complete a 2-6 page piece, but otherwise, the workload isn't to bad. It's a great introduction to the art of seeing, as well as an excellent writing course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It improved my writing a lot and make me more confident in my writing abilities. The class was also very interesting because we learned about a variety of artists such as Francis Bacon, Jenny Saville, Phillip Guston, Jack Levine, Paula Rego and many many more.",
    "It is a class that anyone interested in art should take!",
    "In this class, you learn how to write (mostly) art criticism. We discussed many elements of a good critic and the writing style encouraged in the class was very journalistic."
