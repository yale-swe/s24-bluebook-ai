    "best class ever. tom and turner kick ass",
    "It was fun. Tom is here once a week. Turner generally likes anything that you do, which makes me miss harsh critics like Petit. TAs were extremely helpful. We got to deal with site and actually program a lot more (which didn't happen in my junior year), and it was exciting.",
    "Studio. Make things.",
    "only arch majors. enjoy this semester.",
    "It's a fun studio, a lot more free than past studios. You probably have to take it anyway, so relax with it and give yourself a lot of freedom in the projects.",
    "Do it, you won't regret it.",
    "Way more relaxed than junior year (let's be honest, you've earned it). Turner is great. Do try to get something worthwhile out ofthis class though, Turner doesn't ask for much work, but his criticism is really valuable so pay attention and don't just coast through it.",
    "This design studio is focused on pushing students outside of their typical design styles. It consists of three projects throughout the semester, the final project is nearly half the semester. I would recommend this studio to those in the architecture major."
