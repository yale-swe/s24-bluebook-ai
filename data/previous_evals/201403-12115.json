    "Everything you read about this class is true. The workload is huge, you will spend your breaks writing lab reports and you still have to study for the final after all that. It's unlikely that you will find a harder class at Yale in terms of workload. I feel that I have gotten a lot out of the class (it would've been ridiculous not to, after all the hundreds of hours I spent on it), and Vaccaro is great, but it does not justify all the time I had to spend on the class. Seriously, if you want to do well, do NOT procrastinate. Only take the class if you have to, or if you're masochistic.",
    "CHEM 330L is tough. The labs aren't the hard part: the reports are. However, I enjoyed my time in the lab and learned a great deal about all the experiments we conducted. The amount of work is ridiculous and most of the weeks of my semester were spent thinking about CHEM 330L. If you take this class, make a lot of room for the heavy workload.",
    "really not worth it. at one point it just felt like you are not getting anything out of the class anymore. i don't mind a demanding class that actually teaches me something. I have definitely learnt a whole lot in this class but the workload is just not proportional to what I reaped. it s like you are a worker in a factory trying to assemble a radio or something, you cant miss any component in your final product (aka the lab report) but you are not actually thinking, just following a format. the grading is very arbitrary and you don't get feedback in time to improve. the professor and the TAs are incredibly nice and helpful though. it's just the assessment structure was frustrating.",
    "It's no secret that this class is hard. It is. And if you're reading this you probably don't have much of a choice in taking it. But it is also manageable. I cannot stress how important it is to start labs early (like immediately...like get back from class and at least record your data). This is not a \"don't try to do it the night before because then you'll have to pull an all-nighter\" warning...for certain labs, if you start even four days before, you will probably average about 3-4 hours of sleep per night. Seriously, get the data analysis mostly done as soon as you can, and give yourself at least a week to finish it and write the report (that way you can spread the workload out for minimal stress). It won't really make the labs easier, but it will make things much less awful the days leading up to the due date. The good news is that the lab tied in very well with the class (chem 332)! I'm glad I took them concurrently because my knowledge from both helped me in each class. Also very important...don't be afraid to ask for help. The TAs this year were great and they understood what we were going through (they all had to do the labs as well). Dr. Vaccaro is also a good resource, although I would recommend trying to see if the TAs can help first. Good luck!",
    "hahahahahahahahahahahahaha oh my god.",
    "Physical chemistry lab is one of the most demanding courses I have ever taken as a student. Though it is challenging, it is certainly not difficult. While it is true that there is quite a bit of work for a 1 credit class, the amount of time given between lab reports should make them manageable. As long as you do not procrastinate and leave the lab reports to the last possible minute, the workload should be doable.",
    "This class is A LOT of work. Don't underestimate it, though you probably will in the beginning. It's very stressful and tons of work, and there will be times when you're sick of writing your report and you will cry. But in the end, you will probably come out stronger and you'll learn a lot (hopefully). What doesn't kill you definitely makes you stronger. You WILL get through this. I promise.",
    "It is exactly what you think it will be. More work than you can believe, and it does seem quite pointless at times. Beware the data analysis! But you have to take it, so make the best of it. It's physically impossible to finish reports if you start them the day before - 40 pages is a reasonable length for the later labs. Definitely start at least four days before the lab is due, do the data analysis first, and then write the thing. Learn to use Excel; it will be both your only friend and your most bitter enemy. SAVE EVERYTHING because losing data would be the worst. At least the final isn't that bad if you've been paying attention. And you get to learn how to use an oscilloscope! You can survive, the grading is fair if you put in the effort they want from you.",
    "Write. Write. Drink Coffee. Write. Cry. Drink more coffee. Write. Write. Cry. Consider selling my soul to the devil in exchange for this being done. Write. Edit. Cry. Give up and turn in. Rinse with tears and repeat 4 more times. If you do not have to take this class, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Great introduction to physical chemistry and you see the techniques behind everything you've learned so far, like how a bomb calorimeter actually works. Beware of the final. It is literally nothing like the practice, no matter what the instructor says. Also, pretty sure I wrote over 150 pages of lab reports. Excellent course, though I wish it counted as a writing credit. If you are weak, then you may want to avoid this course.",
    "If you're taking PCHEM lab, you probably have to take it. It's a really hard class and the lab reports are ridiculously long. After at least one lab report, I finished writing it and started crying from relief and just plain being overwhelmed. That being said, if you ask the TAs they will definitely help you out with anything you're struggling with, and the lab lectures teach pretty difficult physics and chemistry concepts in a clearly understandable way.",
    "... It's so bittersweet. That's the best way I can explain this class. I learned so SO much but it's such an obscene amount of work. Typing 140-180 pages of text, graphs, figures, and tables is more work than all my other classes that semester combined. It's ridiculous. But I learned so much. Vaccaro is an amazing lecturer and the TAs were so accessible. I can't fault anyone. The course itself just demands so much.",
    "You know it's going to be hard if you've read the other reviews. But listen, it's not all that complicated, it's just a lot of time. Start your lab reports a week before they are due if you can because they take a whole week to do. Be warned that if you don't leave enough time to write the reports they will be very stressful and your other classes will suffer. On the other hand, they are certainly doable; the hardest part is actually doing them. You will get through this! When you finish you will be able to crank out lab reports like a boss and perhaps also walk on hot coals (untested).",
    "A LOT of writing. The TA's are great, and they're helpful during the lab, but the write-up is still confusing a lot of times, and\/or it takes a lot of time to do data analysis.",
    "This class is really fantastic and interesting and to say that you learn a lot is a great understatement. That being said, it is actually an atrocious amount of work. I am not kidding about this: there are 5 hours of class a week + 5 quizzes + 5 lab reports + a final. Each lab report requires many hours analyzing data, 10 to 15 written pages that require not just regurgitation but also a good deal of thinking, and at least that many pages of figures and tables that must be nicely formatted. You will think that its not a lot of work at the very beginning and then you will quickly be proven completely wrong, even if you dont procrastinate at all so dont be fooled. In addition, the things that you are learning are difficult to understand. Each lab report took me between 20 and 30 hours (closer to 30, although I'm probably a bit slower than most people). I know of no other class at Yale that is so much work and you should consider it to be at least 2 credits when you are figuring out your class schedule.",
    "No. As much as I think learning is fun, no not this. Save yourself the years you would shave off of your life through the stress and sleep deprivation inflicted by this class. The lab reports are just too long to actually learn well from them because you're rushing to finish them instead of absorbing the material. The staff is great and ever so helpful, but honestly it would be best to avoid this course if possible.",
    "This class taught me in one semester about as much material as 3 different classes. Its crazy how much you learn, and its impossible to comprehend how much work this is until youre spending every waking hour in a week on your lab reports. You probably have no choice as to whether or not you can take this class. Or, if youre chemical engineering, this class will probably decide for you whether or not you go ABET. Your grades in your other classes will suffer when taking this course, unless you are that person that doesnt use any grace days on reports. Space your grace days out. Plan your schedule around this class. If you enjoy learning, this is an awesome class, but the work can make that learning feel like its not worth the pain.",
    "A required class for the ChemE ABET (and please only take this class if it is required). The lab reports consumed my entire life this semester, and also slightly lowered my grades in my other four classes because I always had less time to study for them. Looking back, I probably could have spent a little bit less time on the reports and sacrificed some points to gain back considerable hours into my weekly schedule. Every review will say this, but I'll say it again: DO NOT procrastinate on your reports. I saved my five \"grace days\" until the very end of the semester, pulling all-nighters if I had to, and this was a really good strategy. The end of the semester is always hectic, and having extra time on those last two reports was crucial, especially because report 4 has a ton of tedious data analysis and report 5 is on NMR which is extremely challenging conceptually (look for good youtube videos online to help out!). I will say that in spite of the unreal workload, this is the most I've ever learned in any Yale course. Furthermore, having done a lot of research, I appreciate how valuable the writing skills you will gain are for the \"real world\". It is incredibly satisfying to print out a 50 page report. My best advice if you have to take this class is keep your head down and just get through it. Find study buddies to commiserate with. People who haven't taken this class truly won't understand how much work it takes to do it well. At the end of the day, though, it's only one semester, and afterwards, you'll feel like you can do anything you put your mind to. Good luck!!",
    "The venerable Physical Chemistry Lab One is a true gemstone Gut class of the chemistry major. If you are looking for an easy gutty science credit class, you should definitely take this class. This class overall teaches a lot of data analysis and error propagation techniques. There are a total of 5 lab reports, which each took about 3 or 4 days to complete. By this I mean, I spent 3 or 4 days doing absolutely nothing but doing the data analysis and writing up the laboratory reports for this class for each report. I would recommend working on the lab reports over Thanksgiving and Fall break, as previous classes have suggested. I unfortunately did not heed this advice. If you can figure out how to not procrastinate, then these reports may be more manageable for you. The lab reports are very straightforward and most of the things you need can be found in the lab packet. The actual labs for this course are relatively interesting and not very difficult. The teaching assistants are very helpful and Professor Vaccaro always drops by to check in on how everyone is doing. The lectures are very clear and help elucidate what is going on in lab and what you need to know for the reports.",
    "This class is an incredible amount of work. If you start the lab reports at a responsible time, you'll still be working around the clock in the final day or two to finish them. If you start them at an irresponsible time, I'm not sure that it's even possible, to be honest. So take this class seriously, and try to get started on the lab reports as soon as possible! It's a great learning experience with an incredible professor and excellent TA's. The workload is obscene, but I don't think Prof. Vaccaro is in the mood to change it.",
    "A lot of work, but very rewarding. The class is well-taught and well-structured. I suppose it is an effect of spending 50+ hours on an assignment, but you gain a sense of accomplishment and pride after finishing each lab report (through the haze of sleep-deprivation) ...and for surviving the class. This class compliments CHEM 332 well (though some people take them separately), but I would carefully consider the workload of your other classes when you take this one. If you stay on top of your work and don't procrastinate, the workload of this class is manageable and not as bad as its reputation. Overall I would recommend this class, but time it carefully.",
    "Tons of work, but you learn a lot about everything."
