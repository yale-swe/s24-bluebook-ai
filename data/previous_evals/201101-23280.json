    "Great to have structured format to pursue write up and presentation of a formal paper. appreciated being in it, and gained value from being exposed to science students doing write ups, data analysis even though i wasn't (non-traditional class member). Increased my science literacy. Great structure for MA project work.",
    "This class' name should be changed to Advanced Research Seminar. I never would have heard or have gone to this class based on the title alone; it does not encompass what the class is really about... advancing our own research that goes well beyond Silviculture.More of these classes should be offered. For example 3 courses: 1 for natural science, a second for social science, and a third for interdisciplinary science.This course has been invaluable in helping students advanced their own research. After taking Research Methods our first semester, there has been NO OTHER guidance in how to analyze, interpret, and write up our data and results.This class should be used as a model to create other classes that give all MESc students the opportunity to advance their research.Mark Ashton is a great professor!",
    "This course a very practical seminar. It provides students interested in research critical tools to undertake excellent scholarship. It also gives the student opportunities to be evaluated several times. This course is what i will personally refer to as hands-on!",
    "7b) Elaine was absolutely incredible and generous. The statistical feedback she provided was unparalleled and extremely important to everyone in this class. Without Elaine this class would still be good, but it wouldn't be half as great.10) This course was critical to the write-up of my degree research. I found the two semesters of this course to be considerably more valuable than Research Methods."

I'm not sure that I would have finished the analysis (let alone finished it properly) without this class!",

   "comments": [
    "Some deadlines second semester.",
    "A schedule for the second semester of the class should be created by the professor at the beginning of the term and distributed. The plan for class was often created the week before, a few days before, and sometimes even the afternoon before class. This reduced student investment and also reduced the quality of what we produced because we couldn't plan ahead.Feedback on drafts sometimes took much longer to be returned than expected\/appropriate. In particular, feedback on colloquium abstracts took a very long time to be sent.The course title should be adjusted so that it is more apparent what the course covers and the course should also be approved to qualify as research credits for MESC and MFS students.I think that the order in which topics are addressed by this seminar should be changed. It would have been most helpful to start the year off by working on statistical analysis and results and to make that the focus of the first semester. The introduction, methods, abstract, discussion, etc. could then have been tackled in the second semester.",
