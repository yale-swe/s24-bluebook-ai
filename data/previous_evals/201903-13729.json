    "Overall the course was well organized and structured. Theories were clearly stated, and examples helped a lot in understanding the significance of theories in the real world. TA sections were extremely helpful. The only improvement could be shortening the time for repetitive homework.",
    "weakness: unorganized & disordered & inconsistent teaching style & confusing annotation",
    "The class was too big. I think the course could have been improved by having multiple smaller sections. In particular, I think splitting the course into graduate and undergraduate students would give graduate students more chances to apply what we learned to our work compared with just having one final project at the end."

    "Underlying statistics \/ theory were more important on the midterm and final than the rest of the course. I was able to do very well on all of the homework but struggled with the exams because of focus much more time on coding compared with the underlying statistical concepts."
