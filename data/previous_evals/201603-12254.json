    "Very interesting subject matter and the teacher was very passionate about the subject.",
    "The main strength of the class is the huge variety of topics and interests offered, as well as the opportunities to actually make ceramics and engage physically with the material. We got to work with the best professional potter in New Haven, who is also the most generous and kind person ever. He helped us with lab sessions and worked with many students on their final projects for experimental or creative work. The only downside could be is that it was very self driven and personal interest based, so it's not an easy class to take without fully engaging in it."

There are so many different angles to take for the class and you don't need to know literally anything about ceramics\/archaeology\/anything to take it. Like art? Take it. Arch major? Take it. Did pottery for a year when you were 10? Take it."
