    "Great course. If you're interested in: public health, gender studies, sexuality studies, anthropology, sociology, etc. take it!",
    "This is a wonderful class. Prof. Reid is so kind and calm but very sharp and witty. I loved being in it and learned so much. Not a terrible workload either.",
    "Interesting topics\/ discussions. Important topic.",
    "recommended, but reid isnt teaching it anymore",
    "One of the easier classes Yale has to offer. 3 papers (5pgs each). One book per week. 1 class presentation about ANYTHING related to HIV.",
    "Highly recommended. Graeme Reid is a great professor and this material is incredibly important to learn. I really hope that even though Professor Reid is leaving, Yale will find someone else to teach a course on this topic.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the subject - the readings are always good, sometimes really really good. Graeme is also the best.",
    "This class is a solid introduction to the most pressing issues around representation of and intervention in African HIV\/AIDS crises. The readings are terrific and will get you thinking about these problems in a nuanced, intersectional way. Certainly take this class if you're a WGSS, African Studies, or Anthropology major, but this class might be even more important for you if you're into global health, international relations, or medicine.",
    "Yes, take it--but only if laptops are no longer allowed in the seminar. It's a great exploration of the topic--thoughtful, not prescriptive."
