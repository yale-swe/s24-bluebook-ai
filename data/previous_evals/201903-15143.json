    "The small class size meant that there were many opportunities to ask questions and receive feedback. Possibly adding an additional blog-post assignment in the first half of the semester would lead to higher engagement early on (since the class met only once a week).",
    "Definitions and concepts were very clear. Expectations were sometimes a little unclear sometimes, but this might have been because the students in the class had different backgrounds and different skill levels. Sometimes it felt like the course outcomes were very introductory, and at other times it felt like we were supposed to have a pretty extensive knowledge of the underlying mathematics."
