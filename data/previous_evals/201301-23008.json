   "comments": [
    "Middle East Exceptionalism asks whether or not the Middle East and North Africa are unique from other regions of the world. Topics include colonialism, religion, violence, women's rights, and democracy. This is a good course for people with no knowledge of the Middle East, but people who have studied a lot about the Middle East may find it a bit repetitive.",
    "I would definitely recommend Middle East Exceptionalism to any student who is interested in the MIddle East region. We discussed politics, gender issues, religion and violence among other things, drawing from political science theory and psychology among other things. Professor Lawrence leads very interesting discussions which are also relaxed and fun.",
    "Take this class because you will learn so much about political science as a discipline (if it is new to you) and the Middle East as a region (even if you have studied it for years). Professor Lawrence is a patient and helpful teacher. She really cares about helping you excel and has very high expectations. Don't expect to come out of the class with concrete answers, but 10,000 questions that would take a lifetime to answer.",
    "Middle east exceptionalism is a very good polisci course. The workload isn't unreasonable (~100 pages of reading per week) and the things we read were generally interesting. Technically, you don't need a background in middle east politics\/history to take the class, though I think it definitely helps. There aren't tests or quizzes, but discussions are fast-paced and highly analytical. Most of the students in the class were juniors or seniors in some kind of polisci field, which facilitated such intense discussion. Consequently, as a freshman with a limited background in polisci and history, I sometimes found it hard to keep up or contribute to discussions. That said, I definitely got a lot out of the class, and professor Lawrence is a very good teacher. Definitely take this class if you're at all interested in politics, global affairs, or the middle east",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the Middle East. But don't take it if you don't like polisci, because it is kind of nit picky",
    "Middle East Exceptionalism is a great class. I took the course because I wanted to know more about the Middle East and wanted an intelligent take on if the ME is exceptional and if so, why. Prof. Lawrence has high standards but is accessible and genuinely cares. Her frankness is refreshing and yet she doesn't attempt to persuade you either way, preferring to allow you to come to your own conclusion.There are three response papers and a final so the workload is definitely manageable. If you are interested in this subject- take it! You'll learn a lot and enjoy the process as you do!",
    "This is a really good course! It was my first seminar at Yale, and it was a very positive experience: Prof. Lawrence leads wide-ranging, substantive discussions that encourage critical engagement with questions of culture, democracy, and change. Though students who know more about the Middle East are generally in a stronger position in a course like this, the class didn't really assume a huge amount of prior knowledge of the region or its political history; nobody should be scared away by the idea that this is an experts-only or a specialists-only course. The workload was very manageable -- less than in any other poli-sci course I've taken -- and the readings were varied and interesting. Very highly recommended."
