    "This is the senior requirement for Computer Science. If you are reading this page, it's likely that this course is a requirement for you. It's a great opportunity, and a good change of pace from some of the less freeform lectures in the Computer Science department. Take it (not only because you may be required to do so)!",
    "Prof. Spielman is a great advisor and it was both a pleasure and an honor to work with him.",
    "It's required for you to complete the major.",
    "It was good. I was working on a project that I found interesting and had an advisor that I liked. If those two conditions are satisfied, you will like it too.",
    "Yes. This is required for computer science majors and can be used to satisfy the senior project component for electrical engineering and computer science majors.",
    "Remember: you either need to do a project a professor wants to do or convince a professor that your project is interesting. No one will support you unless you prove your worth",
    "Very good opportunity to explore a new area of research in the field that you are interested in. The project may end up being much more work than initially anticipated, so keep that in mind when planning the initial idea. Reading others' projects gives an interesting view into the breadth and depth of computer science applications that are present in today's world.",
    "Absolutely! Yale really shines in undergraduate research."
