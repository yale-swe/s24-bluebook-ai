    "If you can write in Hindi, take this class for sure. If you're interested in indian-ish things and\/or languages, then this is worth taking because it's really not that hard. You do about 45 minutes of work per week.",
    "All intro language classes for a classical language seem to follow basically the same pattern -- learning declensions and conjugations, translating sentences. But this is an especially good one, because Professor Brick does a great job of presenting the material, clarifying the book when it's confusing and setting a good tone for the class - not at all stuffy but also not succumbing to the whole \"this is boring but we have to get through it\" thing that often happens with intro language classes. Whether you take the class probably just depends on whether you want to learn Sanskrit, but it is also an especially well taught intro language class."
