    "This is a great course that has helped me get an overview of the almost philosophical questions that underly the way the EU works. It's through understanding the ideas behind everything that has created the institution that we can more fully comprehend why the EU grapples with the issues it does now. Professor Cameron is also super sweet and has a great sense of humor.",
