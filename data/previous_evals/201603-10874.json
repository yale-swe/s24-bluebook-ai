   "comments": [
    "My french really improves in Yale French courses! I think I am now able to use more tenses in my speech and have a wider vocabulary which is exciting. I also just continue to appreciate the beauty of French culture and language.",
    "I learned how to really communicate, read, and write in French. This class improved my skills exponentially. By the last week of class, I was speaking and listening in French, without even noticing it. Furthermore, I came in with almost no reading experience, but by the end of the course, I was reading twenty to thirty pages a night (yes it was a lot, but worth it). We also learned some slang, which will definitely be helpful when visiting a Francophone country.",
    "My French improved significantly during the semester. My speaking abilities and the ability to articulate my thoughts in French developed, as well as my ability to read French and analyze texts.",
    "I managed to improve my French skills a good deal from this course. I think most people who take L4 French, at least in my class, took French at other institutions before Yale and were all coming from different levels of proficiency and comfort. My case was particularly unusual, as I had not taken a French class in 4 years. All in all, I think I improved across all areas: speaking, reading, writing, and theory\/grammar. I also expanded my knowledge of Francophone countries and their respective cultures.",
    "The course covers a good mix of French grammar and literature.",
    "My French unquestionably improved, and I feel a lot more confident reading French stories and articles as well as speaking the language and listening to it.",
    "My French speaking ability improved greatly, as did my reading and writing.",
    "My fluency in French developed rapidly while taking this course.",
    "I gained more confidence in speaking, reading, and comprehending French. I think I really grew in my ability to read more complex texts in French (and then discuss my ideas about them). I also definitely benefitted from the class being run entirely in French, and I felt like I was able to follow everything that was said. I learned new grammar structures (like discours indirect, the multiple uses of devoir, a bit about the literary tenses, pronoms relatives, etc.) and new vocabulary as well.",
    "I increased my grammar skills, french reading skills and conversational skills."

   "comments": [
    "This course had the most fun and engaging readings and movies. I really enjoyed almost everything we read. I wish that there was more speaking practice and cultural excursions.",
    "This class is fabulous as it is. There is the perfect mix of grammar and of reading. Additionally, the class size is perfect, where you can have great conversations with your peers, but also get constant feedback from the professor. One thing that I might change, however, is the testing portion called identifications. This is clearly the hardest part of the exam, as they read a quote from one of the many texts, and you have to answer who said it or who it describes. I am not suggesting getting rid of it because it is hard. Rather, I am suggesting getting rid of it because I dont think it tests our understanding of the material as much as a short essay might.",
    "The strengths: you spend a lot of time speaking, learning, and thinking in French. I have a stronger grasp of the language. The texts were interesting and interactive. The weaknesses: grammar was often confusing and could be elaborated more on.",
    "While I learned a lot from the course and Professor Khoundi was a good teacher, I don't actually care for the structure of this course. I understand that we meet daily for the sake of immersion, but the constant homework and daily time commitment felt more infantilizing than productive. The course materials were frequently more than 10 years old and sometimes had mistakes - all in all, it did not seem like whoever put together the syllabi for French classes put in a lot of effort. This course could really benefit from more carefully thought-out assignments and course materials that are tailored to college students.",
    "This course was very good in that it allowed each student to make improvements based on where they were at the start of the semester to the end.",
    "The strengths of this class are that the texts are really interesting and lead to good discussions and that it is run completely in French, which really helps students grow more comfortable listening to the language. It was helpful having a small class. I also thought having small assignments nightly and tests every other week facilitated learning the language better. This course could be improved by giving students more time to speak I felt like there were days when I barely spoke French at all, which was a problem. I think there should be a greater focus on speaking and a reduced emphasis on some of the grammar. Also, I sometimes felt like each class followed the exact same pattern; there was very little variation in the activities we did each day in class. I think language classes provide opportunities to change things up and have different activities to keep each class unique and engaging.",
    "I think the focus on reading french literature and in class discussions were very beneficial to the course. I think there is to heavy an emphasis on grammar and to little emphasis on conversational skills.",
    "Weakness: Some movies are a bit too old Strength: steep learning curve, easy for non FREN130 students to catch up"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend French classes in general at Yale because the French department is amazing. If you want to learn French and are up for a challenge, take it!",
    "Absolutely. If have any aspirations of speaking French fluently, this class is a must. Not only is it really informative, but it is also highly enjoyable. I looked forward to waking up every morning to going to class, and I dont even think that is an exaggeration. Also, Madame Koundi is an incredible teacher, so I would recommend her sections, but I am sure that all the professors of this class are good as well.",
    "Yes, I would recommend L4. Less work than L3 but my French improved more in this level than in L3.",
    "You will get better at French, but it's tough to come into class daily and do daily homeworks that often feel pointless. Do it if you think that the skills and knowledge you gain are worth your investment of time and mental energy - often into things that feel a bit like busy work.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. To be fair, if you're thinking about taking it you probably have to anyway, but it's a good class.",
    "This course is definitely a challenge and does require a lot of work (in particular, there is a significant amount of assigned reading). However, your French will undoubtedly improve and it was ultimately a very rewarding class.",
    "Yes! If your truly wish to improve your French, this is how to do it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student--having class and homework everyday is a small price to pay for drastically increased competency and fluency in a language.",
    "This is a good class to keep up your French, although it will definitely require a good amount of work. The readings are very interesting, and you will become more comfortable reading longer texts. In my opinion, the course is light on speaking opportunities, but overall I would recommend it. Madame Koundi is really nice and helpful, so definitely take this class with her! She is great.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student, I really enjoyed my professor and the reading material covered.",
    "Yes. The articles and movies of this class are worth reading. Many of them are from different countries. Through learning French, I got to know a lot more about the world and its history."
