   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I knew nothing about astrophysics before this class. Professor Urry taught us about Einsteins Special and General theories of Relativity, dark matter, dark energy, gravitational lensing, the cosmic microwave background, usage of AI in astrophysics, and more, in a very digestible and understandable manner. The class helped me learn how to approach a subject completely blind and tackle learning it",
    "This course is great. You learn cool things. That's cool. I have a decent understanding of general relativity now. That's crazy. The paper at the end is a little bit of a grind, but pretty much the only grind in the course. By the end, you've written a paper on likely a fairly complex topic (dark matter, galaxy formation, dark energy, etc.). It's satisfying.",
    "I learned a lot about a topic I previously knew nothing about. I learned so much about the universe, especially about dark matter, dark energy, and the CMB\/history of the universe.",
    "We learned a lot in depth about different topics in astrophysics, such as dark matter, dark energy, and the expansion of the universe + Big Bang Theory. You learn to present science talks using both Powerpoint presentations and posters (which is very good skill if you want to continue in STEM).",
    "I learned so much about astrophysics in general. I was able to learn about topics I had never even heard of before. I also felt like I learned quite a bit about what a career in STEM looks like and how to tackle difficult subjects.",
    "I developed the ability to read real-world astrophysics papers and engage with modern scientific topics. The course also taught me about a variety of fascinating astronomy topics and the questions that scientists are currently trying to answer. I learned how to write my own astrophysics paper and present research in a mock astrophysics conference.",
    "Knowledge about astrophysics, general relativity, recent astrophysical discoveries including dark matter, dark energy, and the expansion of the universe.",
    "To approach questions from a new scientific and even sometimes theoretical perspective",
    "I developed knowledge of dark energy, dark matter, gravitational lensing, and much more. I feel like I have a much better understanding of theoretical physics and astrophysics on a basic level!"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It could use more structure.",
    "Strengths: Lots of digestible information, good class size, liked that there were no tests but that Professor Urry genuinely cared about understanding rather than just regurgitating answers Weaknesses: At some points it wasn't the most organized? It didn't bother me that much but it's not necessarily the most formal way of learning",
    "The course started out with a seemingly very light workload: just some readings and short write-ups. Then, around the middle of the semester, it amped up a little bit with presentations, a lot of asking and answering questions, and the poster board and final paper. I think balancing the work load more throughout the semester would be helpful for students to have a more regular amount of work rather than a lot at the end of the semester compared to very little at the beginning. Personally, I thought there was a lot of writing in a course that isn't a writing credit. Almost every week we wrote a 2 page (double spaced) summary\/reaction to information, and at the end of the semester wrote a 3,000 word minimum paper. I don't know the process for making a course count as a writing credit but maybe that's something to look into.",
    "The class is absolutely amazing for a science credit since most of the things we do, is read scientific articles and come ready to discuss the articles or get a lecture that re-explains everything you may have read. A weakness to the class is to not procrastinate because work builds up and deadlines come near.",
    "The course did a great job of exposing students to all different aspects of astrophysics. The use of various speakers and field trips was very effective. it could be improved by integrating more discussion time on certain topics.",
    "The material was very interesting and the guest presenters were very informative.",
    "This course's strength was its small size, which allowed each student to contribute and learn in a close-knit community. It could have been improved with additional assistance on the structure of the final assignment, such as strategies for reading dense scientific literature and paper formatting guidelines.",
    "Strengths: learned a lot of interesting knowledge about recent theories in the field of astrophysics. Weaknesses: possibly none.",
    "The strengths were that the course material itself was incredibly engaging and Professor Urry always had a plan for class and wanted us to be as engaged as she was. The only weakness I felt was we had a semester-long project and with the way it was structured, if you were like me and had a project partner that didn't do much work\/was very last-minute, it was hard to spend an entire semester feeling like you were the only one doing the work."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, but only if you are interested in the topic.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Urry is both incredibly caring and incredibly intelligent. She wants her students to learn and understand. The topics are understandable while simultaneously stretching the mind greatly.",
    "Definitely.",
    "If you're remotely interested in learning about what's up with the universe (or what we think is what's up with the universe), take this class. That should be everyone. One of the best freshman seminars.",
    "Yes, it is such interesting subject matter and I felt very fortunate to have such an amazing professor, who usually teaches grad students, as a first year.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is an absolutely amazing class to expand your horizons even if you don't know any astrophysics. Take it for fun and the professor is amazing! She's so nice and provides us with lots of help! Ask her anything and she will respond the next day.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student. It is incredibly interesting and a great way to try something new. The class is challenging in that some of the topics are difficult to understand, but it is overall very enjoyable and manageable.",
    "Absolutely, a great way to conceptually learn about cosmology and astronomy.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it provided an exemplary introduction to some of the most exciting topics in astrophysics. It helped me start processing scientific literature and express my thoughts in a formal, concise manner.",
    "Yes. This course a fantastic introduction to a number of astrophysics concepts, without all the tedious math. If you are interested in things like dark energy, dark matter, inflation theory, supernovae, among other things, you will enjoy this class.",
    "I would recommend the course to any first-year looking to gain knowledge about astrophysics even if they do not plan to major in the field.",
    "Absolutely, if you want to dabble in cosmology and astrophysicist, this is your chance.",
    "Yes, especially for anyone interested in space, theoretical physics, or astrophysics and wants a non-math based introductory course into these topics. Professor Urry is incredibly talented and engaging and it was amazing being taught by her this past semester."
