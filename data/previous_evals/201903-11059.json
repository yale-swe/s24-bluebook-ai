   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Paul North's mastery of the subject matter and gift for eloquent explanation; the subject matter itself. Weaknesses: I wish we had met twice a week, rather than once. Perhaps two two-hour seminars, rather than one three-hour. We often tired after two hours.",
    "I enjoy the structure of the course. I recommend that two students can lead discussions.",
    "The major strength is that this seminar, unlike most seminars taught at Yale, allows for an extended engagement with a single body of work of an entire semester. At the beginning of each semester, Prof. North helpfully charted the territory for each week's concerns; much of the seminar was then dedicated to parsing out difficult passages and arguments and asking difficult questions of the text.",
    "One major strength was the class length. It allowed us to maintain long discussions on difficult texts. One weakness was the size of the class. A smaller size would make the discussion even better.",
    "Paul's philosophy is compatible with Benjamin's writing he takes the time that each text deserves.",
    "organization structure course materials"

    "Without hesitation. An extraordinary exposure to some of the most subtle and intricate thinking I have ever encountered.",
    "Yes, I will. Benjamin is a very versatile thinker and can benefit students from a variety of fields.",
    "yup. chance to learn benjamin and listen to prof north, as well as other students in the class was very rewarding and excellent.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to increase their familiarity with and fluency in critical theory. The discussions can become rather difficult and conceptual, but the issues at stake are almost always relevant to our own intellectual and political moment.",
    "Yes, but only if you are drawn towards Benjamin.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students as Paul North gives a unique perspective on Walter Benjamin."
