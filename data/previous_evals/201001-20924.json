   "comments": [
    "This is a great class to take if you plan on using mice as your model organism for graduate\/post-doc research. I would highly recommend it to another student.",
    "The part of introducing knowledge of mouse strains, handling and generation of knockout\/transgenic mice is great. When it comes to the application in different field, the lectures were a little too detailed and specified in certain subject.",
    "This is a great class to learn about using genetics to manipulate the mouse genome",
    "yes, very helpful",
    "Genetics 703 is an excellent course if you will be at any time in your dissertation research working with the mammalian model system. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, if they were also interested in learning how to use mice as a model. I feel that a lot of the information was valuable, and it also introduced me to faculty and resources at the university that could be useful to me and potentially would be to other students as well.",
    "This course was a practical overview of techniques and issues involving genetic manipulation of the mouse as well as experimental design and considerations for looking at mouse models. Also useful material and practice for grant writing. The course load is relatively light but effective in getting you to think more about and better understand the material. I would recommend the course for any students who will be working with or extensively exposed to research involving mouse models.",
    "I would recommend it, but mostly for the first half of classes. The second half was also interesting, but I thought that it was probably slightly less relevant to our own projects."

   "comments": [
    "This course has not only give me resources for where to look when I have questions about my mouse research (lecture notes and power point slides), but also has provided me with a list of contacts of experts knowledgeable about particular problems pertaining to the mouse that I could possibly use later in my graduate career.",
    "gave me deeper knowledge of mouse handling and experiment design",
    "This course allowed me to understand the importance of mouse backgrounds, strain differences, how to manipulate the genome as well as learning about different models for different diseases.",
    "Several of the courses dealt with mouse models of the nervous system, which is the area of my research, and thus gave me a more extensive background in the research and resources available here at Yale. Other lectures, although not dealing directly with my discipline, were oriented toward scientific research and thus still applicable to me. This course helped me organize my thoughts, and the final, where we had to prepare a research grant, was very helpful in forcing me to focus and present my research plans in a cohesive manner. We were also taught how to and required to write the type of documents I will need to in the future (grants, research protocols, etc.).",
    "Since I am planning on studying aspects of a disease in a mouse model, I found the course really useful for both my own work and understanding others' work on animal models.",
    "Gave me a much better idea of mouse strains and the methods used to create different transgenic and knockout lines. Despite having worked with mice for the past year, I waslacking in knowledge of a number of these techniques."
