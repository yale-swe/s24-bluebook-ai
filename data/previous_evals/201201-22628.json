    "Yes.",
    "This class is a great supplement to Italian 130. It's a lot more laid back and has a lot more cultural stuff like films and short stories. There's less work than in 130 and the few essays we do write are more fun. Giulia is incredible. If you have the opportunity to take a class with her, do it. She's always so nice and so caring, always wanting what's best for her students (and I know this is the opinion of everyone). I would definitely recommend Italian 140 and any class with Giulia.",
    "Definitely take 140 if you want to improve your Italian. It's a really interesting class filled with movies and literature. It was really nice being able to engage on a higher level with Italian.",
    "If you want to improve your language skills and you like Italian culture, you should take L4 Italian. The workload may be heavier than you expected, but it is very easy to do well.",
    "I mean, what is there to summarize? You take Italian 130 and then you have the option of taking 140, which just expands on 130. You continue to speak (hopefully in a smaller group), and write more. You're expected to write more complexly and improve on your grammar. It's sort of a random collection of good Italian films and texts, so that's kind of disorganized but interesting all the same. Overall, I'd recommend it if you like taking Italian... I mostly took it so that I could continue to use the skill I'd spent 3 semesters on already. After taking my usual classes it's kind of nice to use a different part of your brain. Although it was in the morning I actually didn't dread waking upand going to class. I wasn't thrilled about it, but still that says something at 9:25am.",
    "Absolutely. It's a great class, and while there is a decent amount of work, it is low stress. There is no final exam. Instead there is a final presentation which you choose to a very short research paper on any part of italian culture, or analyze one of the films we've seen. It was very interesting and easy to get excited about."
