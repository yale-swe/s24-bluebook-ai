   "comments": [
    "Little guidance from the instructor of 471, and students are required to attend all three days of presentations.",
    "Course is great",
    "I liked it this semester. Very clear what we had to do, although I would have appreciated a bit more notice on the details of assignments. i.e. we were told when stuff was due far in advance (which was great), but not exactly what we had to do until a few days before. Presentations were well organized",
    "I think the course is set up very well overall, but individual experience comes down to your advisor. There was also no feedback on the proposal or midterm reports, so grading is an absolute mystery.",
    "You'll get out of it what you put into it - it's based on independent research.",
    "Strengths: gives you a good opportunity to learn about an area of physics in more depth, get experience of what it's like doing research, get to know a professor",
    "It was fine. The check-ins were good.",
    "Strengths: periodic updates on research, motivates you to write up your research Weaknesses: no real community outside of final presentations, which then end up taking a size-able chuck out of reading week.. perhaps hold final presentations before reading week",
    "More could have been done to bring the cohort together - I think there was some potential to have mid-term updates or opportunities for interaction between the students other than during the final presentations."

    "Yes, depending on the lab they get in to.",

    "You'll get out of it what you put into it - it's based on independent research.",
    "Yes if you're interested in science research",
    "Yes. It was a relatively easy credit as long as you enjoy physics research.",
    "If you are a junior or senior conducting research, this is effectively a low-effort letter grade. Otherwise, there is no point.",
    "Yes. Independent research is important for any aspiring physicist"
