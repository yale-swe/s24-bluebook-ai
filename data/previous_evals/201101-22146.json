   "comments": [
    "It is a great course as a stepping stone from yale undergrad architecture to the real world of architecture",
    "It depends on the project selected. '11 got screwed on the competition itself but at least got to go to Spain. In terms of professors, Tom is a sweetheart, but watch out for Steven -- if you do good work in the beginning of the semester and show up to everything on time then you should be ok. NEVER let him know anything about your personal life or he'll tease you about it all semester.",
    "The senior studio is far more self-directed than previous studio courses. The teaching is less structured than previous semesters and, as such, the workload is decidedly less intense. In turn, the work produced did not seem as refined as it could have been. It was a bit of a bummer. If you want to produce high quality, rigorous work, you've really got to keep YOURSELF motivated. No one is going to push you.",
    "Required for arch major",
    "It's much more friendly than the junior studios, and the competition adds fun and excitement.",
    "It's a requirement and is very dependent on what the design contest is, but Steven Harris often makes the process quite unpleasant. It's a very independent process which is in some ways good but also means that not much progress is made.",
    "You are taking this class because you have to. The most important thing is to plan ahead before desk crits, otherwise you won't get a lot of helpful feedback. With that said, you are pretty much on your own for developing the concept. The TAs and proffers critique mostly on the presentation toward the end of the competition.",
    "Well it's mandatory. But good news if you luck out you get to travel to a really awesome place and you get to work on a real project with the possibility of winning a competition. Steven Harris is great. It is a really fun studio and you get to learn how to use rhino and make renderings in a week!",
    "You have to take this course! Bet you haven't heard that before. Anyways, this is a decent architecture studio. Steven Harris and Tom Zook are jovial professors who keep the studio environment light. However, if you want to produce good work, you need to be self-motivated. Prof. Harris also choose excellent TAs our year and I hope that you will be so lucky too!",
    "Yes. Do whatever you want to.",
    "You learn computer skills. Key. Also, it's fun to enter a competition in the real world and wonderful to travel with your classmates. Totally different studio experience."
