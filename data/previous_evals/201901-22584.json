    "A lot of content on enzyme kinetics and diffusion\/convection transport. Lots of assumptions to be made.",

    "How to model cellular and molecular interactions",
    "Learned a ton about biotransport, diffusion etc.",
    "I learned about drug delivery and idealized models of binding kinetics",
    "I learned about enzymes, reaction rates, and differential equations as they pertain to cell interactions.",
    "I learned to, on a much deeper level than before, understand, analyze, and calculate parameters behind biological transport and kinetics mechanisms.",
    "More about kinetics."

   "comments": [
    "Prof KMJ is great. Course would probably be unbearable without her. The content is challenging, but she tries her best to make it reasonable. I learned a lot from her, and she definitely deserved more attendance although the class was at 9am. Only complaint was about the midterm project. The first half was useful, but I didn't get much out of the second half other than some arbitrary grades.",
    "The only thing that could make this class better is it not being at 9am. It was a very good course that was organized well and taught a good amount of interesting material.",
    "Professor Miller-Jensen is a huge asset to the course. The material is pretty difficult, but she does an excellent job of teaching it.",
    "The class is excellent,",
    "The lectures and sections were challenging, but after explanation, problem sets and readings, I understood the majority of the material. However, the final exam was unreasonable, as the experiments we were supposed to solve were very complex and the majority of the students did not know how to set it up. Also, in the lectures we never really solved any equation, while in the exams we were always expected to solve everything.",
    "The course has a great TA and overall a great professor. That said, there can occasionally be a disconnect between the notes that are haphazardly thrown up on the board and the homework assignments\/exams.",
    "This course is good in that the problem sets are challenging and require you to apply yourself. However, sometimes it feels like they require you to extrapolate information that couldn't be gathered from the lectures alone.",
    "The teaching in this course is relatively effective and overall makes for a useful course. However, class time could be used more effectively for learning. Currently, classes just go through long derivation problems and are not very focused on true conceptual understanding, so you don't leave feeling like you learned very much. This could be improved with significantly better lesson plans focused on concepts first and brute mathematical derivations second.",
    "This course could be improved by having there be more example in class that related to the problem sets and having more materials available for the exams."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "It is a lot of work but very interesting and applicable if you want to learn about this area.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in proteins because it is interesting and very applicable. Also some basics of modeling are gone over and practiced with the system design coding project. Professor Miller Jensen was a passionate educator who really sought to show us why what we were learning mattered. Lastly, Elise, one of the teaching fellows for the course, was an excellent resource to help learn the material and made weekly section engaging.",
    "It's a requirement for BME so you probably have to take it. Otherwise, if you're interested in modeling dynamical systems in biology, sure why not go for it",
    "Yes I would recommend because KMJ is a nice professor, however the midterm is a bit difficult. But as long as you keep up with the material, come to class and go to section, you'll be fine.",
    "Yes and no. Professor Miller-Jensen (KMJ) is kind and can be an engaging lecturer. The material is interesting and, overall, the homework is doable. That said, KMJ is reliant on a note sheet during lectures and this leads to errors and eclectic lectures. Sometimes the topics are explained in a more hand-wavey manner. There are few times that intuition is built, such as with the penny probability experiment.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student willing to spend a lot of time engaging with the material and working through psets. The material is very interesting.",
    "Only if you need the class for a major requirement. Otherwise, please do not bother.",
    "If it is required for your major than yes, other than that don't take it.",
    "I found the course really interesting. The class is mostly made up of students who are required to take it, but as someone who didn't take it as a requirement and also doesn't have an extensive biology background, I learned a lot of new things. Psets took a long time and I found the exams to be difficult. And, while I understand the reasoning behind the mid semester project, it still felt at points to be a lot of work for not much learning. Still though, I found the class to be enjoyable."
