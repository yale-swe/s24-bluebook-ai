    "I have developed more as a singer under Luis' instruction than through any method I've tried before, and I have tried many. He has helped me with my breathing, tension, range, placement, expression, and everything in between.",
    "Lessons this semester gave me an entirely new perspective on my saxophone playing. We spent a majority of the semester refocusing on basic concepts and unlocking techniques that have alluded me for years. We focused primarily on voicing, beginning with basic exercises (mouthpiece pitch manipulation, F trick, overtones on low Bb and above) and ending with application to altissimo. We were also able to spend some time talking about musical expression (the most important part!) and jazz.",
    "Practice techniques, tone exercises, exercises for different registers.",
    "I significantly improved my bassoon technique during the semester and figured out what I need to do to keep improving. I also learned more about phrasing, reed making, and the contrabassoon.",
    "Musicality, violin technique, practice techniques. How to overcome performance anxiety and give and receive musical feedback from peers.",
    "I gained skill in trombone performance and musicianship.",
    "I worked on learning pieces for a future recital in the Spring.",
    "I continued to develop my individual musical ability."

   "comments": [
    "I felt like I grew substantially during this semester with Carrie Koffman. We didn't spend time blindly focusing on abstract concepts - instead, we initially took time to identify my goals with saxophone. Professor Koffman was able to successfully apply these personal goals to the trajectory of the entire semester. She was also understanding of other commitments that I had outside of lessons, and never had unreasonable expectations. That being said, I still felt challenged throughout the semester.",
    "Really flexible scheduling and you get to decide what you would like to work on throughout the semester.",
    "Very grateful for one on one instruction.",
    "The strengths are flexible hours and workload. Perhaps it would be nice to have small performance opportunities throughout the semester.",
    "This course is a very important resource for musicians, and it effectively serves its purpose."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely - taking private lessons with music professors at Yale is an incredible opportunity. Although, it is important to make sure you have the time to devote to them because they won't be beneficial if you are unable to practice.",
    "Yes! I think it's great that Yale offers this program. I would warn them however that they will have to pay the fees for changing your schedule because the music school wasn't considerate enough to give us results until days after the deadline to turn in our schedules.",
    "I would definitely recommend lessons for credit to students who want to keep improving their playing - instructors are amazing and very helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is dedicated to improving their skills on a musical instrument. It is always extremely helpful to take private lessons to learn as much as possible and to receive helpful feedback.",
    "For anyone vey dedicated to violin.",
    "Yes - anyone looking to take lessons in an instrument would benefit from this course.",
    "Yes, it is definitely better to study piano under this course than on one's own.",
    "Yes, lessons are central to the development of any musician."
