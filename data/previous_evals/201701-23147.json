    "The importance of close reading and the applicability of literature to life.",
    "I think that I really learned to write in this class, even more than in the other DS sections. Maybe this is because I cared more about Lit, or because my professor was a tough and effective grader, but I am happy with where I ended up, and feel very well prepared for the rest of my Yale writing career."

   "comments": [
    "we covered so many great works of literature, which i loved, but we moved through them so quickly because there were so many and I feel like I didn't get as much out of them as I would have liked because of that",
    "DS Lit was my favorite of the DS courses. I loved every work we read. That said, I would've loved to read War and Peace, Moby Dick, Proust, and other seminal works\/authors that weren't on\/were taken off the syllabus this year. All in all, though, amazing course! Wouldn't change anything else.",
    "As a general comment on DS Literature, it is hard to feel like you have a strong grasp on a work that you only spent two classes (a week) discussing. DS seems to emphasize breadth (i.e. the entire western cannon) over depth, which is understandable but also disappointing.",
    "It was sometimes hard for me to keep up with the large amount of reading. I understand that this is an important part of the course and adjusted accordingly.",
    "I think that DS is very hard to improve upon-- any time you add something, you have to take something away. I do think Walcott was an excellent addition, and I am also very happy we read Bovary. I also thought it was a good idea to take out War&Peace, though this means I must find time to read it on my own! I also loved King Lear. I think that DS should continue to strive to be diverse and inclusive, despite this meaning the loss of some excellent works."

    "yes, it's a great way to read lots of books that you want to have read but might not get around to by yourself",
    "Absolutely. I loved DS, especially Lit. It is an amazing program. If you are interested in the humanities and\/or want a foundational liberal arts education, definitely do DS!",
    "Yes, if you are passionate about the western canon. 2nd semester Lit is one of the highlights.",
    "Would definitely recommend spring semester literature. A lot of great works in this semester.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! The skills you develop in DS Lit will alter the way you view the world. It's a lot of reading, but it's certainly worth it.",
    "Yes. I am very glad I took DS, and Literature was my favorite class."
