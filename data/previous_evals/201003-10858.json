   "comments": [
    "Yes--it's interesting and fun.",
    "This class is a very interesting approach to quite a broad topic (modes of repetition expressed through various media). Students will find the classes engaging to listen to but will need to be very proactive if they wish to participate themselves, as much of the class is lecture- rather than discussion-based. This class could be frustrating for workaholics and achievement addicts but very enjoyable for those who want a more relaxed atmosphere. HoA726 is also useful as an introduction to different modes of thinking and approaches to scholarly literature for students from outside the film studies department.",
    "No. The class came highly recommended from friends who took it last year and I was disappointed.I do feel that I learned a lot from the first 5 weeks of the class but I was not able to relate these ideas to my other studies\/work as I had hoped."

   "comments": [
    "It continued to foster my thinking in various issues relating to derivative works\/remixes\/mash-ups and copyright.",
    "I found the early readings much more helpful than the later ones, which were more film-specific and less easily adaptable to other fields. I think my own research would also have benefited from more opportunities to share my ideas with others and receive feedback or suggestions.",
    "It didn't add it to my work as much as I would have liked. I enjoyed reading and learning about the theoretical background but didn't get a chance to apply it to my own studies."
