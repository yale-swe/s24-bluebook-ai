   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about microbiology and our immune system. I feel better prepared to understand what I hear about our immunology and diseases in the news or from doctors. This class has given me a different viewpoint so see the world from because of my learned understanding of pathogens and how are body responds to them and actually needs them to survive.",
    "I learned a lot about the biological mechanisms that make the immune system work. The course and Professor Kavathas went into great detail so that every student understood each element of immunology, from broad strokes like the lympathic system to specific enzymes and proteins.",
    "I learned many of the basic concepts behind immunology, including immune cells' structure, how they are activated, and how they perform their effector functions. I learned basic information about microbes and pathogens, as well as some specifics on particular pathogens that cause diseases like polio HIV, and chlamydia.",
    "This course was a thorough introduction to the immune system and aspects of microbiology. It also explored concepts in public health, and medicine as it relates to politics and society. The microbiome topic was the most enlightening for me and it has changed the way I think about microbes, diet and medicine.",
    "My writing and research skills have improved incredibly. I allude this specifically to my professor who did her best to include a wide variety of interesting books and articles in our class readings. She also took it upon herself to improve each of our weaknesses in writing our papers and problem set responses.",
    "We learned about various pathogens, the human immune system, the microbiome, and the individual presentation topics.",
    "Biology of the immune system connection between society, politics, and disease literature and art and disease",
    "I developed my knowledge of the immune system and diseases and also how diseases impact the world around us and how they are perceived in society. The class has two main components and one half is scientific and the other half looks at how disease impacts society. I really enjoyed learning about both sides. I developed my knowledge of biology and gained an insight into the illness of one of my family members through the final research project."

   "comments": [
    "The course was well organized and learning in such a small class helped facilitate discussion and my understanding of the topics. I cannot think of any weaknesses of the course. We did not get into depth for a lot of the topics but that is understandable since we covered a lot of topics.",
    "Very interesting course material. Wish there had been a little more discussion on the morality of mandatory vaccination, as I think this is one of the most interest elements of the course.",
    "I thought this class was an excellent introduction to the world of immunology. I do think there may have been too many novels\/books integrated into the course.",
    "Overall, this was an excellent course that did not expect any significant background in biology, but it still covered a fair amount of detail regarding the immune system. Professor Kavathas always did her best to break down the topics so that they were more easily understood. Our classes usually started with a lecture, then transitioned to a discussion about materials we read outside of class. The class could be improved if there were more opportunities like the problem sets to apply what was learned in class.",
    "I enjoyed the fact that the class was a freshman seminar; I was able to interact with my classmates and professor closely. Owing to the fact that immunology covers a large scope of content, I was extremely happy with the prepared material that our professor provided before each lecture, because they gave us insight on exactly what we needed to learn. However, I would suggest having a run-through of all the material during the first two lectures in order to let the students familiarize with the material before they really begin diving into it, especially students who haven't been exposed to similar material.",
    "I enjoyed the field trips to the Art Gallery and Medical School. The trips put the class material in perspective.",
    "Strengths: many connections to real world disease situations and news topics Weakness: less opportunity to review past material and reflect",
    "Strengths: -Professor Kavavthas is brilliant -engaging topics -variety of interesting readings -very good lecture notes and handbook to recover topics Weaknesses: -quite a high workload"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is such an interesting course and gives you such great insight into how your body responds to microorganisms. It also ties together the social aspects of disease and is a well-rounded course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any freshman that wants a taste of science while not taking a course such as Biology 101. The workload is reasonable and the class is interesting.",
    "Yes, it was good.",
    "Definitely take this course even if you are not entirely science-oriented. If you are considering medicine and want help in deciding if you should pursue that path, this class will help confirm if you do or do not have a passion for medical sciences.",
    "It's a wonderful class to be in, and there's so many interesting things to learn. We had many important conversations concerning history, law and ethics that enriched our minds. Highly recommended!",
    "If the student is interested in the immune system or any related topics, I would highly recommend the course. Good for those interested in biotechnology and bioengineering.",
    "Professor Kavathas cares so much about her students - I highly recommend this class if you are interested in the science of the immune system.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as it is taught incredibly well and the topics are so interesting and relate to many parts of everyday life."
