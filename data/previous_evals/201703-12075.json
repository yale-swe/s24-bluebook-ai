    "How to write a VERY subjective reading response, meaning no matter how I wrote it, I always received the same terrible grade.",
    "A much deeper understanding of gender and sexuality",
    "I think that this course was an excellent introduction to some of the current literature on gender and psychology.",
    "Good, interesting survey of the field of gender psychology. Understanding experimental design and being able to read psychological journal articles was emphasized almost as much as the psychological concepts.",
    "I loved this class. I thought professor LaFrance was incredible through and thoughtful about backing up her presentations with specific research articles. I learned to think empirically about gender rather than based around my own speculations."

    "I thought this class was so so great. This may be a strange comment but I wonder (if it continues to be that size in the future) if it would be possible to have a more discussion oriented room? I feel like when we had group discussions it was hard because I could really see my classmates. Even though these discussions were really great, I think they might flow more naturally if we were sitting around a table, or even just turned our desks towards each other for discussion. I loved everything else about the class!!",
    "This class has super interesting material. The issue is, the grading is TERRIBLE!!! Im warning you now if you take this class be prepared to receive terrible grades no matter how hard you try. I am still wracking my brain on how I could receive the same (bad) grade on all of the (important\/grade changing) reading responses no matter my level of preparation. Im talking didnt read the paper for one and received the same grade as when I prepared it days ahead of time. It was maddening! The grading is incredibly subjective and harsh. Its ridiculous!! On top of that, she expects us to read 3 (long!) full-length papers FOR EVERY CLASS. Thats more than graduate students read!!! Thats literally 6 papers a week (significantly more than Ive read for my thesis!). Now, 6 papers x 13 weeks = 78 papers!!! In one semester! How ridiculous is that?! And no you cant just read the abstract, you must read each one in depth. I couldnt even enjoy the class on credit\/d. Honestly take this class if you want because its interesting but take it on credit\/d and be prepared for very precarious grading.",
    "This class is deceivingly difficult. The content is super interesting and you think you have a good grasp on it but the first midterm was very very specific. Comparatively the final was relatively easy, but it was hard to recover from the midterm.",
    "Fascinating content, engaging lectures, fair workload. The quantity of information necessary to memorize for the midterm felt very overwhelming, and grading can be very harsh.",
    "I think this course was great. There was definitely a lot of reading for this course but I found that each article was relevant and informative regarding the topic at hand.",
    "Professor LaFrance was an interesting lecturer and presented the information in a very clear way. I thought that the class readings were very focused on understanding research methods in psychology, which was not a prerequisite for the course. Especially on the midterm, I felt that students who were not psych majors were at a disadvantage.",
    "The tests were a little too helter skelter for my liking. Often we would ask her questions around 1-2 weeks before a midterm or final was supposed to take place and she wouldn't have any answers that were truly helpful because she wouldn't have the questions formed yet, or even an idea of what the questions would look like. That was rather frustrating because it was hard to figure out the best\/most efficient way to study because I had no information to go off of.",
    "I thought this course was fantastic and I would not change anything about it."

    "YES. Taking this class was such a great decision. It was so stimulating and engaging. I felt like I was constantly learning so much!! I feel like I am so much more prepared to school sexists now and its great. Not only do I realize more bias in the world around me, I also have more knowledge and terminology that I can use to express myself.",

    "Yes! Really essential to take this course if you have ever wanted to examine gender more closely. Seems like a very relevant course, at Yale and beyond.",
    "It is absolutely fascinating, you will learn a lot. But I'd recommend doing it credit\/D.",
    "Yes definitely.",
    "Yes",
    "I would definitely recommend to EVERYONE. I genuinely think everyone should take this course. It was excellent, I learned so much about how to talk about gender and real information from studies. I went in thinking I was pretty well versed in the subject and came out SO much more knowledgable and so much more interested. It's not just discussing gender or debating topics - it's looking at real scientific data and the most updated knowledge about gender and LGBTQ+ experiences. Be an informed citizen, take the course! The workload is fine - the readings aren't too long and they're interesting, the midterm is multiple choice, you'll have 4 short 500 word reading responses and one final paper which happens before Thanksgiving break so it doesn't make your finals week more stressed. You do have one final as well, essay format, and she gives you the questions beforehand. TAKE IT IT'S SO IMPORTANT.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students."
