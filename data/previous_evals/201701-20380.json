    "This class teaches you how to solve difficult transport problems. It is very analytical and the math can become quite challenging. You learn to get through long problems that require many, many steps, and to think about physical systems in ways completely novel to you.",
    "Great course. I learned a lot about differential equations, mathematica and transport phenomena.",
    "I became much better at thinking mathematically.",
    "A bunch of seemingly random math.",
    "The knowledge of how heat and concentrations transport across a space.",
    "I learned some theoretical basics of transport phenomena and a small amount of math.",
    "How to describe transport of thermal\/mass fluids through space. Brush up of differential equations.",
    "I developed my skills in differential equations and identifying different solutions to various scenarios. I did not gain as much physical understanding of transport problems as I would have liked, but I can honestly say I am much more comfortable with differential equations and the procedure to solve analytical transport problems."

   "comments": [
    "Lectures were not very engaging, the problems are just so long. We would often not finish more than one problem in a given lecture. One strength to the course is Professor Loewenberg, he's lovely and always available to students.",
    "The class is excellent when taught by Professor Loewenberg. He provides a challenging yet rewarding mathematical framework to communicate all of the key concepts in the course.",
    "The way lecture is set up is not helpful for learning. Doing random examples without context for them makes it difficult to grasp the material or purpose of it.",
    "It's a very complicated course. Strengths: The transportation, the professor. Weaknesses: The Difficulty.",
    "There is plenty of personal attention and help if you need it. Professor Loewenberg does a great job of making everybody feel comfortable. I think the biggest weakness of the course is the course content itself. Almost all of the material covered is intensely boring theory and there are no connections made between with real-world applications or any sort of engineering.",
    "Without a doubt Professor Loewenberg was the strength of this class. I will discuss this more in the following questions, but this was a great course because of Professor Loewenberg.",
    "The main strength of this class is Professor Loewenberg's dedication to the course and ensuring each student understands it to the best of his or her ability. Professor Loewenberg was incredibly flexible - willing to push back a unit or go over something in class once more, with the aid of his students. He was additionally willing to meet for extended periods of time during office hours or impromptu review sessions. The main weakness in this class is its inability to provide a clear physical understanding of transport problems. Without a physical understanding, I sometimes doubt if I'll be able to recognize a transport problem in the workplace and apply the skills I've learned from this class."

   "comments": [
    "Not really. I imagine you have to take it if you're looking at this review box. Take it with Professor Loewenberg if you can, the lectures won't be so great, but you'll get through with his support.",
    "This course is required for all chemical engineering and environmental engineering students. Please take this if Loewenberg is teaching. The material is not difficult but does require an understanding of differential equations and even strong algebra skills. Honestly, this was the best class I've taken at Yale. Tons of help sessions, review sessions and flexible homework submission. The class is designed for you to really understand the material, instead of just jamming equations into your head (Cough PChem 2). During class, you're more than welcome to ask questions and concepts are explained. Be warned though, Loewenberg is a very smart guy. He does entire problems in his head, solutions and all. So you really need to know what you're stuck on. Luckily, he's always willing to meet outside of class. Take this class if you need a QR, are required, or want a great elective.",
    "Professor Loewenberg is awesome! This is a difficult subject, but he is a shining light that guides you through. He is immensely dedicated to his students and will always give help when you need it.",
    "Yes!! You came to Yale to learn -- just do it!!",
    "Take it with Professor Loewenberg!",
    "Avoid this class like the plague if you can. Sorry chemical engineers.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you're taking Transport, its almost certainly because you don't have a choice. But if you do have a choice, don't take it. Professor Loewenberg is extremely intelligent and caring and puts tons of effort into the course, but at the end of the day the material is boring that this course can only be so enjoyable. Plus, the problem ses involve little transport and instead have you spending hours and hours on irrelevant math. I wish there was any sort of connection to engineering or real-word applications. I had to take it because the Environmental Transport course wasn't offered this semester, but take the environmental version if you can just because I've heard it includes some applications.",
    "Yes! You probably have to take this if you are looking at it -- but take it if it is with Professor Loewenberg. This professor's sole interest is that every student in his class learns the material and comes out with a fundamental understanding of transport phenomena. Help is always available to those who need it or ask for it. I cannot begin to describe how refreshing it was to have a teacher so interested in the students ability to learn.",
    "You're very likely taking this because you have to. It is a lot of work, and you will spend a lot of time outside of class working together with classmates, in review sessions, and going to office hours for help. I ended up liking this course a lot, though, and behind all the very dry integration techniques and differential equation solving, there's a set of scenarios that you'll solve throughout the semester that start to feel like you're really starting to get into the chemical engineering major, rather than chemistry with more math on the side.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student interested in honing their differential equations skills (I was atrocious at diff eq before this) and interested in approaching problems the way Professor Loewenberg does - mainly in a purely mathematical approach. This class will take up a lot of time, as you need to go to extra review sessions, TA section, and possibly office hours in order to complete the assignments. However, the grading is not too harsh, as Professor Loewenberg understands the difficulty of the material."
