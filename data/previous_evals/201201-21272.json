    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I learned so much and it was a lot of fun! We talked about really interesting, relevant, and diverse issues, such as the advent of cable television, YouTube and blogs, and the psychology of elections. Professor Hersh is super nice and a great teacher, and I really enjoyed the class. It wasn't too much work, and all the readings were fun. I only wish that more people had taken the class (it was basically a seminar) so that more people could have an awesome time as well, but since it was the first year it was being taught I can understand some hesitation. But now you know how great it is! Do it.",
    "Information tech and politics takes an in depth look at the relationship between politics and technology that transcends the often surface area coverage provided by other courses on the topic. You get to take a look at how technology affects each branch of government specifically and Professor Hersh is able to offer many interesting perspectives from his experience campaigning.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is very relevant to everyday life, and the material is very interesting. I really enjoyed it--each class was always a good discussion.",
    "Yes! Definitely--after taking this class you will feel like you have gained a large breadth of knowledge. Professor Hersh is an engaging and exciting professor and he cares very much about working with his students.",
    "Take it! It's a very new field that is becoming very important and professor Hersh is great!",
    "Take it. Its a great class that takes a much more critical view on information technology than a lot of the \"OMG FACEBOOK IS SO GREAT\" classes out there. I have no idea if this will be a big lecture in the future (this year it was only 7-8 people), but for the quality of the material it certainly could be.",
    "I came in already interested in issues around politics and technology, but I learned a whole lot in this class that I didn't know about\u0097whether politics around voting data to new views on surveillance and privacy. Professor Hersh is awesome, young, smart, and mixes lecturing and discussion extremely well. The material is relevant, it's current, and it's immediately applicable."
