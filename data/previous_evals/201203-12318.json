   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Ethics, Politics,&Economics 215 to any student who has the chance to take it, especially with Professor Kapustin.",
    "You MUST take it.",
    "I didn't think this class was as amazing as everyone says it is. It is very philosophy-heavy and focuses on pre-1900 writers, which isn't really my scene in the EP&E major. (I am much more econ-y and interested in current philosophy.) So, yeah, I trudged through it doing most of whatever readings I could. I was bored a lot by the material and the discussion, but I think that it's just because this wasn't the sort of poli sci\/econ class that I'm used to. I really liked Professor Kapustin--go to his office hours; he's an interesting thinker. Surprisingly not that hard of a grader.",
    "Yes. If you're an EP&E major, well ya got no choice. And don't worry, Kapustin makes this class absolutely worth it.",
    "Definitely! This is the best humanities class at Yale!",
    "Take it. Professor Kapustin is amazing, and the class an intellectually stimulating experience throughout.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course. Prof. Kapustin leads the seminar really well and shows the depth and complexity of certain thinkers that I, unless having taken this course, would have readily dismissed as unimportant. The readings are fascinating and the workload is not overwhelming, although I would recommend starting the final paper early, as it is a long one and requires a lot of research.",
    "Kapustin lives up to his reputation as a fantastic professor.",
    "Classics of EPE isn't just an amazing course for EPE majors, but a must-take for almost any Yalie. This course is truly unique because it has a strong interdisciplinary approach, one that few classes at Yale do. There are few professors like Professor Kapustin; he's not just brilliant, but makes you fall in love with the subject.",
    "I know everybody raves about Kapustin, but if you're not big on political philosophy, you probably won't be super into this class no matter who the professor is. But Professor Kapustin is kind, understanding, and encouraging.",
    "If you're interested in Philosophy and have Professor Kapustin take it! His passion for the content is contagious. There was rarely a dull moment in class. Since it only meets once a week the workload is very manageable, just make sure to do the readings thoroughly and make notes for class discussions!"
