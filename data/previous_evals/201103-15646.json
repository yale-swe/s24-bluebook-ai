    "Yes! Take it! Very nice respite from other classes. Everyone needs music in their lives!",
    "Intro to Music Theory is more of a second course of music rather than a first. If you have not read music, it would benefit you to gain some experience before the class.",
    "You learn a lot about the fundamentals of music and music composition and are very comfortable with music basics by the end.",
    "If you're interested in learning to read music, then I would recommend MUSI110. That's pretty much all you do. The business at the end about cadences I thought wasn't of much use. But basic \"harmonizing\"-- i.e. learning what chords fit a melody-- is a nice skill. If you already know how to read music, and just want to get better at it, this class can be helpful too. I think most of this class hedges on your teacher. The syllabus and textbook are rather dull; it's the teacher that makes the class.",
    "It's a good class if you're interested in learning music theory. If not, then it will be kind of a pain, because while the work isn't hard, it is tedious and takes up a fair amount of time. If you've played an instrument or had music theory before, it's a fairly easy class. A good fifth class.",
    "Great intro class to music. I will definitely recommend it, but again, if you have had signifacnt exposure to music before, do not take this."
