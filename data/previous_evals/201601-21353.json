   "comments": [
    "If you are looking for an good overview course on current energy technologies and policies, this would be a good class to take. If you want something more intensive than an overview, this probably isn't the right class for you.",
    "Good econ senior seminar. More of a lecture, but certainly a nice course to learn about the environment.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class - make sure you do the readings, they are very well-selected, and will allow you to get a lot out of the class. The policy and research papers are excellent opportunities to learn more about a specific subfield that interests you. Kessides is an energy expert, and will skillfully guide you through this complicated topic.",
    "No",
    "EP&E 300 is an overview of almost every aspect of the energy, mostly power, sector. You learn about coal, nuclear energy, solar, wind, hydropower, biofuels, etc. You will learn from the perspective of looking at large issues facing the energy sector and the transition to a low-carbon economy. You will write a policy brief on a topic you pick and a final research paper. Class participation is relatively minimal, as the seminar is taught more like a lecture. I would definitely recommend the class to anyone looking to learn more about energy.",
    "ECON 452 serves as a great summary of contemporary issues in energy. The course spends a lot of time focusing on the science and economics behind energy policy, and not so much on the debates surrounding the policy itself, so if you have already taken classes on climate change or energy technologies this course could be very repetitive. In addition, due to high levels of interest in this class, the class was much bigger than a standard seminar and so the majority of the classes were lecture style. That said, professor Kessides is a great professor and an incredible resource as he goes out of his way to engage with students and is very knowledgeable about the field. The lectures were well delivered and offered a lot of interesting material. The workload was also minimal which is nice. I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Good class covering all areas",
    "Solid course, but definitely expect a lecture series rather than an interactive seminar. Kessides knows his stuff and there is tons to be learned if you pay attention in lecture and skim through the readings. However, he is also extremely hands-off. Don't expect too much instruction or support for the Final Research paper and he also might not respond to your emails.",
    "Yes, definitely take it if you are interested in energy studies and\/or policy.",
    "If you are looking for a discussion-based seminar, do not take this class. If you want a detailed crash course on the global energy situation and basically every form of energy being used today, taught in a format that is relevant both to students without any prior knowledge about these issues and to those planning on going into the field after graduation, this is the class for you. It is pretty light on workload throughout the year, as the reading is dense but never actually required for anything and the only assignments are a short policy brief and a fairly hefty 20-25 page research paper on a topic of your choice. I wouldn't describe the course as amazing or a must-take, but it is definitely a quality class and if you are interested in the topic covered at all I can't think of a much better or more comprehensive and easy to digest way to learn about it then by taking this course.",
    "Half-decent class on an interesting and relevant topic. In the context of economics classes, one might call this \"the best of the worst.\"",
    "Heavily energy based class",
    "ECON 452 covers the spectrum of fossil fuel and renewable energy sources, providing a solid background on policy that is pertinent to these areas. I would recommend the course to students who may not have an in-depth understanding of energy policy, as a way to better understand energy developments around the world.",
    "I was looking for an EP&E seminar my sophomore year, and this fit the bill. I definitely learnt a lot about renewable energy and climate change, an area I am interested in but do not know much about. The papers are fun to work on because you can choose your own topics and Professor Kessides is extremely helpful, although a slightly dry lecturer.",
    "Contemporary Issues in Energy Policy was a terrific course that effectively surveyed the science, economics, and politics of climate change and energy production. While most classes tend to focus on the problem of climate change, this class penetrated to the solutions. By considering the merits of alternative energies and the opportunities\/challenges of deploying them, this course offered a refreshing look at what a path away from carbon-intensive energy might look like. The lectures were clear and engaging, the readings were interesting, and the workload (weekly readings, a 6-8 page policy paper, and a 20-25 page final paper) was manageable. In addition, Professor Kessides was an excellent professor. His command of the material, real-world energy policy experience, and skills as a lecturer made for a winning combination. Moreover, Professor Kessides was incredibly generous with his time and wisdom. He was always willing to meet with students outside of class, answer questions, and offer advice about our assignments. His kind, thoughtful, and sincere demeanor made office hours a delight. In sum, a highly recommended course!"
