    "Great class. Accessible even to STEM majors, although there is a it of a learning curve in acquiring the necessary vocab to discuss intersectionality if it's anew concept to you. It's a lot of reading and the deadlines for the book reviews tend to sneak up on you, so make sure to stay on top of your work.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about contemporary issues related to race\/gender\/class and health. The focus is primarily anthropological, but it is very accessible to students of other majors. The small discussion size makes it easy for everyone to participate, and Marcia is careful to make sure that everyone has the chance to lead a seminar.",
    "A wonderful way for non-majors and majors alike (though I can speak only as a non-major) to delve deeply into a topic while also getting solid foundations in ANTH and WGSS material. The first few books are theory-heavy, which makes it feel like everyone can be on a relatively equal playing field regarding the WGSS concepts. After that, we slowly transitioned into ethnographies, which are definitel yaccessible to people who have never read an ethnography before. The books are great, and this class is centered around the books. It's technically a lot of work (a book a week with reading responses, plus 4 big assignments), but it's one of those classes where completing the readings will allow you to successfully complete the work even if you're unfamiliar with the concepts. I'm a non-major and was worried about the workload, but I definitely got a lot out of it by putting time into it -- and it was never overaly stressful; it was just a matter of completing the books and learning how to write for anthropology. I would DEFINITELY recommend to non-majors if you can get into the class. I would probably have never taken an anthro class, and now I really want to take more...worth the hike to 10 Sachem Street!",
    "This class was amazing! You'll get a deep understanding of how gender influences things like poverty, abuse, and drug use. This class points out ways in which women are disadvantaged, and how this harms their health. Marcia is a great instructor!",
    "This class was excellent! Professor Inhorn (Marcia) was a great discussion facilitator, and the books we read were truly enlightening. Any pre-med student interested in women's health should consider taking this. It will definitely impact the way I will practice medicine as a doctor in the future. The books were so excellent--a few long ones, but all were gripping reads. This class is great even for non-anthro majors! We discussed key terms and ideas central to the discipline at the beginning of the semester, so I felt well-prepared to do the assignments and critique the books from an anthropological perspective.",
    "If you're interested in studies of race, class, or gender, this class is awesome at evaluating those forces in health institutions. If you're even considering becoming a healthcare provider or researcher, I would say this class is essential and is like nothing else you will encounter.",
    "I took this class as a pre-medical student interested in women's reproductive medicine, and I was interested in exploring how structural factors influence women's health. This class exposed me to so much more than I could have ever imagined and I would absolutely recommend it. I took it without a background in the social sciences and it was definitely a bit of a steep learning curve, but with the help of Professor Inhorn and the books we read, I was able to keep up relatively quickly. I learned so much in such a brief time and I think that everything I learned will be immensely important throughout my career and also as a human being.",
    "Absolutely take it if you get in. A lot of reading (a book a week and 12 books in the semester), but they are all fascinating, and you will genuinely want to do the reading. Marcia calls it a \"feminist book group\" and that's really what it is. The conversations in this class are more applicable to your life than almost anything else you will learn at Yale. It is an empowering class that I will always remember and carry with me everywhere.",
    "It was an amazing class! It really was a feminist book-club and I learned a ton from it. The discussions added a lot to what I got out of the course, which is not the case often enough. I think this had to do with the wide variety of backgrounds of the students in the class - definitely a plus! The books were really good and it was great to read many on a single topic to get an idea of the scholarship on that topic\/the different ways to talk about it. Writing the book reviews was also very helpful in engaging with the readings - I actually remember all of the books we read and I can't say that for most of my classes.",
    "ANTH 451 is a reading group of anthropologies dealing with issues in women's health and intersectionality across the United States. The books deal with reproduction, AIDS, poverty, and drug addiction and span diverse regions of the country. Classes are discussions led by a different student or pair of students each week. Reading responses are handed in weekly, which is a helpful way to stay on top of the reading, and three longer written assignments are due over the course of the semester. The work is very straightforward and the texts are fascinating. Take this course if you are interested in public health, social policy, or social justice!",
    "This is an extremely important class to take ! No other course gives you this kind of raw insight."
