   "comments": [
    "Take it, just take it. It's a great class, not too much work and super fun. Lacina is great and really tried to get us to go out of our comfort zone. He was encouraging but also helpful, and made the class really comfortable even for those of us with little or no previous dance experience",
    "If you're enthusiastic about dancing, and want to get credit for it, taking this class will be the best decision of your semester.",
    "definitively yes.BEST CLASS EVER.but make sure you love dance and you dont miss the class.",
    "As long as you\u0092re not shy and not afraid to improvise, try new, unfamiliar things, and probably look foolish most of the time, you will do well in the class and you will have fun. However, West African dance is definitely physically demanding so make sure you\u0092re ready to show up to every class with energy. One of the most unusual classes at yale, definitely take it to mix up your schedule!",
    "African dance is a fun, high-energy course. You learn a variety of traditional and modern African dances that you present in a show at the semester. Class generally involves warm-up, improvisational exercises and rehearsing choreography\/learning new choreography. There were weekly readings that we rarely discussed and two short papers. I'd highly recommend the course--it was immensely enjoyable and is very accessible even for non-dancers. Plus watching Prof. Coulibaly dance is amazing.",
    "TAKE IT!!!You will enjoy it quite a lot, a nice way to exercise,(its pretty rigorous!!!!) during the week while earning a credit and learning about dance.",
    "Take this class if you have a heavy semester. I was taking three science classes and could not bear to sit through another lecture course. This class was literally 2 days a week of 2 hours of dancing. We never really talked about the reading so there was not much pressure about it. You have a final paper and performance at the end of the semester and that is pretty much it. Lacina is an amazing dance and teacher and you will not regret taking this class. It is a good break form the hecticness of regular Yale classes.",
    "basically West African Dance: traditional to contemporary is 2 hours of dance, twice a week, nice work out, a lot of work but different",
    "I ABSOLUTELY recommend it. Even if you don't think you are specifically interested in African dance, take the class. It will still be tons of fun, not to mention a good workout.",
    "I think it is a must take!",
    "Take this class! It's as much a mental workout as it is a physical one. I loved every class, and I learned how to move in ways that I would never have anticipated. This class gave me amazing confidence along with a better understanding of traditional and contemporary African dance."
