   "comments": [
    "A LOT of reading (120 pages per week of a single-saspced Word document in 11 point font), so it's tough to get through it all each week. However, if you can manage, the papers are very manageable and Calabresi is a great resource to hear about how other countries have taken the US constitution and done it differently, some with more success than others. Unlike most of my peers, I took it without a con law background, and I would recommend Ahkil Amar's class or something like it beforehand, if nothing else just to lessen the workload and know more cases to draw upon in discussion. The class is full of pre-law students, who make discussion lively and meaningful, but it does get a little tense sometimes when a diehard socialist-liberal and a conservative go after it. Fun though, and I learned a ton. Overall recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course, although it was not as good as I hoped it would be. Professor Calabresi is a pretty mediocre discussion leader. He cold calls students in proportion to how much they already talk, which was strange, and is not very good at integrating each student into the class discussion, or even giving ever student a chance to participate in discussions. The course was also more about comparative policy, in the sense that we would talk about what we think a constitution SHOULD protect in terms of freedom of speech, for example, rather than what the various constitutions actually do protect. I liked the course--I learned from it and enjoyed the opportunity to study with Professor Calabresi--but there are definitely better seminars out there.",
    "I would definitely recommend PLSC 393. It makes the topic very accessible and you can learn a lot. Professor Calabresi was extremely kind and knowledgeable. The three paper assignments were also very enjoyable and worthwhile.",
    "I think the subject matter of the class is quite good, especially if you are interested in law. I actually really enjoyed every assignment that we did, and it's really not that much work all things considered (3 papers). In section, Professor Calabresi does tend to pick on the same students every class, so just be aware that that is something that happens.",
    "Yes, I recommend this course, especially if you are considering going into law school. I was on the fence about law school when I started the course, and now I am almost certain I would like to pursue law school thanks to what I learned. The readings are manageable (we read Calabresi's casebook) and quite fascinating. I am interested in international politics, so the fact that the course focused on the constitutions of the G-20 nations and not solely that of the U.S. (though U.S. constitutional law is the central focus).",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Calabresi is incredibly good at creating great debate in the class and asking really interesting and thought-provoking questions, and the material is fascinating for anyone interested in the law. A great complement to Constitutional Law, a great senior year class, and truly a privilege to be taught by such a great instructor - he has been a Supreme Court Clerk, prominent law review author, and well-known professor. Seriously, take this class - it is not much work and you can get so much out of it!",
    "An engaging seminar covering key topics in comparative constitutional law which gives students a stronger understanding of how the G-20 Nations have applied a constitutional framework to their governments!",
    "Take it! If you can get in. Pay attention to the composition of the class. Mine had a handful of very outspoken kids, and a majority of silent ones. Make sure you get into the vocal group -- Calabresi tends to call on people who already talk a lot. He's not gonna go out of his way to encourage timid kids (tough luck). (Although if you don't like talking or something, you can always go to office hours).",
    "The course material is very interesting, but the class discussion can be dominated by a few students. Professor Calabresi is very nice, but doesn't lead the discussion very well. Just be prepared if you are not confident about speaking up in class.",
    "Comparative Constitutional Law is an excellent class, especially if you have any interest in going to law school or the law more generally. Professor Calabresi is one of the kindest, most helpful professors I've had while at Yale. Given how academically and professionally accomplished he is, I expected him to be somewhat intimidating, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that he is actually extremely friendly and easy to talk to. I wrote my senior thesis in conjunction with the class, and Professor Calabresi's assistance throughout every stage of the process, from research to writing to revising, was invaluable. The class was largely composed of senior polisci or EP&E majors, many interested in\/applying to law school, so it was not altogether surprising that the level of the in-class discussions was quite high. Professor Calabresi does occasionally cold call in class, but it isn't high pressure. The readings consisted of a chapter from his casebook per week, and while they were often quite long, they were also interesting to read. The workload is not bad at all, consisting of readings\/participation, two 5-page papers, and one 10-page paper or senior thesis. If you are able to get into the class, I would wholeheartedly recommend that you take it.",
    "This is a small seminar class with a good bit of reading. The material is very interesting to students planning to pursue law, history, or political science, but probably not a class that other students should take just for fun."
