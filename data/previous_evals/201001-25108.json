   "comments": [
    "This is a very interesting class that will help you develop your own ideas about government and politics. There is a lot of reading, but not overwhelmingly so. Take it writing intensive, since the two papers are a good way to really develop your own ideas, as well as allowing you to avoid taking a midterm, improve your writing skills, and fulfill the WR requirement.",
    "Take it! It was great. You will read Marx, Mill, Rawls, Nozick, Hamilton, MacIntyre.... how could you ask for more?",
    "One word - GUT. If you want an easy WR credit, take it. If you have any minimal level of intelligence (and the set of old notes that seem to be floating around all the varsity sports teams) you'll get by doing very little work. The WR requirements are especially a joke - you won't find an easier way to get a writing credit anywhere.But if you want a course that's intellectually stimulating, look elsewhere. The course does cover some important books and the lectures by Shapiro are actually pretty good. But you'll just be frustrated when you go to section and everybody around you is disinterested and hasn't done a page of reading. Don't bother.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it - specifically for a WR credit.",
    "Decent, fairly boring",
    "I would say that it is similar to all other Political Philosophy courses, but you could perhaps find another course that was more interesting.",
    "Definitely if you wanna learn political philosophy",
    "I recommend it if you are interested in the course material and plan on doing most of the readings assigned. I took this course for a writing credit simply because it only requires that you write two papers, and I had heard that in previous years it was easy to earn a good grade in. This year the structure of the course changed, and if you do not keep up with the readings you will not do well. Looking back, I should have take English 114 to get my writing credit, but having said that, this course was very interesting and I'm glad I had the opportunity to learn some interesting ideas in political philosophy, even though I plan on being a math\/economics major",
    "I recommend MoFoPo if you are truly interested in political philosophy (which it turns out I am not). It is a lot of reading, but the lectures are very good. The readings are interested if you're interested in the philosophical underpinnings of political systems, but not if you're into policy discussions. You will not learn how to evaluate policies in this course, only how to talk about basic political structures. It is a good, easy WR credit though.",
    "Boring and irrelevant in today's age.",
    "good class if you are into political philosophy. dry but clear and thorough lectures. recommended.",
    "Amazing class. Shapiro is an interesting and engaging lecturer even when the topics got a little dry. And the course is just overall amazingly well organized. Everything flowed really nicely, and I feel like a have learned so much. Definitely take it WR if you can.",
    "A fascinating overview of five different political theories and the philosophers who went with them - utilitarianism, Marxism, social contract theory, anti-Enlightenment theory, and democratic justice. The readings are interesting and the essays are interesting and rewarding. I would definitely recommend taking it writing intensive.",
    "Definitely not a easy class, but a decently good class for WR credit. You will also probably end up with a better grade if you take it WR b\/c you are forced to do drafts of your two papers and will probably end up with decent grades while also being more prepared for the final.",
    "I took the class writing intensive, and it is definitely a great way to fulfill your writing requirement. You are able to submit drafts to your TA before you hand in your two papers, and you don't have to take the midterm. I thought the class was overall very interesting, the material was at times a little steep to read through, but you can get the general idea of the readings as long as you attend lecture. You dont necessarily have to do all the reading (which is alot), but you do need to have a general concept of the authors' theories. The final and midterm are both open notes. Take it!!!!",
    "I wouldn't take it again. The material is pretty interesting, but there is so much reading that I feel like its inevitable that you will fall behind. Plus, with a bad TA you could get stuck with a poor grade",
    "There are some dense readings that you will have to persevere through, but you will learn a lot in this class. It's always useful to actively engage the question of why\/when governments are legitimate.",
    "This is an introduction to political philosophy through the lens of Prof. Shapiro's argument, which he presents at the end of the term. I'm not sure its the best introduction to political philosophy - I would recommend looking at Steven Smith's intro as well.",
    "This is a must-take course for poli sci majors (and for other majors too). Very interesting, very manageable, and will help you think in new ways. Take it WI if offered. Also it has an open-note\/open-book final and midterm so it's not about memorization.",
    "This was a truly fascinating class. Tons of reading (which can get pretty dry) but solid lectures and if you get a good TA and fellow students, section can really help you engage with the material. If you're interested in an introductory polisci, fairly philosophical-style class, MoFoPo will rock your world. Writing intensive is very manageable since it's only 2 pretty short papers and then the final with everyone else.",
    "Political Science is a good course for those who want to have a broad introduction to political philosophy. Nevertheless, the syllabus tries to comprise way too many works, which can be a little confusing. Professor Shapiro is a good lecturer, yet his lectures are a little dry sometimes. If you're willing to spend 6-10 weekly hours doing the readings, then this class is a great fit.",
    "Great introduction to political theory. Enjoyed the class significantly.",
    "Take it! You will learn a lot. It's a very interesting class and pretty fun as well. It's also not too difficult. It's just fascinating stuff to think about. I absolutely loved it and it has me hooked on political science. It's a good course for someone who knows nothing about political science or philosophy (as I was). I also took it writing intensive, which was not a mistake. Learning how to write for political science is a unique and valuable skill and is a really interesting way to analyze the material.",
    "Highly recommended. Not too difficult--for some it would be a \"gut\". Its far from frivolous. The course will change your world view and understanding of democracy's role in global politics.",
    "Great class for those who haven't taken political philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this course, for I really enjoyed it, though it ironically taught me that I do not wish to pursue political philosophy. We read important authors that you should read anywayand discuss them in a coherent, accessibly manner that helps you see the connections between them as well as the flaws within each's arguments. Prof Shapiro is a really great lecturer; section is actually really helpful. The two essays are short and interesting to write, so you should take it WI.",
    "This class is a good chance to get a decent understanding of major philosophers that have shaped our way of thinking. The course treats philosophers from Locke and on, culminating in Shapiro's own commentary on democracy. I would highly recommend going to the lectures, which Ian Shapiro delivers well. Read his book Moral Foundations of Politics instead of the required readings. That book more closely follows the lectures and the themes of the course as a whole.",
    "I really did not like it. Only take it if you are into political philosophy.",
    "Yes. It is a good class to take if you are interested in political philosophy, and haven't had too much experience beforehand. I recommend taking an intro econ class before taking mofopo.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who has already taken some political philosophy. Because of Shapiro's limited thesis, I feel like it would be a better class to refine one's study, not start it off (this was the first PLSC class that I took at Yale).",
    "All in all, I found this course to be very insightful. The course was presented in a very thematic and chronological way, which made for a very comprehensive yet coherent manner of presentation. This course gave me the opportunity to read many of the works that I had long wanted to read, yet Prof. Shapiro offered wonderful commentary that I would have never gleaned from just reading each work on my own.",
    "It's a good class for a writing credit, so yes",
    "When people ask me what I thought of MoFoPo, this is always my response: \"I liked it, and I hated it.\" I have no regrets about taking it, and I feel much more informed about the impossibility of political science and its applications. However, the readings are mostly very dry, painful treatises that obfuscate already complex ideas about human nature and the purpose of government. Also, there are a TON of books for this class - prepare to shell out a significant amount of money just to take this course. The reading load is also insane - basically one book a week - and you will probably feel like you have no idea what's going on most of the time, especially in lecture. Shapiro is a decent lecturer - he is very intelligent and articulate, but he is also at times arrogant and the class is essentially his book in lecture form. He is not a very engaging lecturer, so don't be surprised if you find your mind shutting off 15 minutes into lecture. I would recommend taking it though, if you are at all interested in Political Science, but shop it first and make sure you can keep up with the reading.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good introduction to political science and a student who is interested in it",
    "This course covers a lot of material at a decent depth. You get a introductory yet complex view at many of the greatest political philosophers. I would recommend this if you are not sure what type of political theory you are interested in.",
    "yes if interested in the subject matter",
    "Reading a lot of great thinkers and dismissing them.",
    "Moderately difficult course. Take it writing intensive, as you learn more by researching your papers than by anything else in the course.",
    "So much reading and the papers are kind of graded hard. Hardly any work but not an easy A",
    "Political Science 118 is a good follow-up class to Intro to Political Philosophy. This course focuses on modern political philosophy, from John Locke to present day. Combined, the two courses provide a more than complete base of political thought. This course, focusing on later thinkers, addresses theories which impact the world today. The course strives to answer the question: what makes government legitimate?",
    "Everyone at Yale ought to take this class. It combines political science, philosophy, and economics in an extremely fascinating blend that appeals to people of all disciplines.",
    "Fine intro, important material, but not as inspiring as it could be.",
    "This class allowed students to learn the differences between different styles of government by exploring how their key aspects and virtues were identified through political theorists. I would recommend this class as writing intensive but not as a non-writing.",
    "It provides a great introduction to political philosophy through the Enlightenment. The reading was a bit dense, but the lectures helped clarify most of it. Definitely get Shapiro's book, The Moral Foundations of Politics. It repeats some of the material in the lecture, but it definitely helps you understand the points he's trying to make.Do understand that it is a philosophy course and so there is no definitive answer as to what kind of system of politics we should create, but these are some of the great philosophers that one should know to begin understanding the conversation.",
    "I think it's a great class if you are interested in political science and might want to be a PoliSci major",
    "It's a good general survey of political thought from the Enlightenment onward. Shapiro's spin on the greats makes this class very interesting, even though it's definitely introductory level.",
    "This class is a great introduction class to moral philosophy. But it's definitely not a gut. There's a lot of reading and the papers and exams, particularly the latter, can be difficult. With that said, if you do your work and prepare well, it's also a fair class. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to get an intro to political philosophy, regardless of whether or not you think you'd like it. For example, I've realized after taking this class that political philosophy might just not be for me. However, I'm still thankful for the knowledge I learned and for knowing what I'm interested in.",
    "Strong recommendation",
    "awesome class. very interesting material that everyone should know. shapiro is a great lecturer. work isn't bad either",
    "It's a good introduction to political philosophy for people who want to get an overview without getting into incredibly technical aspects of the readings.",
    "One of those classes that you should probably take. Don't do the WI. There are better WI courses out there. Overall a great class, though Shapiro's 3 slide powerpoints can get a little monotonous.",
    "The class was very interesting! It covered a lot of different philosophers. It would have been nice if we had read a bit less works but covered them more thoroughly. The lectures were helpful and Professor Shapiro\u0092s book was great! It is a great writing credit. If you need a PoliSci Class that is not too difficult but covers a lot of interestingmaterial, take this one! The writing section is good if you need a writing credit, but if you don\u0092t, the regular section is probably a little less stressful.",
    "Helpful for understanding the context surrounding political discourse. Recommended if you are interested in politics and philosophy.",
    "This class is a good overview of major thinkers such as Locke, Marx, and Bentham. If you are curious about political philosophy then this is definitely a good foundation. You should take it writing intensive because then you receive a writing credit and the experience that you have analyzing the thinkers helps with the essay on the final. There is a lot of reading though.",
    "Covers what makes a government legitimate according to philosophers though the ages. Lectures are a bit dry, and sections are completely hit or miss. Definitely take it cr\/d\/f if you can - you'll get a good overview without having to do the (insane) amounts of reading.",
    "Good introduction to the quest for the moral legitimacy of politics. Good excuse to read and write about the greats of political philosophy if you haven't done so yet.",
    "Good syllabus, lecture can be boring. Avoid Ye Jin as a TA if possible.",
    "Take it, as any major. It's very foundational for other coursework in politics, philosophy, and even psychology. Professor Shapiro is an amazing lecturer, so take it with him.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone interested in political philosophy or politics in general. It provides a really good foundation in moral issues that underlie politics.",
    "I would recommend this especially as a writing credit. There are only 2 papers and you don't need to take the midterm. I definately wroteless than I have in non writing classes. Also the you get to read a lot of famous writers and learn about a lot of big ideas, which is great. It is good to have a basis in these thinkers since a lot of other people know about them. Could be frustratingly low level for some and I probably would not have taken it if I didn't need the writing credit. I would rather take something that goes more in depth or covers more interesting topics.",
    "It is a course on how political philosophy has evolved and influenced today's institutions. It teaches some interesting points and gets people to think of why we are doing something which is good. Also good for a WR credit.",
    "i would absolutely recommend this class to another student. it taught me the philosophical foundations upon which this country arose out of in an extremely interesting way.",
    "If you are very interested in Polisci go for it, if its not your thing think twice about it because the course is very reading heavy.",
    "Don't take this class. It's not interesting enough to be this difficult.",
    "It is a really good and an especially great WR. There are two papers and you are able to turn in drafts before the final thing. The ideas that are presented in this course will be fundamental to other class so it would be a good idea to take it early on.",
    "I really enjoyed MoFoPo.The class is all about the interaction of ideas about the best way to run a society so if you are interested in the modern progression of philosophical ideas about politics, or you like ethics and political philosophy this class is for you. Section is very important so pick your TF well, (Anthony Berryhill is the best, get him if you can). The class is a lot of reading, but it is not too hard if you try to keep up. The class was 'fun learning' for the most part and gave me a lot of ideas; it changed my perspective and outlook on a lot of questions and issues and I cannot give a class higher praise.",
    "MoFoPo is a good introduction to of a number of extremely important political thinkers, such as Bentham, Mill, Marx, Nozick, Rawls, Burke, etc. Each reading has some very fascinating ideas, and Professor Shapiro does a good job of providing an overview of each theory in lecture. Professor Shapiro's own theory about Democratic Justice is rather interesting as well. Overall, I would recommend the class, particularly as a writing credit.",
    "Make sure you are interested in political philosophy before taking this class! I thought I was and quickly learned that it was not for me.",
    "It's an ok Writing Credit.",
    "Yes, workload is not demanding, good way to get a writing credit",
    "MoFoPo is a good way to get a base for Poli Sci, and the material is often interesting. Beware, if you take this class there is a LOT of reading and it can be hard to follow the lectures if you do not do the reading. Shapiro is a good lecturer and he really knows his stuff.",
    "This class is worth taking if you are interested in political science. However if you are simply trying to fill credits I do not recommend this class. It requires A LOT of reading; probably an average of 140 pages per week so I do not recommend taking it the same semester as another class that requires a lot of reading. If you do take this course make sure that you have the time to do the reading.",
    "PLSC 118 is a solid class without too much work for a writing credit. The material is not terribly hard, and I would recommend it to a fellow student for this reason.",
    "I recommend the course as either Credit\/D or as a writing credit."
