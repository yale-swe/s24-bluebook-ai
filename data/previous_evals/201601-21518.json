    "I really like having read the DC. I feel more educated now. Mazzotta is obviously a genius and knows what he's talking about, but sometimes he goes on tangents\/talks about really lofty concepts that are a little too esoteric and could use some explanation. The quizzes are kind of hard, as there are only 3 text I.D.'s on each one. So if you don't know one, that's pretty bad.",
    "Take it!! The Mazzotta is a very engaging lecturer and does a wonderful job of introducing you to the critical themes of the poetry.",
    "Mazzotta is an excellent guide. The Divine Comedy is a very complicated poem and you will be grateful to have studied it under him. If you want to read it in Italian, this is your opportunity to do so; that of course makes it a much more time-consuming course, but I thought it was worth it.",
    "ITAL 310 provides a captivating and accessible introduction to Dante's Divine Comedy. There is quite a bit of workin addition to a midterm and final exam, there are regular quizzes at section and a final paperand students are required not only for being familiar with the \"big ideas\" at play in the text, but also for memorizing the myriad of structural details (plot, characters, etc.). That said, the work is well worth it!! I came into the semester thinking that I would not like Dante (that I was taking the class merely to fulfill a requirement for my major), but in the end, I found that Dante is one of my favorite authors from four years of studying literature, and I hope to return to him again and again in the future!",
    "A must-take Yale course, especially with Professor Mazzota. Even if you have read the Divine Comedy, you haven't picked up the tiny treasures of details that devoted Dante scholars have. And who doesn't want to think about themes like love, perfection and failure?",
    "I would thoroughly recommend this course if you are interested in reading the Divine Comedy. I think you'll definitely get more out of the work by taking this class than if you read it on your own."
