    "Yes, would definitely recommend it.",
    "This capstone project was wonderful. Our group consulted for the Small Arms Survey, a Geneva-based organization, and researched the armed groups in western and northern Africa. Not only did the students in the group have a great dynamic, Prof. Kocher served as a great faculty advisor. He guided the group and served as theinterlocutor with the organization without being overbearing or overly demanding. While the capstone projects, more generally, might have benefited from being year-long, rather than just for a semester, our project ended right on time. Our work was cleanly divided and the final product was admirable.",
    "I really enjoyed my particular project (Researching Armed Groups in West Africa for Small Arms Survey) and felt that it was a great way of tying together many of my interests and skills. Working together as part of a team of students on such a large project was surprisingly fun and rewarding. Such a structure provides a nice change of pace from traditional seminars. Also, the Jackson Institute seems to be doing a very good job of finding projects that are both \"academic\" but also \"applicable\" to the real word. However, having working on a two-semester independent senior project for a second major, as a \"culminating projects\" the capstone feels somewhat less rewarding in comparison. Thus, I would highly recommend the capstone experience to another student but also recommend considering options for a senior year independent research project.",
    "You're gonna have to do it. Should be fun."
