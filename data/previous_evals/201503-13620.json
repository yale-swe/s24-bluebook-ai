    "Cool course with a unique opportunity to do a meaningful final paper. Be aware that you will not know how you are doing in the course because grades are based on a single final paper. Given that, the paper becomes a big time commitment during finals. The material was certainly interesting, but the class felt geared more toward those with a philosophy background than psychology\/cognitive science.",
    "A great introduction to the recent work on morality in the diverse fields in cognitive science. Not too much work - a few articles for each week's seminar, and a final research paper at the end of the semester. Prof. Knobe was a great and engaged seminar leader, who made sure that the class was always moving in a productive direction. Take this class!",
    "Cognitive Science of Morality is a truly incredible seminar--in fact, it's by far the most incredible one I've taken at Yale. It does an excellent job exposing students to the current literature on the cognitive science of morality and experimental philosophy. This is perfect for any philosophy, psych, or cog sci major. Professor Knobe is simultaneously the most brilliant, the most generous, and the most accessible professor I have ever had. He is willing to do anything and everything to help his students and has one of the most fascinating minds I've ever seen. Every single class session was enjoyable and educative. Quite possibly the BEST seminar and professor at Yale. Seriously, if you are lucky enough to get in, TAKE IT!",
    "Take this class if you have the opportunity to! The content is super interesting, the workload is minimal, Professor Knobe is great and the final project is fairly open ended.",
    "This course was really interesting with fascinating readings and discussions each week. Unfortunately, Professor Knobe is not the greatest professor. He often cuts students off and inhibits the natural flow of the discussion which is frustrating. Furthermore, he does not respond to students weekly reading responses--which require a lot of time and work to write. There is also no grade breakdown available, so the final paper is essentially 100% of your grade and there are no guidelines or page requirements etc. So ultimately, despite being very interesting, this class was not enjoyable and was actually quite frustrating.",
    "Imagine coming to class, and then spending class seeing a brilliant Professor come up with crazy hypothetical examples and drawing diagrams to try to figure out morality - arguably one of the most abstract and yet practical things to try to figure out. It's a wonder to watch.",
    "Yes, take this course! The large research project alone is worth it for the excellent guidance you'll get.",
    "Each week you read a few papers, and then in class you attempt to discuss, understand, and explain these papers. The papers focus on a wide variety of topics within the cognitive science of morality, but are all very diverse and very interesting things to think about. I would recommend teh course.",
    "Really good for anyone interested in the topic. Highly recommended. You get freedom on your final project, which is really cool, and the support of a leading expert in the field."
