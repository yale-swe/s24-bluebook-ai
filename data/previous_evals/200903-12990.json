    "The material of the class was great and followed logically. The assignments, the drawing, midterm and the final papers, were reasonable and enjoyable.",
    "The course was very well organized. All information was provided at the right moment and the work load was commensurate to the possibility of the students to meet the requirements.",
    "The instructor is obviously very knswledgable regarding the subject manner and every weekly lecture is delivered with the most dedication and preparation. The assignments were perfectly reasonable in terms of course load - and the drawings were quite enjoyable to do.",
    "The lectures were informative, organized, and enjoyable. The syllabus was a helpful reference, full of additional readings we could use for further research on each topic presented. As Bryan is familiar with the amount of work required for advanced studio, his expectations for us were extremely reasonable. Assignment load was appropriate.",
    "I think the final paper should be due before Thanksgiving break. This will make sure that students do not relegate the paper to after the final week of studio."

   "comments": [
    "I expected a rather typical landscape class but got much more. It also covered a lot of architectural\/design theory and made a lot of interesting connections between the ancient and the modern world of architecture.",
    "All my expectations were met. I learned a lot and I enjoyed immensely Bryan\u0092s lectures. He was always very well prepared, valued our time and responsibly prepared his classes. He timely provided all required readings and always gave us the chance to deepen our knowledge through suggested readings. He was always available for discussion, both in and outside of class, and helped me elaborate on my paper topic in the most constructive way.",
    "The course exceeded my expectations in terms of knowledge conveyed.",
    "I expected to learn the historical development of landscape architecture from ancient Roman civilization to the Renaissance. In addition to this, the course incorporated a fair amount of modern examples of landscape design from which we could study similar motifs and typologies. Bryan\u0092s lectures provided a refreshing perspective on seminal architectural works as they relate to their integral exterior counterparts."

   "comments": [
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course, and think that it was invaluable to my education as an architect. Bryan is a huge asset to the school, and I feel fortunate to have taken the class.",
    "The course was amazing - I'm glad I took it. I learned a lot not just about \"landscape\" but about ancient Roman architecture, modern architecture, and typologies.",
    "It was very enlightening to have taken my first course in landscape instruction. Since landscape is such an integral part of architecture - i'm surprised that this is not a required course for the school of architecture.",
    "I had been looking forward to taking this course and its sequel (British Landscape) since I started the program. I wish that I had taken an architectural history survey as thorough and methodical earlier in my education.",
    "This course has been exceptionally valuable. I have had minimal exposure to the history of landscape design and this course has given me a much better understanding of the principles involved. This course helped me with studio as well as my other courses."

    "Bryan was great - enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and invested.",
    "Bryan was fantastic- one of the best classes ive had at YSOA. wonderful body of knowledge, expertise, and depth. a real treat to sit back and just listen adn learn. so much better than listening to other classmates make bs presentations on material that they do not really know. i would alwasy prefer to spend my time listening to my professor rather than classmates during class. thank you bryan for a wonderfull class.",
    "Bryan was such a dedicated instructor and really a delight to listen to.",
    "Bryan was a great instructor. He would be ready to answer questions, available to discuss issues outside the classroom, and excited enough at every class meeting to address students who had direct interest in the topic under discussion. I have not taken an elective at this school with someone as invested in the course and as interested in his students\u0092 comprehension of the material as Bryan. He takes the work we do as seriously as he takes his own performance. Most remarkably, he was so accommodating that he would give lectures students hadmissed at arranged times during the semester."
