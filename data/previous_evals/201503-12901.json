    "Awesome class! So much fun to take as a senior cog sci major- lectures were entertaining, interesting, and very easy to follow. The only hard part is doing all of the readings, which you REALLY need to do for the midterm and final- the experimental papers are very easy to read, but the long theoretical ones are tedious and sometimes unclear. But you don't have to know the specifics of the readings for the test, just the overall points and it is easy to pair up with others to split up the readings. Overall, the class was fantastic and having example midterm questions were super helpful. Karen Wynn is the absolute best to take a class with- unbelievably knowledge and fun, and she is so awesome about letting you ask questions and having short class discussions about topics. Also did a fun movie night for Project Nim- really cares about the class and it shows.",
    "yes yes yes! Take this course! it's amazing. There's a fair amount of work- lots of readings for every week. You probably don't want to read them all right before the exam because there are a lot. And the weight is almost entirely on the 2 exams so if you mess up on one it's going to be really tough to pull up your grade. There are 3 short papers but those are pretty manageable and not worth much. The topics covered are very very interesting and Karen is such a fantastic professor! The class was right after lunch (when it's usually hard for me to stay awake) BUT Karen is so engaging that it's literally impossible to fall asleep even if you wanted to. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Babies and Animals is a course I'd recommend to any student (major or non-major) interested in cognitive science\/psychology. Each lecture is fascinating and focused, and the overall theme of the course is narrow enough that you get the chance to go into these topics (e.g. number, language, emotion, attachment, etc. as they have been studied in infants and non-humans) in considerable depth. Prof. Wynn is fantastic all-around and the workload--weekly primary literature readings, three 1000-1500 word interesting thought papers, and two midterms--is completely fair. If you're looking for an upper-level psych course (or even an ambitious distributional requirement!) I'd definitely recommend.",
    "Would definitely recommend, especially for anyone interested in psychology or cog sci. This class provides lots of new and interesting material, and Professor Wynn is a lot of fun.",
    "Would not recommend to anyone with a prior psych background, or anyone interested in neuroscience rather than behavioral psych.",
    "This is a great course if you've ever wondered about how human babies and different animals think. This course covers a wide variety of topics including how babies and animals handle numbers, physics, language, emotions, and more. Professor Wynn also makes the class fun to attend, and the workload is manageable.",
    "This class sounds really easy. And the information is entertaining and digestible. And yet, it was definitely my lowest grade this semester. The tests are very tricky (often questions are about concepts buried on like page 12 of one of the 20 readings we were given...never talked about in lecture, etc), and the essays are graded harshly. There's a pretty solid stream of work for such a seemingly benign topic. Also, Professor Wynn, though very kind and well-meaning, can often be a little annoying... But! I emerged with an amazing collection of funfacts about babies and animals which is great for small-talk (and also for my CogSci major)",
    "I really enjoyed this course -- I'm a physics major and took the course as a social science without any prior exposure to cognitive science or psychology, and I felt that it had both enough breadth to give me a satisfying background in cognitive science and enough depth to showcase Professor Wynn's expertise in infant cognition. Prof. Wynn is incredible, gave great, engaging lectures, chose interesting, informative readings, and wrote challenging but reasonable exams.",
    "While I enjoyed Mental Lives, the content of the lectures does not necessarily align with the types of evaluations assigned. The lectures are a survey, while the exams ask you to remember specific readings (do all the reading!), and the essays are more thought-experiments than arguments. So, while the lectures may serve as a valuable overview for anyone, I think the readings and assignments are suited to psych and cog sci majors who are truly interested in -- and want to engage rigorously with -- the subject matter.",
    "Learn cool things about babies and animals. Be able to impress people with knowledge of experiments and psychology. Class was too long but the exams weren't too bad.",
    "It's a very interesting course without particularly heavy requirements. Granted, I took it credit\/D, so my perspective may be a bit skewed, but as long as you keep up on the reading it's quite manageable. Don't assume it's a gut just because of the low-key lectures--the tests draw serious material from the readings, and the three short writing assignments (around 1000 words each) do require you to do some solid analysis. I'm not crazy about Wynn as a lecturer, but she obviously knows her stuff, so I got used to it.",
    "I would not recommend PSYC 304 to another student.",
    "Id recommend it to another student. Its not a gut class. Its a fun and engaging class that might make you think in ways that you havent before and can also engage you if youve been studying this sort of thing for most of your undergraduate career. You learn about fish that will act selectively nice when there are witnesses around but will be mean when theres no one there to hear you scream.its great. I actually stopped eating fish (I was pescatarian at the time) while I was taking this course because we talked a good amount about fish cognition, and at some point I just couldnt stomach eating them anymore. In any case, this is a solid course for anyone whos relatively interested in the subject. Go to lectures, do the readings, study for the exams and youll get a lot out of the course!",
    "I recommend this to anyone interested in psychology. Baby psychology is awesome, and the comparative psych was also interesting. If you've taken Dev Psyc already, you might get bored during some lectures, but there is a decent amount of new material.",
    "Mental Lives of Babies and Animals was a great overview of several different mental capacities as they appear in infants and animals. Throughout the class, we compare and contrast concepts between infants and animals, and it is very interesting to see how much is help in common, as well as what is potentially unique in humans. There are three short essays and one midterm, with a slightly cumulative final. There may seem to be a lot of readings sometimes, but you mostly only need main ideas not details. For example, we are sometimes assigned the research articles for the experiments we learn about in class, but the details given in class are generally enough. Professor Wynn is a fun lecturer, and is helpful and open to suggestions.",
    "Mental Lives of Babies and Animals was a spectacular class. Karen Wynn is an engaging and informative lecturer who truly cares about her students and will stay after or arrange a time outside of class to answer questions. This course is a wonderful look into the study of non-adult human minds, complete with animal videos, experimental methodology, and straight, sweet science. Be cautious if the TF is David Menikoff though, he is quite hard to please grade-wise.",
    "This class is fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone, not just psych majors and animal lovers. The readings are a little bit dry at times but the class itself was always fun and engaging. I loved Professor Wynn and found her to be very friendly and approachable.",
    "If you are interested in research based psychology but not necessarily of the human variety, this class is a great intro. The reading assignments are interesting, but not necessary to understand lecture. However, some questions on the exams did ask for reading specific examples.",
    "I would recommend as an easy 5th class or a Credit\/D\/Fail class. Two midterms, three essays, and no final. Prof Wynn is very quirky and often awkward but very sweet. She claims 50% of exams are based on readings but since it's a psych class I was able to BS the reading-based questions based on intuition and do fine on the first midterm without having done any of the readings. After skimming the readings in the few hours before the second midterm, I was able to answer every question so the readings are definitely not extremely necessary, especially if you're taking it Credit\/D. Repetitive material from intro and sexy psych but overall an interesting course. Lectures can get very dry and I noticed many people started to not come to class as the year went on.",
    "If you like comparative cognition and are looking for a fun and not-too-rigorous SO, take it. You'll learn a lot of interesting things to tell your parents when they ask \"what did you learn this semester?\""
