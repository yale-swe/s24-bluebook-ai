    "Awesome, do it if interested in research",
    "I took MCDB 475 my second semester senior year, to fulfill the senior requirement. If you find a supportive lab that aligns with your interests, then it can be really rewarding. Unfortunately, it's also quite difficult to complete a project in one semester, but that's the rub with 475 - and I didn't want to take 485 or 495 since I'm not planning on going into hard science research.",
    "Independent research",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in performing intense research and getting credit for it, as well as in gaining experience writing a research paper.",
    "I started doing research my junior spring and will continue conducting research senior year, and taking this class credit\/fail was great because then I could focus on getting into the lab and lab work instead of focusing on getting a certain letter grade."
