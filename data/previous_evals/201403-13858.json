    "Definitely continues language development.",
    "This class is great! You learn how to speak Portuguese through interesting lesson plans revolving around current issues, music, literature or intellectual debates. I learned a ton about Brazilian culture. If you are interested in Brazil\/Portuguese culture and learning Portuguese, definitely take this class with Selma! I haven't had any of the other teachers but Selma is great. She is easy going and a great teacher.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students interested in improving their Portuguese oral and written communication skills. There is a significant emphasis on Brazilian culture and current affairs, and a student with an interest in Brazil and Latin America should greatly benefit from taking this course."
