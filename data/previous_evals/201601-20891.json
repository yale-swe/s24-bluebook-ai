   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class if you're at all interesting in making things. They supply a good amount of plastic and concrete and even some wood that's free to use. Of course, materials can add up if you need more specific things, but often the dollar store has perfectly good material for cheap. Also, go to artists and craftsman for supplies, Hull's sucks and is overpriced.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow classmate.",
    "Creative and varied exploration of sculpture. Pretty nontraditional with little technical instruction. Focus on materials and interpretation.",
    "ART 110 is an excellent course for someone who wants to learn different methods of manipulating space (and time) (and material) in creative ways. My advice would be: take it for the sake of making Things, but come to class prepared with ideas (and a rough idea of how you intend to put those ideas into being)otherwise, the class can be quite tedious, and you might spend a lot of the (almost) two hour class-time standing around wishing you knew how to do the Things (that everyone else seems to know how to do). Sandra, however, is also supportive in her critiques and seems to care deeply about connecting her students ideas with the Real World. I would take it again.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, regardless of interest or aptitude in art, and even if they aren't an art major. I think there is definitely something to be taken away from a creative exploration of the abstract which in my opinion would be useful for everyone."
