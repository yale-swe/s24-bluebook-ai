I also think the field trip was fun and informative! Some of the guest lecturers at the end of the semester were also interesting (the guy on the last day who worked with NASA...not so much)",
    "The final project was the best aspect of the course. While lectures were informative and helpful to understand the concepts used in Remote Sensing, the practice of using remote sensing to answer a given question was the best experience.",
    "I really enjoyed learning the concepts at the beginning of the course. I also learned a tremendous amount from working on my final project.",
    "Working on the course project was very helpful to individual learning. Larry was very helpful with guiding the final projects and is very knowledgeable.",
    "I really loved learning the different techniques, technology, sensors, and the scientific background in this course. Professor Lee provides very clear instruction. Application of remote sensing techniques seem almost boundless and this class left me with a sense of excited anticipation not only for the future of remote sensing but also for the ways that these techniques can be applied to my work today and into the future! An awesome introduction with very useful hands-on experience in the lab portion.",

   "comments": [
    "I wish that my own project work could have been integrated into the labs, for example, applying new techniques but to our own data. I think this would have incentivized me to to the labs better and probably would have helped improve my final project. As mentioned above, I think that some of the early teaching on physics was less useful, and could be traded out with more applied teaching (I've already forgotten all of the equations we had to learn, for example). I think it could be really interesting to instead assign scientific papers that use remote sensing in different areas, and then discuss in detail how these projects were done (Dr. Seto's presentation was the most similar to this approach).",
    "I really didn't like the way that this class was structured; I wish there had been less theoretical material and more time working with, and getting comfortable with ENVI. The labs were okay, but they didn't really require much thought and could be really boring because of the repetitive nature of some of the lab report questions. It might have been more interesting to start the project earlier so people can pick an area of study, and then do the lab exercises based on their regions of study. The results from some of the labs could then be incorporated into the project. I also think the problem sets were a total waste of time and felt like undergraduate busy work. For example, problem set one had about 10 questions where all we were doing was converting units. Either you know how to do a conversion or you don't; we don't need to be repeating that process over and over as some form of a rote exercise.",
    "The field trip was not very useful and involved hopping on and off the bus a lot. It would have been more fun to do a walking field trip instead.",
    "I really enjoyed the course, but I think that the assignments could be adjusted to improve the course overall. After spring break I would have preferred to focus entirely on my final project. Instead, I spent almost all of my available time in the lab trying to complete the lab assignments. The labs were helpful at the beginning of the course, but I think it would be more useful to stop having lab assignments, and give students that time to work on their projects. Maybe, make the labs available for review in case a student wants to use that particular tool in their project. The class already takes up a considerable amount of time, and I could only allocate so much to both the labs and the final project.",
    "The lab exercises could be improved. I appreciate that there is a lab section for this course but the labs feel like pushing buttons and I didn't fully learn or understand how to use ENVI until it came time to do the course project. The labs are great resources for the course projects because the instructions are so detailed.",
    "I think the course is very well put-together and would recommend it to anyone as-is.",
    "I did not learn much about troubleshooting within ENVI because all the labs were so prescribed. Is there a way to make the labs just as informative and low-stress, without having them be so prescribed and giving students a chance to troubleshoot on their own? Also, lectures in the second half of the semester were not as relevant. There were some that seemed like they were just trying to fill time, especially guest speaker Dr. Ashton.",
    "Lectures, although among the best-prepared on campus, lose a lot of worth by only being available late the night before they are presented, so it is impossible to prepare them unless one wants to get little sleep the night before this morning class Exam is too long Ungraded course requirements Inaccurate information on course-integral CEO website, long into the semester Posting student names and materials publicly without student consent Using grading criteria that are not for components taught in the course Unbelievably little feedback on the written and compiled major course project, while feedback that was given was mostly for the brief presentation, which is listed as ungraded Grade for final project based almost completely on the supposedly ungraded presentation and very little on all of the work that went into the paper Three weeks is not enough time for preparation of a project that is expected to be completed to the caliber of a major presentation and thesis; grading favor is heavily slanted toward students who have a major project on which to draw from outside this class Project is presented as exploratory yet graded as if it was to have reached a certain completion point, again favoring students with a major project from outside the course Other components interfere with what is laughably presented as three weeks to work on course project Field trip held during the three-week project period, also during major holy days for several faiths First of the three in-class project-prep lab days is spent mostly discussing and preparing the field trip, second project prep day spent writing up the ungraded field trip, third day lab is too crowded with people from the other lab sections Course project is so extensive that it interferes with other courses at a very busy time of the semester; extent of project is fine, and projects are the most important part of course, but more time is needed for them, and student time needs to be respected, unfettered by discussion, previous-lab completion and field trip components Lab staff seemed to pick and choose whom to help for projects, how much and when, at a time when a let-them-figure-it-out approach is not useful; lab staff sometimes spent extensive time chatting with some people even though having told others no time to even answer a question Lab staff discussed student work habits and work styles and preferences behind their backs, not good practice even though names were not named During presentations, some students were supported and others were treated rudely by course leaders, inappropriate even if presentation is seen as poor That this puzzling end of semester time can be experienced as not supportive of learning and overly stressful, and the course can still be held as very good means, both that a lot of work has gone into preparing the course and that more attention needs to be given to the student experience of the course as a fair, supportive, respectful of students, if appropriately challenging, learning experience."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - I think linking final project more directly with the labs could be useful, especially the last few labs that were completed while working on the final project. At that time I was excited about the project and the labs felt more like busy work.",
    "Again, I think that the lecture material needs to be better tied into the labs. The lectures seemed very theoretical, whereas the labs were very applied. It would have been nice to have more of a bridge between the two (maybe talk about different applications during the lectures, rather than just the theory or physics or statistics behind a new tool).",
    "The lab assignments often took a very long time to complete. Towards the end of the course, I found that completing the lab assignments took away from the time I needed to work on my project. Maybe ending the labs a week or 2 sooner would be helpful to make sure the project gets the time it needs.",

Very engaging and the material really sparked my imagination and curiosity for climate, weather, and Earth!",
    "I think they are great",
    "Good",

You will leave this course with a treasure box of ideas and skills for answering questions about more topics than you can imagine! Enjoy!",
