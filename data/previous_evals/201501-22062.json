   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a great seminar with good load of reading but less than a lot of other seminars out there. There are a lot of scholarly articles every week, which can be a chore to plod through sometimes. The discussion, however, was always engaging, and Auld is a fantastic professor. One thing to be prepared for is that there was more theory surrounding markets involved in the class than I expected there to be beforehand.",
    "Social activism may not be your cup of tea, but understanding the most effective way to influence a group and communicate your message to a large group of people is important",
    "Yes I would recommend this to a student interested in economics and the ways social movements interact with the private sector.",
    "I would recommend this class 100%. I did not know how interesting the strategies and tactics of activism, and how these actions influence global markets",
    "If you don't mind a more general, discussion based course, take it! Might be frustrating for students who want more in depth, detailed studies. I Found discussions very interesting and got a lot out of the readings.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, mostly because of the professor, the people in the class and the discussion... the readings were really very boring but somehow when we got to class the discussion about the readings was always interesting. what's really great about this class is that you have to turn in a draft for your final paper early in the semester so you end up writing a final paper you're actually proud of, and it can be basically about anything.... apart from the final paper you only have two in class presentations and that's it. It's very easy in terms of workload and still very interesting! while I enjoyed talking about consumer activist movements, I think that talking about certification programs was quite dull... there's a mix of interesting ideas and some dull stuff, but prof. auld is awesome and great at leading a good discussion. Overall I'm not sure I can concretely point to specific things I learned, but know I've grown a lot through discussion and the final paper.",
    "This course takes a rigorous, academic approach to the topics of social movements (boycotts, buycotts - just to name a few). It delves into theory in the first half, and then complements the theory with case studies in the latter half of the course. Each constituent part of the syllabus melds well with the whole, and a cohesive flow emerges from the 11-week curriculum. I would most definitely recommend this course. This is growing to be an extremely important field. Moreover, it looks to things we see in our everyday lives (kosher certification, fair trade coffee) and compels us to think critically about them.",
    "If this course is taught again -- given that Professor Auld, who taught it this semester, was at Yale for a one-year fellowship -- then I would definitely recommend taking it. The course is an important interdisciplinary course that brings in social movement theory, political economy (trade, regulation, and theory of private markets), environmental policy, specific studies of private certification programs. I enjoyed the company of many of my classmates, who brought a variety of perspectives and disciplinary backgrounds. The research paper is open ended and allows you to explore whatever environmental issue (relating to markets and economies) is important to you - Professor Auld was flexible and helpful in molding my topic."
