    "This is a great class to improve your Hindi. It's small; Swapna Ji is incredibly dedicated to helping you learn; you get the chance to sing songs and watch movies, and the workload isn't too bad. I went from just knowing how to read\/write\/understand to being able to hold a conversation with my parents. This is a great class.",
    "This class is designed for students who have had some sort of exposure to Hindi in the past, whether it be speaking or writing. If you are of South Asian heritage but wouldn't understand a drop of Hindi, don't take this class (it's an L3)! That being said, I came in with no literacy skills but I could speak and understand fairly well. Although it was tough in the beginning catching up with the alphabet and writing, once I learned within about a month, the course became much easier. The setting is very intimate (we had 5 students) and thus our professor Swapnaji was able to tailor the class to fit our needs. If she feels at any point your level is higher or lower than everyone else's she'll give you more reading or more help during office hours. She is very knowledgable on many South Asian languages and their cultures. She is also an amazing cook and a generous host. We were invited to her house for dinner! In terms of workload, we met twice a week (which is rare, since most L3 languages meet 5 days) and our classes were at 4 pm. The homework was pretty relaxed but I strongly advise you actually do the homework or else you won't end up getting anything from the language. Swpanaji is very nice and understanding but it's best not to take advantage of that. Our midterm assignment was to prepare a short skit, which was very fun and didn't seem like much work. Our final project was a magazine which took some effort but at least you won't have an exam during finals week. We also watched a movie in class toward the end of the semester. Overall, I had a great experience and learned how to read and write! This was also an easy way to fulfill a language requirement if you take L3 and L4, both of which are relaxed classes, but can be a challenge if you commit yourself nonetheless."
