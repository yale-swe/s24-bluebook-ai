   "comments": [
    "FREN 150 is an intense course that demands a lot of its students. Most of the grammar review isn't new, but it requires that one be more precise about certain nuances. This proves exceptionally difficult because very little time is spent reviewing grammar in class; the onus is on the student. If one is committed, however, to doing the review exercises carefully (the professors no longer check to see if you did them), FREN 150 has a lot to offer; the selection and variety of works (both texts and films) is phenomenal, and the discussions in class and analysis that one does in the essays are genuinely rewarding. If you can, take this with Madame Hoffman; she is dynamic, fun, and not-at-all intimidating.",
    "Continues along with grammar and new vocab. Helps with french skills. Would recommend for those interested in continuing french skills",
    "If you're comfortable and proficient in French, don't take this course. It is a waste of time unless you have serious gaps in grammar and such.",
    "Seemed to be more work than L4, despite meeting fewer times. Luckily, it's still a top quality, fun class to take. Consistent workload."
