    "Functioning of wetlands, how to define and delineate them; current issues in wetlands conservation and protection; impacts of climate change and human disturbance on wetlands and the implications of those. Also learned a lot about the flora and fauna unique to wetlands and how to identify them.",
    "Basic understanding of wetland types, ecology, threats, and intersectionality with climate change.",
    "I gained a deep and very detailed comprehension of wetlands, the roles they play in society and the global ecosystem, and how humans can begin improving our stewardship and relationship with wetlands.",
    "I learned a lot about wetlands and scientific studies.",
    "Wetland delineation methods, the importance of coastal wetlands, and an understanding of conflict surrounding wetlands.",
    "I learned about physical characteristics of wetlands, legal perceptions of wetlands and about the importance of wetlands for certain ecosystem services.",
    "A comprehensive understanding of wetlands and wetland ecology. Nuances of law and policy as they relate to wetlands included as well.",
    "wetland delineation, wetland classification, wetland management and also societal implications of wetlands.",

    "Outstanding, I am very interested in all aquatic ecosystems and this course was great.",
    "Very well, although I wished that there had been more emphasis on the basics of wetlands management, how someone managing a wetland would build a management plan, etc.",
    "The knowledge I gained exceeded my expectations. I now see wetlands all around me and understand the many complex ways in which humans impact wetlands (dam, dredging, filling, pollution, etc.) and watersheds in general, as well as how we can help them.",
    "I expected to learn more about different types of wetlands. I also expected to spend more time on wetland delineation.",
    "I expected a bit more wetland plant and animal identification, but I gained a broader understanding of wetlands globally.",
    "I took this class to learn about the ecology of wetlands. I learned this and more. I found the non-ecology course material interesting also, and I liked how all the material was inter-related. This made it easier for me to find an entry point and to learn about all the material comprehensively.",
    "Exceeded expectations. Professor Freidenburg was knowledgable and supportive.",
    "Very well!",
    "Pretty in line."

   "comments": [
    "Content was very, very good. Mix of classroom lectures, student presentations and field trips was great. I like the once a week format as well. I would be very happy to see a \"part II\" of this class called advanced wetlands or something like that and go even deeper into the subject matter.",
    "Strengths included the field trips, Kealoha, the final project, Mary Burak, the weekly reading response structure, and the readings on dam removal in Week 8. In the early weeks, it felt like we never discussed a lot of the content of the readings. We read about classification systems but didn't delve much into what sets different types of wetlands apart from each other in class. The 3-hour length is also a little tough, but I understand that we don't get the field trips in a shorter time period, so it's manageable. Also, I didn't get as much out of the mini-field trip with Megan Raymond to the sort-of wetland area on Yale's campus.",
    "The class discussions we have make sure that everyone's thoughts, ideas, questions, etc. got addressed at length. The field trips were also a great opportunity to get off campus and do in-field soil samples, plant identification, and wetland analyses with professionals.",
    "Overall, this class provides a great overview of wetlands. The course was well organized and the guest speakers were interesting. I liked the Wetlands in the News and the final presentations. I also enjoyed the field trips. One thing I would change is the reading responses. It was difficult to submit responses by 1:00 pm on Sundays. I often traveled on the weekends and had to be very intentional about completing the assignments. If I did them before the weekend, I would forget some of it by Monday. If I did them over the weekend, it was difficult to find the time. Also, the book was on reserve at CSSSI, but they are not open until 1:00 pm on Sundays. This meant that if you wanted to use the book, you had to go to the library on Saturday. But, the library also closes early on Saturdays. A deadline later on Sundays would have worked better. Additionally, it felt like a lot to come up with a comment and a question for every single reading. I did not always have a question and felt like I was forcing my response at times. Perhaps a choice between a comment or a question would work better. Another thing I would change is the plants. I think it is helpful for students to learn about wetland plants, but it was a little too unstructured. Students who had a background in ecology seemed to be at an advantage. It would have been more helpful to go over the plants in class in a structured lecture.",
    "The course was great in that it incorporated field work, herbarium specimens, and guest speakers. I wish that we could have done a bit more with the herbarium specimens, in terms of practicing identifying plants, wetland types, and other specimens.",
    "Strengths: The guest speakers and field trips were interesting and also offered a more professional perspective than the other weeks did. We had a great class size. The discussions rarely waned. I liked how we submitted questions about the material before class and our questions were always addressed during class. I hope you keep the once-a-week format.",
    "The content was fantastic, having lecture once a week made for a dense Monday. Would have liked to have the class spread over two classes during the week.",
    "The wetlands in the news were awesome, so were the case studies and the guest speakers. I would like more of them. I also felt like classes dragged on for a bit and the lectures could be a little long when we didn't have activities or discussions. The reading posts felt a little useless on some days, and I would have preferred something more active and participatory.",
    "The length of class was good inasmuch as it allowed us to go on short field trips and have long lectures, but it would also be nice to have dedicated field time outside of normal class hours",
    "Field trips were great! Guest speakers were great! I think splitting the course into two sections rather than one long meeting period per week would be better (although the field trips are great, so Im not sure how you could manage this) I really liked the flexibility in the final presentations and the wetlands in the news."

    "Do the readings ahead of class and do them thoroughly. Attend all the field trips as they really bring the material to life.",

    "Overall, this is a great class. The workload is manageable, the professor is really nice, and the field trips are fun.",
    "It is very fun, and I learned a lot about the function of wetlands broadly. The technical material wasn't very intense, but that was kind of nice.",
    "Take this if you have any interest in wetlands. You will gain a comprehensive overview of the science and social aspects too.",
    "Make sure to stay on top of the readings and stay engaged during class.",
    "Make sure to read the textbook! It is great!",
    "If you're not interested in a more technical, ecology-focused class (as opposed to conservation\/management), then this is not the class for you. Otherwise, it's excellent!"
