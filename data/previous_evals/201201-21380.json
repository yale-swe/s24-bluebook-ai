    "Very difficult and only take it if you need to",
    "It is definitely not an easy course. The material is very interesting, but the work can be very time consuming and challenging. I reserve my recommendation of this class only for those who intend to use this course toward their major.",
    "Pchem is a good year-long class introducing in physical chemistry. The second semester is almost all quantum, which means a lot of math and derivations. If you love it, if not - well, you'll have to survive. Work with other students and it should be fine.",
    "This is a hard class, but Zilm's notes are fantastic. You'll just have to put in the time to learn them. Also, problem sets take forever, so make sure you find a good study partner\/group!",
    "There is a lot of really tough material in this course that is really rewarding once you understand it, but be proactive from the very start about understanding material well, because it all builds upon itself. The reason Professor Zilm gets a bad reputation isn't because he doesn't lecture well- he's pretty straightforward, and goes fast necessarily due to the nature of the class, and even puts great lecture notes online. He gets a bad reputation because he can be difficult to go to for help, so figure out resources that work for you form the very start- for me, finding a good group to work on problem sets with worked best, but I should have done it earlier in the semester.",
    "Yes. I was afraid of this class but I actually really enjoyed it. It's hard but it's manageable with Professor Zilm.",
    "You will delve into quantum mechanics like you have never delved into it before. There's a lot of math and a lot of deriving. If you grasp the conceptual aspects, you will probably be set for whatever future chemistry you do, but you will also be expected to understand and use quite a bit of the math.",
    "good solid, organized class with manageable amounts of work. Some derivations can get long and complex, but you come out with a much better and deeper understanding of a lot of general chemistry concepts.",
    "Course was really well-taught; Zilm was a wonderful professor and I learned a lot coming out of the course. The tests were fair, and I'm glad I took the course overall.",
    "I would recommend this course highly even to non-majors - it's a great introduction to quantum and stat mech.",
    "Much better than first semester with Schmuttenmaer. You're probably taking it because it's required for Chemistry and ChemE (but unfortunately not so relevant to ChemE). Lots of derivations, a good survey of quantum mechanics and other aspects of physical chemistry. I wish we did some calculations that were a little more in depth. The notes are really good so it's not necessary to go to class. The curve is tough but if you complete all problem sets and study guides for the tests you will do fine.",
    "This is a great class and will teach you so much. I finally understood quantum mechanics. Take it! And take it with Zilm if you get a chance, it was really solid.",
    "This is an intense class that covers quantum mechanics and statistical thermodynamics. This class is far from Chem332 last semester, in that more involved mathematics will be included. That said, the material is far more interesting, and the tests are much fairer (does not mean easier) than Chem332.",
    "CHEM333 was an excellent course, and Professor Zilm was one of the best professorsI have had while at Yale. His lectures were quite engaging and he also put full lecture notes online, which were quite handy. It was quite fascinating to learn the quantum and statistical mechanics foundation behind much of chemistry.",
    "Much more difficult than first semester, but you've probably got to take this, so try to have fun?",
    "Hardest chem class, in my opinion. Orgo was way better and first semester pchem was way easier.",
    "For the tests, do the study problems that Zilm gives you, study the derivations, and remember the homework problems. The questions on the tests are easier than the homework problems and are usually variants of the study problems, some class derivations, and some of the easier homework problems. If you do this, the class will be ok. Keep the big picture of the derivations in mind.",
    "CHEM 333 is a hard class. Definitely harder than 332 in the fall, and definitely harder than any other chemistry class you have taken. That said, this class is phenomenal if you are willing to put in the work (we're talking 10-20 hour problem sets and lots of studying before exams). The class is fair, and Zilm does a great job of posting really clear notes online after every class. You will cover the basics of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics, and basically derive all the postulates that were just handed to you in organic class. Take this class if you want to understand the fundamentals of chemistry and are willing to work hard. If you need to take it for your major, be warned that you need to put it a significant amount of time if you want to learn the material and get a good grade -- but that you will come out feeling like you've learned so much!",
    "Math Heavy course, make sure you put the time in to nail down the subjects",
    "This class is fine. Lots of crazy material that will probably never come up around the dinner table, but interesting nonetheless. Zilm is actually a decent professor, even though he sucks as a person and is not the nicest guy in the world. The material is manageable as long as you read the notes carefully and study them for the exams. If you have the option to wait and take it with Vaccaro, I would do that, but that may just be because I really dislike Zilm."
