   "comments": [
    "Haskell! I don't really remember much of the linguistics knowledge (probably that's because I didn't pay attention to the linguistics part, not because of the class), but playing with Haskell was fun.",
    "On the theoretical side, I gained a much greater understanding of how to tackle the formal treatment of meaning. On the practical side, I learned how to code in Haskell.",
    "I learned all kinds of cool stuff about logic and semantics in this course. I also got much better at functional programming. Lecture was always a very interesting mashup of theory and implementation. I remember how, during our last class, almost everyone voted to have an additional 2 hour make-up class because they found they wanted to learn more about vector semantics.",
    "abstract thinking, modeling, applied logic, programming. So MANY.",
    "Knowledge on (English) syntax, semantics, first order logic. Skills on Haskell (functional) programming."

   "comments": [
    "This course was great, probably because of Professor Bob Frank. His homework assignments are of perfect difficulty level: challenging but not impossible\/too time consuming. If you like CS\/functional programming language you will like Haskell. Prof Frank is also engaging in lecture, but the only minus part of the class is the once a week meeting time. I think meeting for more than once a week will help a lot with keeping students engaged constantly.",
    "I really liked the course's structure, no suggestions other than to keep it up!",
    "Amazing course overall. Class was interesting and the problem sets were challenging but not tedious. One thing that could be improved is that, sometimes, the homeworks were released later than expected or had confusing typos.",
    "Pros: Professor Frank is extremely clear and enthusiastic. His problem sets are concise and fun. (I usually did them for fun on Fridays or Sundays). Even Haskell was fun to learn, when we weren't forced to build everything from scratch but got scaffolds where we could fill in the interesting problems. Cons: The course was a bit slow in general. Especially since I had taken mathematical logic, there happened to be a lot of overlap."

   "comments": [
    "YES! Definitely, if you i) like computer science and ii) want to learn about a fun application of computer science i.e. linguistics.",
    "Yes but be prepared for a sporadic workload (sometimes no problem sets for week, final project is intense)",
    "'Twas definitely a course I would recommend! Bob is perhaps my favorite teacher at Yale, as he always explains abstract concepts in an engaging and understandable manner, and the topics covered are very interesting--including various ways to represent sentential meaning formally, such as with first order propositional logic, as well as the perhaps the hottest topic in the field now, namely the word2vec technique for representing word meanings.",
    "This was a pretty enjoyable course. Though I had a strong CS background, I had never taken a course in linguistics, so I found some of the linguistics aspects of the course to be challenging. Furthermore, programming in Haskell is an interesting and potentially challenging experience even if you have coded a lot before.",
    "I'd recommend this to anyone who's into CS or linguistics. You definitely need some programming experience to do this course.",
    "Absolutely. What a class! Prof. Frank is a brilliant lecturer and the material covered in the course is relevant to students across so many disciplines (linguistics, CS, philosophy, cogsci, music...) The coding in Haskell is not too difficult to pick up and the assignments are all purposefully designed and fun to complete. Definitely not the easiest course I've taken at Yale, but I feel like my effort was rewarded in full.",
