    "160 is a conversation based class, so there aren't very many big writing assignments, but you're still expected to keep up with the material and be able to talk about it every day, which does involve some busywork. That being said, it's fun and interesting, Mme Pinzka is great, and I highly recommend it!",
    "If you're looking to improve your conversational French and your understanding of French culture, I would certainly recommend French 160! It is very similar to AP French but goes deeper into some topics, and I am glad that I took it to keep my French speaking skills strong!",
    "A bit more work than you'd expect. Pinzka is an amazing professor who's extremely knowledgeable and obviously loves the subject she teaches. However, this class is a significant step up in difficulty from lower level French classes, so be prepared.",
    "Yes! Take to have great conversation about French society",
    "FREN 160 was a fantastic course I would definitely recommend, given you already have a good foundation in French. I came from not having spoken French in over one and a half years, and although the beginning was difficult, the language comes back quickly with some work. At first the workload may be a bit much, but I think that it was very rewarding in the end. I definitely feel like I understand substantially more about French language and culture after this semester, and I would even say that this class has pushed me to take more French classes in the future."
