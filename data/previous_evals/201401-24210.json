    "Definitely recommend.",
    "It's a good class if you're interested in qualitative methods and want to prepare to do your own research.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who plans on conducting qualitative research. And for those who intend to incorporate ethnographic work, I would recommend it in addition to or in lieu of the field methods course offered in Poly Sci. This course will help a student prepare and launch her research. It is equally perfect for a student developing a research project for a second-year paper or a dissertation prospectus.",
    "I would summarize this course as an introduction to qualitative research design and methods with an emphasis on publishing in general sociology journals. I would recommend this course to any student interested in qualitative research and would go further to suggest that this course is essential for such students, especially in the sociology department.",
    "Take it before starting a research."
