   "comments": [
    "This course does have rather more busy work that I would have wanted; be aware that you'll have listening-and-response assignments due each week, as well as about a (short) chapter of reading, several articles (sometimes with responses), and more often than not, some sort of written assignment about two-thirds of a page long. Be prepared for vocabulary tests every two or three weeks and two oral exams.I took this class with DS, so the workload was tough, but the material was interesting and engaging, and Mme Pinzka is very enthusiastic. Watching six movies for homework was a great plus.",
    "Yes, providing the student has a genuine interest in French language and culture.",
    "There is quite a lot of homework three times a week - short writing assignments, vocabulary exercises, and video responses. It does take time to complete these assignments, so be ready! However, they do get easier with time and it is never a problem, unless you fall behind on work. Classes themselves are really chill and easy-going, especially if you've prepared for a bit before coming in. Your experience can also vary depending on who else is in the class - you will spend A LOT of time talking to your classmates, and might end up making new friends! It's a really cool class - take it!",
    "It's essentially a class where you watch\/read things about contemporary life and political issues in France and then discuss them. Be prepared for a short assignment every night; there's a moderate and steady workload. Although the exercises can occasionally feel like busy work, they're quite rewarding on the whole, and you'll definitely leave the class feeling like you've learned a lot about French culture. The small, intimate setting of the class increases its quality, making it feel less like a class and more like a discussion among friends."
