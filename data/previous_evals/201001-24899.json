    "This class is definitely not for someone interested in \"classic\" Japanese literature such as Tale of Genji as most of the books, though prize winners, seem more current. Be prepared to read about sex and violence. Discussions are usually interesting and listening to Professor Treat is also. Unfortunately, it seems very difficult to get an A, so perhaps a credit\/D route would be best to take.",
    "The selection of works is diverse and interesting. If taking the course to discuss literature, then take the initiative yourself or ask for literary insight from Professor Treat. He tends to focus on explaining the social context over the literary value of each work.",
    "If you are at all interested in learning anything about Japan in the slightest, this course will plunge you head-first into the most interesting topics Japanese literature has to offer. Be forewarned, though: a majority of the works contain very graphic material, including murders, explicit sex, and substance abuse. But that's what makes the class so interesting - reading this stuff, instead of, say, watching it, provides a whole new experience. Give this class a shot - it is definitely worth your time. I absolutely loved the course syllabus (although a yaoi novel was - in my opinion - unnecessarily assigned), and I read almost every single work cover to cover. Perhaps one of the greatest strengths of the class was Professor Treat's incredible knowledge accrued from years of living and working in Japan. Whenever he says, \"Let me tell you a story...\" make sure you listen. His anecdotes are always fascinating. All in all, a fantastic class!",
    "I think Professor Treat gave some good context for considering the class. You don't necessarily learn about Japan by taking the class, you learn about some contemporary Japanese literature. I'd have a hard time recommending the class to someone who's not already studying Japanese literature. A lot of the readings are interesting, but there are still quite a few that aren't, and the secondary scholarship we read is not the greatest. The classes can be hit or miss, some days the discussion is really interesting, whereas in others the discussion can be dry.",
    "Amazing discussion, small workload except for some large readings, and very easy.",
    "This class is a fantastic fourth or fifth class. The readings were very interesting and very out-of-the-ordinary - refreshing. The workload consists of two 8-10 page literary analyses. A caveat, though: you read some very strange stuff, at least as far as Western sensibilities are concerned. If you're not willing to open your mind to understanding Japanese culture (beyond the stereotypes) you might find the readings painful. As it was, this was my favorite course.",
    "Great class and in terms of assignments, not too difficult (2 eight to ten page papers). However, what this class lacks in tangible assignments, it makes up for in discussion. Most of the class revolves around discussion, so be sure to come ready with ideas. Modern Japanese literature is very surreal in a lot of ways. Some of it I liked, some of it I didn't, but I really enjoyed the conversations that resulted from all of them. Professor Treat a very cool and knowledgable guy that told a lot of funky stories from Japan, and Ellen Tilton was a great TA. If you have any interest in modern Japan (you'll learn tons) and\/or off-kilter literature, I recommend it.",
    "It's true when they say that you read some pretty scandalous and over-the-top stuff in this class. While some of the material discussed in class makes some people squeamish, my classmates made the discussions really enjoyable. (I wasn't affected all that much by the material as I knew kinda what to expect.) It really depends on the classmates. Despite that, Prof. Treat knows what he's talking about and has quite the experiences to share about the works and authors themselves. You really get a TRUE sense of how Japan was in the post-war period. Any illusions about Japan and its people\/culture are dispelled because the works (although fiction) really give insight about how Japan emerged and then receded into the nation it is now. Pretty dark and disturbing stuff, but really great class to attend - even if it's just on a whim to take the class.",
    "A great introduction to Japanese Literature and its advancement from the early 70s through today. Much of the literature is very challenging, including sexual and violent themes that may be hard to stomach. Shopper Beware."
