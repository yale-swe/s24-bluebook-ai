   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student interest in French literature, especially if you are interested in close reading\/analysis. Professor Connolly is amazing, definitely take advantage of office hours when you're writing papers!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It was such a small seminar, which allowed us to really know each other and have very comfortable and open conversations. There was a pretty big variety of comfort levels with speaking French, and Professor Connolly did an amazing job of making sure the less fluent students weren't lost while never dumbing down conversations. I never felt judged for being less articulate in French than many students in the room were.",
    "Great introduction to Modern French Poetry. A lot of readings, but (almost) all of them fascinating and enriching.Class discussion will depend a lot on the instructor and the fellow students (and their level of competency with respect to discussing poetry in French). Prof. Connolly was great; I can only recommend taking a class with him.",
    "I'd recommend it. It's a class for everyone, from fluent speakers to people who are much less confident in their skills. Professor Connolly is extremely helpful both inside and outside of class.",
    "This is a really fun course! Interesting, beautiful material, well-organized and well-taught, and your French will improve by leaps and bounds (class discussion is fast-paced and the vocabulary in the readings can be challenging). If you're considering this as a fifth course, be aware that it can be a lot of work--we read not just the literature itself, but a number of lengthy and difficult theoretical texts. That said, the writing assignments are approachable and a lot of fun, and Prof. Connolly gives lots of detailed, wonderfully helpful feedback. Would recommend--if the material interests you, take it!",
    "Good overview of French poetry."
