    "One concrete skill I gained was the ability to write pithy, impactful positions using the policy memo assignments. Overall, I gained a good historical overview of climate policy in the United States.",
    "I learned a lot of necessary perspectives of climate change policy, science, framework, and energy policy",
    "This course gave me a comprehensive basic knowledge about a variety of different climate policy topics.",
    "I got a good overview of the landscape that surrounds climate change, from policy development to energy sources to mitigation mechanisms.",
    "Detailed history of climate change policy as well as current challenges and possible solutions.",
    "Memo writing was a great exercise for future policymakers. I also learned to greater appreciate the role of finance and technology\/innovation in policymaking.",
    "A thorough foundation in environmental policy, especially around climate and energy.",
    "The course gave us an in-depth knowledge on climate change on both national as well as international levels. It touched on economics, policy, and finance and a number of other intersectional themes, which are all relevant for my interests in climate policy.",
    "Very high-level summary of climate policy and topics.",
    "Policy framework, memo writing, climate science and consumer behavior.",
    "Gained practice writing \"policy memos\" (short briefs on a specific topic. This felt like a useful skill and made for great assignments.",
    "What I appreciated most about this course was Dan's insight into the politics of climate change -- what it takes to push policies through, why some policies succeed in one place but fail in another, and what are the political trade offs that governments must make. I thought the course was a nice blend of theory and practical application, and I really valued the deep dive into energy.",
    "This class was great.",
    "A better understanding of all aspects of global climate change issues and how can other countries take the responsibilities after the United States pulled out of the Paris Agreement.",
    "I got a very comprehensive understanding of climate change policy internationally and domestically, and its future directions and challenges. I also understand much more about energy systems and renewable energy potential and challenges.",
    "the current landscape of climate policy in the US and around the world",
    "Foundational knowledge of climate policies from the domestic to the global level, current issues in climate and their relation to geopolitics, and intersections between political and business interests as regards climate change policy.",
    "I learned a lot in this course about climate and energy policy in the U.S. and internationally.",
    "I learned about climate change policy, energy policy, and policy analysis."

    "Personal insights from Professor Esty were very valuable given his extensive experience working in the field.",
    "Better than expected - I learned so much in this course.",
    "It aligned perfectly; it was a survey course which exposed me to a range of topics related to climate change.",
    "Not very well.",
    "Exceeded my expectations.",
    "I expected the course to be extremely mitigation focused, which it was. But I hoped that we might spend more than a class discussing adaptation and loss and damage, given the increasing importance of these issues.",
    "It aligned very well.",
    "I believe the most important skill I have gained from this class is how to write strong policy memos. I have also gained insights about how developing countries should take the lead in dealing with global climate change issues.",
    "No. Very US centric material.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think, similar to traditional climate policy conversations, there was much more attention paid to greenhouse gas mitigation and not very much to adaptation. I think that's a critical gap, and that students need to be learning about adaptation policies in parity with mitigation ones. Additionally, it would be helpful to cover policy mechanisms that are not market based. There is, of course, a reason to learn market-based mechanisms when it comes to climate policy, but I think it's a big omission to not mention how a non-market-based mechanism would operate.",
    "It would be better if we can receive some presentation material to digest lecture of Prof. Dan Esty",
    "The course itself was great. It would be beneficial, however, if more instruction was given on the class writing assignments and if the grading was done faster so that improvements can be for the next assignment. The option was given to do an extra policy memo to drop the lowest grade, but it was difficult to make that decision when grades had not been returned.",
    "Strengths: Good breadth of topics for a survey type course. Readings were varied and provided good insight. Weaknesses: Energy and mitigation were given much more weight\/emphasis than other subjects such as adaptation, forestry, land use, agriculture, equity, etc.",
    "Strengths are Dan's depth of knowledge and insight on the topic. Weaknesses are the lack of student engagement.",
    "Feedback on memos could be done on a more timely basis to allow ample time to incorporate criticisms into subsequent memo assignments. Appreciate Professor Esty's encouragement of class participation\/Socratic method but more difficult to do with such a large class of 50+ students.",
    "Strengths: depth of knowledge presented, clarity of information presented, very engaging class sessions, interesting assignments Weaknesses: my main criticism is the amount of energy policy presented in this course. I would have preferred more time spent on international policy, and a little less on energy.",
    "Strength: Professor Esty's lectures were very engaging. Weakness: slow response\/feedback on policy memos from TA team.",
    "The course is too broad to provide anything meaningful to students. All of these topics seem to be covered in other courses, and the course even begins to repeat information over the semester. Taking a deeper dive into any handful of topics would be much better. The policy memos treated topics too large to be realistic or useful. The class size is too big to facilitate discussion, and the lectures were didactic.",
    "Professor Esty is a great orator. Materials covered in the lectures were highly illuminating.",
    "Strengths: The reading list was expertly curated. I learned a great deal from the readings alone! Dan Esty is very knowledgeable. Weaknesses: There was often little discussion of the readings in class. I would have liked to see more integration of the readings with class discussion. I think many people skipped the readings as a result.",
    "Strengthens include Dan's insight and experience, very engaging lectures, policy memo assignments (difficult, but extremely useful skill to develop), and the readings, which complemented in-class discussions. Weaknesses: The readings on adaptation, in particular, are quite outdated. Most of the adaptation community is advocating for a move away from framing the conversation as mitigation OR adaptation, but rather mitigation AND adaptation given that impacts are already happening and that some may be unavoidable. I also would have appreciated a broader international focus, and I think that the developed\/developing country isn't useful. China's circumstances, for example, are vastly different from Uganda's. It would've been really interesting to have a lecture focused on LDCs and SIDS as well as a bit more nuance in how we categorize development around the world.",
    "It was occasionally hard to follow Dan because he doesn't use slides. Actually, that made it very hard for me. It would be great if he could use any sort of visual representation to highlight the most important take aways.",
    "I think the readings of this class are very interesting and very helpful for me to understand the course materials. I hope the lecture can be more interactive between Professor Esty and students.",
    "Daniel Esty is an amazing lecturer and the class and content is very engaging and interesting. The weaknesses are a sense of a lack of guidance with assignments, and Dan seems very unavailable.",
    "strengths - practical, big picture, useful assignments. weaknesses - I wish we went a bit more into the nitty gritty of climate policies in a more systematic way",
    "The content is always interesting and the policy memos really force you to think critically about policy issues. That being said, lectures often got repetitive and the class sometimes felt like Esty's cult of personality. Don't get me wrong, he's a nice guy but sometimes half a lecture would be rehashing the exact same points from the previous week.",
    "I felt that the course would have been more rewarding in a seminar format (smaller class size, with more emphasis on discussion). However, in its current format I learned a lot from Prof. Esty's lectures. I also thought that the policy memo assignments were a good exercise and helped me learn more about the course content. However, I felt that the assigned reading loads per class were unreasonably high, and I doubt that any of the students were doing all of the assigned reading.",
    "A strength of the course are the very detailed lectures. I learned a lot of valuable information from them. A weakness of the course is that the professor did not grade the policy memos. I would have liked him to grade them since he knows first-hand how a policymaker thinks."

    "Great intro class to climate policy from many different perspectives. Highly recommend taking advantage of Professor Esty's office hours.",
    "Be prepared to spend a lot of time on readings.",
    "Anyone interested in climate policy should take this course. It is helpful in providing a macro-level perspective on the intersectional themes related to climate policy.",
    "Identify the topics within the syllabus that interest you and see whether there might be another course that covers that topic more comprehensively.",
    "This is a must take for folks interested in working in clean energy.",
    "Do the readings. They are so rich and really help in doing the final exam.",
    "Interesting class, and Dan is a great professor. But the course is also very focused on mitigation, energy policy, and the United States -- this can be assets or weaknesses depending on students' interests.",
    "Can't think of anything.",
    "The readings for this class are very interesting. Make sure to finish the required readings before going to lecture can help you to learn more stuff from Professor Esty.",
    "This is a great class with reasonable workload, you will learn a lot about different perspectives around climate change, highly recommend.",
    "worth the time and effort.",
    "I didn't do all the readings, and it was unclear to me whether doing the readings was necessary for success in the course. That being said, the standard for the policy memos is quite high, even though it's the TA's who are grading them; unless you have a really strong policy analysis background (which I didn't), don't expect to just write these as another essay and call it a night. Your memos need to be airtight.",
    "I would advise students interested in climate policy to take this class.",
    "Pay attention and take detailed notes during the lectures!"
