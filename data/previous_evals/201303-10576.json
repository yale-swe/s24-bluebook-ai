    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It has been one of he best classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Marcus is so fascinating and the reading is almost entirely primary sources allowing you to really engage with the history. You definitely have to actively pay attention and take notes in evey lecture, but Professor Marcus is a very fair grader and so interesting to talk to. The paper was a very reasonable assignment, and one I got so much out of. I highly highly highly recommend this class.",
    "This class is a survey of Jewish history from Biblical to early modern times (1600)",
    "Amazing. A great introduction to Jewish history. I would definitely recommend it. It was intellectually stimulating yet not overly taxing.",
    "If you listen, you learn, and the material is very interesting. Readings are unnecessary for tests but still enriching.Listening can be painful and difficult, because Marcus is a VERY scattered and repetitive lecturer. DO NOT discount past negative reviews of his incoherence as I did. Lectures seem like they will be well organized (and the few papers you read by him are!), but they are VERY DISORGANIZED. You will loop around things several times and touch on the other things on the board, but it is a struggle to follow the train of thought, and he OFTEN goes off on rants or tangents about things that are irrelevant, which makes you want to pay attention less.The professor is unapologetically biased in a kind of funny yet horrible way, so you can never be sure of whether you're getting the field's scholarly opinions or his.This is fascinating material to learn, and it interacts with Muslim\/Christian history as well as some philosophy\/politics, but it was not pleasant to work with this professor. Had I known at the beginning of the semester what it was actually like, I would not have chosen to take it.",
    "It is an adequate summary of Jewish history. It covers a lot of time so be sure to pay attention in lecture",
    "Definitely take this class. You learn a lot and it is not much work.",
    "I would take this if you're interested in the subject matter. The lectures are dry and disorganized, but there is no section and the readings are interesting. Not a bad history, and it fills a lot of requirements for the major. Not too much work, but you won't enjoy the time you spend in class.",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. I loved the course--it's been one of my favorite at Yale. Lectures are clear and interesting, as are the readings assigned. I found it a fascinating overview not only of premodern Jewish history, but a glimpse into early Muslim, Christian, and European history as well. The weakness probably is the infrequency of assessment: it might be nice to have some way of gauging how you're doing in the class besides the two exams and a paper.",
    "It's a good lecture with not a ton of reading and definitely not a lot of work. Two midterms and a paper make it a manageable course, and I took it Cr\/D as a science major with zero background in the course material (although the course is popular among people that might have a little bit of background knowledge). The class is an awesome introduction to historical analysis -- looking at a variety of texts (many of questionable validity) and other documents and objects to tell a story. I really liked the class a lot.",
    "If you need a fifth class that is a pleasure to attend and not much work, take it. I would most certainly recommend it. Also good intro to how history as a study works, since you look at conflicting texts\/narratives\/accounts",
    "A great survey course to learn about Jewish history!",
    "If you are at all interested in the subject, this is a great class that requires no prior knowledge. It is holistic in that, as a survey class, it discusses the Jews from biblical to early modern times. I found this class very informative and genuinely interesting. Definitely shop if you're at all interested!",
    "I would suggest this course as an interesting lecture for anybody interested in Jewish history, whether ornot they have any previous experience with the area."
