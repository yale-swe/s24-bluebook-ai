    "Take this course!! Interesting books, enthusiastic professor, lots of opportunity for discussion, totally reasonable workload. I shopped this course not expecting to take it--I just wanted to see how much French I remembered (this was my first Yale French class)--and had so much fun in the first two classes that I just had to.",
    "French lit is a great class to take if you placed into L5. I would definitely recommend it only to students who have a decent background in French, as the works that we read were pretty difficult in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and length of assignment. Expect to spend somewhere between an hour and a half and two hours completing each reading assignment. It's not too much work (three essays, three in class presentations, and an oral final), but because the class is so small, you really can't afford to not prepare for class every day, since you can't hide in the back! If you've been taking French for a while, definitely consider 170, but if you're a relatively new speaker, maybe hold off for another semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend FREN 170 for any student seeking an overview of French literature. The books are chosen with many common themes and the classes are well planned.",
    "I really enjoyed this class; the books were interesting (for the most part), and Pinzka made the class dynamic wonderful.",
    "Definitely take it if you like French. The work isn't horrible and I really enjoyed it."
