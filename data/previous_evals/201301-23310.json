    "Yes, I would recommend it. The class was a little disorganized since Professor Lapadula had some medical emergencies, but I think we all learned the basics of writing a screenplay. Your enjoyment of the class will depend on your classmates, since they will be the ones providing opinions and critiquing your work. This is a big part of the class, since you will be meeting with other classmates before you turn in your midterm folder (which includes script coverages, character profiles, etc.) and then again when you read everyone's rough drafts in class. Hope for a good mix of people!"
