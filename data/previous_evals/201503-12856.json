    "If you are at all curious about insects\/spiders\/scorpions etc. then I highly recommend. The lab acts as a great supplement to the 250 lecture--while the lecture focuses in general about arthropod anatomy, behavior, communication, etc., the lab takes you on a wild tour of the major orders and families of Phylum Arthropoda, 90 of which you will aim to have represented in your own personal arthropod collection! Did you know there is such a thing as a mantidfly? Its head and arms look like that of a tiny praying mantis but it flies around looking like a wasp. Some even have mimicky wasp-looking stripe patterns. Look it up. It's unrelated to actual mantises. It's crazy. It's a crazy thing to look at. I got one for my collection and so can you. Expect multiple weekends (and your entire October break) to go into filed trips in Connecticut and Florida (plane tickets paid for), and a very large chunk of reading period to go into lab work identifying all of your specimens. It's quite fun and everybody comes away with some neat bugs they caught. It's a small lab, so all the students get close which each other and Marta and the TA's. Nick and Meredith were great TA's this semester, and Marta is exactly the mentor you would want if you want to learn the fieldwork. You should do it!",
    "Extremely fun and interesting course. Be prepared for a lot of work and memorization, especially towards the end of the semester. The class is very time-consuming, both at the beginning of the semester, with all the field trips, and afterwards, with the weekly quizzes and the collection preparation. I believe I spent a total of 50 hours on my final project (the collection). Is it worth it, you'll ask? Hell yeah, it is!!"
