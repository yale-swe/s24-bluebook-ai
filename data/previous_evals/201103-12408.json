    "This was a good introduction to the discipline of cultural sociology. I thought it was well-organized and well-taught, providing a range of material that was both very interesting and very informative. Aptly captured how a discipline is developed, with challenges and innovations from unexpected places. Professor Alexander is fiercely in favor of cultural autonomy, but unless you're a staunch materialist, you should enjoy this class just fine.",
    "Take this class!(even if you're not a sociology major!!!)",
    "Shop it to see if you like the subject matter and Alexander's approach -- if you do, this is an exciting class that deals with both the theory and modern research approaches to a really cool segment of sociology.",
    "Every once in a while you'll find a course at Yale that changes the way you see the world. Cultural Sociology is one of those courses. It will make you see that even in modernity (perhaps moreso), symbols, meanings, and myths are powerful forces in shaping the human experience.",
    "I really loved this course. I would definitely recommend it, both to sociology majors and non-majors alike. It's a really good mix of empirical and theoretical concepts, and its one of those classes that you'll keep thinking about once you leave lecture. I think the way it traced the evolution of the discipline of cultural sociology over the past century was really fascinating; getting this kind of historical view of how an academic discipline develops is something I haven't really experienced in any of my other classes. I think that the readings were all pretty interesting, and Professor Alexander is a great lecturer. He's knowledgeable, opinionated, funny and dynamic, and he really made the material come to life. The sections were also among the best I've had in all my time at Yale. The final paper is really cool, because you actually get to do cultural sociology, but be sure you put in the time to make it good.",
    "I'd highly recommend this class. It takes you on a very well-structured tour of the intellectual development of the subdiscipline of cultural sociology--which is a distinct approach to studying social science topics that attends to the power that culture holds distinct just from \"material factors\" like class and economics. You'll thus get to read very fascinating alternative takes on the explanation of everything from how class boundaries are constructed to why Barack Obama beat John McCain in 2008. The readings are fascinating. Dr. Alexander is a colorful figure and a very entertaining lecturer. And given the fact that he is the creator of many of the pathbreaking theories that you study in the class, he is the perfect person to take this kind of course with.I think sociology majors (or anyone who has had some acquantance with Marx\/Weber\/Durkheim\/Parsons before) might have an easier time following along with the beginning of the course, but all the concepts are clearly explained in lecture and by the TAs.",
    "Cultural Sociology was an interesting class, but I think that you would enjoy the class more if you had a background in sociology. If you do not, you might find the class a bit confusing or frustrating at times\u0097at least I did. But you will also learn something, too. Professor Alexander is a good lecturer, and the TAs are helpful and forgiving if you are confused. So, recommended, but with some reservations. (Also, skimming is a useful skill to have for this class.)"
