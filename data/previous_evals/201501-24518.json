    "Kant's Political Philosophy was primarily an investigation of Kant's moral philosophy, with applications of his theory to political and religious theory. The readings included Kant's Second Critique (Practical Reason), the Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, The Metaphysics of Morals, Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, assorted essays, and a few interpretive works by Arendt, Rawls, and Habermas. Kant's work is famously difficult to read, although these writings are certainly easier than his metaphysics. The material is very particular, part of Kant's cohesive thinking about the world, so appeal is contingent on interest in Kant. Nonetheless, as one of the pre-eminent thinkers, perhaps one of the last few philosophers to present a full philosophy of the world, Kant's Political Philosophy ought have broader appeal."
