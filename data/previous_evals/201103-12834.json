    "Chinese 130 is generally very easy, except for oral tests. I am disappointed at not having learned so much new vocabulary, but I do feel that my speaking is a bit more liuli.",
    "Chinese 130 was a great experience for me. It made me realize how advanced and sophisticated and effective the Chinese program is at Yale. I really enjoyed the structure of the class and the way we learned material. Although most of the class is about memorization, the in-class exercises and participation encouraged thought, creativity and a sense of humor. The class is a lot of work, but even by the middle of the term I could see improvement in my Chinese. If you enjoy Chinese, then you this class will be pretty fun for you.Also, as a freshman who had taken four years of Chinese in high school, I was worried that this placement would be too high for me. That was not the case. It was very good placement.",
    "This class is great in that we have a reliable textbook that includes all the material you need to know. However, I may argue that this class doesn't encourage as much speaking as it should or stringing together of sentences on your own. By focusing on taught sentence structures too much, it really does limit your own creativity. I think homework should be more similar to L1\/L2 with sentences in English that we are asked to translate into Chinese. It is also quite difficult in that you are quizzed every other day. So keep up from the very beginning!",
    "Chinese 130 is an intermediate course that lets students learn practical Chinese. I found the textbook really helpful because it focuses on real-life situations. If you are thinking of taking this course, you should take it."
