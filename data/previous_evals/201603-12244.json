   "comments": [
    "I learned so much about ethnography, women's health, and research methods! I also developed the ability to write a strong book review. I have a feeling that I will use Marcia's guide to writing an academic book review many times in the future!",
    "I gained my first exposure to anthropology and ethnography, which has certainly shaped my ideas about how medicine and science fit into people's lives, particularly those who are socially disadvantaged. I learned how to critically review a social science, public health, or anthropological book. I also gained huge insight into women's health issues from discussions in class due to the diversity of the student body present.",
    "I learned how to read and analyze ethnographies for method. I also became much more aware of the kinds of health issues women face, and the struggles of documenting vulnerable populations. This class also asks students to think about policy implications for betting healthcare in the United States.",
    "approaches to reading ethnographies; offering valuable feedback (positive & negative) on research\/studies",
    "I had never written a book review before, so learning how to write that particular sort of essay was a new experience.",
    "Having no prior experience with qualitative methods in social sciences, this course exposed me to ethnography and qualitative interviewing as methodologies with their own set of useful applications. The books in this course investigate sources of structural inequality (on the basis of race, class, gender, health, etc.), and provide insights on how individuals' lives are affected.",
    "This is a great course about intersectionality. More specifically, how race, gender and SES come together to influence women's behavior and health. You read a book a week--they are all super interesting--and hone you're writing skills by writing two short books reviews and one longer comparative review.",
    "This class has really opened my eyes to thinking about specific social issues particular women's health issues (and occasionally general health not specific to women as well) about topics that I had heard of but not paid detailed attention to. It has given me with the necessary vocabulary and critical thinking skills to analyze how theoretical frameworks can be applied to thinking about societal structures and also introduced me to the fundamentals of feminist thought, and Black feminist thought in particular.",
    "Reading ethnographies with a critical eye, an understanding of how the healthcare system affects different groups differently, and gave an opportunity to talk about policy in ways that many other classes do not offer",
    "Learned about women's health in a more nuanced way that ever before. Class is mostly about sociocultural impacts on health, which is such a valuable topic that we really should discuss more often. Exposed to more information about low-income women than ever before.",
    "I learned how to read ethnographic works in a comprehensive way. I learned how to think critically about anthropological and sociological studies, and how to critique the strengths and weaknesses of an author's work. I learned a lot about feminist and sociological theory, which I really appreciated. I learned a lot about how our country's political history has made life difficult for poor women over the years. And I learned how to extrapolate the results of a seemingly narrow anthropological study to a wider policy-based framework.",
    "Reading a book a week is something that I was proud of. Inevitably, this taught me effective notetaking and time management skills. It was really good practice to read a book, think critically about it, and engage in debate with others during class.",
    "I learned so much about different health and social issues facing women across the US. I also learned how to write book reviews, which is an important skill when one is considering academia or research. And Marcia teaches everyone to be a more informed and generous human being!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There are so many strengths of this course: Marcia, the books, the discussion, the classmates, the snacks...I could go on. I learned so much about women's health and enjoyed every minute! I especially liked the reading response format, as it was a great mechanism to get weekly feedback from Marcia and engage critically with each book.",
    "Marcia is an incredible professor, the reading was engaging, and the discussion was rich. I honestly have no complaints, other than that I wish I was able to spend more time with each of the books.",
    "The course is very structured. I think it would be better if there were two sections, each with a smaller number of students. There is very high demand from this class, and many people were declined. I imagine Yale could fill three sections with the amount of people who are interested in these topics.",
    "strengths : reading list; classes led by students; content (women + health) weaknesses : should be a smaller seminar",
    "I do wish that we had talked more about the book reviews in class, and that we had spent a little more time on books which focused on non-urban areas, but I understand that the literature in that area is quite limited so that may not have been possible.",
    "I really cannot find any weaknesses with this course. I think it is fantastic--super interesting and relevant to anyone interested in women's issues, women's health or public health\/medicine.",
    "Honestly I see no weaknesses to this class. Yes, you have to read one book per week but the selection of books are absolutely amazing and I found myself wanting to by some of the books for my own academic interest. The strengths of this class is that it will open your eyes up to underserved communities and their health, and how intersections of race, class, and gender can impact women of color in deeply tragic ways. I talked about this class with my friend who is also in it all the time, and I think it has solidified the direction I want to move in in terms of my future ambitions.",
    "The readings were wonderful and extremely engaging, even if time consuming. I did feel like a few topics weren't covered in the course that I'd like to read about. (I know it will be difficult to fit these in, but something to consider.) Queer women's health was missing (including Trans* narratives) and I also would've been interested to read about the health of Native women. That being said, I appreciated the discussions about race and class that we did have.",
    "I think the reading list is a huge strength, especially starting with theory to help provide a baseline knowledge",
    "Strength - Marcia cultivates an open learning environment and the class is set up so you have a lot of ways to show your knowledge of the subject - leading discussion, 2 papers, short responses, and a final. The other students really want to be there and it's a great environment! Weakness - no queer women's stories, and gay men are only discussed with reference to the AIDS epidemic (v problematic to only talk about LGBTQ people with reference to HIV\/AIDS). And, Marcia is an easy grader but does not provide much feedback on assignments.",
    "I really loved this course. The reading list was phenomenal (give or take one or two books), the assignments were fair and not overwhelming, and the material was extremely engaging. The only thing that I wished had been different is Marcia's presence throughout the seminar. I'm glad that we had student leaders for each class, as I thought that process helped everyone to engage more with the material, but I wish that I could have heard more from Marcia and her extensive knowledge of women's health. She has done so much important work and I really wanted to take advantage of the short amount of time I had with her. I'm not really sure how to integrate that into the course since I think the current set-up works well, but I would have liked that addition.",
    "Strengths: Small seminar Rigorous Weaknesses: Some of the books were not truly \"intersectional\" even though the course was about intersectionality. \"Intersectionality\" has a very specific meaning, drawing from Black feminist scholars like Kimberle Crenshaw and Patricia Hill Collins, but some of our texts did not deal with race-- or really, what's worse, said that they \"were not about race\" without engaging with whiteness, or with the colonial history of ethnography. It felt like we did not adequately talk about this in class because the professor wanted us to be generous with the text. I like generosity as an approach in most regards, but I think that it can't preclude incisive critiques that need to made. The stakes are too high.",
    "I loved that we read full books! The responses were useful exercises for the most part. The one response I think I could have done without writing was the one for the day of the book I presented. After spending so much time reflecting on the book, it seemed a little bit silly to then have to write a reflection in addition but I guess it wasn't that onerous a task, so this is just a small criticism. I loved the class leadership model and the films. I just loved it overall! It might be interesting to consider adding a book on trans women and the health issues they face to update the perspective on gender a bit."

   "comments": [
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! This is an incredible course that is relevant for sociology, anthropology, WGSS, public health, and anyone interested in women's health, ethnography, and intersectionality. You read one book per week, which sounds like a lot, but the books are so enjoyable that I always looked forward to doing the reading. The written work consists of two 2-page single spaced book reviews and one 10-page double spaced comparative book review comparing a book from the course with another from a selected list. In addition, you write a short (2-3 paragraph) reading response each week before class and lead one book discussion with a partner. Marcia gives helpful feedback on all of these and is a kind and extremely knowledgable instructor. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and recommend it HIGHLY to anyone interested in public health, intersectionality, or women's health. It can be difficult to get in if you're not a junior, senior, or grad student, but if you're interested in taking this course in the future I recommend going to the first class anyway to get your name on the list, as it may help you get a spot in future years.",
    "A phenomenal course. Marcia is an awesome professor, super engaging, and talented at choosing books for discussion. This is one of may favorite classes I've taken at Yale. The workload is not bad - Two 2-page, single spaced book reviews, and one 6-page comparative book review in addition to weekly reading responses (very short - like a paragraph and a half). You also have to lead the discussion for one book with a partner. Overall though, don't dismiss the amount of reading - there is a lot, and in order to fully participate in the seminar, you need to do at minimum half of it for each book, which can be hundreds of pages. If you aren't already WGSS, this class will make you want to be (It certainly did for me, and I'm MCDB).",
    "Absolutely. Professor Inhorn is a wonderful seminar leader, and I learned a lot.",
    "yes, the reading list is strong & there is much to learn just from that as well as from your peers in discussion.",
    "This course was a wonderful, thought provoking experience. Everyone who was in the class contributed, and despite the heavy reading load (be prepared to read a lot), the work always felt worthwhile.",
    "This course was really good at letting me read a variety of books on women's health. If you want to read lots of books, take this class. The quality of the conversation depends on who else is in the course. Prof Inhorn is really nice and brings food every class.",
    "This is a fantastic course! The material is incredibly important not just to anthropologists or sociologists, but for anyone hoping to become involved in healthcare or public policy or advocacy for a healthier, more equal society. The texts are mostly quite accessible to non-social science majors.",
    "Yes, this is a wonderful course. There is a lot of reading (1 book per week) but all of the books are very interesting and pretty quick reads. Marcia Inhorn is an incredible professor and person. Highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in anthropology, public health, WGSS, sociology, or medicine. I learned so much about topics I may have never read about and the class is a wonderful environment to have in-depth discussions. I am so happy to have taken this course and I know that I will continue to think about the texts we read for a long time.",
    "If you are ever fortunate enough to take this popular class, take it. Even if the first couple books sound heavy and scary, don't worry, the books vary in length and density. You will get much more out of this class than most of the other classes you will ever take at Yale.",
    "Absolutely one of the better classes I've taken at Yale. This class is a \"feminist book club,\" which means there's a lot of reading. A book a week is no joke. This is not a class to take during a 5 credit semester, but if you're looking for an interesting fourth, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, this was an eye-opening and intellectually stimulating course. One of the most rewarding I've taken at Yale thus far.",
    "Yes, the texts are incredible and I think the student leadership provides a lot to the course and encourages students to talk so that there is rarely a quiet moment, I think the reading responses encourage students to think about the books in important ways before coming to class, I learned a lot from the conversations we had and the texts we read",
    "Yes! This course is amazing b\/c of the other ppl in the course. You learn so much through class discussions and meaningful engagement with other students. Reading these books in a structured environment adds so much benefit, and Marcia knows an immense amount about anthropology and intersectionality theory, which really enhances learning. Only take it if you are willing to read the books (it's a lot!) but if you are it's very worth it!",
    "I really loved this course. The reading list was phenomenal (give or take one or two books), the assignments were fair and not overwhelming, and the material was extremely engaging. It's a book a week, which can be a lot, but definitely worth it. One reading response each week (150-300 words), two book reviews throughout the semester and one final paper. The book reviews are two pages single spaced and are pretty straightforward. Everyone also has to lead one class during the semester, which you do with a partner. This requires you to develop a kind of worksheet with a short overview of the major concepts and questions to prompt the discussion. There's a good deal of feminist and sociological theory discussed in this course, but non-anthopology\/social science\/WGSS majors can definitely keep up if they put in a little extra time. In this course, I learned how to read ethnographic works in a comprehensive way. I learned how to think critically about anthropological and sociological studies, and how to critique the strengths and weaknesses of an author's work. I learned a lot about feminist and sociological theory, which I really appreciated. I learned a lot about how our country's political history has made life difficult for poor women over the years. And I learned how to extrapolate the results of a seemingly narrow anthropological study to a wider policy-based framework. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this course to anyone from any discipline.",
    "We need more classes like this. I would recommend this class with some warnings... stay critical. If you take it, read \"Limitations of a Dirty World\" first by Lawrence Ralph. Personally, this gave me a framework to stay critical of ethnography while allowing myself to read generously at the same time.",
    "DO NOT TURN DOWN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A PART OF THE MOST EPIC FEMINIST BOOK CLUB. Reading a book a week might seem like a hefty task but the content is so interesting and the class attracts a wonderful variety of people that make for great discussions. Marcia is also an incredible professor--so knowledgeable and accomplished, yet very accessible and kind. She does a great job with the syllabus and facilitating the class while letting students take the lead. And she brings snacks to every class. WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR. TAKE IT!"
