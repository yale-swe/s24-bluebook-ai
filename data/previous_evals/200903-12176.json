   "comments": [
    "Extremely interesting readings and discussions. I definitely would recommend it, even for a non-anthropology student. Professor Brotehrton is very helpful and educated. He makes difficult material easy to understand, and basic material engaging. He's a great guy who certainly makes the class what it is.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in or interested in learning about feminist topics. For people who are against feminism this class is not for you. Also keep in mind that there is a lot of reading.",
    "Take it. You should really just take it. At least shop it, then if you don't think you want to take it...take it anyway.",
    "I would recommend this seminar to anthropology majors and non-anthropology majors alike. The topic was very broad (and everyone's term papers were equally broad), but we read about a lot of really interesting topics and had some good discussions. Prof. Brotherton is very nice and likes to keep the class very engaged.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class, especially because Professor Brotherton is so great. The readings are generally really interesting, and our class discussions were always so engaging I didn't want to leave after two hours. If you liked intro to medical anthro, this is a great seminar to follow up on some of the major themes of that class and explore \"the body\" more in depth.",
    "Take this course! Professor Brotherton is great. Interesting readings and discussion."
