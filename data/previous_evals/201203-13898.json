    "It was good.",
    "Great class! The amount information we learn is unbelievable. The final project was one of the most useful projects I have done, to this day. The paper critiques are also extremely useful.",
    "course was great. only complaint is that the critiques were quite a bit of work, but only worth 10% of our grade, which was discouraging.",
    "Strengths:-It was a really good idea to assign critiques. As time went on I found myself reading articles more carefully in this and other classes.-The introduction of ecological principles to look at the factors that make infectious diseases happy is a really great complement to the way that other classes cover these diseases. There is very little on the natural history or effect on the body of these diseases (topics covered in undergrad microbio and immuno classes) which was great. Instead, it really focused on how diseases are carried across species and populations.-The labs were awesome. I am even thinking of taking more spatial stats and remote sensing because of them.Possible improvements:-It focused heavily on examples from diseases that were transmitted by vectors (mosquitoes, ticks, a little bit on worms) but very little on other very prominent diseases that warrant an ecological perspective (the ones that come to mind are the flu, cholera, plague, typhus). To be fair, we lost some days to the hurricane and it would have been hard to give more examples.-Although the focus was not on immunological\/genetic factors, it would have been interesting to review a bit how inter-species relations and evolutionary pressures affect the possibility of antigenic shift vs. recombination vs genetic drift vs founder effects, etc.-The midterm tested straight memorization of equations, which was ok, but it would have been helpful to have one or two problem sets before it to really learn about what the equations were. I really didn't expect to have to perform rote memorization of these equations.",
    "-Journal Critiques were helpful in that they caused us to fully digest the literature but they are time consuming and it would be better if there were only one per class-I liked that the readings were primarily journal articles-Group presentation could be substituted for something else-Final project was a lot of work, but a great learning experience-Class concentrated on mosquito diseases and could have spent more time covering other vector-borne or zoonotic diseases-A lot of info was packed in before the midterm, maybe there should be less guest lecturers and more specific units could be saved for after the midterm so we could have spent more time on the midterm material",
    "Fast-paced but very informative.",
    "I understand the need to ensure that we have read the assigned readings, however the critiques were often assigned last minute and the feedback was minimal. The feedback on labs was also slow.The course covers a lot of different material and at times the slides contained too much information. A way to improve the course would to have objectives\/take away messages from the lecture. Also, application with epidemiology would also be useful to understanding how it all",
    "Incredibly interesting, essentially the only opportunity to learn epi specific to infectious diseases; essentially, the content is fascinatingWeaknesses: Having to write \"critiques\" of every article read was monotonous and unproductive, especially when the only comments we received on them were \"great job.\" If you want this to be a more productive exercise, I would assign fewer and put more time in helping students develop their critiquing skills.The labs, while a good idea, were formulaic; simply following directions doesn't teach what's going on with the programs.",
    "Good class, but sometimes I felt lost in the format of the course. We switched abruptly from the ID stuff to the GIS stuff, and I thought that we didn't cover the ID stuff as comprehensively as we should have. However, I guess we got a good overview of the topic, though I don't feel there are that many classes in which I can learn about this stuff more deeply."

    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Intelligent, engaging, leads an excellent course.A little blunt in her feedback in one-on-one meetings over the project, and as this is a challenging assignment, students may want more support and advice.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Good teaching. However, I would have appreciated if we dug into the math a little more."

If you are interested in any of the infectious diseases that affect the very poor or people in other countries, it is good to review ecological principles and how ecological factors affect these diseases (even if you choose to focus on social epi or other aspects of the disease later).",

    "Yes-this is a course that provides an ecological approach to public health and epidemiology and will provide a broad scope in the methods, concepts, and application in infectious diseases.",

    "Yes, I would recommend EMD 572 because it provides a solid overview of the topic. It is great if you want to work at the interface between ecology and health because that is where new research will be conducted."
