    "Yes.",
    "As I have stated in other reviews of the school resources, although we have fantastic fabrication and material resources available, I believe many of the policies used by HAAS library to be counterproductive to effective and timely research. One book per student, for one night is frankly ridiculous and the majority of students rely on other library systems or online sources to conduct research. A library should never be closed during finals, in fact the hours should increase. Libraries should encourage research, thus I hope the policies will one day change.",
    "All the equipment was available to us, yet I wish that the course could be paired with a technical course so that we could express our theoretical understanding of post-humanism through equally complex and live forms of mapping.",
    "Resources were all available. Seminar equipment in the classroom (projector, mouse, etc.) needs to be better maintained on the 7th floor seminar room.",
    "Ariane is to be commended for her ability to consistently foster lively, enthusiastic class discussions. This probably extends from her willingness to let the topic of conversation drift somewhat, which was a productive technique for exploring a challenging, emergent subject like post-humanism. At the same time,though, the breadth of topics did occasionally seem entirely unchecked, and so the only advice I can give for future improvement is to bring the same level of enthusiasm with slightly more restraint when the subject gets too far off track."
