    "I would say it is a seminar on Buddhist monasticism which introduces you to a few interesting readings on this subject, which illustrate various ways of working on questions related to Buddhist monastic life. And, most importantly, it teaches you to consistently work on developing your own argument for your paper. I would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "This class was extraordinary, and the readings and discussions were always very insightful. I would strongly recommend it.",
    "Summary: Monastic Life in Asia is a trial by fire research course where you will be reading some important texts regarding monasticism while maintaining your own research project.Recommendation: Definitely. If you can figure out how to thrive in this course then you will be able to do research projects of your own later in your career. This course helps define a particular style of research and allows you to see how you can modify it to fit your instincts and needs as a scholar.",
    "I would recommend it strongly because I found the course readings personally enjoyable and also illustrative of strong methodology for studying the topic of Buddhist monasticism."

   "comments": [
    "It opened up a great deal about monasticism in Buddhism that I was previously unaware of. The course also allowed me to see how mainstream Buddhist thought, both by practitioners and Buddhologists, might be limiting and reinforces my belief that they need to be challenged in a reasonable, even-keeled way.",
    "This course was most directly in the area of my main interest, which is Theravada Buddhism. This may have been another reason why I think that the paper was better this time (though I haven't seen the paper feedback yet, I expect that I did better than before), since it was easier and came more naturally to relate the topic of my research to the main course materials."
