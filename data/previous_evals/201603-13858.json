    "Greg is very cognizant and considerate of our workload. His assignments exist mainly to get our juices flowing about whichever topic we'll be covering in class, and work well to do so.",
    "Some of the assignments seemed very well clued in to the readings we did but they did not always make sense within the context of what was discussed in class. This tended to make some of the assignments feel like busy work rather than real in depth discoveries about the subject matter. We also were asked to do quite a few readings each class and when only five minutes were set aside to discuss, it did little to reinforce the importance of the readings."

    "Glad to have this course on this essential topic. Greg's great value is his wealth of examples he can share - wide ranging experiences that give us a broad spectrum of what to expect when we're in the position of dealing with boards of our own.",
    "I really had a difficult time staying engaged on days when there was little to no discussion and more listening than anything else. This made my attachment to the material weak at best. I appreciated the personal anecdotes but I would have liked to apply some of my own meanings to the learning so I could internalize them more fully."
