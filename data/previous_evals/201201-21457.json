   "comments": [
    "If you're interesting in linguistics and computer science, this is a good course for you. It escalated quite quickly though - it started out very slow but picked up by the third or fourth assignment.",
    "Fun look at an interesting topic. Pretty light workload, but beware, if you're not comfortable with programming, you'll have some difficulty.",
    "This course was one of my favorite courses that I've taken at Yale. We used the functional programming language Haskell to implement various formal notions of meaning in linguistics. This is especially interesting if you're familiar with semantics, since the basic structure of the course is to present a theoretical framework within Semantics, then implement it in Haskell. This makes all of the sometimes-dry theory come to life and actually seem useful for accomplishing something. The structure of the course was great with two instructors - Bob doing an hour of theory and Tim doing an hour of implementation, roughly - and if it is offered again, take it! Syntax isn't really a pre-req - just a knack for formal systems and a very rudimentary knowledge of programming would help.",
    "Yes, it was really interesting and fun. It was very easy in the beginning though and then really hard at the end. Definitely should have programming experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class."
