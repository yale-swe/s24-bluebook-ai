    "Calculus II, involving parametrics, polar equations, volumes, integration techniques, and Taylor polynomials. Thinking conceptually about math.",
    "This course taught exactly what it said it would - integration and series - and it taught it quite effectively.",
    "Integration, sequences and series, taylor series",
    "Integrals, convergence, etc.",
    "I got a good handle on integral calculus.",
    "Following and developing calculus proofs; applying concepts to other disciplines; SERIES",
    "Time management skills. It was tough juggling some of the work because I am a student athlete but it really taught me how to organize myself better.",
    "I improved my math abilities and continued with learning calculus.",
    "I developed problem solving skills as they can be applied to calculus, especially through the application questions we did. I also learned how to sort of teach myself something by myself because of the explorations.",
    "By taking this course, I was able to develop a deeper understanding of the ideas I learned in BC Calculus last year.",
    "I learned calculus a bit more in-depth, although I found learning through intuition to be much harder than just learning the material straight up."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths are structured psets contributing to learning the material well. Weaknesses include a lack of communication between students and professors\/TAs about office hours.",
    "This course covered the content very well, but some of the lectures were rushed to allow for working on examples in small groups in class, leaving the review sessions to actually learn the content.",
    "Weakness: paced too fast",
    "The instruction of the course wasn't great. The instructor spent very little time teaching students how to approach a problem -- most of class time was spent watching him solve a problem with little step-by-step explanation",
    "Office hours could be better.",
    "I thought the course was taught effectively, but that more additional resources could have been offered.",
    "Strengths: the explorations; Profs. Berkowitz and Smith Could be improved: why don't we do diff equations? Why don't we do the applications chapter? We could have such a larger curriculum",
    "The course has some interesting material, however some chapters are not expressed clearly by professors. They are also not the most approachable.",
    "This class was structured fine but the teaching was challenging. I had to do a lot of self teaching in order to understand the material. I think that providing more explicit connections to the explorations would have been helpful.",
    "I think the material covered in the explorations should be covered more in class.",
    "For the weaknesses, I would say that I had no teaching fellow and sometimes I felt that classes were disorganized from time to time despite a good teaching quality.",
    "This course was strong in helping the students understand the concepts taught because the problem sets were very useful in establishing these understandings. However, I had to learn a lot of the material on my own because the class itself wasn't extremely helpful n developing these understandings. The class was also not very engaging and didn't involve a lot of participation from the students.",
    "This course was very fast and did cover a good amount of material. However, learning through intuition was not helpful to me."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is a good course to learn Calculus II in a structured way.",
    "Yes; in fact, I would recommend students with gaps in their AP Calc knowledge go back and take this course just to be sure.",

    "Yes",
    "Yes, it's interesting and well-polished",
    "I would recommend it if they enjoy a more challenging math class.",
    "Yes if you need it as a prereq or for a QR credit. It is a pretty typical math class and the teaching can be a little bit rough at times, though.",
    "Only if they wanted\/needed to take calculus, otherwise I would advise them to take a different QR credit because of the class is challenging and set up in an odd way with the explorations.",
    "I would not, unless they had to take it for their major.",
    "I would recommend this as a prerequisite only.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it as a prerequisite or major requirement. There are other QR credits that are far more interesting."
