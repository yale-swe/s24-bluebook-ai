   "comments": [
    "It's simply a more intensive language class that will require a set amount of daily work including weekends.",
    "Yes- great course and useful language to learn.",
    "Yes, it is a very good language class and you will have to take it anyways",
    "CHNS 122 is the second semester of first year Chinese for heritage learners. CHNS 122 is very similar in structure to 112; the only slight difference is that there is a greater focus on vocabulary and phrases at the end. If you've taken CHNS 112, I would certainly continue with this course.",
    "If you're looking at this course, you probably already took 112 and already know what to expect. 122 is faster paced in some respects (quantity of characters, length of tutorial passages), but you also spend more time on each lesson. The teachers were both good.",
    "It's not tough to get an A persay, but be prepared for the work. The daily quizzes and lots of character memorization started to take its toll on me. But if you want to learn chinese, this is a good class.",
    "I love this class; the teachers are both great and helpful and the work isn't that bad. It's basically a daily quiz everyday with character memorization and character translations. The class teaches Chinese at a reasonably fast pace, but it's not too hard to keep up.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student only if they are serious about learning chinese. It is intense and there are daily quizzes that don't seem like much, but take up a lot of study time each night. The homework, although it may not seem like much, takes up a lot of time as well. You get used to the workload too.However, you do learn a lot and you'll be surprised by how much you know by the end of it.",
    "It's required for those who took 112 in the fall, but it's a good course and worth taking, especially since one's already invested in the course.",
    "Yes. It's a very comprehensive and manageable course. You definitely will see a huge improvement in your Chinese by the end of it.",
    "Chinese 122 is the continuation of L1. Its much more focused on the vocabulary book than last semester. We also have to write \"essays\" in class, but they really are not that bad and only cover the material we learn in class.If you've already taken L1 take L2. The format of the class is essentially the same.",
    "Sometimes boring. You kind of get tired of it since it's everyday, but that's what you have to do to learn a language.",
    "Decent amount of homework each day, focus on participation and learning new material every day. Would recommend to a student interested in Chinese.",
    "I would certainly recommend this to any student wishing to improve their Chinese.",
    "CHNS 122 is structured similarly with CHNS 112, and I think this continuation of structure was a very good idea. The teaching of Chinese to native speakers must be difficult, but the instructors handled it wonderfully. The strengths include well thought-out lesson plans, interesting phrases learned, manageable pace of learning, and organized structure. Weaknesses may be due to the fact that the instructors rotate each week, I would've rather had instructors rotate every two weeks, or maybe even monthly, to have more stability in the teaching style and allow students a chance to get to know the instructors. Overall, I highly enjoyed the course, and think my spoken Chinese has improved tremendously.",
    "Chinese 112 and 122 were really great. For a student like me, who went to Chinese school but didn't learn anything, my writing and reading skills needed work. I ended up enjoying the course much more than I originally thought I would, and I am going to China this summer to study more Chinese. The workload seems like a lot at first, but is completely manageable. I got into a rhythm and if you study with other people for the worksheets and oral tests, that would be to your benefit. I would definitely encourage other heritage speakers to take this course if you feel like you should or are just plain interested.",
    "The Chinese L1 and L2 Heritage track classes come as a bundle of 2, meaning that the classes are both taught by Professor Liang and Liu at the same time. The class structure was almost identical to how it is taught in L1 for heritage, so I will assume that you already know how it works.As far as the material goes, it is ramped up but not too significantly. I had to spend some time reviewing material after winter break as I had already forgotten a surprising amount from 1 month of non-use. I did find that my daily quiz scores were lower even though I was putting in the same amount of work. The characters and phrases are a little more beyond what you probably already use at home, leading to the slight difficulty increase. That being said, the overall difficulty of the course is still very comfortable, and it accomplishes its goal of teaching the Chinese language in an efficient but fun setting. The workload is not that difficult or heavy, and it is nice to have regular assignments to balance the weekly or biweekly based work of other classes.I strongly believe that Yale's Chinese department is among its strongest foreign language programs. I would highly recommend the L1 and L2 Heritage track for anyone who has a decent Chinese background. If you've already taken L1 for heritage, the L2 class should be a no-brainer decision.",
    "lots of work, but very well taught for the heritage speaker.",
    "Chinese 122 is just like the first semester. You will go through fewer chapters this semester, but the chapters will be harder. I think the workload for both L1\/L2 Chinese (heritage) was very manageable (maybe an hour or two a night)",
    "A great way for people who have had some exposure to Chinese to really get a strong foundation in grammar and written chinese.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to those who are native speakers who do not yet have a grasp of writing and reading Chinese.",
    "Summary: Take chinese. It's important (supposedly), and not as hard as everyone complains it to be (bad grammar here).*Like actually- stop complaining! Be a tiger child! It's fun and rewarding.**Like double actually- taking chinese made me realize and appreciate why the Chinese people are so hardworking and meticulous--it's cuz asian children have to be in order to learn their language!!",
    "Chinese is a valuable language to learn and the Yale program is one of the best. The amount ofmaterial learned is amazing.",
    "Second half of the first year of Chinese. Definitely take it. Learned a lot.",
    "Exactly what you would expect after taking CHNS 112. The second half has trickier grammar and more new words, but it\u0092s not hard once you\u0092ve taken the first half and have gotten into the habit of memorizing every day and continually doing drills. It\u0092s time consuming but rewarding since you will have enough vocabulary at the end to read and write substantial passages."
