   "comments": [
    "A very important part of American and global history, I was also able to improve my analytical and writing skills",
    "I developed an in-depth knowledge of the origins of slavery and racism in the Atlantic World.",
    "This class was a really good survey lecture in terms of atlantic slavery. It was great to see how we spent time looking at Latin America and the Caribbean and spent just as much time comparing the growth of slave societies there than in North America. The outside discussion responses and our essays were focused on analyzing primary sources.",
    "I learned a lot about the topic at hand, and I also developed my skills of historical analysis specifically primary source analysis as well as critical reading of secondary sources.",
    "I learned about the construction and deconstruction of the slave regime from a political, economic and social standpoint. We learned about prominent figures in the process of emancipation and the slow process by which emancipation was even possible. This class is a gateway into having a more keen understanding of the American context.",
    "Much better understanding of the history of Atlantic slavery. This was not limited to the US, but truly the whole Atlantic. Super important subject material, I think everyone should take a course like this at some point.",
    "Of all the Yale history courses I have taken (and it is many!) this was probably the most important. If you want to understand this country, you have to understand slavery. I learned to work through guilt, engage in conversations in which I had no lived experience, and how such an insidious system takes root.",
    "not much.",
    "I learned an extensive of the origins of Atlantic Slavery, its history, and how it has set the foundation for current race relations of the world.",
    "This course is a very in-depth overview of slavery and its repercussions.",
    "As a first-year, it was a good introduction into how to manage college readings and essay writing! I also learned a lot about the history of slavery that has since definitely affected my worldview, and connected a lot of pieces in a puzzle that I didn't even know I was missing.",
    "I learned a lot about transatlantic slavery which is usually left out of the narrative. I thought I knew a lot more than I did about the systems and arc of legal slavery but this class illuminated so much I did not know",
    "Content-wise, this survey course provided an introduction to the global history of slavery from the 15th to 19th centuries, with particular attention to the history of slave resistance. Skillwise, this course is a typical history lecture essays provide opportunities to practice directly analyzing primary sources, readings (secondary and primary) supplement lecture, and exams mostly test memorization and overall course themes.",
    "I learnt a lot about American history that I didn't really know about especially with regard to slavery. I also learnt how to write shorter and more concise papers which is something I struggled with.",
    "Broad overview of slavery across the atlantic world, from the origins of slavery to abolition.",
    "We learnt in depth about the emergence of transatlantic slavery.",
    "I learned how to more effectively define a historical term, using context and analysis. My knowledge of the subject matter immensely improved. I feel like I can talk about it with confidence and create connections to other areas of history.",
    "My listening and note taking skills improved tremendously since almost all of the information from the class was communicated through verbal lecturing. My close reading and analysis skills have improved due to the readings of the course which were primarily primary sources that we had to write papers on. This course was also extremely informative and I have gained a plethora of new information.",
    "understanding of how slavery is not just limited to the U.S. but rather is global and transatlantic, how slavery evolved in different parts of the world, slavery and the law, emergence of blacks cultures, slave rebellions and revolutions, abolitionist movements; also improved on my primary source analysis and critical reading skills; how to incorporate both primary and secondary sources into papers"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Not much to improve, was highly engaged all the way through",
    "It's very interesting and very informative. however, I think more guidance could be offered regarding what they are looking for in terms of papers and reading responses.",
    "I think there was a lot of miscommunication in the class, which I think comes from the recent syllabus change. The midterm structure was pretty unrelated to what was said in class, and the instructions on the essays weren't very clear until you went to office hours (which I recommend strongly if you have the time too!) Ask for office hours as early as possible because the times are very limited for both the TF and Rugemer which is really frustrating because their feedback was very helpful. I also think that the structure of the essays felt unhelpful in understanding the material more. Honestly, I think it would've been much more helpful to have one-two larger papers than three awkward assignments, since the paper's limited you to only one set of readings, and it feels more productive to draw connections across different readings and perspectives. Rugemer's lectures were interesting but tended to speed through material very fast, and not give enough time to answer questions. The class isn't outright bad, I just think some aspects of it are still disorganized and could be better changed to help students learn more, rather than give assignments for the sake of it.",
    "Lecture was great, and the readings tied in very well. This course was a lot of work, and I think the midterm could have either been removed or it could have been a bit more straightforward.",
    "Great class, great readings, great information. Rugemer talks a mile a minute and prefers you to hand take notes, so you can see where the hiccup lies. There's little time to process what you're trying to write which can make It harder to take in the large amount of information you'll be receiving. If you worry about grades a lot, Credit\/D might be an option because sometimes, even when you know a lot in this class and study, the professor and TFs' mode of grading will not reflect that.",
    "Organized, not an insane amount of reading. We didn't really have time to analyze\/emotionally process what we were learning much, but part of that was due to how much material we were covering.",
    "Strengths: I thought the workload was very manageable and well-spaced. The lectures were really engaging and the hand-outs helped a whole lot! I thought the professor was very fair in how he distributed exc and other expectations. Weaknesses: there were a ton of terms to memorize, it might have been nice to get the midterm ones a little sooner.",
    "there needs to be more personalization to the material",
    "The course material was interesting and comprehensive. It could be improved if Professor Rugemer was better organized.",
    "The strength of this course was how in-depth it was. However, I would see that the lecture could be a bit more clear and the Professor could better explain the midterm and final exams.",
    "The TAs for this class were amazing, and the professor also gave \"key terms\" at the beginning of each class to focus on in the lecture, which helped focus my note-taking and prioritize\/organize information (and helped me study!). One thing that could be improved is that the slides used for class were all pictures, but if they could incorporate bullet points or include the key terms or focal points of a certain event\/story that would be helpful because the lecture does move pretty fast (400+ years of history in one semester!).",
    "Strengths of this class include very relevant and important subject matter, strong TFs, mostly interesting readings (I loved Smallwoods Saltwater Slavery), a reasonable workload, and fair exams (Rugemer gives all terms in advance for studying). One major weakness was the readings and lectures often did not correspond and having reading responses due Monday morning (before the weeks lectures) for Thursday sections proved confusing for context. Other than that, this course was a reasonably good, fair course but definitely not my favorite history lecture Ive taken.",
    "3 papers and 2 exams for the history class didn't quite fit the class. The final should be removed and maybe make the last paper longer. Besides that, I looked forward to every lecture as Professor Rugemer has a quite interesting way of relaying information that kept me engaged all through the class. However, he did move fast and didn't provide notes. This was even more distressing when he designed part of the midterm to be based on what he said almost verbatim.",
    "Its a good introductory history course, but it didnt go far beyond what I learned in APUSH. One strength is that it goes beyond the US.",
    "Strengths: very organized lecture Weakness: atrociously hard grading (subjective and unwarranted- had to give the exact details they were looking even if you showed a solid understanding of the topic in a different way)",
    "The course is taught without the stress of a timeline and it often creates confusion in the lectures. The expectations of the tests were also not clearly established at the beginning of the term, resulting in many students receiving low grades on the midterm. The format of the lectures were very all over the place, often not revolving around a theme or specific period, but more a compilation of facts.",
    "The lectures were very interesting and clear; however, the professor spoke very fast which made it easy to miss important information. Sections were instrumental to my understanding; i had a really great TA.",
    "strengths: lectures are very well-organized, readings complement lectures (good mix of primary and secondary); discussion sections were helpful in clarifying lecture and going over the readings weaknesses: a lot of assignments (3 papers, midterm, and final); midterm was not like other history tests so have to study differently for it (maybe should give practice questions for the fill in the blank or matching so students know what to expect)"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it was highly interesting and engaging and a very important part of history which goes a long way to explaining some of the problems which we face today.",
    "I would recommend this course because it teaches a lot of important history that often goes overlooked.",
    "Yeah if you need it for the AFAM major or want a preindustrial credit for history. The lectures weren't bad and you learn a lot about a really important topic. Just make sure you communicate instructions and feedback with your TF as much as possible to help with some of the miscommunication you'll experience and know that the class isn't a gut at all and requires active engagement.",
    "Yes That student would have to be prepared to work, attend lecture, and engage with the course material.",
    "Yes, it's a class that gives clear insight into the sociopolitical climate of current America. To me it's essential to have basic knowledge of these histories because there's no excuse to be out here acting oblivious and clueless in this day and age. Just... educate yourself, ok?",
    "Yes. I think this history is super important to know.",
    "No.",
    "If you want to live in this country and truly understand it, you must understand the foundation of our country: slavery. This class dispells many myths. It breaks down the happy School House Rock image of pilgrims coming to America for religious freedom (spoiler: it was mostly plantation owners looking for money) and the origins of slavery (spoiler: basically since the beginning of time, people have tried to own other people). Yes, it is difficult material to grapple with emotionally, but either we face terrible truths or we live cowardly lives and perpetuate injustice. Up to you! :)",
    "if you have to take it, then yes. otherwise no.",
    "Eh. Only if you are really interested in the history of slavery. It was more work than any of my other courses, and not a well-organized class. Rugemer was all over the place, and his TA's were often in the same boat as the students in regards to the following plan for the class. Readings were often not uploaded in time to read, and lectures were often not clear.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who really wants to understand the institution of slavery better. Keep in mind it is a bit difficult.",
    "Yes, I would. The information was throughly interesting and very important, though it was difficult at first for me because I had very little background knowledge into what was going on at the beginning of the course which focused greatly on the African continent. However, ultimately I was able to understand the course without the background knowledge and make sense of everything, it was just a bit overwhelming at first b\/c it was hard to contextualize things. Once we moved into talking about the Atlantic world, it was easier to contextualize. Still, a lack of background knowledge shouldn't dissuade anyone from taking this course! As a first-year, it was a good introduction into how to manage college readings and essay writing! I also learned a lot about the history of slavery that has since definitely affected my worldview, and connected a lot of pieces in a puzzle that I didn't even know I was missing. The TAs for this class were amazing, and the professor also gave \"key terms\" at the beginning of each class to focus on in the lecture, which helped focus my note-taking and prioritize\/organize information (and helped me study!).",
    "Yes. Great lecture where you learn a lot with a manageable workload and reading",
    "I would recommend this course to a student particularly interested in the subject matter or a history major looking for an interesting and relevant preindustrial credit. The subject matter is incredibly important for understanding contemporary global racism and placing US slavery in a global context. As a class, this course is very fair: reasonable workload, fair exams, good lectures, and strong TFs. A good, if not the best, history lecture.",
    "Yes. The knowledge I gained from this class entirely changed how perceive American history as an international student.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes because the content was so interesting and important but the harsh grading would be a huge deterrent.",
    "I would not. The course was very scattered and felt unorganized. There was no feedback on the major tests and the essays required had nothing to do with the information given during lecture, but with the readings we did. This resulted in confusion surrounding the assessments.",
    "Yes, the content is not only extremely important but its also extremely interesting. All the work we did had a clear purpose and contributed to our greater understanding of the course content. My writing skills, critical thinking skills, and close reading skills improved tremendously.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the history of transatlantic slavery, you should take this class. It provides a full look at slavery through a global lens. Professor Rugemer specializes in this subject so he is very knowledgeable about it and teaches it well. Whether you want to satisfy a requirement or not, you will learn something in this class."
