   "comments": [
    "The interesting material and lack of homework makes this class ideal for someone who wants an in depth introduction to viruses, but may be busy with other coursework or labwork at the same time. Great for first years.",
    "This course is a sampler of different DNA and RNA viruses that teaches you the different means that viruses solve different problems for infecting the host and survival through evading response from the immune system. I would recommend this course to anyone that has not studied viruses before, because this course is very interesting in regards to understanding differences between viruses and different methods that have evolved by viruses to enter, replicate and survive. However, if you have studied viruses before this class would be too slow.",
    "I would tell them that it is a great introduction to viruses, basic topics of virology and virus families. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with an interest in virology or who would like to learn something about viruses.",
    "I would recommend the class to students that are interested in learning more about an specific virus, or to students whose current research is related to viruses.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I learned a ton and it was enjoyable.",
    "A overview of the general characteristics of the major virus families. I would recommend this course to students who are interested in learning about overall virus characteristics.",
    "Yes. You learn about an important field that is central to many other fields.",
    "This course is about the molecular biology of the viruses that were presented. The overview of the all the viruses are taught in this course. I would recommend this course to another student."

    "It has been great for understanding the research of labs that work with viruses. I'm currently a first year doing rotations and it definitely has helped me understand why people use and study viruses.",
    "This course is very helpful for understanding my next laboratory rotation. For my discipline this course is not directly applicable but its important information that may come handy in the future.",
    "I do not think this class will really be applicable to me thesis research as I do not plan to join a virology lab. However, as I said above, I did not know anything about viruses upon entering the class, so this class was a good learning experience for me.",
    "This course contributed to my future research because it helped me realize that there are some cellular mechanisms (I am interested in) that are used as well by viruses in order to complete their life cycle. Therefore, studying viruses could help gain insights into certain mechanism from the host cell, which I consider is quite an interesting approach.",
    "It helped me better understand a rotation project I am currently working on.",
    "I took this more out of interest but it did give me some ideas, particularly during discussions about replication mechanisms.",
    "This course has deepened my knowledge of my discipline by expanding my knowledge of the different viruses and how they can be used in genetic engineering. This has not contributed to my dissertation."
