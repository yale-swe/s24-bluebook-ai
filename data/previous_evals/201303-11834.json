    "Yes. Great class! Taking pictures is your HW.",
    "Meredith is patient, knowledgable, and open to all levels of experience and types of photography. She made the class my favorite one at Yale so far.",
    "This course teaches digital photography without assuming any prior experience on the part of the student (although prior experience definitely helps). You get to do different genres of photography and explore different themes, with the goal of producing photographs that not only look aesthetically well-composed but that also convey meaning through its visual qualities. You also get to learn Lightroom and Photoshop, which are extremely useful tools. Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in photography - my guess is that the techniques and tools I've learned in this class are going to be useful for me well beyond Yale. Meredith is also a great instructor - she really pushes you to explore your though processes behind your photography and come up with new ways to express your ideas through photographs.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. You learn how to really use a digital camera (not just putting it on default modes), and learn how to use Photoshop and Lightroom to edit photos. Not a gut - you really have to spend time photographing, editing, and printing. But very fun!",
    "This is a great course for people who want to get out and start taking digital photos and who need some direction to do so. If you're already taking a lot of photos on your own, I'm not sure how useful this class will be. It is interesting, however, to learn to use Lightroom and Photoshop and to begin to think more critically about photography's potential and its evolution. I did not find the critiques particularly enlightening, but that probably depends on the group of students and the student-professor dynamic.I did not find the workload to be too taxing. It's easy to take 100-150 pictures a week using a digital camera. Printing, however, is another story. Getting perfect prints requires many, many hours at the DMCA. It is also expensive, so watch out!There were a few writing assignments and field trips, which I found was a nice way to vary the class work.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, especially if you haven't taken any other art classes at Yale.",
    "I would but not to a fellow graduate student. It was not challenging enough. Great for technical learning though.",
    "Take this class if you are already comfortable with your camera and want to learn how to edit\/print. This is not a class for complete beginners! You won't have much guidance, but a great way to become a more comfortable photographer. A great credit\/d class.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It's a nice break from the normal work routines, and going out to take pictures is a nice way to relax. Don't be fooled though, it's still a decent amount of work, and you can be expecting to take about 100 to 150 pictures a week. It's great for learning to use a DSL and tools such as Lightroom and Photoshop. This is the kind of class we're you'll get out of it what you put in. Great class overall.",
    "This class is amazing. If you are interested in photography, definitely take it. You will spend some money if you want to buy a camera, lens, paper, etc. but it is totally worth it.",
    "The class will obviously vary depending on who is teaching it, but generally expect the following;during class, to spend time learning computer programs such as photoshop and light room, learning how to print, looking at slide shows of photographs, looking at photographs first hand in places like the Beinecke and the YUAG, occasionally taking photos (expect to do this outside of class), critiquing your classmates photos and having your own photos critiqued.Meredith Miller's major strength as a teacher is familiarity with the world of photography, her artistic eye, and her approachable nature. The following two criticisms are the manifestation of her private and shy personality. Firstly, dhe could do a better job of initiating students on a personal level. Since art is such a personal exercise, she needs to get personal with the students. I do notthink she understood this to be her role as an instructor. Secondly, she could also be more communicate about her expectations. Without pressing, students are not going to prioritize the work she assigns them. She needs to stress the importance of spreading an artistic process over the long period of time that she gives them for each project, rather than expecting students to do this on their own."
