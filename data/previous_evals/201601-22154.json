   "comments": [
    "It is an intesive reading course, but with a huge flexibility and scope to learn about Islam, contemporary anthropology, and also about Western policies and attitudes towards the Middle East, Islam, and Muslim societies. This breadth is very valuable and provides an incredibly enriching learning space.",
    "This is basically a look at the answers scholars have written to the popular narrative that there is a \"crisis\" in Islam. If you study post-colonial theory or are interested in reading what people are saying in response to this narrative, you should take this class. There were some students who didn't always agree with the direction of the conversation, though, and they sometimes had to defend their position to the class, so if you're not totally bought into the readings, be prepared to explain why.",
    "I would recommend RLST 703 to any student of my fellow PhD students in religious studies, regardless of their specific area of interest. Prof. Grewal was able to draw from texts that engaged with theology, anthropology, religious history, etc. and her class touched on themes including gender, race, sexuality, liberalism, and education. I think such a course would be important for any student hoping to teach and research in the field of religious studies, even if Islamic studies is not their particular area of interest.",
    "This class has a LOT of reading, but most of the books are really worth the read. Even if you don't really have an interest in religion or Islam specifically, take this class. It's more of an investigation of all minority politics because our discussions oftentimes can me mapped onto all different types of conflicts and struggles."
