    "If very interested in learning complex fluid dynamics and how it related to Aerodynamics take this. Otherwise this class can be very frustrating and stressful. Could take Credit\/D on a light schedule",
    "Aero is a pretty decent class. It doesn't require too much work (p-sets were roughly 3 hours). The midterm was SO HARD but the final was manageable. Definitely go to office hours because that's the only way it's going to work out for you. It was a really small class this semester (5 people) and one person was a genius and understood everything and kind of made the rest of us look bad. I don't know why, but nothing Juan says sticks in my head, so I had to use other resources to teach myself quite a bit of the material.",
    "Professor de la Mora was one of the nicest engineering professors I've had. He really cared and tried to be as helpful as possible. However, the material is really tough and his lectures can be a little hard to follow. Also, knowing Mathematica going in would be a big advantage on the homeworks. The workload is very reasonable",
    "It was hard. I don't regret taking it, but it was hard. You will develop a strong sense of solidarity with your classmates, so make sure to help each other and learn what you can. Also don't hesitate to ask professor de la Mora for help. And if you're like me and it's been awhile since MATH 120, review that. You'll need it."
