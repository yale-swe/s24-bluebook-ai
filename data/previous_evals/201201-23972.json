   "comments": [
    "Great survey class.",
    "This class was good in theory, but in practice, the material was overly dense without any incentives to encourage actually learning of the material. Students should be tested on the material that we learn in some way.",
    "Yes if you are looking for an easy class, interested in doing very academic work in economics and\/or interested in the material.",
    "It's a good class. I expected for it to be more interactive but presentations were mostly based on models, so there's only so much we could ask\/discuss.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in bounded rationality, but hopefully the class will be restructured in the future.",
    "Sure, it's a good econ seminar.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to get some exposure to behavioral economics. You will also get practice with analyzing economic papers and presenting on them.",
    "Broad overview of certain topics in bounded rationality. Not much work. Interesting topics, but you have to be able to at least vaguely understand the math (or just be content with not understanding what's going on for the most part). The papers are dense, so the assignments themselves are a little difficult, but there seems to be enough freedom to write them with a fairly cursory understanding of the material (though the presentation is more challenging).",
    "Economics 478 offers students a very good survey of topics in the bounded rationality literature from its theoretical inception to modern day contributions to the field. This course allows students to study deeply an aspect of microeconomic theory neglected in introductory and intermediate courses, despite widespread criticism that economics is out of touch with reality because of the assumptions of rationality it makes. While a student enrolled in Bounded Rationality will learn a lot about this field, s\/he will also be exposed to a wide variety of economic models enabling him\/her to better understand the tradeoff between simplicity and detail and how this tradeoff affects the results of a model in terms of tractability and comprehensiveness. Professor Rozen is great; she is a scholar in the field and is very approachable. Additionally, she has insight into how best to structure and teach a course to keep students interested in the material. The workload for the course in low, but enjoyable; it allows the student to more deeply engage with the material emphasized in the course or to explore topics of his own choosing. Overall, I would recommend this class to economics majors who are in need of a seminar or are looking for an additional course to take and who have a greater interest in economic theory than empirical economics as is studied in most of the department\u0092s other seminars."
