    "Having two professors made the different halves of the semester really different and I think it impacted my learning. I think if the professors can settle on one teaching style throughout that would actually be really helpful because I just didn't have a great time adjusting to a new style in the middle of the semester, especially with that style being one that I didn't agree with.",
    "I disliked the switch of the professor in the middle. Jorgenson rushed his lessons at the end of the midterm because he was leaving and Miller had no real idea of what we had already covered. I had developed a nice flow for the class by midterm that I had to completely throw out when the new professor was introduced, and my performance dipped when I had to re-adapt."

    "If you are doing the chem major and you need electives, this is probably one of the more manageable electives to take. Jorgensen and Miller are both pretty good professors and the content is interesting. Not sure I would recommend it to someone who isn't trying to get the chemistry degree, I'm not sure I see there being much of a reason to take this course unless you have to.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I think the content is pretty fundamental and the class is pretty easy so its a good way to get your elective in even if the class isn't particularly well taught."
