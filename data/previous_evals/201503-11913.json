    "A pretty good class. Michael Warner is about as good of a seminar leader as you can ask for. idk, I havent taken many English classes (I was one of the only non-majors) so hard to really compare, but if you like the reading list you cant be too disappointed. Warner is brilliant and maybe a little intimidating at first and the other tryhard English majors are definitely intimidating, but if youre reading this youre probably one of them, so I guess youll fit right in. My only gripe is that Warner brings his scholarly agenda pretty hard to class and opens each meeting with a discussion of the queerness of whomever were talking about which gets old after a while. But the fact is that hes an expert at this stuff and knows so much about the context and all the subsequent criticism so it really is a gift to be able to learn from him. There were just three essays and they were graded pretty reasonably so I can recommend it from a grading standpoint. Id give it an A- if youre an English major youll fit in way better than I did and probably love it tbh.",
    "This course is a good survey of antebellum literature, with plenty of historical context and literary history thrown in. I hadn't read anything on the syllabus before, so it was a great introduction to some of the classics of American literature. Professor Warner is tremendous, and I would recommend taking a class with him to anyone, since he makes the material very accessible. Without a solid English background, this class can definitely prove a little tricky, and I sometimes wish there had been a little more instruction on the papers (although since it's a junior English seminar I guess I can't complain too much). I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to anyone interested in the subject, or to anyone looking to take a class with a singularly intelligent and well-read professor.",
    "This was a great syllabus--we read both solidly canonical works from the period (Melville, Hawthorne, Whitman) and some wild cards (Robert Montgomery Bird's Sheppard Lee). Michael Warner can lead discussion with a strong hand, but the class improved over time as everyone got more comfortable. If you're interested in early 19th century American literature and want the chance to learn from an undeniably brilliant scholar, this is a very worthwhile class.",
    "Some good readings punctuated by great readings. Warner is super knowledgable and approachable.",
    "Antebellum American Literature is a typical English class in that we have three papers (two medium ones, one long one) and send in reading responses each week. We read poetry and prose, and some of the authors included Whitman, Douglass, Hawthorne, Stowe, and Emerson. Some are well-known classics--Uncle Tom's Cabin and The Scarlet Letter, for instance--and others not so much, such as Melville's short stories and Bird's Sheppard Lee. Professor Warner is fun to listen to and is really good at helping the class work through more difficult bits in discussion.",
    "absolutely",
    "OH MY GOD TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!!! Take whatever Warner is teaching you will NOT regret it.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in reading American literature with an eye to themes of environmentalism, feminism, anti-racism, and queerness. This class made literature that I had previously dismissed as not relevant to my interests or experiences seem full of life and complexities. I appreciated reading things I had read but not fully understood in high school. like \"The Scarlet Letter\" and the \"The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass\", in a richer context, as well as discovering things I hadn't read before, like Robert Montgomery's shapeshifting novel, \"Sheppard Lee.\"",
    "It's a really solid and interesting class. There isn't a ton of pressure to talk a lot, but you should still come to class prepared otherwise you won't get anything out of it. The readings are great and Warner is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. 10\/10"
