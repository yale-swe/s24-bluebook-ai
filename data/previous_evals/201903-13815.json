    "This class provided great insight into the philosophy and practice of surrealism as both a historical art movement and an aesthetic-political movement. There was a healthy mix of critical reading of texts and visual works, long form writing skills as well as practical surrealist exercises that challenge rationalist-ideological modes of thought.",
    "The course focused on the key juxtapositions and ideas driving the surrealist movement. The reading of primary and secondary texts was illuminated further by the exercising of certain surrealist experiments.",
    "Learned SO MUCH not only about the artistic facet of surrealism but also the political aspect. Truly an Art History class.",
    "I learned so much about the historic conditions, themes and theories, and strategies of Surrealism. Throughout the course we read the key manifestoes and essays produced in France in the 1930s, relevant theory from Barthes, Benjamin, Krauss, etc., as well as more contemporary takes and texts from Surrealists in Martinique and Egypt. The class definitely helped me think about art history in a novel, more experimental way, and improve my writing and researching skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Firstly, the class content was well organized and featured a somewhat diverse set of surrealist works and thought. I do believe that post-colonial and de-colonial surrealist thinkers should emerge earlier in the course to improve diversity and add new inspiration for deep class discussions that came to fruition later in the course. Secondly, there was a generally higher workload in some weeks than others. I really did appreciate the optionality afforded in the reading responses and practicums. Perhaps a more balanced and consistent workload could help for planning and time management throughout the semester, particularly for students with other reading and writing heavy courses.",
    "Strengths: Professor Fiduccia is a gem. I have never had a professor this eloquent, caring, and knowledgeable. I love her, shes amazing! The way she presents the subject matter is perfection. Weaknesses: Readings can be a bit much.",
    "Strengths: the course meets twice in the YUAG and once in the Beinecke; Professor Fiduccia is super kind and knowledgeable about the subject; nearly half the work in the course is conducting Surrealist experiments of your own, rather than just writing papers. Neutral: there are lots of small assignments, so you will have work every single week but no midterm at all and only one 8-10 page final paper plus an experimental research project. I personally think that this is a strength, but it really depends on how you prefer your classes. Weaknesses: besides the time spent at Yale collections, the course doesn't really spend much time looking at individual art objects: we did a couple of close-looking exercises, which I really enjoyed, but otherwise focused more on the readings. I think that Surrealism could benefit from using art works more frequently as opportunities to apply theory."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "This course will teach you the basics of the Surrealist movement, while providing opportunities and advice to 'live' a surrealist praxis. Surrealism in itself is quite a white, masculinist export, so if you don't mind that, you might like the class. Prof Fiduccia does a good job of incorporating the anti-colonial history of the movement, but if you are looking to really study the revolution, maybe look somewhere else.",
    "The subject matter is very interesting and the work goes beyond just essay writing. In addition, Professor Fiduccia is an amazing teacher who has extensive knowledge on the subject.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for those willing to invest time and mental energy in engaging with surrealist thought and practice on both a historical and ideological level. The opportunities to engage and contribute in discussion and writing are really open-ended and allow for your own lived experiences to guide the conversation and production of practical and written exercises.",
    "Absolutely. I thoroughly enjoyed the course",
    "YES! MUST-TAKE.",
    "Yes, this class did not only help me know more about the subject but also more about myself and the world around me. I thought about the practicums and readings outside of class and couldnt stop talking about the class with my friends. It was by far the best class I took this semester."
