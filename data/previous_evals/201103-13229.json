    "We had several assignments for our systematic review, but we did not get adequate feedback on the assignments. I would have expected more valuable input from Dr. Irwin to improve my work. I almost felt she only skipped over them and then concluded \"excellent work\". I basically wrote a systematic review and put a lot of time and effort into it without adequate individualized feedback from Dr. Irwin.Also, I think she did not sufficiently explain the steps to be take while doing a systematic review. It was majorly based on self-teaching.I tried to ask for an appointment a few times to clarify my questions. She said \"let's talk after the class\". which meant to talk in front of many other students who had questions for 1-2 minutes. Dr. Irwin said she will be available for questions, which she though was not in reality.I liked the topic of the class, but I am disappointed by the overall quality of the class.",
    "Course is good if you know nothing about obesity, less interesting if you know a lot about the topic area. More breadth than depth on the subject.",
    "",
    "I thought it provided a good overview of the obesity epidemic and ways to intervene on it.",
    "Great overview class- workload was not too heavy and class discussions were productive and informativeI really enjoyed the guest lectures on policy and nutrition",
    "Very exciting subject. Great overview of the issue. Good discussion topics. Reading is very relevant and not overwhelming. Great guidance for the final project.Did not see any particular weaknesses.",
    "Course was interesting and engaging though raarely did I feel like we answered the week's question. Not entirely confident that if given unlimited funds and frree reign in a city, that I would know how to combat obesity.",
    "This course provided an excellent overview of the current state of obesity in America. I particularly enjoyed the cost of obesity lecture. I also thought all of the guest lecturers added insightful new perspectives (particularly the surgeon- whose voice we don't get to hear much in public health). They made for interesting discussions.In terms of future improvements, I think it would have been beneficial to discuss a greater number of behavioral theories, particularly with examples of how they pertain to obesity prevention.",
    "I think the strenghts of the class were the lectures and the final paper.",
    "While I thought that this was an interesting class, I don't think it was very worthwhile for those of us who had a background in obesity work. I didn't feel that I learned very much throughout the class, though it was interesting to hear what different people were working on (the guest lectures were nicely varied and very interesting). I thought that the final project was very useful- having never written a systematic review before, it was good experience- I also enjoyed hearing everyone's presentation.",
    "Great course about obesity, loved the guest lecturers, but seemed to quickly skim topics at times. Some of the lectures were great, while others were more geared toward reading towards the slides."

    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0see above",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Good professor, knowledgeable in certain topic areas and fully admits to areas where she is less knowledgeable, which was fine because it allowed other students to share ideas and perspectives making for a well rounded course.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0very approachablegreat teaching style",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0She is very knolwedgeable, had great speakers come it to talk to our class. She was not great at responding to emails from the students.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0strengths- Dr. Irwin is a knowledgable professor on the topic with relevant research experience to help guide class discussionshe is quick to respond to emails and provide feedback on classworkimprovements- could provide more guidance on systematic review (or at least provide helpful resources)",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Very engaging and passionate about the subject. Well thought out plan for each class. Great feedback for projects. Made class enjoyable, would take another class taught by this instructor.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Sometimes the conversation was dominated by the professor, opposed to taking more student feedback. lectures were interesting and well done. Guest speakers were great! Very informative!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0Melinda was a great professor. She provided ample examples from her research, which was interesting to learn about. I appreciated that she asked us not to use computers in class, as it seemed to keep everyone more focused. She also provided helpful feedback for our end-of-term papers, which was a valuable final project. I feel I learned a lot about how to conduct (and evaluate) a systematic literature review thanks to this course.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0I really enjoy during a review paper of the intervetions. However, I would have liked better instructions for the final presentation of the paper.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Liggett Irwin \u00a0I think that Professor Irwin is a good lecturer, and assigns good readings and projects. My one major criticism is that I often felt that she lacked some amount of compassion towards people who are obese. I don't doubt that she cares a lot about helping people lose weight, but I think she struggles to understand what these people face in terms of stigma and day to day life. I know many people at YSPH are really good about exercising and eating right, but some aren't, and I think anyone in the latter group would really be uncomfortable in this class."
