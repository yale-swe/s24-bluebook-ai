    "This is an IR theory course that focuses on the role of non-state actors in the global community. I would definitely recommend it, especially for students who do not wish to take a \"classic\" IR theory course. This class is for people who want to talk about issues, not -isms.",
    "I might if he was an IR student who needed to fulfill the IR Theory requirement and didn't want an excessive workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend INRL 650 to another student. Even if the fellow student is not thinking about working in the NGO\/INGO field, I would strongly advise taking this class. This is because learning about non-state actors will contribute so much insight and provide a new perspective to the way we examine other issues. Whether the focus of one's study is international econ, environment, security, or development, knowing how NSAs function will improve understanding of the aforementioned areas."

   "comments": [
    "I am interested in human rights research and advocacy as well as development, and this course included modules on both topics. Thus I was able to gain a better understanding of how non-state actors operate in and influence these fields.",
    "Well there were some readings that were good, like the one on the autonomy of institutions and the one on Imagined Europe. Those helped contribute to my understanding of institutions and the making of nations respectively.",
    "Had I had not taken this course, my understanding and analysis of the specific issue area I will study will be deficient and incomplete. Because the role of NSAs in certain areas of international politics do not always get the academic\/scholarly spotlight they deserve, I found it useful to learn about their role and influence in specific issues of global governance. The course has contributed to expanding the scope and depth of my analysis in future research."
