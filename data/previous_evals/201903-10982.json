   "comments": [
    "I developed an expansive awareness of how Marxist cultural theory has developed over the last century or so, and was able to get a grasp of several new and extremely useful concepts. I was introduced to several new texts, and had the opportunity to see how potentially disparate projects can be read together as working through a shared set of concerns. I also had the opportunity to write a paper that helped me develop and concretize a core element of my overall research project.",
    "I was able to grasp basic terminology essential to Marxist discourse and engage with some crucial texts.",
    "I gained a solid overview of and facility with major writers in the Western Marxist tradition. I came away from each seminar with a good sense of what is at stake in each text, how they have been read, and how they relate to other key critical texts. I improved my ability to read extensively in difficult critical texts, and to articulate clearly and concisely the arguments and issues at stake.",
    "First and foremost, I learned how to take on quite a lot of reading in a strategic way. That meant planning my reading schedule in advance, thinking through problems and questions before, during and after, and giving myself time between the readings and the seminar to collect my impressions and thoughts. These were not skills I had before Joe's class, and I now feel prepared to take on any graduate seminar. I also learned how to participate in seminar and not fear disagreement or critique by other students or by my instructor. In fact, I learned that this process is an essential part of discussion that occasionally goes missing when participants aren't prepared to be intellectually vulnerable."

   "comments": [
    "With some texts, it might be worth focusing the reading to a greater extent. There was such a wealth of material, the specifics could sometimes get muddied by the volume. Otherwise, I think the syllabus design was near perfect (though I think Stuart Hall could maybe have a week dedicated to him), discussion developed as the semester went on, and the class as a whole seemed to develop some sense of a shared project. Overall, I think it succeeded as well as any course could in its stated goal of familiarizing students with a critical tradition whilst enabling them to deploy resources from that tradition in their own work.",
    "I highly appreciated the diverse scope of the texts and, above all, Professor Cleary's generous and always helpful introduction to each session. The students could clearly see that he was committed and prepared to each session. The amount of reading for each week was appropriate, but some weeks were certainly more challenging than others. How to improve a course like this? It's challenging because some are entirely new to the language\/discourse, while others are much more familiar with it. I believe that Professor Cleary did offer the best format for an introductory seminar like this. I personally wish that more time would have been spent on seminal figures (Marx, Lukacs, Gramsci). And I regret that some notable figures like Negri\/Hardt were missing in the syllabus.",
    "The reading list and discussion questions were very good, and were formulated to generate critical engagement with the material. The discussion was generally energetic, useful and generated good insights, but some voices were heard more than others--this is no different than other Yale seminars, and I'm not entirely sure what could be done to fix it. It would be a shame to cut back on the amount or difficulty of the readings--that's what a grad seminar should be for. The discussion posts were sometimes laborious and time-consuming (though generally useful as exercises and for consolidating the reading) and students often wrote way too much.",
    "Strengths: 1) Extremely thorough and thoughtful syllabus; 2) the course was organized well which made it easier to see the connections between different texts; 3) Professor Cleary provided context and clarification when necessary for difficult\/slippery ideas; 4) Professor Cleary was generous and available to meet with students Weaknesses: 1) reading load was sometimes unmanageable especially for particularly dense texts, though this improved throughout the semester as Professor Cleary made adjustments 2) the solo reading response model (I think group work was best for working out ideas before class, plus I enjoyed interacting with seminar mates I didn't often get to speak to).",
    "Starting with the amount of reading we got in the first couple of weeks was a bit of a trial by fire, but once I adjusted to the class's rhythms I found myself comfortable for the rest of the semester. Some of the methods of encouraging preparation for seminar felt a bit like trial and error (which is certainly necessary with a new class), so I think the course would benefit from more firmly established expectations at the start of the semester (how long should blog posts be, etc.)."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is an opportunity to read some central texts that really deserve having time devoted to them and then learning from classroom discussion. It has almost exactly the right balance between breadth and depth. Professor Cleary is also an excellent person to learn from, encouraging students to think creatively whilst ensuring that texts remain central to their analysis.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to all students in the humanities.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to anyone in literary studies. The course is good for solidifying one's theoretical and intellectual foundations",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone. I feel that I learned more in this class than others this semester.",
    "Certainly."
