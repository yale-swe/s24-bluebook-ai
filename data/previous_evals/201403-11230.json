    "I would recommend it as a way to fulfill a diversity requirement for the APA.",
    "I would greatly recommend this course to a fellow student, as issues of diversity are both relevant in research and treatment. As clinicians, we must not only be well-versed in issues of diversity but be able to use our base of information flexibly to adapt to whatever situation we might be facing with any individual client. Cultural competency is therefore essential for all clinicians and researchers alike to have this basis of understanding."

   "comments": [
    "A few of the guest lectures were highly informative and contributed to my clinical work, as it was intended to do.",
    "As stated above, this course is extremely useful for our training as clinicians in becoming culturally competent and able to not only build substantial rapport with any patient but be able to adapt our cultural conceptions to the data from any one individual we may be coming into contact with in a clinical setting. This concept is equally important to researchers as a lack of diversity in research historically has contributed to a lack of generalizability of many findings assumed to be generalizable to other cultures, such as the lack of replication of the Muller-Lyer illusion in other cultures, for example."
