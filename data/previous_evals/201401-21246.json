    "Frighteningly disorganized and taught at a graduate\/professional level way above our undergrad heads. The instructors didn't bother to put together a full syllabus for their course before the first meeting, making it often a surprise what we'd be discussing. They literally forgot about our midterm paper until aggressively reminded, and were then forced to give comically long extensions. Lots of key readings (in particular Leibniz, Quine, the Brain in a Vat argument) were discussed in seminar without being assigned first, adding to the feeling that we were in for way more than we expected. Seminar meetings felt like two-hour lectures and often ran way over, in part because we students were almost totally unprepared for the day's events even with multiple rereadings of the sources. A very disappointing experience, especially given that much of the material was interesting and thought-provoking, and a course such as this one really SHOULD be offered. [That said, Carl Posy, who exacerbated many of these problems, was a visiting professor this term from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and he's unlikely to return; if a seminar like this one comes back next year, it's likely to be Franks solo, and of the two Franks was far more compassionate and able to adjust to students' needs.]",
    "This course seemed to honestly be two leading philosophers telling us their philosophy, which was great. Unfortunately, partly because of there being two professors and partly because of the professors themselves, every part of this class was extremely disorganized - from the papers, which were assigned right before they were originally supposed to be due, to the classes themselves which (though quite interesting) jumped all over the place. In short, probably not a class for the faint-hearted.",
    "This class is amazing. A few words about its structure: the two professors alternated teaching. Every week, you read contemporary philosophy articles on a different issue in Kant usually alongside an excerpt from Kant. In general the seminars were more like lectures because of the density of the material, but there was always time to sidetrack, and both professors always stopped to consider our objections. The seminars required very very close attention, but were intense in just the way you want a seminar to be. Readings really ran the gamut; we covered an amazingly broad array of topics, but this is not by any stretch a survey course. Because we were covering them all in the context of deep study of Kantian themes, we engaged all of them pretty seriously. Both professors are brilliant. I get the impression many of the ideas presented in this class were new ones, and it is a real privilege just to watch people so smart engage philosophical arguments. Both professors are also amazingly committed to their students; they will really go out of their ways to help you understand the material. The readings were always hard though varied significantly in length from week to week. Actually, as a general note, take basically whatever classes with both of them!! A caveat: this class is really hard unless you have a strong background in Kant and exposure to contemporary philosophy. I took it with one half that background and am very glad that I did, but definitely struggled a lot at times because of what I was missing."
