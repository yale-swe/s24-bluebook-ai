    "Really easy class for seniors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It would be great if you are looking for a random class on a topic you have never learned about before. Not too much work or test.",
    "Great class - take it!",
    "If you study the specifics for the two quizzes and you take the final project very seriously then you will do great, very little in this class hinges upon lectures. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're willing to sit through lecture that you don't want to.",
    "Yes, but be careful if you are an engineering major since you'll have to do some work.",
    "This course is all group work. It's cool if you're creative or interested in finances for starting a business, but not really an engineering class. Lecture information is not essential to the learning process. Guest speakers are cool",
    "Great senior class where you work on a group project. Be aware that the material is very dated (and textbook is rife with typos), and that grading can be arbitrary. But all in all a very interesting exercise in creativity and group effort that is rare at yale.",
    "Sure",
    "Not worth it.",
    "A general overview of the product design process from surveying customer needs and prototyping to marketing and patenting. Not a lot of work until the big group project at the end. Be sure to pick a group of people who will work equally or else you'll hate the project and it'll be way more stressful. The course is a bit disorganized but Proff Bolanos is very established and knowledgeable of the field.",
    "Take this!",
    "Fun hands on class"
