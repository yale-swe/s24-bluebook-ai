    "You read Whitman, Dickinson, Moby-Dick, and a bit of Emerson, but really this is not a class with Harold Bloom, it's a class about Harold Bloom. The man's a genius and the discussions are sometimes top rate, but this is not a seminar in the traditional sense, just a chance to read some things and hear somebody who's thought a hell of a lot about them talk. Well worth it if you can get it, and certainly a minimum of work - but if you're interested in studying these works \"at a college level\" this is not the venue. An unforgettable experience in a way, but basically not a class.",
    "Whitman for six weeks, Moby-Dick for three, Dickinson for three. It's a great--maybe the best--list.The class is about Harold; he can be really great. He also had weeks when he was generally very tired and was slightly less inspiring. He's still better than many professors on their good days.",
    "If you have a real background in the poets of the course, it would probably be beneficial to take the class. I wouldn't recommend taking it if you don't have a some sort of background in reading these poets' works. Also, if you have a low tolerance for social climbers and disingenuous interactions, this is not the class for you.",
    "TAKE THE COURSE. IT IS GREAT.",
    "This isn't really a class by any standard definition, but it's a really incredible experience that will give you a kind of insight into the works you read that is qualitatively different from the kind of insight any other class can give you. Take it take it for sure...it's very hard to describe but it's definitely something different and special, and it will open and stretch your mind, sometimes without your realizing it's happening.",
    "The opportunity to read some of the greatest texts with one of the most remarkable minds guiding you through them.",
    "As always, Harold Bloom is the most outstanding instructor: wise, caring, thought-provoking and thoughtful beyond measure. If you're looking at this course, then you already know you want to take it, and why you want to take it with him. That said, it's worth knowing that class will almost certainly be held at his house almost every week as he is not in good health. You should also expect to make a trip to his house to visit him most weeks to continue your discussion. This is a class for those very committed both to the material and to the professor: it's a life experience, really, and not one to embark on unless you're prepared to approach it as such and with the dedication that he calls for."
