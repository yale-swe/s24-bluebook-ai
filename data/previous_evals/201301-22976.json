    "It's a great way to get to know a really interesting method of printmaking. Not too much work, but a lot of reward.",
    "Only if you're prepared to put in a lot of hours should you take Silkscreen. It was a lot of fun for me though, and I will definitely be taking Printmaking later on.",
    "I would recommend it to any student who wants to learn how to silkscreen or wants to learn a more \"analog\" method of producing an image. You'll learn how to silkscreen but will definitely have to be responsible about planning when you will finish your assignments as shop hours are a little unforgiving.",
    "Yes take it.",
    "Yes. If you want to take a class that is both creative and practical, take silkscreen. The assignments are really fun, the workload is not as heavy as some of the other printmaking classes, and the process is so satisfying to master (not that you can master it in a semester, but I definitely saw major improvement in my skills and my classmates' by the end).",
    "Great for learning screen printing techniques."
