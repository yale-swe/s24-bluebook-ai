   "comments": [
    "If you like Shakespeare and are good at memorizing lines this is a fun class. Biggs is a true character and it is worth your while to get to know him.",
    "You have to take this if you want to act. Professor Biggs might be the only man in theater studies who will openly criticize and it is so helpful and appreciated. It is really classical scene study, nothing fancy and out-there but if you want to just get back to some simple acting work this is where to do it. I really have no desire to be a classical actress but couldn't be happier I took this. Also it is just really fun if you take the class with good people.",
    "I would because it's a great opportunity to hone your skills as an actor. Take it even if you don't love Shakespeare - the lessons are relevant for all of acting.",
    "A Shakespeare acting class with emphasis on both monologues and scene work. I would recommend this class because it gives excellent training and audition techniques.",
    "One of the few real acting classes at Yale, and it's wonderful. We worked three monologues, several duologues, and two longer scenes. It's a very small class size, so you get to work every class, which is really nice. Professor Biggs gives great direction and, especially with the monologues, prepares you for professional auditions. So much fun and definitely worth taking. I highly recommend it!"
