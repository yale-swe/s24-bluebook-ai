    "I feel that this course has significant room for improvement -- too much reading, not enough direction from the instructor.",
    "I enjoyed this course very much.",
    "This class desperately needs field trips. We're right next to the coast -- let's get out, meet some people, and do some applied stuff!",
    "The weekly workload was very heavy. I felt that we were unable to completely cover all of the assigned materials. It was more of a brief overview of each.",
    "Professor Burroughs is an excellent professor. I was incredibly impressed with the syllabus and the assignments. The structure of having students teach material did not always optimize learning b\/c students did not always teach the material all that well. If Professor Burroughs could set the tone for proper teaching of the articles, students will get more out of the student teaching. I enjoyed when professor Burroughs taught the material and found his explanations to be very helpful. Finally, having a final after the final paper was very difficult--scheduling it earlier in the semester would have been better. Overall, excellent course, and I wish that FES planned to have Professor Burroughs teach more courses.",
    "I thought that this course was a great introduction to the coastal policy arena. The universe of information was inclusive and each setting was explained equally by science, policy, stakeholder perspectives, etc. I really enjoyed the course, the assignments, the readings, and the overall pace and breadth of the course. The better the in-class discussion, the better the course goes, overall. We had flashes of that this year, but probably could have benefited from some more discussion entrees. Part of that is on us, though.The readings were just a tad heavy, in my opinion. That said, that's because I liked them and generally tried to do them all every week. I was mostly successful. I'm not sure if lighter reading is worth compromising, though. One of the greatest assets of this course is a carefully balanced selected reading list from the syllabus. Very well done overall.The professor kept things lively for the most part when conversation waned or drifted. If the professor decides to use the policy formulation exercise in the second half of the semester (like our SLR project), then (I think) it's critical for the professor to guide that process (like you did with our deliverable schedule) and to suggest ways for improvement. I think many of us almost wanted you to be a little more critical during the policy development process to chase us off of some trails so that we ended up with a stronger paper. Just a minor complaint, though. It shows we cared!"

    "My classmates.",
    "I loved learning about the governance ideas related to coastal management.",

    "More instructor direction, the \"discussion\" summaries ended up being verbatim regurgitation of the readings which made being prepared for class a disadvantage because we would simply go over the readings word for word. There should have been discussion\/problem solving\/think-tank exercises.I would have liked to hear the professor lecture more, instead of the discussion being so repetitive.",
    "I enjoyed it very much and can't think of any improvements.",
    "The format of the class is quite weak. There's little point in exhaustively summarizing articles that we all read. Classes should have been a much more dynamic combination of lecture and discussion, instead of rehashing the readings at length. Especially during the middle weeks, the class's structure kind of dragged. This was both the fault of the instructor, who in my opinion should have intervened to change the dynamic of the class; and the students, who became lethargic and didn't push the envelope at all.",
    "workload, more manageable",
    "See question 11.",
    "Just a way to make sure that discussion stays lively. Summarizing readings was great, but am not sure it was worth taking up half of class to present. Maybe incorporating readings into an overall narrative or couple of themes would be better than just summarizing readings every week--or questions to consider and discuss after group reads and summarizes article. It could have been because our group was so small that we were stagnant at times."

    "The instructor was always available for questions and help.",

I thought his instruction struck a good balance between informing us and making us seek out answers on our own. At times, he could be a little vague, and his instructions were sometimes inscrutable. Still, he obviously has a huge body of knowledge and expertise, which was much appreciated.",
    "Excellent help from the professor.",

I wish that we had spent more time talking about fisheries -- important though sea level rise is, I felt like spending several precious class sessions talking about our final project was superfluous. We could have covered other topics, such as fisheries or oil extraction, in greater depth, and spent less time discussing sea level.",

   "comments": [
    "Group work was good-- instructor feedback often came in the form of a question. For example, you would ask a question for clarification and his feedback would be another question. Very frustrating.",
    "I enjoyed working as a team onthe final project and hearing everyone's perspectives.",
    "It was awesome. Great people with a diverse field of knowledge and different aptitudes. Learned as much from them as I did from the class. I also really enjoyed their company -- they made what could have been a frustrating assignment interesting and fun to work on.",
    "It was a great experience to work with a group my peers. I learned a great deal from my peers. The frustrations and compromises are part of the experience and overall we produced a much better product as a team than we would have separately.",
    "Group work was essential to this course. Essential. I think we were fortunate to have a really good group. Even if there were 1 or 2 people who didn't contribute equally, it would be really problematic in the course and the classroom experiences and work productions would suffer. That's how essential group work is for this class. No problems this year, though. We all tought each other a lot and we felt like the out-of-class group experiences were productive, (mostly) focused, and collegial.Disadvantages were that we were all pretty sick of groupwork by this point in the year. E-documents and google chatting can make meeting seem irrelevant. I had a hard time adjusting to this, but it seemed to be the preferred method of communication as the semester dragged on. We still got together several times to finish our project."

    "Break up the readings in groups and encourage the professor to lecture instead of having reading summaries for 3 hours.",

    "This class is largely what you make it! Don't get sucked into just summarizing articles every week. The instructor will basically take the course in whatever direction you want to go -- if you push the conversation in interesting directions, you'll get a lot out of the course; if you're content to do the minimum, it won't be much use. This is one course where the students can really dictate the agenda.",
