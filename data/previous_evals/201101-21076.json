   "comments": [
    "This is a class about contemporary issues in foreign policy. If you're interested in discussing these issues, it's a good class to take. I would warn students, though, that it does not go in much depth at all in the issues, so if you're looking for a course that really considers the issues in depth this might not be the best one to take. That said, Negroponte is a great person to get to know and has interesting insight into American foreign policy.",
    "yes.i especially loved the discussion on Israel and Palestine, and Climate Change when Amb. Negroponte revealed his diplomatic expertise and how he would address the challenges.",
    "This was a really interesting course that allowed us to survey the major issues of our time in an interesting and meaningful way.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in foreign policy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I would summarize this course as saying that a student will be able to learn a ton about the pressing national security issues facing the US from all over the world from a very experienced and insightful professor.",
    "INRL 765 was a great survey course of current international issues related to US national security. Would definitely recommend this course to others.",
    "Valuable survey course on the issues with someone who very often has first hand insight.",
    "This is a useful overview of U.S. foreign policy from an experienced policy practitioner. I would recommend this course."

    "This course gave me a lot of insightinto different regions of the world and their interactions\/importance with US foreign policy. I also learned a lot about the historical context of US foreign policy relations with many countries and heard a lot of great anecdotes from the professor's personal experiences.",
