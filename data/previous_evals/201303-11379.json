   "comments": [
    "This was a great class; I don't understand why previous reviews were so negative. The class is a broad survey of topics from historical linguistics, dealing with how languages change over time and the sociopolitical issues surrounding those changes. Prof. Bowern is very knowledgeable about linguistics and languages in general and you will learn a lot. Homework was roughly biweekly and there was a final paper; no exams.",
    "Ling 112 offers and overview of the types of changes that languages undergo over time. These include sound changes, syntactic changes, semantic changes and many others. This class is a really nice alternative writing credit. Its not super easy, and the material is a bit dry unless you are really passionate about linguistics, but its much better than a lot of the alternatives. Its also nice that there is no final. Professor Bowen is a great lecturer and is very helpful. Be sure to be in communication with the TA about the expectations on the homework, as sometimes they are looking for something very specific.",
    "A pretty good overview of historical linguistics; I feel like I have a fairly good handle on sound change and reconstructions. Not the easiest way to get a writing credit (Eight 3-4 page papers and then a 10 page final research paper). If you're interested in a more general intro to the field of linguistics, I would suggest taking another course.",
    "If you think Linguistics sounds interesting this class won't disappoint. Others may complain that too many examples come from the professor's favorite Australian languages, but that shouldn't take away from the fact that the topics covered are interesting and the lecturing is very good. The workload, most of it writing, might be more that one would expect given the low course number, but it's not unreasonable for a writing credit. Expect to work a fairly enjoyable 5-10 hours a week outside of class and section.",
    "A wide-ranging introduction to language change (and the reasons it occurs) at every level from single sounds to words to whole languages interacting with each other. We discussed lots of interesting examples in class and section. You also get to do some problems in the homework.This is a writing credit (or at least it was in fall 2013) , so you have a 10 page paper at the end, and a couple of the homework assignments were more research than problem-solving.If you're like me and into STEM, looking for a tolerable WR, I highly recommend this class. Despite linguists' claim to work in the humanities, linguistics is actually a science and this class is very logical. Don't worry too much about the paper \u00e2\u0080\u0094 once you do your research (I read 8 papers) you'll find you have plenty to say and that it's surprisingly easy to write 10+ pages."
