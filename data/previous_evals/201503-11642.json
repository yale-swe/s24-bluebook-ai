   "comments": [
    "You really get out of this class what you put in. You can totally put nothing in, but you'll get nothing out. The practicum commitment is intense and time-consuming, but really rewarding and fun. No homework except reading (which we never discuss) and a final 10-15 page paper (analysis of research studies).",
    "Yes, this class's workload is very light. That's not why I took it, though. The lectures are actually extremely interesting, and I looked forward to visiting Chapel Haven every week.",
    "PSYC 350 is a great course and an amazing opportunity to learn about autism in a tangible way and from a variety of perspectives. I would definitely recommend PSYC 350 to another student. It is by far one of the most formative course experiences I have had at Yale and offers an incredible opportunity to all students who take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Autism and Related Disorders to anyone who is interested in any part of the autism spectrum. The weekly placements were incredibly valuable, for often times the psych classes at Yale end up being large lecture settings; here, however, the weekly placements allow you to get hand-on experience with working with students that have autism or Asperger's, and the on-site knowledge you gain is definitely worth it. The weekly seminars were very informative and taught by experts in the field of autism. We covered all aspects of ASD, from the genetic component to various treatment types and therapy techniques. Hearing the brother of a man with autism speak was also very valuable, embodying the data that we've been reading about. Hearing a high-functioning man with autism present his story to us was also hugely interesting and exciting, and getting to ask him questions was very eye-opening.",
    "This is a good class--sometimes going to the placements were cumbersome because they're far away.",
    "This class is amazing! If you are at all interested in autism or know someone who is affected by the disorder, you will learn so much in this class and will come away with a much better understanding of the challenges that people with autism face on a daily basis.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to all students.",
    "I didn't enjoy this class as much as I hoped I would. The class is really more like a small lecture series than a seminar. Though it was interesting to have different speakers come in every week, I found that this lent itself to the class feeling very fragmented. I think it would have been interesting to have more discussions in class. I think I ended up getting the most out of observing the clinical assessments at the Child Study Center.",
    "You really get what you put into this course. You can probably get away with not going to lecture and\/or your field placement, but it is incredibly worth it to go. Some lectures can be a bit dry compared to others, but all in all the information presented is interesting - particularly to those people who don't have experience with Autism before. Field placements can be very rewarding experiences if you go! The course is essay based and this makes sense for a course covering a special topic like this.",
    "I would say that you should take the class if you have a personal connection to autism. However, the course does not provide enough depth, except for the final paper if you choose to pursue it, on various topics of neurobiology. This is a survey course more than anything, but the workload is very manageable and you will no doubt find many of the guest lecturers very interesting to meet and talk to.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to gain experience working with people with ASD. It is an interesting class that does not require too much work. Overall a great class!",
    "Take this class if you are genuinely interested in ASD. I imagine that it would make a good fifth class, but be aware that the practicum ultimately will take up a good 4 hours\/solid portion of your day.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "No homework or exams, just a 10-15 page final paper on an autism related topic of your interest. Attendance in class wasn't strictly monitored, which means you can take more interest in aspects of autism that interest you and have a lighter grasp on other areas. I chose to sit in on autism rounds for my practicum, and it was interesting to observe the climate of many licensed professionals discussing their diagnoses based on a child's performance during diagnostic tests. I'd recommend one of the practicums where you work directly with autistic individuals though.",
    "Yes, this is an incredible class and unique experience.",
    "Great class, very interesting. Would definitely recommend to future students, especially if they have friends or family with ASDs.",
    "DEFINITELY take this course - it is incredible. Do NOT expect it to be a seminar, because it really is just a new lecture every single week with a guest speaker at a forefront of the field. However, it was not too hard, the readings were accessible, and the paper was pretty fun to work on! I really appreciated this course and you learn a lot on how autism is shaping the future of America and the current up-to-date research on its treatment and diagnosis. Fred Volkmar is a total boss and it was a very engaging place to spend 90 minutes of your week."
