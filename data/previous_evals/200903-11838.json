    "AMST190 is a course that attempts to break down the many sociological, and cultural changes that influenced the US from the late 1800s to 1919. The reading is interesting, and lectures can be really cool. I recommend this course. Try to get Yenisey if she's still a section leader next year!",
    "There are other better AMST classes out there so if you're looking for an interesting class then look some more. FORMAC is good but it provides a basis to learn other classes.",
    "Great way to understand this period in American history. TAKE IT... AMST major or not!",
    "I would summarize AMST190 as an attempt to understand the years from 1876 to 1919 in the U.S. through a variety of cultural materials. The main themes of the class are labor, race, gender, citizenship, class, and the emergence of a 'modern' culture. I would recommendthis class to any student interested in looking at this period of American history through a variety of lenses such as film, image, music, journalism, comics, and literature and who wants to develop skills in cultural analysis. If you are looking for a class that will leave you with a firm grasp of American history during this period, however, FORMAC may not be your class.",
    "Yes, take if you are going to be an Am. Studies major or thinking about it.",
    "Excellent survey course. Not too much work, great lectures (all slide shows, full of cool visual material), interesting and relevant topic. You'll find yourself talking about the material after class.",
    "A study of culture and its function in society; very interdisciplinary, with a focus on unorthodox historical documents such as films, comics&music. It assumes a lot of prior knowledge about American history though; don't take this class if you're looking for a basic overview of the period.",
    "Take the class. A great introductory course on American culture and the professor is inspiring.",
    "I thought this was a great course. Agnew is an amazing and engaging lecturer. The only problem is that while lectures are also enjoyable and fascinating to listen to, they can be a little difficult to follow. It's almost impossible to take good notes and extract real information, so when the time comes for tests it's definitely a little daunting. But he puts notes up online which are incredibly helpful, so it ends up being fine. So overall, yes I would recommend it.",
    "A really excellent course, unlike any history class I have taken at Yale or in high school. I thought that the years would be boring at first, but Agnew is an AMAZING lecturer and I learned so much. Section (with Sam) was excellent and really pulled the class together. Readings are largely primary sources which are really interesting, and like I said, lectures are fascinating and Agnew is brilliant and entertaining. Definitely take this class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. I took it to supplement my major (History of Art, concentrating in American Art) and I found the course very accessible. Professor Agnew approached the material through lots of media: pictures, poems, songs, newspaper articles, which made the course material interesting. He's a great lecturer and the work is not that hard, it was one of my easier classes.",
    "This is a solid class and I would recommend it highly. There is a decent amount of reading per week, but its manageable.",
    "Pretty interesting class- some lectures are great, others less so. Not a ton of work, and the readings are (usually) pretty interesting so they're not hard to do. Keep in mind that we're studying from from the 1870s to 1919, so \"modern american culture,\" as exciting as the phrase sounds, does not refer to giga pets and lady gaga. That would be cool, though.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone who is thinking about doing American Studies as a major.",
    "Comprehensive look at American culture in the time period, but difficult if you don't already have some background because the narratives are very complicated and hard to relate to the big picture.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. The tools of cultural analysis are invaluable in many disciplines: history, literature, theater\/film, evolutionary biology, economics, creative writing\u0085 So many of our assumptions emerge from the late nineteenth\/early twentieth century \u0096 this class made me realize just how constructed (and seductive) they are.Professor Agnew is a dynamic, dynamite professor who spins a story out of incredibly disparate elements. (Sometimes his lectures are a bit hard to follow \u0096 it\u0092s one of those classes where you definitely need to type your notes in order to keep up with his argument.) Nonetheless, he helped me to see the world as a bit of a looking glass\u0097both a window to peer through, and a glass that bears my reflection. Definitely convinced me to become an American Studies major \u0096 I recommend it to everyone.",
    "Definitely. It is a great way to approach history, and I learned so much more about the history of the American culture we have today.",
    "yes, you really learn a lot, i feel like i understand modern american culture and the historical background of why things are the way they are today.",
    "I would certainly recommend FORMAC to another student. Having taken this course as a first semester freshman, I will admit that I was completely confused and frustrated at the beginning of the course. This was unlike any other history class I had taken, and while it was interesting, I wasn't exactly sure what it was all about. However, time and my TF helped me figure out the class, and by the end of term, it was one of my favorite courses. The lectures are interesting and thought-provoking. The subject matter of the class is fascinating\u0097the turbid dialectic America underwent as it became an industrial and urban nation. The redefining and restructuring of labor, the rise of a managerial middle class, the shift from rural agricultural life-rhythms to fast-paced and clock-regulated city life, and the meaning of American cultural citizenship will all pleasantly occupy your thoughts. Now I can't look at American cultural symbols or output in the same way\u0097not without analyzing them for potential myths and frames.",
    "A really interesting approach to history. Take it, especially if you need a FORMAC.",
    "I LOVED FORMAC! While it may appear to be a survey class of 1876-1919, the lecture with Agnew turns the survey into a story. Lectures are riveting. The sheer amount of knowledge that Agnew possesses is staggering. The time period is a very interesting one, right after the Civil War up through WWI. It is interesting to see how fluidly the country changes to become modern. Agnew does a great job also of connecting the modern to our contemporary society so that lectures hit home for students. The focus on cultural productions such as music, film and comics also makes the course very fun.LOVE LOVE LOVE. Take it if you're at all interested in American society.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is interested in learning about American History and culture. The course work, papers, and tests are fair and the lectures are interesting.",
    "FORMAC is a WONDERFUL class! I think it has been one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Agnew's lectures are just amazing--very well put together and thought provoking. The material is extremely interesting. It is so much better than an ordinary history class b\/c you really focus on the cultural aspect of american society. The work load is actually very very fair--primary documents (like short stories, poems, speeches by men like Carnegie, film reviews, and a few novels) that are so interesting you will want to do all of them; also most of them are very quick reads that go by quickly. I think we only had one reading the whole semester that was simply facts\/historical information (secondary source). Please take this class! Agnew's lectures are one of a kind, and the TA's are awesome. We had two essays, a midterm, and a final(with the final you have the option of doing a take home). Studying for the midterm is a bit stressful but it is then that the material really comes together and you realize just how wonderful Agnews' lectures are. Going to lecture is extremely important since the readings are simply primary sources and his lectures are key in putting all the ideas together. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Formac is a great overview of American cultural history. There is a lot of information packed into each lecture, and sometimes the reading load can get a little heavy. However, if you do the work and attend lecture, it is not difficult to do well. (Prof. Agnew does put the lecture slides online, but the slide showis mostly images and he says a lot of important stuff in lecture that isn't on the slides, so going really helps). It's a great intro course if you're interested in American studies or history.",
    "I am a junior American Studies major, and this was the most intellectually stimulating class I took this semester--far more engaging than my seminar. Professor Agnew is brilliant, and his lectures were not only consistently interesting, but clever and original, and I always left lecture wowed.An interesting period of American history that is often skipped over, a great professor, not a lot of work--take this class!!",
    "This course presents a huge wealth of information and interpretation. Lectures habitually blew my mind - Agnew is brilliant. Most of the readings were good. The papers and exams were very challenging because the kind of interpretation and thought they ask for is totally different from the kind you do in any other kind of class. There are no easy A's here. That said, I really liked the class and would highly recommend it. Even as someone who has grown up in the United States, most of the stuff covered in this class was new to me. It is really cool to trace the influence of this time period into today's culture.",
    "American Studies 190 01 is a class that chronicles changes in American life from 1876 to 1919. It does so by analyzing transformations in American culture from several viewpoints, from that of urban immigrant workers, to those of rural farmers, African Americans, women, the suburban middle class, and a growing tribalist upper class. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in American history and learning about the Gilded Age. Be warned though that this is not a textbook-based course, its syllabus is comprised of nearly all primary sources. If you enjoy analyzing primary sources and learning history in a conceptual way, this is the class for you.",
    "This class started off strong with very engaging lectures, but overtime, the material didn't seem to grab me as much. I'm not sure if that's really the professor's fault since Agnew's lectures were always well prepared. I think it just came down to he subject matter being very much catered to people who really, really like history since this time period wasn't the most make-you-jump-out-of-your-seat interesting. I'm not sure if I would recommend this course since it just didn't do it for me, but it's definitely worth a shopping.",
    "I strongly recommend AMST 190\/HIST 112 to a fellow student. If you are interested in American history or cultural history, then Professor Agnew will blow your mind! He is honestly one of the most brilliant and engaging lecturers at Yale!However, the class is quite intellectually challenging because Agnew sets the bar so high. I recommend maybe trying to take another class in cultural history before this like Professor Matthew Jacobson's ForMAC from 1919 to the Present.",
    "Lectures are some of the best I've ever been to-I was actually sad when I missed one. Like really, legitimately sad. Reading was kinda heavy but well worth the time spent. Apart from the readings there wasn't too much work involved. I would definitely say take this class if you are at all interested in cultural transformation and especially if you are thinking about majoring in American Studies. The focus on 1876-1919 was also a plus just because it was a time period that I previously didn't know much about. Take this class!!!",
    "FORMAC is a whirlwind tour of a period of American history and culture that I didn't know much about and am really glad that I do know. Professor Agnew can be a bit of a mad scientist but the class is really enjoyable and a great way to engage with an important period. It's a cultural study, though, not so much a historical study in the traditional sense."
