    "- Could attempt using one case study - will enable in-depth discussion and see how our views on sustainability changes over time. TA attempted to do this but, difficult given other things TA needs to cover.- Sometimes the guest lectures were disconnected from rest of the class. Even if good sessions in and of itself.- Sometimes the Professors did not discuss the readings in-depth.- Professors did not push each others boundaries much. Stayed within comfort zones. Would have liked to see more discussions and debates.- Need an Economist as a part of the discussion. Not just because it is the dismal science :). Many of us are skeptical about the solutions they propose but, they are the ones who usually take a stand - so would have been useful to have them a part of this.- A lot of work. I don't mind it but, could have avoided a finals as well. Would have been OK writing a third concept assessment instead.",
    "My TA had no particular expertise so my TA was not able to bring much to the conversation in section for the TA's own experience or background",
    "The course has four instructors. I feel like the three older male professors with much more technical fields somehow overshadowed or dominated Karen Hebert's social science side. It is difficult to read whether this was a gender, authority or hard vs soft science issue. I would have likes to see a little more of her input. It was there, but not at the forefront.The workload for the course was too high: Weekly commentary and commentary on commentary plus three larger concept assessments plus a poster (which is in the order of project\/paper\/final in terms of time consumed) PLUS a final, which was changed at the last minute into a take home (which entails more work than just a sit-down final). I think there's still too much of a load left over from when it was a 6-credit class last semester.",
    "Q1: The readings were often pretty good individually, but they often had very little to do with what we were talking about in class, and there were many times huge gaps in the material between the Monday and the Wednesday class, even though we were required to read all of the reading before Monday.Q2: This was extremely variable. Some professors were really good at addressing student questions, others got extremely defensive when they were asked a difficult question. Other times, the professors would respond in a deliberately polarizing way, which tended to provoke unnecessarily long-winded conversations about things no one in the class ever thought was true in the first place.Q3: The assignments in this class were a complete waste of time. I had actually enjoyed writing the fist concept assessment, only to get it back with the comment that I had not correctly done the assignment. The fact that I had not done the assignment correctly was totally a shock to me, and made me realize that the 'correct' way to do the assignment was far from obvious. The assignments asked us to directly address many concepts that we never actually talked about in class. Professors acted as though these 'concepts' were obvious to students, but many of us had only read one article that made very little sense on the topic. We never even got a chance to ask questions about the concepts when we were confused, because the lectures were too busy talking about other information that relied little or not at all on whatever information we were supposed to have taken from the class. SO FRUSTRATING.Also on assignments: you cannot ask for a 1500 work paper when the prompt itself is 1000 words. That is absurd. It always seemed as though the TAs and the Profs wanted both a 1500 word paper and a full literature review\/feasibility study. You can't have both. But when we only gave 1500 words, we were asked for more detail. When we gave more detail, we were told the papers were too long.Q4: This classwas a lot of work. However, I don't mind getting a lot of work for a class if I feel like I am getting a lot out of the work. This was not the case for me in Linkages. The weekly responses, unlike other weekly reading responses for other classes, felt like busy work more than something to help us get more out of the reading. This probably has a lot to do with the fact that we never actually talked about the reading. Ever. It all seemed pointless.Q6: We talked about this in class, but I think jumping from topic to topic was unhelpful. Nothing came together, nothing made sense together, and it just seemed like a big jumble of half-formed ideas. There has to be some way to make the class cohesive.Q7: I was very excited coming into the class to have Oz, Karen, Tony, and Tom for professors. However, none of them even seemed like they were teaching the class, since they lectured so infrequently (always deferring to guest lectures), and never attending discussion sections (WHY NOT?!?!?!). I felt like Gabe was my professor since he was the only one I had regular contact with. Also, the professors didn't seem to work well with one another, since what they had to say was so hard to fit alongside what the others had to say. The debates were by far the best lectures, but they stopped for some reason.Q8: This class was based on a really good idea. It failed to address that idea in any coherent way. I think I would like to take this class in 5 years when the problems have been ironed out and the students are no long the unlucky guinea pigs. I HATED being part of this experiment.",
    "The one appealing aspect of this course was hearing about the research interests of this diverse array of exceptionally accomplished intellectuals. It did help to describe the impressive number of angles which one can approach environmental studies from. However, they presented their subject of expertise in a vacuum of independence, which made it difficult to discern any overarching method for analyzing \"linkages\" between disciplines and environmental issues.",
    "This is the second time this class has been taught. I learned A LOT taking this class but it's still a work in progress. The assigned readings are great, the lectures are pretty poor, and the assignments didn't really deepen our understanding of the topics addressed. There were three TAs and it seemed that people loved 2 of them. Discussion section is a big part of this class. It often felt like we were sprinting from one topic to the next. It's always a struggle to balancebreadth with depth and here, they really erred on the side of breadth.A rigorous case study (or two) introduced first thing, before anything else, would help. That way, there would be something to hang all the many concepts on.The professors expressed their interest in understanding solutions to problems but really, we spent most of our time unpacking problems.In many ways, it was depressing and yet an ego booster to realize that our professors aren't any more sure than the students about how to solve environmental problems.",
    "Work load is a lot heavier than a 3 credit course. The exam seemed redundant after the concept assessments and the poster.",
    "On question 6: it is more a matter of the organisation of the class than the pace; as it is currently organised, it tries to cover a lot of material a little too fast.",
    "I think instructors for the course should be evaluated independently. While they were very knowledgable in their respective fields, and very willing to engage in debates, some were reluctant to address criticsm to their disciplinary mindset.",
    "Linkages of Sustainability tries to do a lot. I appreciated the wide scope and acknowledgement that \"sustainability\" - ostensibly, why we are all here - is multifaceted, difficult, and confusing to attempt. Complex system dynamics are involved, and although we merely broached the details of these models, it did leave me with a taste for doing more here. Unfortunately, what is good as a gateway course is frustrating in my last semester at FES, because it is clear that a broad survey of social science concepts of systems theory leave huge gaping holes, which complicate and frustrate students who genuinely care about these issues.",
    "This is a good class because you get to really examine what sustainability is and the way you think about it."

    "- Some of the readings.- The TA.",

    "real life, well examined, case studies; debates on issues",
    "Diversity of input and perspectives from the professors.Content. I really appreciated the vast majority of the material. I have given my feedback on the specific issues I have had to the TA. The Systems Dynamics portions of the course were mind-opening.",
    "The debate lectures. Those were the only times when we could see that different disciplined points of view change the way one has to think about a certain topic. I would hope the class in the future is more like these debates. It was nice to see the professors working together in acohesive way, and I actually learned a lot from those 2 classes.I liked where this class was going. I think it has the potential to be very good. It just wasn't this semester. I could tell that all the profs care a lot about this kind of class, and they tried very hard to make it work (even took our comments and incorporated them into the final exam), but it just fell short this time. Unfortunately, when I am paying this much to go to a school that is meant to be as good as Yale, I am particularly sensitive to when classes fall short.",
    "The breadth of topics covered, and the cutting edge research shared",
    "The integrated teaching -- it was great to get a sense of how many different tools we can apply to think about questions of sustainability.",
    "The readings and web chat during the discussion about Pebble Mine and the guest lecture from Karen Seto were the best moments in the course.",
    "The concepts assessments.They are challenging in that there's a lot of information to process. But I think they're absolutely necessary as an exercise.",

    "The range of readings. Discussion section.",
    "Though the course could be frustrating at times, this course strongly influenced the way I think about the world, which to me is the mark of an excellent course.",
    "Many relevant\/interesting topics are covered during the course and you get to hear lectures from a variety of professors. I enjoyed the guest lectures\/movies outside of class and the dinners\/drinks provided at these events were awesome. Class discussions were insightful and enjoyable. I appreciated not having an exam in this class and I liked having the class in Sage 24 (it was easier to hear and see professors and students).",
    "Working on the group poster project was a valuable experience, though I wish we had been given more time throughout the semester to approach the project. Our discussion sections were dynamic and engaging, but not long enough to cover all of the ideas and materials introduced in the week's lectures and readings.",
    "Exposure to a wide variety of subjects and faculty.",
    "Linkages does indeed train you in interdisciplinary, systematic thinking, as it sets out to do. It really opens the mind to both other fields of knowledge and expertise, and other ways of thinking, whatever your background may be. You'll never look at an environmental (or any other) issue the same way again.A lot of the material presented in class was very interesting; the debates in particular were enlightening, though the sides in each could have engaged each other more directly.Sections were the most useful I've ever had - the reading responses and reading-response-responses, while adding significantly to the workload, certainly helped sections to be more useful, and the multiple perspectives that all the students brought to sections were real eye-openers.",
    "Hearing a wide range of perspectives and other professors who visited, as well as the knowledge held by four different faculty members. Discussion session was also very valuable.",

   "comments": [
    "The concept assessments made no sense. The format was very unclear. Also, the feedback wasn't very helpful. I always got 1 or 2 points on each rubric section, which didn't give me a place to focus on improving.",
    "coordination between instructors and topics. some issues were only mildly touched upon while there was too much emphasis on others",
    "Work-load.The CSR section.",
    "I felt that the order of the course should have been rearranged such that all the \"toolbox\" concepts such as systems thinking, scenario planning, decision making analysis, governance etc. were taught up front, before introducing us to topical areas such as agriculture, pebble mine, cod fisheries etc. This way, we would have been able to practice applying the different concepts to these case studies. I felt that the concepts taught towards the end of the class like decision making analysis would have been very valuable to us if given the same weight as the systems thinking concept was, but were seemingly given short-shrift instead.",
    "The assignments. The content. The structure.I think the class should take the form of a 3 hour seminar once a week, rather than this 2 hour and a half lectures (even though we were promised that they would only be one hour) plus a discussion section that was too short to be worth it, but long enough to be terribly inconvenient.The only way this 3 hour structure would work, though, is if the profs actually kept to their 1-HOUR time slot, and left the other time for the class to discuss the topic, WITH PROFESSORS, the way a truly rigorous and interesting course would.",
    "None.",
    "Need to focus on the practical and management focus over the academic.Re-examine all readings and assignment towards this end.The depth of analysis and thought, and overall value, in the concept assessment far outstrips the lecture, then perhaps spend some lecture time reviewing the concept assessment after they are submitted to capitalize on all that work that has been done.Food and corporate responsibility sections need a complete overhaul. Way too one dimensional and thin.",
    "Sometimes the course just felt too theoretical. I think that theory readings are incredibly important, but I'd love to meld them more regularly to case studies, where we can dive deep into an issue and apply the theory to that particular case.",
    "The concept assessments should focus on readings already presented in class. Using a common case study throughout the entire course may offer some cohesion. Offering some guidance about the visual aspects of how to create a presentation poster may also be helpful.",
    "1. The grading system. The weekly meetings and the weekly responses (40% both) take too much time, and they're worthless by themselves.The concept assessments (50%)are the real thing.2. The weekly discussion sections should be redesigned. I would suggest all discussions be framed in terms of systems theory.3. This class should be offered in the fall term, for 1st years.4. Also, as long as the final exam is a take home exam (as it was for us), that's fine. There's no point on having a closed book examination.",
    "That being said, I think this course should be discontinued. I have no idea how you can put so many brilliant people on teaching team and still fail to convey any meaningful lessons about environmental systems. As currently taught, the course is an exercise in trivia. One piece on disjointed information is presented after another and even when we can get two professors to lend divergent insights on a specific case study, the curriculum moves on, and never revisits the case again. The one exception to this pattern was the pebble mine case, which was referred back to multiple times. In future years (I assume that this course will actually be continued) I would recommend an intensive case based framework. Spend two weeks or one case (Pebble Mine, the Atlantic Cod Fishery, Ozone Depletion, Borneo, and Global Warming would be possible choices) and dig into them in depth. Spend the first three weeks of the course on systems thinking, resilience, some qualitative economic concepts like common pool resource management, and anthropological concepts then apply those throughout the course to five cases. Also, I might have benefited from hearing some of Dr. Leiserowitz' work on public perception and psychology earlier in the course. Furthermore, try to approach each case in a disciplined fashion. Define the scope, stakeholders, stakeholder priorities, and competing environmental agendas. It is extremely difficult to believe that we've been given tools of analysis when it is often hard to determine if any are being used in the presentation of material.",
    "Lectures need improvement. Less talking at us and more engagement. Assume we did the reading.Assignments would be more useful if they were on a topic we'd already been discussing instead of something new each time.Poster assignment still baffles me. I got nothing from making a poster.The term \"linkages\" needs to be more rigorously defined.",
    "The interdisciplinary nature of the course leads it to be incoherent at times, but I felt it all came together in the end.",
    "The work load is very heavy in this class compared to the other integrative courses, and to other FES courses in general. The written assignments had small word limits and extremely long\/extensive prompts; students would be marked off if they left out information but were also marked off for going over the word limit. It was confusing to know what the professors\/TAs wanted. It would have been helpful to have assignments that were similar to assignments\/work products that will be expected of students once they are out in the working world. The class was not interdisciplinary. Two of the professors were clearly still stuck in their own disciplines\/ways of thinking.",
    "The pace. We explored so much new and interesting material each week, and then barely had a chance to dig in and discuss. It would also be helpful to have more focus on a few case studies to approach from different theoretical perspectives and with different practical tools throughout the semester.",
    "1. Workload2. Some flexibility should be given in concept assessments, rubric based evaluation leads to rote learning.",
    "The integration between the different components of the course is still, shall we say, incomplete. It might help to have clearer mental models or possibly shared case studies presented at the -beginning- of the class (besides just systems thinking and panarchy), to inform and structure the rest of the class as we go through the various 'linkages across X' and 'linkages of X' sections. In particular, perhaps some of the systems thinking and panarchy material could be compressed a little, and some of the material prof Leiserowitz presents right near the end - about governance or modes of thought\/communication - brought forward to the beginning.Overall, my main frustration with the course was that after a while, once the entire 'linkages' idea had sunk in (a few weeks into term), it became frustrating to be trying to apply linkages thinking to cases for which we had no real data or information - because ultimately, while recognising that linkages exist is an important first step, learning to identify which are important and which less so is a necessary next step to mastering linkages thinking. Doing this requires more solid factual information that can be discussed - hence the possible usefulness of case studies.The concept assessments, while useful chances to exercise the kind of thinking we were being taught, were frustrating for that reason - it felt a little contrived, and I always worried about [mis-]applying concepts to a case I knew virtually nothing about.",
    "It was too much work I think. I think there could be a few small tweaks, such as no final exam on top of three concept assessment papers and a final poster, and don't require discussion leaders to prepare questions and such on top of the regular response paper and reply. A practical element could be incorporated into the concept assessments which could be valuable for the students and various real causes and issues. There could also be improvement in exploring and recognizing more environmental ethics and values outside the mainstream and western philosophy, perhaps inviting a professor like John Grim or Mary Evelyn Tucker to share a presentation on religion, values and the environment. I think there could also be a greater explicit emphasis, at least for a week, on the links between human rights and environmental justice and sustainability.",
    "Conecpt assesments were at times unclear in expectations with respect to the space given to writing.",
    "Though the specific work we had to do was at many times interesting, the workload was definitely very (or rather too) heavy. This is not a 3-credit course's workload, but perhaps 4. My suggestion is to take one of the general things out, either the weekly reviews, the concept assessments, the poster, or the final. Though, i think the poster and the final were both helpful, given that the final remains a take-home (certainly not an in-class exam).Also, more examples of actual successful cases might be helpful. The last guest lecturer, who i believe previously taught the course, gave a very insightful lecture on an actual successful example. More of those would probably be helpful. Thank you for a good semester!",
    "The lack of focus, and incomplete descriptions of phenomena. We need more linkages in Linkages.",
    "The course had a lot of work. It also could be very depressing at times. I would have liked it if we could have spent more time talking about what systems were and ways to identify leverage points. I also was particularly bothered at the lack of respect for our time - at the beginning of the semester, we were told that because of the extra hour for discussion sections, the lecture portion of the class would end 20 minutes early. This didn't happen, and while I found the lectures and discussions that followed to be interesting, I found the consistent lack of respect for students' time very inconsiderate."

    "Yes.",
    "Not remotely. As before, there was too little face-time with the profs.There was little in the way of a cohesive understanding of sustainability. By the end of the class, I realized that the word is basically meaningless. Maybe that was the point. But I don't like a class that leaves me cynical.The class was far from interdisciplinary. It was multi-disciplinary, which is not the same.",
    "Certainly.",
    "It did give me a stronger framework to think about sustainability issues, and I thought the reading was quite interesting. Again, moving from the theoretical to the practical still seems like a challenge in this course.",

   "comments": [
    "The best part of the course to me were the discussion sections and the readings. Learnt a lot from classmates.",
    "Much less effort. More ideas about what a concept assessment is.",
    "I always enjoy working with a group, both professionally and academically. Multiple perspectives enrich thinking. I believe that the final product is often more solid than that of individual work, at least for me.",
    "I didn't understand the point of the poster presentation when the faculty did not engage us in the conversation that was purportedly the distinguishing factor of the poster.",
    "I enjoyed the group project more than anything else we had to do for the class. We were able to pick a project that was appealing to us (rather than respond to a prompt that made barely any sense on a topic that was only a little bit interesting), and were able to complete an assignment that actually gave us good experience (since posters are something that people have to do in the real world).Also, since it became clear to me that I didn't understand how to write a concept assessment, it was nice to have team mates to help figure out what was actually wanted from us.",
    "It exposes you to varying working styles, which is similar to an actual work environment.",
    "I liked working with my partner on the poster project. Very good to have another person to bounce ideas off of, and to get their insights into the linkages we explored in class.",
    "There's so much information, and there are so many different oppinions on the topic, that I learned a lot by group working. Maybe not in a strictly academic sense. But a lot, anyways.",
    "I could not have completed the project that we set out to tackle without group assistance.",
    "Group work was the part of this course I disliked the most. Not all group members pulled their weight and it was a very frustrating experience.",
    "The big group project was a poster presentation on a sustainability problem of our choice, for which we were to envision a solution. We turned in proposals and assignments before presenting the final product but received limited feedback on content. The presentation itself was a bit disappointing--professors didn't really engage with us on our ideas. Students (from the class and even some who were just passing through), on the other hand, were really engaged as they came to chat with us. The work itself was a good challenge and thought exercise, but for the amount of effort that goes into presenting a 4x3 poster, the reward was limited.",
    "Good to work with different individuals - leads to better brainstorming.",
    "Advantages - the pooling of expertise and multiple perspectives that are common advantages of groupwork are particularly relevant and helpful given the nature and purpose of the course.Disadvantages - given the relatively limited time for the groupwork, and the busy period it falls in, it was somewhat hard to coordinate efforts.",
    "Deepen the discussion, allow more open debate.",
    "It was good in that it allowed me to learn from my classmates things that they learned that i had missed. As for a disadvantage, it perhaps took more time than if it were attended to by just one person. With that said, i do prefer having worked with a group and believe that the outcome was better that what i would have done if i worked by myself.",
    "I appreciated that in the group work, we could attempt something of real analytical and statistical rigor, while enjoying the company of friends. One of the best parts of the class."

   "question_text": "For students taking this course, what advice would you give them?",
   "comments": [
    "plan accordingly, and most importantly, find a topic you are interested in so you can apply some of the concepts taken from the class to it",
    "If you're a generalist interested in sustainability, this is a good course to whet your appetite for what's out there. If you have specific interests, find another integrative course (eg the Fall water course).Stay on top of the material. Be open to new ideas and perspectives.",
    "Take this course in Fall semester.",
    "This is a difficult questions. Because my advice would be to not take the course. But if no one takes it, the class cannot improve, and I truly think that it will eventually be a good class.So. I don't know. My advice is to demand satisfaction.",
    "Be prepared to put in effort to read from a spectrum of issues and disciplines.",
    "Take this class to broaden your thinking about sustainability as a complex web of issues, where pulling on one thread inevitably tugs a thread elsewhere. The class complexifies and frustrates as much as anything else, although the theoretical tools should help with problem-solving in practice down the road. At least, that's what I hope!",
    "Pay the most attention to the systems thinking lectures and readings. I think all the topics covered in the course should be approached in terms of the concepts in systems theory.And do the readings. They may look like a bunch of random stuff, but they're meaningfull at the individual level.",
    "This class is totally worthless. Unless they completely retrofit the syllabus in future years, I cannot see how it is useful to anyone. It might be intriguing if you haven't had any background thinking in abstract terms or trying to perceive interdisciplinary connections, but if you have the capacity to realize that overfishing has both economic and ecological implications, you can intuitively recognize any of the \"Linkages\" presented in this course.",
    "Do as much of the reading as possible, especially in the first month of classes.",
    "The concepts\/ideas discussed in this class are incredibly interesting and useful to anyone looking to become a more effective environmental\/resource manager. The work load is large and the class is still multidisciplinary, but in a few more years the course will be awesome after some more tweaking.",
    "Use the final poster project to take on something tangible and real, something that's of burning interest to you.",
    "Be prepared for working almost every day of the week. But the course is worthwhile for exposure to different faculty and the diversity of topics explored.",
    "Be prepared for the workload. Engage thoroughly, and you'll get a lot more out of it. Keep an open mind.Linkages is very much a work in progress. Roll with it. Shape the class to your desires.",
    "This course, now for the third year of existence, is most likely going to be reworked again. Delve into the readings as much as possible and ask questions, and continually press for the main points in lecture. As a hands-on exercise to construct your own model of how societies interact and might achieve sustainability, it might be very useful, but that is a narrative not given directly by the class, but achieved with your own work."
