    "Instructor: Katherine Elizabeth Davies \u00a0ONE WORD: SUPERBBRING HER BACK. YALE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE NEEDS CRITICS LIKE TRATTIE !!The most enthusiastic and dedicated critic I have had at Yale hands down.I could go on but I think little else needs to be said.",
    "Instructor: Katherine Elizabeth Davies \u00a0Trattie was an excellent critic. She seemed to take a genuine interest in my project and worked hard to help me develop my own skills within their own framework of how I work and think.",
    "Instructor: Katherine Elizabeth Davies \u00a0Trattie was a wonderful critic in terms of encouraging our own personal investigations, and helping us maintain a high level of excitement and interest in our projects during a very long semester. I might have benefited if she had pushed me further towards a structural\/detail level of resolution for my project.",
    "Instructor: Katherine Elizabeth Davies \u00a0I really enjoyed working with Trattie this past semester. She was consistently available, supportive, and able to evaluate and discuss my project and progress from a variety of viewpoints. In addition, she pushed me to constantly improve upon my work while remaining supportive, a quality that I believe to be very important in a critic.My one critique of Trattie throughout the semester is that she would occassionally offer comments on my work that were difficult to decipher. She would sometimes look at a model or drawing and tell me that she thought it needed improvement but she wouldn't be able to define what aspect of the work needed to be readdressed. These instances may have had more to do with my design process than with anything else but I guess my one piece of advice would be that she strive to make her criticism and advice as specific as possible.Thanks for a great semester!",
    "Instructor: Katherine Elizabeth Davies \u00a0I enjoyed having Trattie; she was encouraging and positive and without pretense. This made her approachable and sympathetic to the ups and downs of the school year. While it may have only been her first year teaching studio alone she has the right motivations, that is, she wants to teach - which leads me to believe with more experience (perhaps to help her gauge the directions and misdirections of student trajectories), she will have a lot to offer.",
    "Instructor: Katherine Elizabeth Davies \u00a0Trattie was very supportive and encouraging through the semester. However, she was seldom critical. Throughout the semester, I knew what ideas were important to me, but I struggled with how to best express them as architectural form. Even at times when I specifically asked for help or expressed discontent about some aspect of my project, Trattie's response was to trust myself and keep going. Instead, it would have been for more helpful if she was able to question what I had and helped me figure out what was important and what were just placeholders for something better. To do this, I think it would be important for Trattie to ask more questions about why particular aspects of a project are the best solution to the problem. In answering these questions it would force us to clarify and improve our ideas.",
    "Instructor: Katherine Elizabeth Davies \u00a0Trattie Davies has easily been the best studio critic I have had thus far. This studio was the most productive for me, and it is largely due to the encouraging attitude of the critic. She performed how I expected a critic should-- to evaluate my work and ideas based on the way I have presented them and give me constructive and practical feedback, encouraging me to push further, and making certain I was pursuing my own idea the entire way through.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0Mark is the best studio critic I have ever had. I did the best work of my life (by far) under his tutelage. He is simultaneously extremely open minded and able to offer very timely 'NO!'s. He kept me moving in my own direction and pushed me further down my own thought process than I've ever been. The only critic that even comes close to teaching as much as Mark would be our TA, Cody.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0I found this semester incredibly valuable and feel lucky to have had Mark as a studio critic. I think we were all grateful to have a critic that pushed us to explore areas of design that we initially might have been uncomfortable with.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0Mark is a good teacher with a set of strong opinions which certainly color the way the studio operates.I enjoyed Mark\u0092s commitment to the discussion of issues that are thoroughly architectural.My main critique would be that Mark seems to prefer judging work as a final product (Mark looks at a drawing or rendering and says, \u0091that\u0092s good, that\u0092s bad\u0092; quite formal critiques) but as a student, I feel that in addition to this final 'product'-based critique, it would be helpful to get a critique of my working process ( i.e. the WAY I am thinking, rather than what I am producing).This is not to say that studio critics should fetishize process, but rather understand that a more well-understood process leads to better formal results. But there are probably enough critics like that at Yale, so Mark's approach is a valuable addition to my education.And that is really a small point, and the things I LOVED about being in this studio far outweigh any critique I could make:Mark was great when asking him specific questions, when there was a choice to be made between certain options, he was very decisive (which is refreshing).Particularly he was able to help me understand better how to make formal decisions, and therefore how to build up, and edit down, a formal language, which is pretty fundamental to architecture.I also appreciate the attention to drawings and renderings, and getting them to be of a better quality. Mark does not settle for 'good enough', which is a valuable lessonin itself.I\u0092m grateful to have had Mark for this studio.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0Mark was a great critic. He really helped me develop my ideas and push me to do something I wouldn't normally be comfortable with. Some of the most valuable days of studio were during our group discussions where he asked us to think about our projects within the larger discourse and talk about one another's in the same terms. Overall he was really helpful and the best critic I've had at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0Mark was great in terms of understanding what you wanted to do and helping you clarify and achieve that.",
    "Instructor: Mark Foster Gage \u00a0Mark is a good designer and section leader. He was willing to hear my ideas and gave good advice as I developed my project. He came in on the weekend a couple of times for desk crits, which I appreciated. I believe he didn't realize I was taking four other courses and consequently couldn't spend 100% of my time on studio.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Often Martin's feedback at deskcrits or pin-ups was very breif. I never knew if it was because he was short on time, was not engaged in the project, or simply so no problem so said very little..",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Martin was a very open critic. He provided objective, on-point criticism based on the specific terms set out by my project. For the most part, he was extremely good at honing in on important issues that needed refinement in my project. As a result, I think my project was better as a result of his criticism.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0Has direct comments as to why certain aspects of your design are working or not working. Can give direction based on those comments that will give you a sense of where you should go without telling you exactly what to do.",
    "Instructor: Martin Finio \u00a0I truly enjoyed working with Martin Finio this semester. His method of teaching encouraged an individual approach to the design problem. This, in turn, helped us develop ways of questioning our own work and setting up criteria for moving forward. I had sometimes wished that his instructions were more specific, but the lack of specificity was ultimately just as instrumental to our growth.One way in which I believe our experience could have been improved in the studio is a stronger demand on production, especially towards the end of the studio semester. Unfortunately, by the third semester, we still did not have a very clear idea of where our work needed to be in advance of the final 1-2 weeks in order to reach the level of polish required for the final presentation. Although there was a definitive shift in studio focus, it would be helpful, I believe, if in the weeks leading up to the final there would be even more specificity and oversight in the development of individual presentations.",
    "Instructor: Mimi C. Hoang \u00a0It was a privilege and an absolute joy to have Mimi as a studio critic. Mimi is highly invested in teaching, and in her students. She consistently gave me the support, the focused attention, and the stream of sharp critical insight that I needed \u0096 this was true during desk crits, pin-ups, as well as studio-wide reviews. She had a clear understanding of my project, my process, and myfacilities\/shortcomings, and would give criticism and assign tasks (both very specific short-term tasks as well as longer-term goals) that pushed me towards an ambitious yet manageable end goal. As a result, I felt that I was steadily progressing throughout the semester, and that I was constantly challenged to improve in areas that needed work. Mimi\u0092s criticisms were always insightful and crystal-clear, but more importantly, they were consistent with past comments, making it easy to understand the comments in the context of the project as a semester-long endeavor (i.e. there was a strong thematic\/narrative continuity with each student). Aside from her teaching strengths, Mimi professionalism is something that should be emulated. She had excellent control of time. And while she was highly punctual coming and leaving, she was always amenable to arriving earlier or going later depending on the needs of the studio. Desk crits were concise and focused, yet never felt rushed. Mimi\u0092s intelligence, expertise, sharp insight, good sense, kindness, professionalism, dedication, and collaborative nature made the semester a total pleasure despite the high demands of studio and other classes. The school is very lucky to have such a fine critic, and I hope that she will teach here for years to come.",
    "Instructor: Mimi C. Hoang \u00a0Mimi Hoang is by far one of the best studio critics in the YSOA. In fact, after some of the woefully inadecuate and unispired instruction I received first year, it was a relief to finally have a critic who was invested in my work, and the work of all of her students. The YSOA should seek out and employ critics of her caliber, who not only show incredible teaching skills, but also are successful designers and architects in their own right.If there was a ever a question or concern, Mimi was always available for her students, often emailing suggestions and ideas at other times. Always punctual, excited, and efficient, she dealt incredibly well with instructing and appealing to students of diverse backgrounds. Never did she insist on her own design agenda or interests over the students, but rather worked to help the student achieve their own ideas and enhance the best aspects of any project.",
    "Instructor: Mimi C. Hoang \u00a0Mimi Hoang is a brilliant critic and she gave me more than I expected to gain from this semester.",
    "Instructor: Mimi C. Hoang \u00a0Mimi is the quickest-thinking critic that I have had. Having discussed her with my fellow students, I know that I'm not alone in my amazement at her ability to read a student's intentions almost instantly from the most basic model or drawing. Reading these intentions leads to guidance that is really helpful and appropriate for the particular student. She also has a sense of humor and treats students like humans and adults.",
    "Instructor: Mimi C. Hoang \u00a0Mimi was incredible. She was devoted to her role as a critic; she was receptive to various ideas and willing to discuss my project in the terms I was hoping to engage with it. She is very quick to understand what I'm trying to achieve, and helpful in offering opportunities that I am missing or possible ways to improve. She is demanding (in a very good way), but also encouraging. This made it easier to really engage with the problem at hand, and more productive in moving through the semester. Mimi is undoubtedly the best critic I have had at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Mimi C. Hoang \u00a0Mimi was an excellent critic in all respects. Her comments were always helpful and insightful- she was able to see what was good about my project and how to push it further. A t the same time, I always felt like I was in control of the design process and that she was there to help me, not to enforce and preconceived ideas or opinions. Her desk crits especially were direct and to the point, and she was wonderful at communicating clearly. I was really glad that she was able to push my design in a direction I might not otherwise have gone- she challenged me in the best way possible.",
    "Instructor: Mimi C. Hoang \u00a0Mimi is one of the best critics I have ever had. With a quick wit, she can understand our designs within a few minutes and offers poignant and specific comments to each student. With a good memory, she remembers each student\u0092s projects well and suggests specific precedents for reference. She boldly encouraged each student to explore and grow out of his\/her own comfort zones and helpedmaking these design challenges a most pleasant experience. Her comments can be very clear and direct or abstract and conceptual depending on the stage of design development. I have always found them appropriate and helpful. Class time is always well organized and efficiently utilized, while no student ever felt rushed or neglected. Most of all, we felt that our time with Mimi has turned us into more critical and capable critics and designers. I appreciate all that I have learned during the past term.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0My section critic allowed for much exploration, and I really appreciated that. However, I wished that there were more interim requirements from him to push us to produce more. I also found the times that he chose for pin-ups and reviews to be very untimely and strange. Pin-ups should not be right before a large studio-wide review. Overall, though, I found him to be an interesting source of inspiration.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter de Bretteville has been a perfect professor for this term in the fact that he provided a foil for each student to look at themselves. I found the semester useful in this fact as I saw my faults and positive attributes in his criticism. Peter let the work flow as it came and was not demanding in a frame of deadlines as much as he was in quality of design. The projects developed in this course where very when developed but less when documented, though I feel that is resultant of the students desire to continue work on the projects and not to created presentation quality work. Overall, very pleased with what I learned and plan to make a point of what shortcomings have become apparent at final review.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0It was difficult to engage with Peter in contemporary architectural issues. Most of the de Bretteville student's buildings (including my own) looked and functioned like 1960's buildings.I thought that Peter could have been a lot more critical during desk-crits. He tended to talk mostly about things that were good about the design and ofter missed, or chose not to talk about, glaring problemsin the project.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0There were times when there was not a very high level of engagement on Peter's part. It was also difficult to get a clear idea of what he expected from you on a weekly basis. Some more specific criticism would have been very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter is difficult to evaluate. For certain aspects of a design, or certain scale buildings, he provides valuable criticism and ideas. But he has a very discrete comfort zone within which he is able to provide worthwhile criticism. To that end, I think he is a much more valuable critic for the second semester studio than for the third.There was a huge disparity in the quality of TA across studios this semester. It is outright absurd that Mark Gage's studio was provided with a TA like Cody Davis, effectively doubling instruction and critique, while Peter DeBretteville was given a TA like Liam Lowry. If Peter continues to teach this semester, then he must be paired with a TA who has the time and effort to provide auxiliary consultations.Liam wasn't a bad TA; if anything, he was entirely normal for a studio TA. Which is to say, largely absent for the duration of the semester except for a token walkthrough before midterm and final reviews. Far too late for any meaningful discussion or advice.Either get rid of studio TAs, or redefine their roles and assign them intelligently.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I wish that Peter had been more critical in our desk crits because I often felt like he was commenting in a narrow way on what I produced instead of offering insights on how to move the project forward. It was difficult to make big design leaps because he often focused the discussion on the forms and physicality of the building, rather than its underlying ideas. I sometimes liked the relative independence he gave us with his hands-off approach, but it could also be frustrating when I really wanted critical feedback to strengthen my design and my ideas.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter is a very knowledgeable architect. It is very clear that he is experienced and had good idea of how to proceed within your project. However, I felt that the work produced in this studio does not adequately represent the amount of work that should be done in a normal studio. Several of the students in our section switched schemes after the mid-review and the work wastherefore not suggestive of a whole semester. Peter was not very effective in helping make quick decisions in order to move on within the scheme in order to create a finished project.I felt that I did not grow as an architect or designer this semester. Peter is great when it comes to practical applications of architecture, but unfortunately I was hoping to be pushed in a more creative direction this semester. I felt that I ended up with a very similar project to last year and to what I have done in undergraduate. Peter, while being encouraging in my project, failed to push me to think outside of my comfort zone to create something that might not have been as successful but at least would have been different.I also felt that Peter did not require as much as the other studio critics. There were several times where he was not in studio. While other critics required several models each desk crit, Peter was satisfied with general discussion of the direction of one\u0092s project. It often makes it easier to produce when one knows his or her critic is expecting it.It is frustrating to know how much money we spend on our education and the ratio of it that goes into a studio that ends up lacking. To not have a professor that can push and challenge the student in directions he or she is not used to seems to defeat the purpose of graduate study. It is upsetting to walk away from a semester of work without being able to clearly definite what one has learned, nor have a project that of which one is proud.While Peter is a very approachable professor and is very interested in each students\u0092 project, I do not feel that this semester was a success nor do I feel that it was at the level that a graduate studio should be."

   "comments": [
    "I expected to be able to develop one concept over the whole semester and continue developing my technical skills as the project demanded. These expectations were met. Martin was very good at challenging ideas in order to strengthen them, and by the end of the semester I did feel that I had a clear idea that was expressed in the building. Cody was an excellent resource as well for technical help.",
    "I was excited to do a large scale, semester long project. It was extremely difficult and rewarding to do the project. I, however, did not anticipate how self-directed much of the work was to be.",
    "My expectations were to formulate my own ideas on the subject matter and weave them into my designs. It was about developing a philosophy and testing it, struggling to develop it\/realize it and bringing it to a clear-enough level of resolution for critics to be able to talk about my project on my terms - ultimately allowing for them to tap into my process and pick up on my intentions for the project.These expectations were well met and I learnt a great deal about what was important and what needed editing in this project - and this studio has allowed me to take a step towards my overall goals as I've come to better understand the way in which I work most effectively and the areas in which there is room for improvement.",
    "My expectations were to have a fullsemester to work on a project, to bring a building design to a higher level of development than I have before, and to explore elements of daylighting in that design. I think the studio met these expectations well.",
    "exceeded.",
    "I've learnedto never have expectations about architecture courses. I was very happy with the content and outline of the project.",
    "The studio was what I thought it would be, no big surprises. This is perhaps because this is not my first \u0091integrated studio\u0092. I thought the little workshops in the first half were not of much use and probably even a waste of time. But I understand why there are there in the contet of \u0091integrated studio\u0092.",
    "I think I had expected to be pushed further on the development of the technical aspects of my building, and I think that, to a certain extent, that is what I miss from my own project. I wish there were more studio-wide requirements on drawings and models that are directly related to the development of the design, as opposed to the emphasis placed on the specialty seminars for Ecotect and daylighting.",
    "Based on the project brief, I expected to have produced a fully-resolved building by final review. While my project was certainly more developed than my first year studio projects, I feel that I could have benefited from investing more time in developing structure, resolving circulation\/egress, elaborating on details, considering environmental strategies, etc (as we were under the impression that this would be the only semester where these aspects of design would be seriously pushed). However, there was certainly great value in having spent much of the second half of the semester clarifying and amplifying the conceptual intent.In terms of personal goals, I expected to improve my model-making facility and expand my vocabulary of visual representation techniques. I felt that I had adequate freedom and guidance to push these in a productive direction.",
    "I had high expectations and I feel they were met and then some. I learned so much and feel so much more comfortable with studio at Yale now.",
    "I had thought that the comprehensive building studio would allow me to delve into the details of the building. Instead, while I was able to revisit the prompt several times over the course of the semester, I sacrificed the deep level of detail as a result of reworking of the project.",
    "I have been known to experiment with too many ideas and not focusing on one in depth; therefore, my ambition for this semester was to learn how to clarify my design concept and translate it into architectural form. At the end of this semester, I gained that ability along with learning how to be more analytical and critical in both studying precedents and during the design process.",
    "For the most part they were met. I am still unconvinced by the studio's insistence on spending the first month on peripheral tasks that are so separate from the design component: do this first, then move here, and go here, mentality. The first month seems utterly different. Have it better integrated - we all know to do case studies, site analysis etc. Having it burdened as an autonomous task makes it less important, rather than more important.",
    "I don't feel like my project was a developed as it could have been, especially considering the time we were given to complete it. I'm not sure why, because I know that I worked every bit as hard this semester as I have in the past, if not harder. I'm not really sure what happened.I think that the initial assignments were not very useful in the way that they were given to us.All of the information from the precedent study should have been COMPILED AND PRINTED with plans and sections AT THE SAME SCALE so that we could constantly refer to built examples of proportion and dimension of spaces that we are familiar with.The 4 x 4 project was totally unnecessary.",
    "The four month timeframe was perfect for this project. Don't change it.",
    "thought that in this studio I would have been able to explore aspects of my project beyond just the initial architectural gesture. That I would get to look at structure, facade, and other details and allow that to help me clarify and strengthen my ideas. On a whole, I felt like the class didn't do much of this. Maybe if there were more studio-wide benchmarks, we would have been encouraged to set the initial parts of the design, form, program, circulation, and allow that to transition into the next stage.",
    "I enjoyed having the opportunity to design a complete building in a holistic way, and the contemporary art museum program was a great stimulus for design and discussion. This has been my favorite studio semester so far.",
    "I appreciated that there was a focus on specific art pieces within the museum, around which to build the concept and the design. I was expecting a studio that was more receptive to artistic ideas, and I think that was true of the actual experience.",
    "My expectations were that this studio would give us the chance to design a project to a further degree of detail and resolution than a typical studio project. In this, my expectations were only partially met. After mid-term, I thought there would be more focus on refining the design concept and developing ideas at a detail scale. This never really happened, as there was a push to take a step back and \u0093radicalize\u0094 our design proposals. In the end, I think this was a productive experience for me even if it did not meet my initial expectations, as it allowed me to really clarify my concept.",
    "I wanted to improve my design and graphic skills. I wanted to conceive a challenging design. I have found satisfactory improvements in all the above areas. Mimi\u0092s instructions have led me in the right direction towards further self-improvement."

   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you-library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. adequate for the fulfillment of the work assigned?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "The resources available are generally very good.However, the DM office could benefit from additional help during crunch time. Their hours (especially being closed the weekened before reviews), are too few. Also, it is impossible to find to-date tutorials for using the 3d printers.",
    "The only complaint I have regarding resources, is that before final review the printers were all having problems.",
    "I think so...I think there were issues with the site model. I think a whole week should be dedicated to that at the start of the studio. It should be part of the requirements and interwoven into the studio...instead of students getting at each others throats about it two days before finals.I wish the library would allow us to check books out for longer. Most libraries at other universities allow for this so I don't understand why the A+A library policy is any different.I'm certain much thought has gone into the decision but perhaps it isn't working as well as initially intended.",
    "Yes",
    "The resources were adequate. I do wish people would not use all the computer lab computers to render around finals time. Sometimes I prefer to work in one of the labs, and it is frustrating when you can't find a computer because one or two students are using the entire lab to render.",
    "Ok, the 3 axis 4x8 mill was down for the MAJORITY of the semester. This simply translates into no large scale milling. It was down for almost the majority of the last semester and I feel a little bit had. I came here in large part for the tools and was sold with an empty promise of availability. Is 20 grand really not worth having the MOST used tool at the school available?",
    "The printing resources at the conclusion of semester seemed inadequate for the number of people trying to print. This was evident in the delays in the print queues for that presentation days.",
    "Yes.",
    "all good",
    "It is unfortunate that not all the studios share Cody as a direct resource. I feel like there were people who desired more software exploration that shied away from it because of the lack of support in the other studios. Particularly when there are tutorials, it would be nice if the whole studio were involved.",
    "Desk space, fabrication labs, software were adequate. 1-day library loan system is a headache, and is inadequate in addressing student needs for meaningful research.",
    "The resources were all great except the library. It is a shame that we can only take out one book at a time when we are expected to be looking at precedents as well as doing research for other elective classes. For Graduate students at Yale not to have access to more than one book is really unfortunate.",
    "The abilities of this schools state-of-the-art systems in fabrication and computer power are lacking in actual staying power. The failure, at whatever end, for the fabrication mills to be fully functional and even a full strength on number of available units is a negating factor when a projects depend on such techniques of making. The collective you are tying students hands when projects have to be sacrificed from means previously available go off-line, meanwhile a high level of presentation quality is still expected. The level of computational power is also what I can only call a joke. This can go one of two ways: the school should either invest capital into at least mid-level professional level computers (not the office jokers full of dustbunnies under our desks) with select stations around the school capable of hauling large data operations when needed (massive make 2ds, file integrations, condensing of oversized pdfs), or make the school system capable of integration with student computer systems on and off campus (the current file systems is littered with random files buried everywhere, the printing setup is next to impossible to use, and vpn is touch and go). One solid system would be nice.",
    "While the facilities at YSOA are incredible - the tech support to fabrication are unparalleled, the library is a different story. The HAAS Library is nothing short of a disaster, the fact that students can only check out 1 book for one night and are fined exorbitant amounts for late fees is simply ridiculous. Also, added the fact that you can only check out one book at a time, the hours are terrible, and the search database is the worst I have ever used. It is insane to have this situation in one of the best universities in the world, where students are forced to by books on amazon or ebay, because they don't trust their own library resources. Given the price for being here and the fact that we are graduate sctudents who should be allowed to check out multiple books for at least a week long period, there shoulod be some reevalutation in this system.",
    "There is a definite shortage of 3d-printers, which forced many of us to outsource our models to be printed and shipped from out-of-state.",
    "Everything was great with the exception of our library which is always frustrating. They just have the most ridiculous ciruclation policies.",
    "The limited number of scanners presented a problem for students pursuing hand drawing. There used to be one scanner on each floor, located in the print room, but last year these scanners were transferred to the lab. Aside from there being only two scanners on the upper floors instead of three, these scanners are now attached to lab computers which are also used by students for other work. I would strongly encourage at least 2 more scanners to be installed for casual use by the students, perhaps even in their former location inside the print rooms.The large mill was down multiple times this semester, leaving students struggling to find time for their milling work. While this did not have an impact on my own studio project, other students were greatly inconvenienced by this instability.",
    "Yes I felt like the resources were available to produce substantial work for this semesters project.",
    "Yes they were.",
    "The library is a real problem. I've accumulated so many fees because I've kept books (one book at a time, a terrible limitation) that I've kept longer than overnight. Everything else, super.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "I had all of the resources I needed.",
    "We need more individual server space. We need more laser cutters. We need more 3D printers and\/or shorter lead times on jobs. In-house 3D printing is still too expensive and often too inconvenient to take advantage of.",
    "I was extremely disappointed by the distribution of resources in the studio. I spoke to our TA for this studio once, for about 2 minutes. Whereas, the Gage studio seemed to have a second critic in Cody. I attended many of the workshops through the semester, but it is very different to have someone extremely knowledge to help you on a week to week basis than it is to have one marathon session about abstract workings of a particular software.",
    "The individual computers at each desk are woefully inadequate for our daily computing needs. And if the promise of a new computer each year is going to be consistently deferred, than the faculty should at least have the courtesy to inform the students so that they can make other preparations. It's unconscionable that the school promises new computers, accepts that portion of our tuition, and then provides us with old computers. At least have the decency to provide a refund and let me buy my own computer, as one of the few students who cannot afford to do so otherwise.",
    "Yes",
    "The workshops were poorly timed, such that it was difficult to attend them, and they were mostly introductions to the software and fabrication. I'm not sure how to fix this, but there is not much time to learn a new software and produce a studio project.",
    "The biggest problem in terms of resources was the lack of controlled temperature in the studio space. Throughout the entire semester, the work environment was way colder than necessary, and even in the winter there was cold air blowing in my face. This really made it an unpleasant work environment that hampered productivity, especially as heavy coats were often necessary. Despite many complaints throughout the semester, these concerns were never addressed."

    "The daylighting workshop was excellent, but the timing is poor. It seemed to kill the studios momentum right after mid-review. Instead I would propose moving it to one or two weeks after mid-review. Contact with more outside experts later in the semester would be great.The juries were excellent. A common critism among them, which I agree with, had to do with the presentation format requirements. Every deadline this semester was accomanied by a board size requirement, which often worked against the content of the project. I don't understand why this school insists on printing one sheet, instead of allowing more room for presentation design. The presentations would be much more exciting if board size was not a requirement. Rather, presentations could have a maximum space allocation depending on where the review is held.",
    "I find desk-crits to be the most valuable type of criticism in the development of a project as they are specific to your project and are a bit less formal than a pin-up.",
    "Most valuable: desk crits.Pin ups were helpful but...too forced with the rest of the studio.They also occurred too frequently at the start of the semester...and I thought the approach whilst valid wasn't as productive for some.THE DAYLIGHTING REVIEW was poorly-timed though a valuable exercise no doubt but after mid-reviews all students (including myself) wanted to think about was how to fix or go about editing\/re-working their projects. It was too formal a presentation too soon. It should have happened either before mid-reviews or between mid-reviews and finals..as spaces materialized in students' projects.Juries were great and their expertise really helped to reveal the strengths and weaknesses present in the designs. The critiques were well-organized and thoughtful.",
    "The least valuable aspects, in my opinion, are the group pin-ups. They waste valuable time and do not provide the kind of feedback that one can get from an individual review with his\/her critic or from a mid-review with invited outside critics. I found the desk-crits and mid-reviews to be the most valuable. During the desk-crit one can discuss the ideas and progress or concerns with the critic in great depth, many times arriving on solutions and ways to proceed. Mid-reviews are great for testing these ideas in front of a larger group of people and getting an outside perspective from invited critics.",
    "I enjoyed my desk-crits the best and think I got the most out of them because I was able to talk at length with one individual about how I wanted my project to progress. I found that environmental considerations could be incorporated more fully into the class beyond the fourth week of the semester.",
    "everything was valuable and well timed. A dream of a course.I wish there was somewhere to talk more about our TA, Cody. I think it does a disservice for the school with a hard line that yale is not a \"vocational school.\" This translates into not ever taking the software learning seriously. 2 hour tutorials do not cut it. There should be a rigorous thourough skills development course. Cody would be the man to take this on. I have never learned so much from one person.",
    "The ratio and timing of desk crits to pin-ups were perfect. The 2 perons pin-ups also work very well. Don't change this aspect of the studio. The lighting design felt forced and didn't really evolve into many people's final projects.",
    "One of the most interesting and valuable days during studio is when we had a class discussion post mid-term to talk about the concepts and ideas of our projects without anything visual. The forced verbalization of our ideas proved more helpful than I initially thought it would be. I think the pin ups of just plans and sections were also helpful. I think having a pin-up day where we pinned up just perspectives and renderings would have also be useful.",
    "work shops",
    "I thought Ecotect stuff occurred too early in the semester, and the daylighting exercise (while valuable) should not have been right after midterms, when we were thinking about more all-encompassing changes.My particular studio's pinups were always untimely, and the timing could be changed. It would have been nice to have pin-ups with other studios once in a while. I think the studios would have been better with more inter-studio crits and assignments.",
    "Desk crits were the most valuable aspect of studio - this is certainly because I had Mimi as my critic (pls refer to gushing praise in question 4). I felt that studio-wide reviews were less successful because the critics (in-house and outside) generally did not have a cohesive and consistent set of expectations\/criteria with which to assess the highly varied body of student work. Some critics pushed technical resolution, others pushed formal invention, others conceptual wholeness, etc. Environmental issues seemed to be ignored en masse. Given that I felt my project was developed to a satisfactory level with respect to the trajectory that my critic had set out for me, it was therefore surprising and disconcerting that any precious time at review had been spent discussing the lack of a secondary means of egress, a \"naive\" structural system, and that 2-foot floor plates are inadequate for services. The agenda for the project could have been made much more clear, and there could have been a much more concerted effort to follow that set of criteria as a studio (both on the part of the critics and the students). For example, if environmental design is going to be a big part of the project, and if we invite Atelier Ten for one-on-one consultations, then we should expect that it's really going to be an integral part of our projects, and that it will be a critera for evaluation.Also, given that we were challenged to develop museum projects that espoused a revolutionary attitude towards issues of art curation\/display, it would have been helpful to invite a few artist (especially sculptors and installation artists) and curators in order to better understand our agenda, possibilities, and constraints. Perhaps more museum visits throughout the semester? I feel that this would be instrumental - it would allow students to see differently at various stages of their own design process.Overall, extremely fruitful semester. Great program, well-chosen site, good pace and excellent variety of assignments (precedent analysis, site analysis, daylighting, environmental consultations, etc.). Thanks Mark and Mimi!",
    "The most valuable aspects of the studio were our group discussions. Also, the week with M.J. Long was really helpful. I had low expectations for the lighting exercise but it was extremely helpful and she was amazing.",
    "Most valuable: groups discussions of what the project meant overall and in each individual case. The real identity of the museum project came out through these discussions as well as the abilities of each member of the class to grasp particular skills and knowledge set into a useful criticism that developed the projects along the way.Least valuable: final jury. It was more show and less actual knowledgeable responses or the ability to read what would make good museum space. I felt as though the student body knew the characteristics of these spaces better than the jurors. The end was a game of attractive pictures and not of light studies, adaptable space, great sequence, or formal compilations to enhance the experience of the art. Might as well have said that you like this \"just because\" That should not be acceptable at this level.",
    "Everything was valuable except for the small assignments like the lighting study, etc. which just wasted time we could have used to develop our projects further.",
    "Pinning up in pairs was very valuable for me this semester. It required a level of finish and elocution that was not always present during desk crits while still maintaining a level of informality where ideas could be freely discussed. The studio-wide pinups were also helpful, especially in advance of the final review. It was very valuable to see my classmates\u0092 work and their individual styles of representation.While I appreciated the daylighting workshop and found the exercise valuable and engaging, I thought that the week after midreview would be better spent evaluating the critics\u0092 comments and re-assessing our work. Otherwise, by the time we come back to the studio project, it is a challenge to reconnect with our work and regain the momentum that we had built up before midreview.",
    "As I recall, one of the most valuable aspects of this studio were group pin-ups because it gave more constructive criticism from many perspectives and also trains me to provide feedback. Secondly, the detective technique in unpacking the ideas of precedents was quite valuable because I was able to use this analytical process on my own project towards the end to test the clarity of my concept and it's impact on my design. I was able to extract many clear diagrams out from my project using this method.The lighting exercise was also something valuable, but I wish that there was a little more time to refine the design before we applied the lighting exercise.",
    "1. Mark's idea of pinning up presentation orders the hour before reviews began, in the morning, is a smart idea that runs laterally to the same goals as a pencils down. That being said, the reality of working a pencils-down is unlikely, the morning alternative is a welcome choice; however ONLY IF all the studio critics partake. It was frustrating to learn that certain critics divulged the information to their students, while others were left in the dark. To make it work, which I think is worth it, make sure to have all studio participate.2. I think it was a little unfair to have one studio with a vastly superior Teaching Assistant (with whom private tutorials and second full desk-crits took place).",
    "For me, pin-ups and juries were more useful than desk-crits.",
    "I thought pinning up in small groups was the most effective aspect of the studio. It allowed us to give and receive criticism as a group and helped us keep up with everyone's work in the studio. I didn't think that the exercises that we did at the start of the semester were entirely worthwhile.",
    "I would favor desk crits over group pinups\/discussions. The group discussions were helpful in the first month of the semester, when we were still bouncing new ideas around, but as our projects developed, it would have been a better use of time to focus on individual issues.",
    "In general, I found the approach to the environmental design component of the studio to be extremely hypocritical. We were asked to seriously consider and encompass energy-saving and sustainable design into our buildings, and had several workshops for this purpose, but at the final juries the topic was never raised and some students who made efforts in this regard were accused of making \u0093cheap\u0094 architecture. I don\u0092t see the point of bothering with the Atelier 10 and daylighting workshops if studio critics, particularly Mark Gage, and guest jurors think that sustainability is such a joke.",
    "Pin-ups, which Mimi only had occasionally, were not nearly as useful as desk crits. The most valuable pin-ups were group discussions with Mimi and the rest of our studio. This format helps the design process as well as the presentation without taking too much time from the work that is not as presentation oriented.",
    "Desk crits and small group pinups with Mimi were the most valuable aspects of the studio. I think that overall the start of the semester was a little too slow in terms of precedent analysis, site analysis, etc. I did find the 2+2 exercise to be hugely beneficial however. I think that the daylighting workshop directly after midterm was the least helpful aspect of the studio, as it ultimately did not help my design move forward in anyway and seemed like a distraction. Similarly, the environmental consulting\/ecotect sessions seemed really poorly integrated and there was no focus from the critics on environmental design issues.",
    "This semester has a more appropriate mix of formal and informal pin-ups in comparison to first year. I find that at the initial brainstorming stage desk-crits are productive, while individual and small group pin-ups are more productive just before major deadlines. I felt that each class period was utilized efficiently, and that my design has progressed along in a steady pace. The environmental workshop taught me useful information and skills, however was not very informative toward design decisions. The lighting workshop was a good exercise that helped with shaking things up a bit in my design. I appreciate that Mimi is a very strong critic who is not only an excellent designer but a true educator. She knew how to communicate to each student in order to induce productive learning based on each student\u0092s strength and weakness. In the end, each student has improved and is able to give helpful and critical comments to his\/her fellow studio mates. Regarding the beginning \u0093idea stage\u0094 of the project, I would like to suggest that it is perhaps useful to begin a project with a slide-show presentation of individual research interests. Through this way, the students may be introduced to the various aspects that needed to be addressed in museum designs. This will also forge beginning discussions\/debates over the museum typology. This can lead to produce designs that are fueled with critical and imperative agendas.",
    "This semester was very fractured. The workshops were not well integrated into the studio and in fact tended to interrupt the flow of the studio. The daylighting study was useful but it was silly to have it after the midreview. Several students changed their designs drastically after the midreview, but the week following we had to use the same design to do a daylighting study. This was not only useless to the new scheme, but also took time away from the student's exploration into his or her new scheme.The first two final pin ups at the beginning of the semester were pointless. It was frustrating to spend money on final prints for simple precedent and site studies. These should not be considered final pin ups."
