   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you want to have a relatively easy class with a broad (but not deep) survey of French literature.",
    "French 170 is a great class. I really enjoyed it. You won't speak so much, since Mme. Girard is so knowledgable and always has so much to say about the texts. It is a lot of work, since we have so much reading, but it is well worth it!",
    "French 170 is exactly an introduction to French lit. Some readings are a bit challenging, and many of them are quite long, but they're all really interesting and compelling (there's a reason why they're classics!), and I would always look forward to reading for homework. There are three essays that you can choose from about 4 questions for the topic, and one main presentation, which was nice because with that amount of reading it would have been unrealistic to expect us to turn something in every class. Overall, I loved our class discussions, madame's presentations on the cultural context, and the literature itself. Definitely recommend.",
    "I would recommend French 170 to anyone looking for a Humanities credit or just interested in continuing the study of French.",
    "I would take it for the major.",
    "The syllabus was really enjoyable to read and I learned a ton from Mme Girard. It ended up being a lot work for me because I came into the class a little behind pace in my comfort withreading written French (so all the readings took a very long time) but I improved my reading a ton!After spending lots of time in grammar focused courses it was so great to finally have the chance to devote your time to studying French lit.",
    "Great lit course, typical French pedagogy but not as harsh.",
    "This is a great class for those who want to get to read French literature in French but who was always afraid of doing so. With Madame Girard, you will find French literature simply fascinating.",
    "It is an overview of French literatre- a ton of reading and then class is a mix of some discussion and listening to Madame Girard talk. I would recommend it if you are very interested in French literature\/are willing to do the reading."
