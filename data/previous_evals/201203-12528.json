   "comments": [
    "Only take this for a grade if you have time for it. You really get out what you put in: the TAs are brilliant and the professor is a genius, but you have to work for it if you want to benefit from the class. TONS of people take it Credit\/D. I wish I had.",
    "Absolutely my favorite history course at Yale. Lectures were unbelievably good! My section was totally fascinating (get Aner Barzilay if you can!) Winter is fantastic and assessments are fair. The workload, however, is absurd: far more reading than is possible to do\/than should be assigned. That said, TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a lot of work (I think an unnecessary amount), but the lectures and discussions are worth it.",
    "This is a good class for anyone who enjoys history AS A DISCIPLINE because you study many historian's interpretations rather than the history itself. It would also be good to take Credit\/D.",
    "Professor Winter was amazing. Each lecture was like story time, but with a deep philosophical or historical point that made you think. It is a lot of reading, but the lectures are great and interesting and I highly recommend this course!",
    "Great class - having taken several classes on military, war theory, and WWII, this class was most exciting to me because of Prof. Winter's emphasis on the \"human\" side of war - literature, memorials, poetry, the Holocaust, veterans. It was something we never talk about and I was thrilled to learn more about to complement a war history education. Great professor, great class. Loved his old-school style of lecture - no fancy powerpoint for the most part, and Winter is without a doubt one of the best public speakers\/lectors I've heard. Makes history into a story, lectures impressively without any notes and not a hitch. Great, truly educational class. It's classes like these that make me truly appreciate the privilege of a Yale education.",
    "Amazing lecture. Enjoyable and important for every Yale student to take.",
    "I would definitely recommend everyone at Yale to take this class. Everyone should learn about Europe in one of the most important historic periods. More than that, you also learn about ways to look at a historical question and see more from different perspective. I traded Cold War for this and never regret my decision. Reading is impossible to catch up with, so taking D\/Fail may be a good idea. This is my fifth class and I have a wonderful time without being worried about the reading.",
    "YES! One of the best courses you'll take at Yale.",
    "You learn about the world wars under the definition of \"Total War\" - what makes them significant, who influenced their trajectory, and what emerges from them? Unbelievable course, highly recommended, do the reading.",
    "Clear, logical presentation of and argument about the history of the two world wars and the interwar period. i loved that the class was more about an argument and story telling of history as opposed to just facts. Professor Winter is delightful to listen to and makes the information easy to understand",
    "This course is great for the following reasons: passionate professor, an approach to history that does not involved memorizing dates and facts but DOES involve ethical issues, critical thinking, literature, art, and looking at situations from many different points of view, and an easy class to do credit\/d\/fail.If you like history or want to learn about WWI-WWII, you should definitely take this course. The reading is overwhelming, but you can get by without doing all of it. It's not an easy course to get an A in, but if you take it credit\/d\/fail you almost certainly will get a passing grade because 1\/3 of your grade is section participation, 1\/3 is a paper, and 1\/3 is the final. Basically, show up to section\/the final and write the paper and you will pass.The lectures are great and inspiring, but Winter talks very fast and some of his arguments are a little unclear. They still are fantastic lectures though. I think everyone should take this course!",
    "This course is pretty good, but definitely take it Credit\/D. The exam was TOTALLY not bad at all, but section is terrifying when you don't have the time to do all 500 pages of reading for the week. Apparently the lecture was much better in years past, because this year it was very hard to follow at times. There were a lot of history majors in the course and I, as an English major, had a very hard time getting on their level.",
    "Definitely take this class! Great lectures. Not too much a work. A big final but very study-able. A lot of reading but not always necessary.",
    "YES! TAKE IT!",
    "Would recommend. One of the best lectures I've taken at Yale. Interesting period made more interesting by Winter. You don't have to do all the reading; no one does.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS -- best history lecture I have taken at Yale. Professor Winter is the most incredible lecturer.",
    "Amazing course. Winter provides a survey of WWI, WWII, the years in between, and their commemoration. It's a tragic, enlightening, and at times beautiful course, filled with all of the very best and the very worst of humanity. Take it. Take it take it take it. And then take what Winter says, and remember it's not in the past, and form your own ideas, because the history Winter discusses lives on today.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's fantastic. Jay Winter is an incredible, incredible lecturer (although quite opinionated, and it definitely shows) and this class is worth it just to listen to him talk. Reading is quite heavy and the reading responses (6 through the semester) get to be a drag, but still manageable. Workload: one midterm paper (for which you need to read two additional books), one final, and participation, equally weighted. The final was very fair, and I thought the grading throughout the course was fair as well. BUT, this class was seriously awesome, unless you already know everything there is to know about WWs I& II. And maybe even then. Possibly the best history lecture I've taken at Yale (and at this point, I've taken most of the ones that are supposed to be \"the best\").",
    "I think Total War is an essential course to take as a History major. These events shaped society as we know it today, and Professor Winter is an amazing lecturer. While there is a fair amount of reading, it is very interesting. The workload is manageable.",
    "Yes. You should know this material to be an educated citizen.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. No one knows Europe like Jay Winter. You'll learn so much and enjoy every second of it.",
    "Take this class before yougraduate. It will re-shape your understanding of the two most important events of the 20th century, and Professor Winter's lectures are incredible. The assessments in the class aren't too bad. Caution: there is WAY too much reading; even the most die-hard of students won't be able to do all of it.",
    "I would highly recommend HIST 273 to another student. Professor Winter is one of the most engaging and inspiring professors at Yale. The course provides students with a thorough understanding of \"Total War\"-a condition that still influences us today. If you want to understand 20th Century history and 21st Century politics, this is an extraordinarily valuable course. It is a very heavy reading course, however, the reading is illuminating and compelling. The course assumes that you have some understanding of WWI and WWII. It teaches you the \"art of historical argumentation\" by putting the ideas of different historians in conversation with one other. This results in a thought provoking and intellectually stimulating experience.",
    "Definitely take this class. The work gets a little intense around the midterm and there's no way to finish all the reading but the lectures are fabulous and the final is very manageable. If you are interested in the cultural aspects of WWI\/WWII and the interwar years, or just history in general, it's a must.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student.",
    "YES TAKE IT. THE READING IS FANTASTIC, THE LECTURES ARE AMAZING, ANER'S SECTION WAS THE BOMB. you can't go wrong! you learn SO much and it's so interesting and important!",
    "I think anyone and everyone would enjoy this course. It was my first history class at Yale and I wish I had taken more with Professor Winter!",
    "This was the best course I have taken at Yale.I don't mean it was my favorite course, or the one I enjoyed the most. I mean that it is the one that made an impact on me, that taught me new things and made me think about old things in a completely new light. Professor Winter's lectures are so polished and passionate and gripping that I couldn't not pay attention if I'd wanted to. If you have any interest at all in WWI or WWII, you owe it to yourself to take this class.Fair warning: it's a lot of work. The readings are often very interesting (sometimes moving), but the reading load is much more appropriate to a graduate level course than an undergrad one, and unless you're taking four credits with light workloads in the other classes, there's just no way to do all of it (you'll be much happier if you accept this fact and just try to do as much as you can).But seriously---do yourself a favor and take this class.",
    "Total War is an awesome class with a truly awesome professor. The workload is totally manageable -- just a midterm paper and a final (for which you get questions in advance). But Jay Winter is really a gem. I'm not a history major, but there were times I left his class wishing I was.If you're not a history major, consider taking this class credit\/d. There is a ton of reading, a ton of material, and in my opinion, some assumption of prior knowledge (which I didn't have). Without the pressure of getting graded, you'll have the joy of sitting in class and hearing Winter...and you won't feel pressure to talk in what might be a useless section.",
    "I would recommend this class. This class does only cover Europe during this time period, but it extends its simply historic nature. You learn a lot about how the war has effected the people of those countries, and how the war still carries on to today.",
    "YES! By far the best course I've taken in my 3.5 years here.",
    "This course will be one of your more memorable courses if you decide to take it. The lectures are fantastic - Prof. Winter is an extremely gifted storyteller and lecturer - and the readings will greatly broaden your understanding of the topic. The workload is undeniably heavy, but well worth the time it demands. If you have an interest in thisdynamic period of history, at the very least shop the class. I don't think you'll regret it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone vaguely interested in the material, on the strength of Professor Winter's lectures alone. His lectures on war commemoration were particularly strong, and it was nice to be able to complement that with our midterm essay assignment on two WWI novels\/memoirs of our choice. Be warned that there's a lot of reading, as well as bi-weekly reading responses, so this is not the lowest workload history lecture out there. But I would say it's definitely worth it.",
    "Absolutely recommended. A must take for History majors.",
    "Overall, a really fun course that is worth the reading - it's got me thinking about majoring in history.",
    "If you are looking for a chronology or cold hard facts about the world wars and interwar years, this is not it. A TON of reading, more cultural than totally military focused as a class. Interesting lectures and focused on the 30 year period but there are other classes about this time period that are better. Maybe take it credit D so you don't have to do the reading and can enjoy the lectures.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. Lectures consisted mainly of Professor Winter restating his thesis, but he hardly ever provided a convincing body of historical evidence to support it. Some of the readings are good, but the reading load is overwhelming--this was the first class, in three years at Yale, for which I could not do all the reading. If you know anything about World War I and World War II, you'll probably come out of the class feeling that you haven't learned much."
