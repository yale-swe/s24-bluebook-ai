    "great class. Italian is a fun and beautiful language.Take it with Chris if you can. He is very helpful and understanding.",
    "I would recommend the course because it is a good language to learn, but I would recommend Annie Ruderman if she is teaching it.",
    "An amazing course of italian where you leave with a good ability to speak italian. I would recommend it to another student, because I felt it really enriched my knowledge of languages and of culture.",
    "Yes, it's a great language.",
    "Pretty easy-going. The work is constant throughout the semester. I would recommend it. If you want a gentle intro language experience, Italian is the class for you.",
    "Yes definitely. It's a great class.",
    "This was, in my opinion, the most ideal course to have every day. There was never a day when I didn't enjoy the class, and always felt challenged yet confident. The staff were wonderful, the events they organizedwere always fun, and I feel thoroughly confident in my ability to read, write, and speak Italian after taking this course.",
    "I would recommend this language course to anyone. It is fun, exciting, and does not require as much work as other languages. I mean, in what other class do you get to watch movies on \"culture days\" and throw parties involving sheet cake and oven baked nachos?"
