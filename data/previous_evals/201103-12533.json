    "If you want to understand life, the universe, and everything, a solid cultural education in Hollywood movies is probably the place to start. This class was a highlight of my semester; Professor Connor is great, the syllabus can't be beat (Jaws, Pulp Fiction, Saving Private Ryan), and it really teaches you how to do serious writing and thinking about film.",
    "It was a very good course with great lectures and interesting readings. However, the workload was quite extensive and the essay's were definitely a struggle. I would recommend to anyone who is interested in the subject and not afraid of putting in the time and effort that it requires.",
    "Yes definitely!",
    "If you are interested in the hollywood industry (excuse me, \"the industry\") then I would absolutely recommend this class. Ultimately, I would say that this class is a lot more about the industry than it is about a formal analysis of contemporary film. While we do cover some aspects of style (in the context of industrial shifts and innovations) be prepared to focus your attention on hollywood studios, corporate histories, brand identities, and the consequences of technology, rather than mise en scene or aesthetics in and of themselves.",
    "Contemporary Hollywood is challenging, but very rewarding. There's a lot of reading, lectures can be confusing, and the papers are difficult. But you will learn a LOT about the film business since 1975, and JD is a brilliant guy. He knows SO MUCH about film.JD expects a lot of his students (this course truly felt like a graduate course at times) but you can get through it.It's a fantastic way to learn about how art and industry collide, how agents and studio execs influence filmmaking and how auteur directors fought them. JD's love of corporate allegory (arguing, for example, that the 1989 Tim Burton BATMAN is an allegory for Time and Warner's merger, avoiding the evil Paramount of the Joker) can get a bit annoying, but in the end is tolerable.This was my hardest class, but it's not impossible. I ended up doing pretty well on the final paper. Just be prepared for a sizable amount of reading and to be confused\/frustrated by JD's lectures at times.",
    "Absolutely take this course. Professor Connor is incredible and extremely knowledgeable on contemporary film. The class is more business and industry based (I finally figured out why this is an HSAR course--it does trace the history of the industry) than analysis, but I found it to be an interesting change of pace from most humanity classes. But be warned, this course is not easy or \"fluffy\" (as the name and syllabus might imply). Professor Connor uses very dense language and sources in lecture, and further there is a lot of reading. Also, the essay topics and final will really push you to know your shit. This class is for someone who really wants to learn more about the film industry, not someone who wants to watch twilight and get credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in contemporary Hollywood. Each week touches on a certain aspect of Hollywood as it has evolved from 1975 (Jaws and the blockbuster) to present-day. So, for example, one week would cover the \"high concept\" movies of the 80s whereas another would discuss Disney and animation. I think this class, more than anyother I've seen at Yale, is more relevant to the contemporary entertainment industry -- so if that is something you're interested in, you will definitely appreciate this course. J.D. is also a really knowledgeable teacher (seriously, he seems to know everything about Hollywood) and poses interesting arguments about films and their production backgrounds. There is quite a bit of reading and the final exam requires a lot of studying, but all in all I highly recommend this course.",
    "This class is amazingly fun and interesting. I would say that for anyone interested in the economic or business market of an arts industry this is an amazing class. It is broad in its appeal and would be an easy fit for History of Art, Theater, Economics, and Film Studies majors. It is one of the few History of Art classes that focuses on the production and business surrounding the industry. Also Prof. Connor\u0092s lectures make it so you do not have to have any film or art studies background to take the course. Every week you watch a film that is then the center focus of the following lectures that are focused on a certain subject.I would recommend this class to anyone with the knowledge that THIS IS NOT A GUT COURSE! There are readings, screenings, and lectures that all cannot be missed. This is not a course where you can choose to read or attend lecture. Though the work is not overwhelming it is not at all something that should be written off.",
    "This class is one that everyone should take credit-d. Those that didn't found the final overwhelming (because there is a lot of reading to review). Unless you are a huge movie buff AND like to read a lot AND have the time to do the reading fairly, then take the class credit d."
