    "Try to get into a section with advanced students who like to participate, or else it will get to be annoying after a while being the only person who really says anything. I would recommend this only if you really feel unconfident in your speaking and writing skills, otherwise it may be a bit too easy, and you should take 160 or 170 instead.",
    "French 150 is a good class and necessary if you want to continue learning French at Yale. Participation in class is important, and homework is mostly comprised of reading and writing formal essays. This class helped me with my writing and the grammar was a good review although the extent to which we did grammar became tedious at times. Other than that, this class is not challenging if you did fine in French 140, but let it be said that the workload is large. On the plus side you don\u00c2\u00b4t have class every day."
