   "comments": [
    "Knowledge of Spanish culture and a great grasp on the basics of the Spanish language.",
    "This class was a wonderful introduction to Spanish language and culture, covering the L1 and L2 syllabus at a rapid but manageable pace. It covers a year in one semester, and the workload matches that tall order. I was amazed at the amount of material we covered and that we were nevertheless able to remember and access it throughout the semester.",
    "I feel very confident in the grasp of Spanish that I gained over the course of the semester. While I have a long way to go, SPAN 125 set me on a strong trajectory towards fluency that I look forward to continuing in future semesters.",
    "I feel really happy with the amount of Spanish I learned in this class. It definitely gives you a solid foundation in the language that will carry you through further study.",
    "This is one of the best language classes ever. It's the best way to learn a language. My speaking skills were made so much better.",
    "I achieved an intermediate level understanding of the Spanish language, but I also learned a lot about the culture and history of different Spanish-speaking countries. This is a fantastic course on every level, and it covers a vast amount of content in record time!",
    "Taking this course gave me the ability to speak Spanish at a level that was high enough to converse with native speakers at a basic level. I learned an immense amount of Spanish vocabulary and pretty much every regularly used conjugation of verbs I need to know. With this level of knowledge in Spanish, I think learning Spanish in the future will be smooth and relatively easy.",
    "This course helped me to develop basic reading, speaking, and writing skills in Spanish.",
    "SPAN125 offers precisely what its title suggests: a comprehensive and accelerated introduction to the Spanish language. While the course maintains a brisk pace, the material never becomes overbearing, and the subject build from first principles (learning the alphabet) to more complete grammar and ultimately to reading a couple short stories and watching a film by the end of the semester. Two of the more remarkable features of the course help define its character. The first is that it is conducted in Spanish from the first (or at latest, the second) day, almost giving the experience of daily immersion and quickly encouraging students to learn through listening and adaptation on top of the formal grammar lessons. The second is the variety of material contained in the course. Despite the level being elementary, students receive a wide range of exposures to the language, reinforcing basic concepts and encouraging (requiring) students to speak in Spanish. Such exposures also form an introduction to Spanish culture (such as with popular music, famous poets, a visit to the Y.U.A.G., and the various topics students individually present). The most noteworthy aspect, however, is the amount of progress the class achieves in a single semester. Realizing how much Spanish you have learned in just thirteen weeks is both a fulfilling moment and an inspiring impetus for future study. The class serves as a testament to quality and efficient language education and to the superb instruction of Profesora Sab-Colom. Profesora Sab-Colom crafts the course from the first day into a complete and successful learning experience. Under her guidance, SPAN125 provides a sturdy groundwork in Spanish language and culture.",
    "Intensive Spanish covers the first two levels of beginner Spanish. it's very comprehensive in terms of grammar and basic vocabulary, and you definitely leave the course with conversation-level skills. I was also able to practice legal vocabulary by choosing subjects for ora presentations that would be useful for work. I highly recommend for anyone who is serious about learning Spanish for their legal career."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Meeting every monring was a strength.",
    "Profesora Sab does an incredible job with the syllabus and daily structure of the class. She keeps it energetic and new, even with two hours every day to fill, and organizes the material in a thoughtful, engaging manner. I would personally be interested in learning more about the different types of dialects in the Spanish-speaking world and incorporating that on some minor level throughout the semester, though we already cover a huge amount of material and there might not be space available for that additional instruction.",
    "This is a very strong class that got all the students participating and speaking Spanish, which is the best way to learn. Perhaps I would have benefitted from more role-playing exercises, which were the most useful opportunities to push my language skills to the next level.",
    "Strengths: (1) Material is taught in an accessible way. (2) Profesora Lourdes is amazing! (3) A good amount of cultural instruction is also included. (4) Extra resources such as movies, stories, and in-class activities are really well-planned and engaging. (3) Especially if followed immediately by L3 or intensive intermediate, this class gives you a working knowledge of Spanish. Weaknesses: (1) The speed of the course is such that a day or two off can throw you off for a while.",
    "The pedagogy is outstanding. Professor Lourdes Sab is one of the best professors I have every had in any class, and she clearly cares deeply about the course and her students. The class doesn't really have any weaknesses - it's like any other intensive language class in that it meets 2 hours every morning and requires a high commitment, but I would consider that a strength as you learn an amazing amount and the energy and talent of the professor makes it easy to show up and be excited day in and day out.",
    "The course spends a lot of time on Spanish and Latinx culture, which is great and necessary, but it sometimes felt like it was getting in the way of learning Spanish grammar and vocabulary rather than helping. This is also written from the opinion of someone who was raised in the Puerto Rican culture. As a result, I've spent a lot of time learning about Latinx cultures throughout my life and a lot of it seemed redundant. Getting tested on this material rather than grammar and vocabulary also seemed odd and unfair.",
    "This course was overall very strong. The homework was useful, as were the in-class assignments. The instructor was very organized and used class time effectively.",
    "The primary strength of this course is setting and achieving the relativity ambitious goal of teaching elementary Spanish in one semester. To this end, the course relies on a very structured and well thought-out syllabus and maintaining a dependable pace. Even with the imperative of moving quickly between grammar subjects and vocabulary units, the course nevertheless manages to incorporate Spanish literature, music, art, and film into a more complete cultural experience. Clearly the course structure and material have been time-tested and continually tweaked over the semesters of its offering. It is then difficult to imagine ways to improve the course in material, instruction, or design. It is what it is. An inherent difficulty might be the slightly off-set rates at which students learn the grammar and develop speaking skills, but that is pretty unavoidable, and the student interaction through small groups is one of the course features. The course has been defined by a specific objective, and reaching it is simply its best quality."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "If you are looking for a one semester crash course in Spanish, this is the course for you. We learned more than I ever expected!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is serious about becoming proficient in Spanish. It is a lot of Spanish in your day-to-day schedule, but if you stay relatively on top of the work and participate in class activities, the workload remains manageable even as the pace picks up throughout the semester. Profesora Sab is a wonderful teacher who is genuinely excited to teach Spanish and keeps the class engaging with new, creative activities. It's hard, but it's rewarding.",
    "If you're taking this class to solely fulfill language requirements faster and pick up 2 credits \"fast,\" you should reconsider. The course is A LOT of work, it's unkind to those unfamiliar with some Spanish words in the beginning, nightly homework can range from 1 hr on a good night to 3 (especially in the beginning), and 2 hours in the morning can drag. Take this class only if you truly want to learn Spanish and are willingly to put in the time. That said, going to class wasn't dreadful because Professor Lourdes was excellent at teaching the material and class activities were enjoyable (once you start being able to actually understand the Spanish). Should you decide to take this course, don't hesitate to ask questions and prep for class. I wouldn't expect an \"A\". By the grace of God I think I might be pulling out an \"A-\" but a \"B\" or \"B+\" is more reasonable to expect (if you're not falling behind). I'd consider taking this course credit\/d\/fail if I could start all over again. All in all this was a great class with a wonderful professor, but it was difficult and very work-intensive. It certainly was a great source of stress, but Credit\/D and a positive attitude should be able to overcome that.",
    "An amazing introduction to Spanish. It is not an easy class, and the workload is such that you will be spending a lot of time focusing on Spanish even outside the daily 2-hour class period. Don't take it if you aren't up for the commitment, but if you want to take learning Spanish seriously, then this is the best class for you. Of particular note is Lourdes Sab's superb brilliance in organizing the class and offering support throughout the semester.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who has extensive experience with another romance language only. The other people in the class are likely to be a combination of polyglots, native speakers of French or Italian, or at least good students of other romance languages. You should have the experience necessary going into it. If you have taken and done well with a romance language before, you will be fine! It is a lot of work, so structure your other classes accordingly. The work pays off in the amount that you learn! Having studied French for most of my life with wonderful teachers and professors, I can confidently say that SPAN 125 will teach you more language with more confidence than you are likely to have gained in the classroom before in such a short time period.",
    "If you want to learn Spanish, this is the way to do it.",
    "Unconditionally yes! I had an excellent experience in this class, and the opportunity to gain an intimate understanding of another culture and language is one that no one should pass up.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who has learned another language to an intermediate level or higher in the past, especially if it was a romance language. The pace is fast and there's a decent amount of work involved. It will teach you how to speak in full Spanish conversations about novel topics, which is a great accomplishment and a great feat that you must want. If you're doing this for a language requirement, make sure you really want it. Most people in this class took a language at Yale previously and took this one because they REALLY wanted to learn the language, rather than just fulfill a requirement.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It does demand a lot of time because it is intensive and meets five days a week, but it fulfills its objective of teaching introductory Spanish.",
    "Deciding whether or not to take SPAN125 has a straightforward litmus test: are you willing to commit the time to learn the basics of Spanish in a single semester? The course is dependable and does not presume to do anything more or anything less than provide a foundational level of Spanish knowledge and an enthusiastic introduction into Spanish culture. It achieves that goal. Progress entails the small satisfactions of understanding a new piece of grammar or recognizing a new vocabulary word (There are not necessarily the revelatory moments found in some seminars.) The course pace certainly can seem vigorous, but it never speeds up drastically (or stops for that matter.) Two other considerations follow: First, taking the course with Profesora Sab-Como is the right choice. Her ability to guide absolute beginners to passable conversation and workable comprehension is admirable, and she models her own speaking grammar and pace over the course of the semester to incorporate the new topics being covered. While she maintains strong expectations for class attendance, homework, and assessments, such measures are necessary to stay on track. She is always available and willing to help or meet to discuss any aspect of the course or review a lesson. Seeing Profesora Sab-Colom each morning was always an upbeat start to the day. Second, the course is worth two credits, which means exactly what that implies. There is a lot to learn. Nevertheless, the homework, while always present, usually assigned nightly and never insignificant, is very stead. One can always work a little ahead if necessary, and no single concept is that difficult to grasp. The only way this course could be considered worth two others in workload is in the number of hours in the classroom (nearly two hours per day is a large commitment) and that being successful in the course likely will require consistent review of earlier concepts.",
    "Yes! I loved the class, even though it was a lot of work and got monotonous at times--but that's what it takes in a beginner's language class and it honestly was much more engaging than I had expected.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I learned way more Spanish than I believed possible in just a semester, and I felt relatively confident in my abilities by the end of the course, especially compared to other language courses I have taken at Yale. Also, though professor Lourdes definitely challenges you, she is very supportive and knows what she's doing as a Spanish teacher.",
    "Yes."
