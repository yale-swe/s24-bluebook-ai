   "comments": [
    "Discussed and debated the history and benefits\/drawbacks of globalization. Globalization as it relates to increased trade and trade agreements, financial globalization, global value chains, China's historical and anticipated impact on globalization, technology's impact, etc.",
    "Globalization and trade couldnt be clearer by now",
    "Debating Globalization left me with a profound understanding of the history, processes, topics and issues of international integration. I feel much better prepared to understand the debates as well as arguments surrounding globalization--a preparation that will remain invaluable in my future.",
    "I learned about the key challenges and risks faced by the process of global interdependence. More specifically, I learned to take a theoretical look at globalization (i.e. Ricardo comparative advantage and Milanovic's elephant curve).",
    "Strong understanding of trade economics and a frame of reference for interpreting current events.",
    "I came into this class with little knowledge about trade and international economics, and I learned a lot about the key principles of these fields throughout the course. However, what really distinguished the seminar to me is the time-relevance of the information that we covered. Professor Zedillo is certainly at the cutting edge of academic discourse about globalization, and through his perspective provided in class, his assigned reading list, and his guest lecturers, I was very impressed by the material that was covered. I left the class with a much more thorough understanding of trade and international economics than I had before, and I feel much more confident about my own thoughts and opinions regarding trade and international commerce. I also gained valuable experience by doing a 30-45 minute presentation with a partner on an important topic that really interested me, and the reading responses provided an excellent context for me to gain skills in concisely formulating opinions and takeaways from complex material.",
    "A broad understanding of the intracacies of globalization",
    "not much - I withdrew"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is a challenging and engaging seminar that allowed me to use the lens of our general economic training at Yale and envision how it can be practically applied to the political climates we have to contend with today",
    "Strengths: interesting subject matter, decent organization of the subject matter, insightful professor, fascinating reading material. Weaknesses: little feedback given to students on their work, too much emphasis on student presentations, not enough time allotted for discussion\/debate in class, no direction given on final paper.",
    "Discussions are always interesting and topics are very well chosen",
    "Debating Globalization's greatest strength was Professor Zedillo's academic excellence and charismatic teaching. He challenged the class but kept the learning climate fun. His comprehensive knowledge of the issues discussed was astonishing and inspired his students to excel at every point.",
    "S: -Chad Bown was great -The in-class students presentations were well done and helpful -The readings were relevant -Professor Zedillo's moderating at the IMF conference really cool to experience as a student of his W: -Lectures can lack direction -Grading was often done late, which made it hard to gauge what they were looking for in reading responses",
    "Not to be glib, but we did not seem to debate globalization as much as I would like. The only class discussion took place in questions for other students at the end of each class, and because of that it seemed like some ideas were taken for granted.",
    "The material and the expertise of the professor was the greatest asset. However Zedillo is not a professor but a practitioner. Most of the learning I did on my own. Basically the class is a lecturer by Zedillo with student presentations. There isn't debating. Nonetheless, you can get a lot from the material and Zedillo's guests and he himself. However, do not expect to hone certain writing or thinking skills. You will learn many different facets of globalization. This is a good course, but it is a course for those driven and willing to put in the workload. You will learn a lot of content but don't expect to develop specific skills.",
    "1. As far as the actual in-class experience goes, the student-led presentations were probably the defining feature that distinguishes the format of this course from others. Although Professor Zedillo always opened the course with a discussion about the weekly topic, it felt more like an introduction than a comprehensive overview; the actual meat of the material was covered by the students. I actually ended up really appreciating this aspect of the course. Students generally stepped up and gave very high quality presentations, and the experience of preparing the presentation when it was my turn was certainly invaluable for my own growth as a student. I also felt like the presentations allowed me to get to know the other students in the class better, even if we didn't interact as much personally. Professor Zedillo also chimed in during the presentations to provide insights and complement students' perspectives. 2. I personally really appreciated the weekly reading responses, even though they were a lot of work. They forced me to constantly engage with the readings rather than passively consume them and provided a setting in which I could regularly express and update my opinions about the key topics that we discussed. Looking back, I think the reading responses were the key factor that drove my learning this semester.",
    "Very compelling class",
    "a LOT of background knowledge was assumed, very little was explained, and class was very drug-out and uninteresting"

   "comments": [
    "yes",
    "Would recommend if the subject matter interests you. Does not depend on prior knowledge of the subject, although some basic understanding of international economics would help. Should know going in though that there is little feedback for students' work and most of class time taken up by other students' presentations rather than discussion\/debating the material amongst each other or with Zedillo.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, teaching is awesome and topics are carefully selected",
    "Yes! Professor Zedillo is an incredibly well spoken and knowledgeable economist who seemingly effortlessly provides tremendous insight on many of the world's most pressing globalization questions and concerns today. -- You won't be disappointed!",
    "If you are at all concerned about globalization, this class is a must take. You will enjoy fascinating readings, remarkable lectures and fun presentations.",
    "It's an interesting course to take on globalization with one of THE intellectual leaders of the topic in the world. Readings are lengthy and there is a weekly reading response to complete. The final assignment is a research paper that makes up a bulk of your grade. Professor Z can be difficult to follow at times and struggles with relating what he says to the material, but there is still much to gain from this course if you're diligent and commit significant time to it.",
    "A good course on trade economics. Hard economic concepts and a lot of readings, but the payoff is substantial in terms of interpreting the news and understanding international trade. Professor Zedillo is a fountain of knowledge, just try to keep up!",
    "Go if you want to learn about globalization. It does a good job. Zedillo is not particularly soft or cushy when it comes to teaching style. He is used to high expectations and a high level of presentation and understanding of the material. This is what makes students better. He does not provide feedback, whatsoever. The TA obviously varies, but make sure to develop a strong relationship with her or him in order to get more out of the class. He could provide you more feedback, but I guess that the think the busy life of Zedillo must make his priority not his students and you can sense that fact hashing out with the TA. That said, you will learn the trends of globalization, so this is relevant to anyone who want to dive in. Zedillo is knowledgeable, but good luck trying to get access to him outside of class.",
    "I would indeed recommend this course to another student. There are a few reasons why. First, the class provided a very thorough overview of key topics in globalization and economic transformation. I had very little knowledge of trade and international economics before this course, and although I would by no means consider myself an expert now, I feel like I have a much better understanding of the issues at play. This has been great for me, as it has given me the opportunity to formulate opinions about important topics that I previously felt too uninformed to engage with. Second, Professor Zedillo is truly at the cutting edge of discourse and thought about globalization. As a result, we were exposed to very recent and important material. This extended beyond the readings and also included conferences and guest lecturers provided by key figures in the field. Professor Zedillo is also very passionate and knowledgeable about the material at hand, and he has clearly devoted a substantial amount of time to studying it. As a result, when he offered his own thoughts and opinions, they were always very carefully thought out and robust. Finally, I also appreciated the insights Professor Zedillo was able to provide based on his own experiences as a public official. For example, I greatly appreciated his discussion of his experiences with the economic crises of the 1990s. That being said, I would add that a substantial chunk of my learning occurred outside the classroom, in particular through covering the assigned readings and required responses. Hence, I believe that this course is to some extent a \"you get out of it what you put into it\" kind of situation.",
    "Yes, great professor, and fantastic themes",
    "If you already know a lot about the subject, especially historical info, then take it, but otherwise don't"
