   "comments": [
    "Literature",
    "This course provides a foundation for the trends of western writing in modernity. It also helped me improve my writing skills for literature.",
    "I read many various works of European literature from Don Quixote to the modern day.",
    "I learned the common themes of modern literature.",
    "Not many. I developed (on my own) a better ability to effectively read and analyze texts.",
    "In Directed Studies: Literature, I gained an introductory knowledge into the works and themes of modern literature from the shattering and scattering of Petrarch to the dislocations of time and space in Cervantes and the sibilance of Milton and Tolstoy. This course has demonstrated to me the progression of literature and the way that it responds to other currents of thought. On a different, more \"practical\", level, this course taught me how to read a text in a deeper and more profound way. The seminars and essays forced me to go beyond a superficial understanding of the plot and characters and to focus, instead, on one aspect of what I read and explain it as fully as I could.",
    "I learned more about the analysis of novels and poetry through class discussion and the professor had useful unique insights about the specific historical background, style and themes of the given texts.",
    "I think my ability to trace major themes throughout a work of literature improved. I think my writing also improved. I also got better at drawing connections between works."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great texts, but still not satisfied because of the change in syllabus",
    "This course did a fantastic job in allowing us to develop a framework for understanding literature through section and lecture. I would only say that I wish some of the lectures more clearly emphasized the historical development of writing vis a vis consciousness.",
    "The strengths are a lot of good readings, and a well-organized system of lectures and sections. I don't see ways it could be improved.",
    "Some of the second semester DS Lit books are not as riveting as the others. But the quality of the lectures has maintained its high standards. The class can be improved by having more structure (for example, the prof can make students prepare introduction to the texts\/thoughts on specific topics\/their favorite parts of the text).",
    "This class promoted a pedagogy of white male authorship to an extent that was remarkable. The texts were promoted as inherently superior to other \"non-Canonized\" works and it was taken for granted that from the texts we would be able to derive universally applicable meaning although the authorship was almost entirely white and male. We were not asked much in terms of analyzation. We were simply questioned about the text in roundabout ways to arrive at conclusions that had already been reached by Professor Bloch.",
    "The reading list of this course is one of its greatest strengths. In no other class that I am aware of can one read Petrarch, Shakespeare, Goethe, Wordsworth, Chekhov, and Walcott in one semester. Moreover, the quality of the professors ensures that one walks away from the course with a profound appreciation for the texts that we read. The greatest weakness of this course is the disconnect between the works. Oftentimes, the lectures failed to explain how the texts build upon each other. Reading Wordsworth after reading Milton, for example, could have been an excellent opportunity to discuss the poets' differing views on the role of poetry and of rhyme. Such a discussion, however, was lacking.",
    "I enjoyed reading most of the works this semester. I think there were a few that could not be done justice in only 2 classes. This was especially true of Omeros given how complex it was. However, I think this was an important work to be included in the syllabus and therefore more time and more professors specializing in the subject should be devoted to it."

   "comments": [
    "The choice to be in, and then to stay in, DS is a personal choice.",
    "Yes. Professor Bloch strikes you with his insight, and the course readings are enjoyable as well.",
    "Yes take DS Literature. You will learn and read about literature than you probably ever will in a class. The combination of section and lecture ensures that you engage with the works while hearing for scholars on these works. Definitely try to get Bloch as an instructor as well. He will absolutely bring up some of the most interesting ideas regarding these texts that will change the way you perceive literature and also live life.",
    "Yes, it is a good and rigorous course in European literature.",
    "Definitely consider continuing DS - the second semester introduces many modern and even postmodern themes that are extremely interesting, while at the same time preserving many elements of the first semester.",
    "You can get a delicate taste of modernism in this class. And Don Quixote, Wordsworth, Madame Bovary, and To the Lighthouse cannot be missed.",
    "I would not reccomend this course to others. The works on the syllabus are interesting enough but not handled correctly by the set up of the class itself beyond the required readings.",
    "For any lover of literature, Directed Studies: Literature is an excellent course to take. The breadth of the course and the seminar style of discussion ensures that it is a rewarding experience.",
    "I would recommend this course because the in-depth class discussion and the knowledgeable teaching gave me a very good understanding of the texts we read.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed the literature that we read in this course."
