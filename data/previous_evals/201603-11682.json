    "This class was great at teaching me the fundamentals of Spanish.",
    "The course is well-taught and well-organized. I think it would be cool if there was more opportunity to practice speaking.",
    "I would recommend more practice tests-- in particular, more practice with the oral and auditory exam in class. Even though we were exposed to those structures before, we weren't really exposed to different accents or comprehensive photographs.",

    "Absolutely! If you want to learn Spanish this is a great place to do it. Also not that heavy of a course-load.",
