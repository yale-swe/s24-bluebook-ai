    "I would recommend this to another student. I would say that this is a very good overarching review of the major economic change in Japanese history from the early modern Tokugawa period until the present. We get to read a series of interesting articles and discuss current, salient topics. If the student has any interest in Japan, I would say it's very helpful.",
    "the teacher had health problems and was only here for three classes. He is obviously a brilliant man, but I think it's time for him to retire. we wanted to take a class with one of japan's top economists, not substitutes who knew nothing about the economy of japan. I don't think i got much out of this class, simply because we didn't actually touch upon many of the issues (due to his absence).",
    "Not worth going to this semester because the prof was sick the entire time, but otherwise not bad for an econ seminar -- you get to learn a lot more about economic history and not just numbers and figures.",
    "Professor Hamada became ill at the beginning of the semester and three weeks of classes were canceled and, for the rest of the semester, the class was turned into a guest lecture series on Japan (not only economics, but everything related to Japan). The final grade is decided by one 14 page paper turned in at the end of semester, on which I receive little help because professor is sick and there is no TA.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in the subject.",
    "Low work level class with regard to reading. However, you will not always understand the concepts presented. Should not take this course without a background in economics."
