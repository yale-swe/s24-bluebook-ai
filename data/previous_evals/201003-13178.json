   "comments": [
    "DS Philosophy provides a great introduction to the ancient Greek, Roman, and early Christian philosophical (and theological) texts. The lectures in DS Philosophy are (for the most part) particularly excellent, even inspiring, and I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in Philosophy. Professor Harte is a very knowledgable section leader, but she dominates class discussions and leaves little room for student interaction and debate.",
    "Almost all of the works that you read in this class give you a very interesting perspective on a number of fundamental questions. However the lectures and the sections are devoted virtually entirely to the construction of the arguments as opposed to their significance or how we might apply them to our own lives. In my opinion, what makes these works worth reading is the substance, or message, of their arguments, not the structure. It is important to understand the structure of the argument yet I do not believe that doing so is mutually exclusive with discussing its significance.",
    "Directed Studies is an intensely rewarding class for anyone who loves reading, analysis, and nuance. I would strongly recommend it.",
    "It's an intro to ancient philosophy. Take it if you are really interested in the subject, or if you really want to take ds in general. Leave time out of your week to parse over what you went through--barreling through text doesn't work here.",
    "DS philosophy is tough first semester, but I have hopes of it getting better. If you keep up with the reading, it can be very fulfilling.",
    "DS Philosophy aims to introduce students to the practice of analyzing philosophical arguments by directing them to read, discuss, and write on the works of the first Western philosophers. The course is a difficult one, but I would recommend it to students who are ready to read tough texts and sharpen their analytical skills. Students may even survive the reading long enough to experience the fun of challenging and reshaping their preconceptions.",
    "fast-paced, very good overview, go for it; this is a section you want!",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "This section of Directed Studies is definitely the one I enjoyed the most. We are able to cover a broad range of subjects and philosophical schools with both depth and content. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a general introductory course in ancient philosophy and is willing to be enrolled in a very intensive program."
