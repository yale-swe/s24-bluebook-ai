   "comments": [
    "I learned about the history of Brazil dating from Portuguese colonization in 1500, the history of African slave trade and how long slavery took to end, the military government, and more. The class dealt a lot with slavery because it plagued Brazil for such a long time. It's a sad history of \"500 years of tomorrows\" - tomorrows that tragically, never arrive.",
    "Brazil has a truly fascinating history, and there is so much to the society that I never even knew about. I learned to do the historian's craft of interpreting motives and seeing the effects of different events. I learned how to challenge experts. I learned how to write more clearly.",
    "I think the primary skill I gained from this course was how to critically analyze a source and dissect it from the actual historical content it was explaining. The TF, Ricardo, was fantastic in this regard - in section, he continually challenged us to consider the source material and authors in order to better understand the historiography of Brazilian history but also to develop our own analytical skills as scholars of history.",
    "HIST 361 gave me a deep insight into the story of Brazil as nation, former empire and fledgling world power. 500 years of history in one class is often difficult to achieve, but HIST 361 did it wonderfully.",
    "This was an excellent survey course about Brazil's 500 year history. I loved every second of it! I feel like I got a good handle on the most important moments in Brazil's trajectory from colony to empire to democracy. At the same time, we focused in-depth in those select moments and were given a great look into the country's rich history.",
    "I learned soo much in this class. Initially, I was worried about the idea of learning 500 years of Brazilian history but after taking the class, I realized how much I enjoyed and how much I learned.",
    "Broad understanding of Brazilian history. Reading, writing, and research skills.",
    "The course taught me a lot of about Brazil. Since I've taken other history courses I don't feel I learned any substantial new skills, but the course definitely helped me sharpen my research and writing skills.",
    "really fun course",
    "Thanks to my awesome TF, Ricardo, I not only learned much about Brazil, but I also learned much about the study of History as well.",
    "I learned a lot about the slave trade and the nature of slavery in Brazil from the 1500s all the way to the end of the 1800s. I also learned a lot about Brazil's political, social and cultural history from 1500 to 20th century. The skills I developed include critical thinking and critical reading of historical texts and constructive challenging of ideas. I also improved in developing a thesis while working on the final paper. I gained more insight into the nature and perception of race in Brazil and in the wider world."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Nothing. This was a great course and the professor covered everything in lecture that he put on the exam.",
    "Great class",
    "The lectures were extremely engaging, Professor Schwartz is a master of this subject. That being said, history of the 19th century on went really quickly, with very little on modern Brazilian history. Talking about current events in-depth like the impeachment would have been really interesting. Also, information about the foundations of things of cultural significance like Capoiera, Samba, and Bossa Nova would have been really engaging. Section could have been improved a lot - we had lots of reading each week but hardly discussed it. It made it seem like I shouldn't have done the readings, or read them a less detail. More discussion of main themes, rather than individuals, so few of which actually ended up on the exams.",
    "One problem I had with this course was that what we were supposed to be reading was very unclear. The syllabus, the reading schedule, the professor and the TA all had conflicting information, so we never knew exactly what we were supposed to be focusing on and what we would be tested on.",
    "Strengths: The course covers a wide expanse of time without glossing over anything important. Weaknesses: The course readings varied in how useful and relevant they were. Some books went untouched.",
    "The strength of the course would definitely be Professor Schwartz's ability to tell Brazil's 500-year history in a compelling and fascinating manner. He has a natural aptitude for describing the characters and events of Brazilian history in such a way that one feels as if one is actually speaking with or witnessing these people and events firsthand. The weakness might lie in that some areas of Brazilian history received deeper treatment than others, or that some parts of the course felt more rushed. The first half was definitely more drawn out than the second, for example.",
    "The lectures were brilliant and really tied together to leave a clear story in one's mind. However, the sections were not as useful as they could have been in exploring what the lectures couldn't investigate- focusing on the readings (which didn't really help too much) instead.",
    "The course appeared to have been set up with much of the framework coming from a textbook and the lectures as details\/color. The textbook, however, was not great. If the course is to remain so set up, I would recommend a different book. Alternatively, if more material could be covered in the lecture, perhaps we could rely less on the book and have more primary source readings. The syllabus was also somewhat misleading with regard to the essay. Since students plan their schedules from the beginning of the semester. I would have been able to devote more time to the essay had I known exactly when it was due and how many pages it was. The lectures also may have been easier to understand thematically if we had stayed on schedule.",
    "It is alot of information to learn but main themes are tested so it wasn't too bad in that sense. The strength of this course has to be Professor Schwartz, who knows so much about Brazilian history and is so helpful and active in making sure you learn the material.",
    "This was a great history class! I liked the format--midterm, short paper, and final--that allowed us to engage with the material in different ways without making our workload too difficult. I always loved Prof. Schwartz's lectures and his excitement and passion about Brazil's history. He made the class a lot of fun and it was a class I always looked forward to.",
    "Solid, straightforward lecture with good material and structure. Readings were sometimes dull.",
    "Prof. Schwartz is an excellent lecturer, and the material is very interesting! Could be improved by rushing less at the end and more info on the mid to late 20th century. I liked the flexibility of the paper to research a personal topic of interest within Brazilian history.",
    "I think the course does an excellent job of explaining Brazil and its history especially because the professor and my TA were both very enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and engaged. On the other hand, a lot of the reading was dull and repetitive.",
    "Professor Schwartz does a very good job of referring specific events in Brazilian history to broader themes",
    "shorter readings that are more interesting and less basic",
    "Great survey course of Brazilian History. Very solid class; not too much work.",
    "The lectures are amazing and the lecture slides are incredibly engaging. The pictures and the slides were a definite strength of this course. Towards the end of the semester, when we began with the 1900s, the lectures began speeding up. This may have been because of a lot of information had to be covered. However, I was lost during those lectures."

   "comments": [
    "I would 100% recommend this class. The professor gives great lectures (you do not have to do all the readings!) and the material is interesting even if you aren't a history major.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Professor Schwartz is awesome, the best lecturer I had for the past four year at Yale history department. TA Ricardo is super intellectual and a great leader for our section.",
    "If you're at all interested in Brazil, take this course. It's easy to see Brazil as a country with a beautiful coastline, Bossa Nova, and Carnaval. It's so important to realize that Brazil was one of the last countries to abolish slavery, it had (and basically still has) a strong military presence, and that racial distribution in Brazil is rooted in slavery. Apart from the content, Professor Schwartz is an encyclopedia when it comes to Brazilian history - we even read some of his own work. Section doesn't really do the course justice, but the lectures alone are extremely engaging and the tests aren't too difficult. One midterm, weekly section with short reading assignments, one 4-6 pg. paper that can be on anything, and a final worth 40%. I did all of the readings for this course but really didn't need to\/not in as much detail. I took section in Portuguese, which was a great way to practice using the language and made memorizing vocab a lot easier. Take this!",
    "Yes. Professor Schwartz was incredibly knowledgeable, passionate and clear in lectures. I truly felt like I came out of this course knowing heaps more about Brazil. The exams were straightforward and fair. This was probably the best survey history course that I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. International history is so important, and as someone who might be interested in diplomacy\/global affairs, its essential for me to understand the context of the regions I want to engage. However, anyone can gain a lot from this course, especially non-international students who want a less America-centric perspective.",
    "I'd recommend History of Brazil to another student. I wasn't actually too interested in Brazilian history going in (I needed another geographic region for my major), but I was pleasantly surprised the main strength of the course would definitely be Professor Schwartz's ability to tell the history of Brazil in an interesting, engaging manner. My TA, Ricardo, was also fantastic! One of the best sections I've ever had at Yale, by far. Ricardo really challenged us to think critically about both Brazilian history and the sources we were reading, which is a skill I will definitely keep for the rest of my studies here at Yale. The only big assignment was a short paper, which isn't graded to harshly and comes with adequate feedback\/help from Professor Schwartz himself and\/or from the TAs. The exams (a midterm and a final) were both reasonable, except watch out for the matching section. Professor Schwartz also has a tendency to go over by about 5 minutes 90% of the time, so keep that in mind when scheduling this class into your course schedule!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You learn a lot without an inordinate amount of work, and the material is really varied and interesting. Do come to all the lectures; they're all worth it.",
    "Not my favorite history lecture I've taken at Yale, but a good introduction to South American history.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I loved learning about the story of Brazil. It is an extremely fascinating and unique one. Professor Schwartz gives an engaging and captivating lecture each time and the supplementary reading materials are similarly interesting. Even if you haven't taken any history courses in Latin America, this is a perfect introduction. Take this course!!",
    "This was a great course. Brazil has a fascinating history, and Professor Schwartz is a FANTASTIC lecturer. The TA's are great and the workload is totally manageable. This is a must take class.",
    "Take this course if you want general background on Brazilian history. Schwartz is an amazing lecturer and even though my TA wasn't the best Schwartz made this an amazing experience for me.",
    "I would definitely recommend History of Brazil! It is an interesting topic that most people know little about, and Prof. Schwartz always delivers great lectures and is super excited about the topics. It's not a high-workload class--just a midterm, 4-6 page paper, and final, and it's not too hard to do well in the class. I learned a lot and didn't stress too much about the workload, so it was really an ideal class!",
    "Yes, if you want to learn about Brazil or South America. It's a solid, straightforward lecture with not too much reading\/work.",
    "Good class, especially if you're looking for a not so challenging humanities credit! Prof. Schwartz is awesome, and the material is interesting without being super dense. Brazilian history is something I knew nothing about coming into the class, and now know a lot!",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this course if you're interested in Brazil. Also a good course if you're interested in questions of race and identity or political history in general. However, if none of those topics interest you the course may get dull for you.",
    "Solid course, not too much work. Good for a 5th class",
    "Interesting way to get a 300 out of the way for Hist majors. Schwartz is a knowledgeable and passionate professor.",
    "really fun course! Stuart is the best, great teacher who really cares about the material and his students - really interesting material.",
    "Yes! This is a great history class. I had close to no prior knowledge of Brazil and had taken only one history (freshman) seminar before taking this class, and I enjoyed it very much. I learned a lot about Brazil and the slave trade that I did not know before. It is also a great entry to learning about South America. The workload is not too demanding and the readings are interesting. Lecture is never boring because all presentations are essentially picture slideshows."
