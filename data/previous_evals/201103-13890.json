   "comments": [
    "This course provides excellent and in-depth observations into the engendered canon of East Asian art. Yes, I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student, whether or not it applied to his\/her major. I truly learned a great deal.",
    "yes",
    "Like many of the other students in this class, I took Gender in East Asian Art History in order to fulfill my \"non-Western\" requirement for the HSAR major. The course is structured thematically (rather than chronologically) around types of art\/artists\/patrons in pre-modern China, Japan, and Korea, with a focus on the role that women did (or did not) have in those societies. I was largely dissatisfied with the course; the readings were exceptionally long and largely repetitive, the class discussions were stilted and awkward, and the course focused far more on poetry than it did on any substantial visual art. Despite having excellent examples of Japanese and Chinese art at YUAG we never once went to look at it. In addition, Professor Li had a student prepare a \"presentation\" every week on the reading, which essentially boiled down to having a student lead the entire two hour seminar each week. This was both incredibly stressful for the presenters and very boring for the rest of the class. I would have much rather had the discussion guided by someone with actual knowledge of the subject matter. Overall, this is the weakest class I have taken in the HSAR department during my time at Yale; I would strongly advise against taking it. Find another Asian Art History course instead.",
    "The topic is very specific, so make sure you are interested in BOTH east asian art and women studies\/gender issues. However, if you are interested, I find the course covered so very interesting materials.",
    "It is what it is and gets repetitive",
    "Great course especially if you like learning history through artwork. Much stronger on that side of things than on the gender studies side.",
    "lots of reading, but very interesting articles-- keep up with the reading and responses and you'll be fine. loved a lot of the articles and shared a few with friends."
