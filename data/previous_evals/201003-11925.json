    "Yes-if you enjoy learning more about the EU and its history.",
    "Don't think about it. Take it. It might not be the best idea when you are stuck with massive graphs detailing European countries' steel and coal production in the 1940's, but when you get to read and discuss interesting authors such as Hix, Vachudova, Caldwell, and Professor Cameron himself, you will realize what a great opportunity this is for getting a comprehensive view of what the European Union is, what it is not, what it should be, and why it is not so as of yet.",
    "I definitely recommend if you have an interest in learning more about Europe.",
    "The course is a great overview of EU's integration, structure and contemporary issues. However, it's only interesting if you're already intrigued by the EU prior to taking the class - it won't suddenly spur your interest in EU matters and it may be hard for you to relate to the discussions if you're not from a European country. The readings at the beginning of the semester are really tedious and boring, later on they get better, so they will leave you with an overall positive impression of the reading material.",
    "If you are interested in the history, development, and current issues of the EU, take this class. You will leave with a very solid understanding of how the various institutions interact and the historical developments that led to their current forms. Professor Cameron is incredibly knowledgeable and is always willing to help you outside of class. Don't expect to much open discussion or debate. It's quite a bit of work with lots of reading and weekly critical responses, but you learn a lot.",
    "Take it if you want a comprehensive overview of the EU.",
    "The one caveat is that this is fairly economics-rich, but for anyone interested in contemporary Europe who isn't afraid of lots of readings and weekly reading responses, I'd say go for it.",
    "This course is ok. It's very representative of the EU: boring, not a lot happening, a lot of talking but interesting. There are weekly reading responses and a final paper or take home exam. The reading responses are very easy. You can write about whatever and often need to do only a couple of pages of the reading to do them. This does not really encourage you to do all the reading. The reading is quite interesting, but not super engaging. Seminars themselves are mostly the prof talking and some students making comments. The emphasis is a lot of the economic side. The paper gives you the opportunity to explore a issue you're interested in more. Easy grade.",
    "The class is a pretty generic seminar on EU. You don't need to know much about the EU since the prof spends 25-30% of each class lecturing on it. There are a medium amount of readings, and they are fairly diverse. Not much work... just weekly reading responses and a final paper or take home exam."
