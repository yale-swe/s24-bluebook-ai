    "It's a good course to start learning Spanish. I can't speak for other professors who teach this course, but Ricardo Monsalve Carvajal is fantastic at what he does. He was probably my favorite professor of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student because it was educational and really helped develop my spanish speaking skills. It was a class that I would recommend to those who have a small understanding of spanish, although it might be difficult for those who have absolutely no spanish experience.",
    "introduction to spanish, but not easy. not unless they needed to fulfill a requirement",
    "The class is good, not great. I am not a language person myself, so it is difficult for me to fall in love with a language class in general. The grading scale is difficult, so just beware that in taking the class, it is incredibly difficult to pull off an A.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 110 section 7 because of Professor Monsalve's approach to learning the language in a natural way."
