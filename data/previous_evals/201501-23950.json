    "A very good overview of the internet, the laws that govern it, and the future of technology in this sector - very applicable to the real world and to current events. I would take it again!",
    "This is listed as a seminar course, but is taught a bit more like a weekly, 2-hour long lecture course. Nevertheless, the material is interesting, relevant, and you learn a lot more about the things you hear about on the news everyday",
    "If you like the material, you'll like this class. If this isn't your thing, dont take it. Great field trips.",
    "I'd recommend to students interested in the topic who don't mind lecture based classes.",
    "Excellent course, Professor Polner is great about explaining complex technological and law material in easy terms!"
