    "The class itself is not the most enjoyable thing in the world, but you will learn an incredible amount and it is very worth it at the end. It will equip you to understand many of the world trade issues. This class is only about trade not about international finance at all.",
    "Overall, an insightful class though there were some classes in which the model presented was pretty intuitive. Will I use any of this after I graduate? Probably not, but it is interesting to look at how our world is shaped by trade. I wish it were at a different time because i found myself falling asleep in some classes. I also wish that we had branched beyond just studying the models. The exams are much harder than you would expect them to be; in class, you learn by the model and by the graphs, but the exams are much more abstract and most students ended up running out of time. Definitely not an easy A, but the workload isn't much.",
    "A class with great material that could make an argument to be an econ major requirement. Only very basic math required, with an emphasis on graphical representation and a conceptual understanding of the models. 5-10 hour problem sets due every 2 weeks (but graded for real so need real effort!), 2 difficult exams but an overall generous curve. 9am can be a struggle but for what it's worth Schott is a great guy and will try his best to keep you engaged and entertained.",
    "If you're intrigued by international trade at all, take it! However, the classes an psets are VERY model-heavy, so if you're not into that, don't.",
    "Take this class. Schott is an amazing professor and very charismatic. He's an excellent lecturer and does his best to make a 9am feel fun and interesting. This class also generally focuses on the intuition behind trade economics which makes it much more approachable. It's much more important to understand the implications of trade models, rather than mindlessly plugging in numbers and Schott does and amazing job of capturing that idea.",
    "TAKE IT!!!!",
    "It is a great course to understand Economic concepts applied to a global scale. It was very interesting because it examined the different assumptions each model made to get to its conclusion and observed the interactions between countries, within the country, across industries, etc. I felt the course was extremely informative and I learned a lot.",
    "Yes if you're interested in international trade and\/or if you're an econ major.",
    "Great lecture and very engaging material. Most interesting class at Yale thus far",
    "Definitely take this class if Professor Schott is teaching. His lectures are always interesting and engaging and the class teaches you a lot about trade and real world events. The course load is not too heavy and the psets get easier as the semester goes on. The tests are challenging but not impossible if you go through the concepts with a friend.",
    "Definitely take this class!!! It's the hardest econ class I've taken at Yale but it's been worth it! The material is really interesting!!",
    "If you can deal with a 9 am class which isnot too easy and requires work, take it. Else if you aren't interest in a few models of international trade, nope don't",
    "This is a great class. Challenging but manageable if you put the time into it. The exams, especially the midterm, are quite difficult, so prepare for that.",
    "ECON 184 is an interesting course that covers many of the models economists use when analyzing international trade. I would recommend ECON 184 to another student, as it is a topic that is both interesting and relevant. Professor Schott does a great job leveraging his experience from teaching MBA courses, drawing on real-world examples. Although it takes time and effort to truly understand the models, there is a great payoff, and it also helps you review concepts from Intro Micro.",
    "This class is the best economics class you can take if you have even the most remote interest in trade. Professor Schott is fantastic. Shop around a bit for a good TA because he\/she is essential to doing well. But, you will not regret this class.",
    "I definitely recommend. Not an easy class, and tests could be quite difficult. But, Professor Schott is amazing, and makes the class interesting and funny. Like, take the class if you're willing to put in the work, and I definitely recommend that you go to class, because Schott is by far the best Econ professor I've had here.",
    "One of the best Econ classes I've ever taken at Yale! 9 am classes are a struggle, but the class is still definitely worth it. Professor Schott is an incredible lecturer and the material is definitely very interesting. For sure, take it!",
    "Not like other economics classes, much more qualitative and more easily applicable to real life. Lectures are super engaging and Prof. Schott is funny and interesting. If you want to read The Economist and Foreign Affairs or want to take an econ class that isn't math heavy or just want to know more about int'l dynamics, this is the class.",
    "Best econ class I've taken, would definitely recommend.",
    "Great introduction to international trade theory",
    "YES would recommend this class! Econ 184 was an excellent course and very applicable to real global economic situations. It was really fascinating to learn about how we are able to model globalization and trade. Now I am able to read NYT articles on economics with fresh eyes and a better understanding of what it all means. However, it did take time for me to adjust and really internalize what the models meant. Be prepared to spend time on sitting down and really understanding whats going on with each model, if you find that you're not picking it up right away. Getting more practice on choosing which model to apply in different situations would have been appreciated. Some psets are really hard, be prepared to spend a decent amount of time on some of them. Everyone does badly on the first one, but you get to drop a pset. First half of the course is harder than the second half imo.",
    "ECON 184 is a great class for students interested in understanding the theory behind current events. While we often encounter news about currency movements or industrialization of different countries, this class dives in beyond the superficial level."
