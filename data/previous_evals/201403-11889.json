   "comments": [
    "Bulls**ty thesis and not even a gut. Wouldn't really recommend. Then again not tons of work",
    "Yes I would recommend. It changes my worldview of many staff.",
    "I would recommend this class. The material is different from anything else I've experienced when discussing evolutionary biology, especially considering the social context. Like I said, the lectures are worthwhile, except towards the end when the class largely focused on art theory and philosophy.",
    "I would recommend the course, the content provides a novel framework for analyzing art and other cultural forms.",
    "The Evolution of Beauty class shows you that science can actually show, rather than disprove, how beauty came to be and how amazing it really is, without demeaning the humanities or calling human emotion stupid. It also teaches you to question things you always took for granted, as well as teach you a lot of really rad new stuff that you never thought to think about, like why birds are colorful or why males aren't actually inherently better than females. I would definitely recommend it, but to make sure they're okay with more biology than art, just cuz the professor is a biologist (ornithologist) who is interested in humanities, after all.",
    "Absolutely take this course!",
    "Definitely recommend. Best course I've taken.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student only if it were better organized in the future. It is my understanding, sadly, that this was a one-time course. Still, it seemed kind of self-gratuitous to Prum. Rather than clearly delineating the grading for the course, or anything like that, the point seemed to be for Prum to have a platform to hash out his ideas. The course, then, seemed to be designed to benefit Prum far more than it was to benefit the students.",
    "Hope that this material becomes available to students in future courses if not in this particular venue. An important reminder to challenge the blind absorption of material that so many lectures encourage. Changed the way I look at the world.",
    "Very interesting! A lot of new ideas combining different fields that I don't always experience in other classes. Could have been a bit more organized in terms of exams and assignments but good overall.",
    "A good experience. It will revolutionize how you see evolutionary biology. Whether Prum's theories are real or not, it doesn't matter. Yale is about changing how you think and this class presents a whole new framework not only to see evolutionary biology and art, but also to see the world. I feel more nimble and intelligent because of the changes I had to make to my thinking and all the new things I learned. Don't expect to learn facts, though there will be plenty. Do expect to learn something completely new and have to apply it. Reminded me a little of freshman organic chemistry style-wise.",
    "This was an amazing course. Professor Prum is a good lecturer, the discussion sections were small, well planned, and contained good discussion. The information was new and thought provoking. The only downside was that some of the topics, mainly during the second half of the semester, were scattered and did not have as much of an overarching theme as those of the first half. If this class is ever taught again (which I would highly recommend), the topics concerning art were slightly unpolished. If this course was given again, I would HIGHLY recommend it to other students",
    "It is a great course to audit but I'm not entirely sure if it's one you'd want to take for a letter grade.",
    "If you're interested in the intersection of art, beauty, and evolution, you should take this class. Be prepared to be introduced to a lot of new ideas, some of which you may not agree with. This class is a great intro to the ideas of evolution and art, and the lectures are interesting.",
    "If you're interested in hearing Prum talk about his own ideas take this course. If not steer clear of it and opt for a different class on evolution. Great material, semi-difficult tests, and little work required.",
    "I would summarize E&EB 190 as a course that describes a new hypothesis in evolutionary biology that has been extrapolated to create a new lens with which to view art and beauty. It is interesting -- although Professor Prum's theory forms the weakest part of the class. I would recommend the course to another student.",
    "This was a neat course. You will learn some interesting ways of looking at the development of certain traits and behaviors in humans and other creatures of the world. Some of the class seems very speculative and perhaps not fully formed though (I believe the theories presented by Prum are still in a stage of development).",
    "If you're interested in an interdisciplinary (science and humanities) approach to the study of aesthetics, this is the class for you.",
    "I would only recommend it as a very easy fifth class where you plan to learn 3 or 4 interesting ideas that you might be able to bring up in conversation sometime, and lots and lots of BS. Huge claims made with little to no support; contortions of evidence just to fit his theory, etc. I remember Prum saying, for example, as evidence for his explanation of the evolution of male same-sex behavior, that homosexual males are usually more attractive than heterosexual males, using as support nothing more than a picture of Ricky martin. to make this kind of claim in what is allegedly a science course in a prestigious university I think borders on irresponsible. however, when he sticks to what he knows (i.e. NOT AESTHETICS OR PHILOSOPHY), Prum teaches interesting material and is well worth listening to.",
    "Awesome course! Mind-blowing connections between art and science.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. You don't know how much you will miss if you don't take this class. Prof. Prum will use evolution theory to explain human art, and you can use it to explain many other things after taking this course. However, one thing I really don't like about this class is that prof. Prum taught this amazing material by reading his slides in his class. I don't think it was effective because his slides were long and he read them really fast. It was hard to catch up. The time when I realized how amazing the course was was when I was studying for the exams.",
    "Since this class was part of the DeVane Lecture Series, it won't be offered again. It was a really interesting chance to hear all of Prum's ideas, but it probably would have been a good class to Credit\/D because it just wasn't that focused on the teaching\/grading - it was much more focused on getting his life's work out into the world and convincing people, because the lecture was also open to the public. His ideas are really interesting, some of them are very out there and some of them aren't, and I'd definitely recommend talking to him about them. He's incredibly passionate about his theories (and about birds), which makes him really fun to listen to.",
    "An interesting class but it was a lot more art history heavy than I expected",
    "No, one of the worst taught classes I've ever taken at Yale. The course was about the professor's new theory of evolution, which was kind of cool, except the tests were just us regurgitating to him exactly what he though about evolution and he presented all of this as though it were fact with little to no evidence. The first few lectures, when he talked about birds, were fine because he knew what he was talking about, but as he got into primate and human sexuality, some of the stuff he said in lectures and the assigned readings were just plain wrong. Prum left no time for questions during class, his lecture slides were just complete walls of text, often with glaring typos, which signals to me that he put little time into preparing for the class. The TAs gave absolutely no feedback on the midterm-- 7 short essays and not one single word was written on my test, just points I'd earned, so you had no idea what was right or wrong. I took it Credit\/D and it was still really, really annoying. Just a thorn in your side and I can't imagine how much more annoyed I would have been at how bad the professor and TAs were if I'd been taking it for a grade\/",
    "I would definitely recommend a revised version of this class, one that focuses on the science-based evolutionary side, and not the evolution of art side. This could easily be a science class! It should be.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Many of Prum's ideas were very original and compelling. Once he departed the field of biology to discuss art theory, his course became pure conjecture. I preferred the first half of the course because I am more interested in biology and because Prum's specialty, ornithology, is the subject he lectures best on.",
    "Evolution of Beauty had something for everyone. It covered animal aesthetic evolution, human evolution, psychology, and art. Professor Prum is great and was able to bring humor into every lecture. Take this class if it is offered again.",
    "There should be more classes that communicate between the sciences and the humanities. It was unfortunate that it didn't count as a science requirement because I felt like we had to do some pretty serious scientific reading for the course. Overall it was interesting material and I learned a lot even though I don't have a lot of prior experience in biology.",
    "Do it.",
    "Evolution of Beauty does a good job of looking at our world today and analyzing what is beautiful, what is art, and why is this so. It analyzes these points from a scientific point of view using evolution and coevolution as a primary tool. The ideas, however, are mostly Professor Prum's own, and so I think they should be taken with a grain of salt. Some of the ideas are glossed over and confusing, others seem very sensible. I think the class left me with a greater appreciation of our world and a better understanding of art and it's history from a scientific viewpoint. I would recommend this class to students who like to see the sciences and humanities tied together. But beware that sometimes at the end of lecture, so many words and novel ideas had been said that I felt as if I'd been hit by a verbal truck. The exams are very subjective and allow for your imagination, but also should be answered as if you were Professor Prum."
