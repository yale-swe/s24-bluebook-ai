    "I did not really use the textbook except to look up a few things. It's probably not worth buying because they have a copy in lab.",

    "RS is an emerging field that I believe will become more widely accessible in the future. I feel that this course does a superb job at providing students with the skills necessary to analyze RS data.",

    "The subject matter and the way it was taught and Larry.",
    "The labs are really useful not just for the course but in the future to apply to other projects. The teachers were really knowledgable and helpful.",

    "It would be great to get exposure to the other major remote sensing software package, even just to know what the interface looks like. I also wonder if it would be possible to have in some labs, like the georeferencing lab, some repetition of process. ie, be presented with a few different layers that need to be warped in different ways and have us practice 3 or 4 times with picking up on what the layer needs to be warped to and practice making the series of clicks a few times. I think that might help cement the software fluency a little better.",
    "Availability of free satellite data, but I guess not really the professor's fault.",
    "Maybe a little less of the math equation stuff in the first problem sets.",
    "More TA hours near the end of the course to help students with their projects.",
    "Nothing too serious, but sometimes lab questions were busy. Sometimes the theoretical side was frustrating because it took a lot to learn, only to realize that sometimes it was not usable."

    "Actually for my non-research-based focus, it was not a good match, but the knowledge itself I personally value, and it gave me a good update on physics, as well as learning techniques and software I would probably otherwise never learn. In this way it is even more valuable than just something that fits into my focus."
