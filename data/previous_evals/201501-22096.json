   "comments": [
    "Places of Amusement makes you look at modern entertainment in a different light. You talk about anything from Coney Island and Disneyland to drive-in movies and virtual realities.",
    "I recommend taking this class if you're not used to taking American Studies or Film Classes - it's a good place to start.",
    "This class was great! Really interesting material and not a ton of work.",
    "I originally signed up for this class because I wanted to read about and talk about Disneyland, but it became so much more than that. We surveyed the cultural and social history of Coney Island, Disney, Las Vegas, and screen spaces like drive-ins, home theaters, and online games. It was interesting to see the connections between these places of amusement, as well as their intersections with the broader world. I found the readings engaging and not too stressful, and the class itself was a good balance of discussion, video clips, and commentary from Professor Glick. The two papers (one 5 page paper and one 10 page paper) were rather enjoyable to write because you are given the opportunity to delve into any aspect of amusement and its cultural implications that you are interested in.",
    "FILM 290 is what some people called the \"theme parks class.\" I think that there's a fun appeal in calling it that, but realistically the tools taught in the course went much deeper than just theme parks. It's almost as if amusement as a post-1900 American phenomenon was deconstructed and reinterpreted, specifically with a look towards film. The class was great, in part because of the instructor and in part because of the format that lent itself to great in-class discussions.",
    "I would recommend the course, even though he isn't teaching at Yale anymore. It's important to learn the history of the places you take for granted as part of the American urban fabric, and this course does a good job of teaching students exactly that."
