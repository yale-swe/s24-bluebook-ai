    "You should take this class if you like art in any way. Take it if you have to; for a major requirement. But also take it just to have a good time.",
    "I think the course is useful for developing constructive language and understanding of form and composition. Yes, I recommend it and agree that it's foundational.",
    "A basic introduction to thinking about art and making.",
    "It was a fun class, but a lot of work sometimes. But not hard work more like collaging for 7 hours in a row. So tedious work. But was overall ok. You just have to know that you're not always going to be doing the most purposeful stuff, but just roll with it and have fun.",
    "If you've got a background in art, take a more challenging art class. This one doesn't provide that development and growth that one would hope for from a semester of studio work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to people who have a lot of free time and do not mind the extended class time. we covered a lot of topics, and I liked the projects we did.",
    "You learn about visual abstraction. It may feel like you can say anything you want about your piece to legitimize it, but there are concrete if difficult to express reasons for why it's an interesting abstraction or an uninteresting one."
