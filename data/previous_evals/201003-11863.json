   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely NOT recommend MATH 115 to any student. MATH 115 is a horrible course. It is poorly taught, the curriculum is very large, and the exams are almost impossible. As a first semester freshman, I never imagined the mathematics department being such a nightmare. MATH 115 is disorganized, the \"extra help\" sessions are more confusing than helpful, and the course is simply terrible. Professor Algom Kfir is not an effective teacher. She frequently makes mistakes on the board and does not provide helpful answers to student questions. Although she does try to be available to students, she is a very poor teacher who should not be teaching MATH 115.",
    "I would say that the workload is very managable and that it is great that there are only 2 midterms and a final. I would also say that there is a lot of help if you need it. I would recommend this course because it is a good preperation for higher level courses in math.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who needs it as a requirement but not for someone who only is trying to get QR",
    "As you might have heard from other students: DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU CAN AVOID IT. Yale is great in many things, but not in its math department. The course is extremely difficult, the tests are extremely hard, and you have to study a ton for them, especially the final. This was my most time consuming course, and most of my time was devoted to studying, rather than doing homework. It is not a fun course in any way, and it will make your life at Yale unnecessarily miserable (especially before exams)",
    "I would recommend Math 115 to a student only if they need the requirement for premed or their major. If not, take an easier math course. Even with an AP 5 in BC Calculus, this course is challenging. You will have to work and teach yourself quite a few concepts.",
    "Good intro math course. The class is very fair, just always keep up with the homework! Overall, a very manageable workload.",
    "Mathematics 115 has a very fast pace, which unfortunately makes the course rather hard. The material itself is challenging, thus it is crucial to go to each lecture well prepared, in order to fully understand what you are being taught. Thankfully, teachers are always available to answer any questions.",
    "It's better to just read the textbook. The lectures are terrible.",
    "Mathematics 115 is not terribly difficult, but it requires independent studying. The test questions are sometimes harder than the problem sets, but it really just takes a lot practice to be ready for any problem they may throw at you.",
    "I would tell a fellow student to take the course if they have a strong mathematical background. I would recommend the class if the student is able to self-learn math.",
    "You know what you're getting into. It's basically like taking an AP Calc class. No surprises, which can be a good thing, but it does get rather boring and dry. However, I think that's just the nature of the subject. Also, take this class with Yael. She is super duper helpful and she's actually a pretty darn good professor. She will always be willing to help you, and a quality like this isn't easy to find.",
    "If you have a choice, do not take MATH115 unless you are willing to work very hard.",
    "Take if you need to or if you're really good at math.",
    "If the person has taken Calculus B\/C and got a 5 on the AP test then don't take it. It's a waste of time, and Math 120 is about vectors, so you don't have to know you integrals as much.",
    "The content of the course itself was easy to manage, however the content of the tests often did not actually test the knowledge of this material, rather it had a level of difficulty beyond understanding the calculus methods. Having said this, there are many resources available to help you on your endeavors, so make sure if you take this course you are willing to seek out help on your own. In addition it was quite clear that in order to excel, one would have to have a sort of natural mathematical intuition.",
    "Math 115 is probably the equivalent of Calculus BC in high school. I would recommend this class if you have a background in Calculus and or if you are very familiar with the 115 curriculum. I recommend this class, but because it is fast paced, you must be willing to put in a lot of extra time re-learning the curriculum on your own.",
    "I would say try to get the good teachers because if you do not, it is a hard course. If this is not necessary for your major, try to avoid it because it can be a lot of pointless work if you are not going to use it for anything.",
    "Yael is a very nice person, but not a very good teacher and not very accessible for office hours. I definitely recommend a different professor, or at least going to a different professor's office hours and review sessions. The tests are hard, and I felt poorly prepared for them. Take the class if you need to - you do learn a lot, but be prepared to put in a lot of work, especially if you didn't take Calc BC. If you took BC, then take 120 - don't waste your time with 115 (it's unnecessarily difficult and poorly taught). SHOP as much as possible for a good professor - this may be your only hope of doing well in the class, unles you're able to put in a tremendous amount of work into understanding the material on your own (or unless you are brilliant at math, in which case I really wouldn't recommend this class - you'd be bored). Don't procrastinate - study the material as much as possible right after you learn it; there are so many things I didn't fully understand until right before the final, andthis definitely hurt me on the problem sets.",
    "Take it if you have taken BC, otherwise it might be a bit tough. For the most part you can work through it but if you're coming in from AB be prepared and don't expect a smooth ride.",
    "This course is a prerequisite. You should take it if you need it for a major, or if you need it to take a more proof-based and intellectually stimulating math course. Alone, it won't be exceedingly worthwhile."
