   "comments": [
    "I would recommend SPAN 151 to a particular type of student. If you fulfilling your L5 requirement (most likely meaning you tested in with AP scores), take this course ONLY if you are awful at reading (Literature is less work, same grades and much better) AND if you like having oral tests\/presentations in lieu of written ones. The grammatical focus is EQUAL to L5 Spanish Grammar. It is just evaluated orally versus written.",
    "Spanish 151 focuses on developing conversational skills. There is not much written work. The first half of the semester consists of discussion about an article\/video clip on various themes read\/seen the night before. In the second half of the course we read a novel.I would recommend the class. It has a relatively light workload. Professor (Maria Pilar Asensio-Manrique) was awesome. I highly recommend taking it with her.This class is a great way to satisfy your foreign language requirement if you received a 5 on the AP Spanish exam.",
    "This class is great if you want to break back into speaking spanish. The readings will definitely help with comprehension and the classes make speaking much more comfortable. It isn't easy, but each class gets easier, and it's a lot of fun.",
    "I would recommend this class if you really want to improve your speaking skills and just want a relaxed atmosphere in which to practice Spanish. It is difficult at first if your spoken Spanish is not at a high level.",
    "Take it to keep Spanish fresh in your mind. Look to other classes to improve your Spanish",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. It is an excellent opportunity to develop fluency in speaking and comprehension in a challenging but supportive environment. Profesora Asensio is wonderful. She pushes you but also provides a safe environment in which to learn. At times I was slightly frustrated by the implications of having students with varying levels of fluency in the class, as it felt that certain students were inclined to dominate discussion, but Profesora Asensio did a good job of making sure all students got their say.",
    "I would recommend the course to a student who needs to complete the language requirement but doesn't necessarily feel the need to improve his language skills.",
    "It was a good class in the sense that it was good speaking practice; however, I didn't really improve my speaking skills, I only maintained them. If you're trying to improve your Spanish, the best way to do so is to travel abroad. If you're fulfilling distributional requirements, it's a great class and the work load is definitely manageable.",
    "The course is structured around a set of weekly\/biweekly themes, with readings and homework. We discuss readings and questions in class, and you really do get a lot more comfortable talking and expressing ideas. There are also debates and role-playing exercises, and we read a novel at the end. I really enjoyed this class; it wasn't too stressful but I feel like my Spanish improved a lot. I would definitely recommend it, and professor Pilar is awesome!",
    "A great way to improve your mastery of Spanish. I would definitely recommend it to another student."
