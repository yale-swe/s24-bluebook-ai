    "Good appreciation for the ways in which capitalism aides and hinders prosperity and the development of society.",
    "I developed a thorough understanding of not only the benefits and drawbacks of capitalism (and how it functions) but also the economic history of the United States. This course is much more qualitative than others that cover the topic but Professor Rae's approach is great!",
    "I learned about the history and modern implications of the institution of capitalism in America through its bases in Enlightenment thinking and innovation. Additionally, I learned how to effectively synthesize resources given in order to come to conclusions about the effects of capitalism and normatively evaluate current topics in the American political and economic scenes.",
    "A history of capitalism in America from the start of the country up until modern day. Its strengths, weaknesses, and complications.",
    "I learned about how capitalism developed and evolved over time.",
    "An in-depth look of what makes capitalism unique. A good amount of history of New Haven, and other areas. Vast insights from Professor Rae.",
    "An understanding of the benefits and downfalls of capitalism.",
    "I learned about the development of capitalism in America.",
    "Learned to better understand the multidimensional nature of capitalism"

   "comments": [
    "Lectures were always interesting and informative",
    "I really liked the class and Prof Rae kept it interesting. A weakness would be that on the exams, I felt like some of the questions tested more specific things rather than broader subjects as a whole and sometimes important topics weren't covered on the exams.",
    "Interesting material. Lecture pace is a little slow but Doug makes lots of fun side stories along the way about Yale, New Haven, and life in general.",
    "The course was very well organized, highly engaging, and extremely interestingI really would not change anything.",
    "This course had very few assignments to test my knowledge before major exams and the readings were sometimes inaccessible.",
    "Its low workload, definitely a gut for undergraduates. But our first midterm wasnt til after the credit D and withdrawal deadline so most of the class took it for credit.",
    "The course could be improved by having a full 50 minute section weekly rather than the impromptu breakout sessions.",
    "Strengths: Professor Rae rocks. Really structured a cool course, with interesting themes for each meeting. Interesting readings, too. Weaknesses: Slides could be a little tough to follow, and it wasn't always clear what information was extraneous or important (sometimes we went off on tangents!)",
    "The readings were fine but it was very confusing to try to find what readings I had to do as the use of Canvas by this course was poor. Towards the end of the semester, the material got repetitive and we were supposed to do some modern case studies but as far as I know, we did none",
    "Strength was how interesting Professor Rae was to listen to, as he is extremely knowledgeable. Another strength was having only mid-term\/final for grades.",
    "Lecture could be more organized. We should have followed a more comprehensive flow between lectures. The topic that was covered on a day to day basis felt random most of the time.",
    "strength was the professor",
    "It was very disorganized and the expectations were unclear. To add on to that, since it was half SOM students, not all students had the same expectationsz",
    "I loved lectures but the syllabus couldve been a little more organized as things got thrown off around the middle of the semester"

   "comments": [
    "Yes - the professor is great and is an interesting course",
    "Definitely. The class is pretty chill and so interesting. Prof Rae knows a ton about the subject and I really enjoyed the classes.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I found the material interesting, the professor entertaining, and the readings being short and worthwhile. If you think the subject might be cool then it's a great elective for you.",
    "This is by far my favorite course that I have taken at Yale, and Professor Rae is, by extension, my favorite professor. He is incredibly knowledgeable, humorous, and passionate about teaching, and I cannot recommend the course highly enough.",
    "I would not recommend this class. It was not very engaging and the material got repetitive.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course as it is not the most demanding course but very interesting overall.",
    "If you're looking for a chill 5th credit, yes. Be thoroughly prepared to tackle the first exam however. Style can take you by surprise if you haven't done the readings or tried to understand the overall message behind every lecture.",
    "As it is, no. This class has great potential, as the material is very interesting. Unfortunately, due to the lack of organization and unclear expectations, its not worth the trouble. The final also ended up being 60% of the grade, which was not made clear to the class until after reading periodz",
    "Yes! The class is a pretty good survey into capitalism and you get a lot out of it without it being a super demanding course"
