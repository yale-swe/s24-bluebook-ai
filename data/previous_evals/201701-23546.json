    "SLC is a great class for anyone looking for an applied approach to management and land conservation. It successfully straddles the line between theoretical readings and practical approaches to conservation work.",

   "comments": [
    "Brad's ability to manage speakers, student comments, and a wide range of topics; getting a sense of on-the-ground challenges for our client.",
    "The course is a survey of private land conservation strategies, so I really appreciated the opportunity to dive in deeper through the student clinical project.",
    "Brad really view this class as an opportunity for networking and collaboration. Being a professional school, sometimes FES has trouble maintaining its focus on producing graduates that can easily transition into the professional world. This class is a perfect example of how FES can develop not just analytical thinkers, but also business-minded graduates who have strong networks for growth and development.",
    "Great overview of land trusts and how to innovate and improve the work of land trusts. Brad is a caring and knowledgeable instructor who is very responsive to students.",
    "I thought the choice of speakers and range of subjects was the best part of the class.",
    "The structure and scope of this course was fantastic. It covered every topic relevant to land conservation, and did so in a coherent well-structured fashion. In general the speakers are a great addition to the class and are very well chosen. I also appreciated that Brad takes the time to debrief about the prior week's speaker each class (in some classes at FES it feels like you never actually talk about the speakers). Lastly, the clinical project component is great. Brad selected a range of interesting projects, and I think people benefited greatly from the experiences. This is one of the best classes I've taken at FES! One other positive -- this is one of the most diverse classes I've taken at FES as far as students' academic\/professional backgrounds. There are MFs, MEMs, and MESCs, folks with science, business, econ, law, and journalism backgrounds, etc. The diversity of perspectives offered during class makes the content more interesting, and definitely pushed me to think about certain topics in new ways.",
    "Great discussion - students had lots of background in the area, speakers provided great fodder, and Brad guided the conversation deftly.",
    "Brad's contact network and ability to bring in guest lecturers is the course' strongest aspect.",
    "The best aspect of this course was the guest speaker line-up. With half of each class period being devoted to guest speakers, we got to listen to a wide range of people and topics. For me, this was invaluable as a newcomer to the conservation world. I was exposed to the work of many organizations and got to make connections with interesting folks in the field. The set-up of this course was unique compared to my other more traditional lecture\/discussion courses. Another great aspect of this course were the student-led discussions in the beginning of each class. There were some discussions that felt a bit stilted\/boring, but for the most part, students were engaged on that week's topic and everyone was involved in discussions. I think this was a great way to hear what my peers were thinking about, as well as a great way to work through questions we had together."

   "comments": [
    "Zoom videos were less engaging. This may just be me, but I have a lot of trouble staying focused during video lectures. Second, too many readings meant that folks often skimmed or skipped them and there was no common baseline of understanding.",
    "If speakers cannot attend in person, they should probably be scrapped from the schedule as hour-long lectures over skype just arent as engaging as they need to be. Also, reading was dense from week to week and didn't always feel terribly relevant - it sometimes felt as though reading was accumulated from year to year without edits. Also, client projects should be vetted a bit more - while I enjoyed working with my client, it really had very little to do with land conservation work which was slightly disappointing.",
    "I know this is hard to control, but the amount of work entailed in the clinical projects varied pretty drastically. I also found the first out of class workshop to be really long and repetitive.",
    "There are tons of readings assigned each week, all of which are useful and worth reading. It would help, though, to have them somewhat organized so that you're not guessing what the relevance of each is; for example, having the website of each speaker listed was a good idea but in execution fell apart because I had no idea what to look at.",
    "Sometimes the reading load felt very heavy. Most of the readings were really interesting and relevant, but it was sometimes hard to read all assigned readings (sometimes 300+ pages a week) and respond to them each week. By the end, I ended up picking one or two readings each week to skim and respond to. That meant I could get my assignment done, but the downside was I really didn't engage in all the readings. Talking with other students in this class, many of them began to approach the readings this way by the end of the year due to lack of time."

In general the course felt extremely practical, I think it will set me up well to do this work in the \"real world.\"",

I'm still deciding what aspects of the conservation world I would like to pursue after graduation, but this course gave me a great look into how land trusts and other small agencies work. For students hoping to do conservation work after Yale, I think this course is extremely important to take."

    "I am studying conservation at Yale, and this is one of the few FES courses that is explicitly about conservation. I was also intrigued by the clinical project aspect of the course, which allowed me to get some hands-on experience in addition to my classwork. Finally, Brad Gentry has a great reputation as a professor (I can confirm that he is great) so I wanted to take at least one of his courses while at Yale."

    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I feel like it was a good introduction to the work that is happening on the ground right now.",
    "Yes absolutely! I gained a lot of practical knowledge from this class to put to good work later on. In addition, I got great insight into work that is currently going on in the field from the speakers. Lastly, I learned a lot from my clinical project -- about specific topics, how organizations are run, and how to work with clients.",
    "Yes. Brad is the best. He wants to impart a lot of information in a non-stressful way and make sure that it is actively useful for students. This is what school should be about.",
    "Yes, but again, I wish there was less of an New England\/ East Coast bias",
    "Yes, as a newcomer to conservation I gained a lot of knowledge about how land trusts and land conservancies worked. In addition, the student-led discussions sparked a lot of self-reflection. The readings were usually quite interesting and pertinent to whatever topic we were discussing that week, and I've saved many of them to refer to in the future."

    "Advantages: allowed me to brainstorm with another, especially important for a topic I'm less versed in. Created a much more dynamic end project, especially in the short time window....I would not have gotten one-quarter as far on my own.",
    "My partner for the clinical project and I got along really well - I appreciated being able to share the work and complement our backgrounds.",
    "I wasn't a huge fan of the two person project team. I struggled to work well with my partner throughout the semester (and to ensure we took on equal portions of the work), and therefore would have preferred the project team to be at least three people. That said, two is a more nimble number as far as scheduling and I know that many people were satisfied with this set-up.",
    "Learned alot from my partner, who had a very different style than I did. I find partner work more useful than group work, and this class had lots of partner projects.",
    "The advantage of group work was that I was able to get some hands-on experience in a clinical project, which was great. I also got very lucky in my group partner, who is a good friend of mine and a great student, and my project supervisor. That made working on the project very enjoyable. The flip side was that I felt that my group project was a heavier workload than many other student projects, and at times I felt stressed about how much I needed to manage for my project in relation to my other course work, especially towards the end of the semester. I am glad I worked on the project I did, but I didn't realize what a heavy lift it was going to be when I signed up for it, and if I had known, I might have thought twice about it."

    "This is a great course for those interested in land conservation\/land trusts. It is important to know that all classes are presentations from outside lecturers. While this is a very interesting and enjoyable model, it is different from a traditional course.",
    "Great choice if you're interested in land trusts and the mechanisms they use--especially if you want to hear from practitioners or a re interested in one of the proposed projects! If you're only tangentially interested in the subject matter, it could be a pretty deep dive into a narrow field, but admittedly lessons could be construed for work in other arenas.",
    "The course is very focused on land trusts - if you are most interested in public land conservation, this may not suit you well. Additionally, as a clinical project course, much of the experience of the course is based on your particular client & project. Be sure that there is a project you're excited to spend the semester with!",
    "Choose your project carefully",
    "Just make sure to take advantage of this course, it is great!",
    "Try to do all the readings if you can! It will be tough because there are so many, but I think they are valuable. Also, for your group project, set your expectations up front with your group members and supervisor. I know some groups ran into trouble because of miscommunication on expectations for the project. Getting that in writing in the beginning of the semester will help mitigate any conflict down the line."
