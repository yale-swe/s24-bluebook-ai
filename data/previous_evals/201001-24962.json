    "A really interesting way to fulfill a science requirement for you non-scientists out there. Not quite as easy to get an \"A\" as you might think, though.",
    "No.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! It may seem easy or interesting the first week but it is NOT. The reading load is ridiculous and boring; there are 3 separate course packets! The tests are based on 3 pages of material from hundreds of pages of reading and the lectures. The lectures are HORRIBLE and have absolutely no point. Wyman just gives anecdotes and stories while Drixler puts up incomprehensible charts that he doesn't even seem to understand and if you put it all together you get NOTHING. If you insist on taking this class, you don't need to go to lecture (although I did) because they put the notes online (verbatim) and don't waste your time in section although the TAs are actually the only redeeming part because they all admit how ridiculous this class is. RUN AWAY!",
    "definitely a worthwhile class to take (especially if you need a science requirement) but be prepared for A LOT of reading. also all the readings are completely necessary to do, most of the exams are structured around them.",
    "It's a course about human populations, so there's a great deal of material devoted to reproductive rituals over time, from primates to humans. A lot of contemporary issues come up, like sex-selective abortion and infanticide and population control. I would definitely recommend it. It's a fascinating class.",
    "If you need a science credit, go for it.",
    "Some of the material is fascinating, some is very dry. There is a lot of reading.",
    "If you are interested in the material, definitely take it. I did every reading for the class and feel as though I learned a ton of information. Unfortunately, the lectures are incredibly boring and you honestly don't need to go to do well in the course.",
    "Material is interesting at first but you get tired of it quickly, perhaps because you have to read extensively for every class. After the 1 midterm, you begin to feel that the class meets for too long, that you are talking for 1hr and 15 min when you could be saying what you are saying in 20 minutes. People stop going to lecture and its just a big disappointment.Lectures are disorganized. Notes are so much better than lecture, because you actually see and understand the outline.They try including the students and that is nice, and engaging at times.Bob's lectures about monkeys are a must see, though. Very interesting and funny at the same time.There are better classes to take at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're looking to get a science credit, because its a lot easier than most science classes. Just be aware that its not by any means a \"gut\" and that you have to do ALL the readings (over 100 pages per week) to do well in the class.",
    "dont do it unless it makes some changes.",
    "-So, it's a gut, clearly. Unfortunately, because of how erratic it is, it appears not to be a guaranteed A as a gut, which kind of defeats the point. You've been warned.",
    "It's a course that covers a lot of information and has a lot of reading, and the concepts don't always come together; but the information is very fascinating and the professors are great!",
    "This course was very scattered and incoherent. Wyman and Drixler are interesting lecturers and kind professors. However, the grading has been pretty hard and uneven--it is very unclear what kind of knowledge the course demands until the midterms, and even then the TA's seem very arbitrary where they take off points. Still, compared to other science credits this has some actual applicability and political\/social implications.",
    "The class is great - important topics that really need to be learned. I felt that the class really expanded my knowledge base in areas of public health, the environment, the ways that populations and economies interact etc. This is one of the classes at yale that made me feel like I'll have a good impact on the world because of my education.The lectures were good and so were the readings (though there are a lot of them).That being said, it's a big class, and the grading on exams suffers because of it. Stand up for what you want the exams to be like, the professors are really good at taking student feedback.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. The subject matter is interesting but the course cannot be saved. I don't understand how the tests went from being incredibly broad to painfully specific without any rhyme or reason. This course continues to be tweaked ever so painfully by the professors, and your grade suffers for it. Furthermore, although there is an inordinate amount of material (more reading than I ever had to do in Directed Studies freshman year) there is no effort at all until the end to create a guide for making sense of the hundreds of pages of material you are supposedly responsible for. The hardest work I've put into a course for the lowest return...I would have been better off duking it out with the pre-meds in biology or chemistry than trying to make sense of this course. Don't subject yourself to this.",
    "If you are a Humanities or Social Sciences person, it might be a good way to get a SC credit in a topic that is important to learn about. However, it is certainly not a gut. Wayy to much reading and tests are harder than expected. Definitely form study groups and split up the readings because it doesn't make sense to do all of them.",
    "This course is the perfect class to take if you are interested in demography and ethical issues of abortion and humanpopulation growth. It is a great SC credit for History majors since it fulfills the non-western requirement and it actually has a lot to offer. Write the research paper, you'll regret not having done so at the end.",
    "Not really - the lecture was boring - most people spent their time playing Sporcle - and the readings were often long and dry. My least favorite class this semester.",
    "YES i tihnk this material is stuff every person should be aware of, and it's really really interesting. and SO IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF OUR WORLD!!!! not to mention an awesome science credit!",
    "A great way to get a science credit if you are more interested in the humanities. Especially fun at the beginning when you learn about monkeys' and apes' mating patterns. Also, at the end of the course, the professors tie the material together well. There is also good discussion of pertinent events to all of our lives including the environment and the future of our planet.",
    "No. Too much work for too little reward. Better and more sciency ways of getting a science credits. Better history classes out there if you're a history major. Much information is intuitive, so you leave the class feeling you didn't learn much.",
    "LOTS OF READING! Lots of really, really, really interesting points that will really make you think (both in readings& lectures) but also lots of points that just seem to be rambling and extremely unimportant. The tests are also A LOT of work to study for because there is just SO much material and the professors don't really give you any indication of what is more likely to be tested on and what is relatively unimportant (and in terms of the tests, NOTHING is relatively unimportant...every test has at least one question that seems to come totally out of left field!). However, I am REALLY glad I took this course; population and demographics was never something I thought about as being a matter of extreme importance, but this class REALLY opened my eyes and I am now fascinated by the whole issue of demography and global population growth... I can definitely see myself taking more classes on this topic in the future.",
    "This class was an interesting subject with interesting material but at the end of the day I don't think I liked it all that much. I feel like I left the class knowing alot of interesting things but it was more because I thought about some of the things I got from lecture on my own.I think this had to do with two things. First of all there's FAR too much reading. A lot of it is redundant and tiring to read (150 page readings where have of it is two pages on one...). Second of all I often felt the class was disorganized and a lot of time I was confused about the overall direction.BUT it is a science cred, and that's huge. And MUCH better (although much more work) than Planets and stars or one of those other joke classes. So if you're doing it for a science cred go for it. Just get ready to read.",
    "Good class. Grading is kind of arbitrary in the exams sometimes. The readings are interesting and you have to make sure that you keep up with them.The two professors (Drixler and Wyman) are great and the class is a great combination of the best that history and biology have to offer.A good science credit class.",
    "Global Issues of Population Growth was a very interesting course, covering many topics relating to fertility, mortality, historical trends, and global consequences of changes in human population. Although it is a science credit, there is very little science involved. It is an extremely reading heavy course, though. The topics are generally interesting and very relevant to many things that are happening in the world today. I truly enjoyed this course and would highly recommend it to anyone.",
    "I would not recommend this class, except as a way to get a science credit with humanities skills",
    "It addresses a huge variety of issues in relation to demographics and also attacks many preconceptions about demographics- such as the Demographic Transition theory. Beyond demographics, it encourages students to analyze statistical information carefully and compile information to come up with their own opinions, as many of the readings conflict with each other in interesting ways. I do recommend this course, as I think it is very relevant. It reaches into biology, history, religion, psychology, and economics.",
    "it sucks.",
    "Yes, students should take it. It covers so many interesting aspects, like great ape biology, early humans, demographic transitions, the biology of fertilization, the abortion question, and the relationship between the environment and population growth. There's something that everyone can into. Be advised that it is a lot of reading, around 1000 pages total, all in articles ranging from very to not so interesting.",
    "Its ok if you need it for a science credit, but no, I would not recommended it unless you are willing to do ALL the reading every week.",
    "I took this for SC credit. It wasn't as painful as other options. Exams asked for random things; reading load was excessive, but overall not so bad and decently interesting.",
    "A pretty good course. The material is extremely timely, relevant and interesting but the lectures were often somewhat boring and the sections are kind of pointless. The professors post their lecture notes online, which is great,but it's definitely a bad sign when I understand the lecture better from reading the online notes than from actually listening to the lecture. If they continue to post their notes online, don't bother to take notes yourself--I hardly ever looked at my own notes. Also, for guest lectures, the assigned reading will be exactly the same as the guest lecture itself. Do one or the other.",
    "It is a fantastic class where everything you learn feels important to how you live in today's world. Moving from the evolution of sex in primates to the spread of humans around the world to the effects of population on politics, economics, and the environment. Everyone should take this class. With improvements in the section it would have been pretty fantastic. Some section leaders are much better than others and also there is a lot of reading. But I felt I left the class really feeling like I had a new view on what needed to change in the world. Prof. Drixler and Wyman are funny and really very very passionate about the topic.",
    "definitely recommend it! its super interesting and worth the work.",
    "This is absolutely the worst and most offensive class I have ever taken at Yale. The professors had no clear structure to the class, it was just whatever they felt like talking about. The exams were completely unpredictable in style, scope and specificity and varied wildly throughout the course. Professors intentionally withheld information about exams when prompted that others give--like grade distributions and rubrics (so you would never know why you lost x points on the exam, even though there was a cumulative final). On a larger level, I found much of the course offensive and hurtful. Violence against women, especially sexual violence, was consistently minimized if not openly joked about or JUSTIFIED with \"science\" or \"population control.\" Colonialist and racist themes ran throughout the course. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. DON'T DO IT. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER SCIENCE CREDITS.",
    "dont take it.",
    "This course was a big disappointment. The reading was far too much, the lectures were dry and boring and repetitious, and the tests were unfairly written. If you absolutely need a science credit and don't have any otheroptions then take it, but only if you have to.",
    "Just know what you're getting into. It is a very interesting class and not extremely difficult in terms of subject matter, but at times will require time and work to memorize all the facts for exams and to put the pieces together in order to write the term paper (if you decide to do so). The professors are both very energetic but not exactly similar in their styles and the readings are often 30 pages of rambling and 5 pages of important points. All this makes the class very valuable yet very frustrating.",
    "History 400 01 will give you an understanding of the issues surrounding population growth and its origins. I would not recommend it because I felt likethe material and lectures were very scattered and not cohesive, and the grading was very arbitrary - often the professors could not even explain why someone had gotten a certain grade and just acknowledged that the TAs had messed up with grading.",
    "Global Problems of Population Growth is a fascinating class that opens one's eyes to the importance of demography in history and in contemporary problems. The class has three basic sections, divided by two midterms. The three overall topics are the sexual practices of primates and early humans, the fertility transition, and modern problems related to population growth. The class has a lot of reading, but most selections are rather interesting. I would highly recommend the class. The class makes you realize the enormous societal change that shifts in fertility and morality can cause. It also gives you a better understanding of religious view toward birth control and abortion. In short, a fascinating class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student. It is such a relevant and important topic today that everybody should be well informed about it. The readings are sometimes long but they are so interesting that it does not seem like homework, and you can always split it with a few people to make it easier.",
    "I would only take this class if you are really interested in the topic (which is totally fascinating) and have some time to devote to it. It is not a gut science. There is a ton of reading and the exams arevery difficult (i.e., poorly designed and therefore hard to do well on without just rote-memorizing everything the professors and reading say). This was honestly the worst-organized and -run course I've taken at Yale, and despite how interested I was in the topic that and the kind of offensive way Wyman handled the abortion unit left me with a sour taste in my mouth. Only take it if you really want to spend a lot of time with the material, and if you have a high tolerance for annoying professors.",
    "The class is an incredible overview of human history, and great because it examines some of the most critical problems that we face today. If you can cope with the reading load and the overwhelming span of the course, it will be one of the most important things that you get to think about whilst you are here.",
    "It is a great class. There is a ton of reading but it is all interesting and definitely worth it. The fact that it is a science credit is another major plus.",
    "If you don't have a death wish, don't take this class.If you do have a death wish, there are more dignified ways to go.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to anyone because it covers really important issues, but beware of the exams -- they are VERY HARD.",
    "If you need a science credit, and aren't afraid to do a little more work than in a 'gut' course but get a lot more out of it, TAKE THIS COURSE. If you are interested in public policy, international relations, or global development, TAKE THIS COURSE. If you are currently living on the face of the planet Earth, and at all care to know about the most important issue facing the globe today, TAKE THIS COURSE.This course is not structured like other science courses. It is all reading (often a lot of reading--but mostly interesting and certainly manageable), and the midterms\/exams are all writing.",
    "Good course. Material covered is all interesting, though the structure sometimes lacks in giving a sense of where we are going. Lectures are interesting. The readings are interesting but sometimes there are too many case studies to cover for each issue. Both professors are good lecturers with interesting material to cover. Good questions raised. Course is sometimes very basic, but case studies are interesting.",
    "AMAZING",
    "I don't think I can wholeheartedly recommend MCDB 150 to a fellow student. I took this class for the Sc credit and it is a lot more work than most of the other for-non-science-majors Sc credits out there. The reading load pretty heavy--really heavy for a non-humanities person. I was perpetually behind (and I'm never like that in my other classes) and therefore perpetually a little stressed. The massive amount of reading also makes studying for the tests (the only grades for the class) a bit of an ordeal.That being said, I'm glad I stuck it out (I considered dropping, the reading was so much) because a lot of the material is really important in today's news. A lot of the current problems in the world have their roots in population growth and it's nice to be able to speak knowledgeably about them. It's also nice because the class isn't just entirely made up of people looking for an Sc (like History of Life, for example, probably is): People are there for the Sc, yes, but also for the history major (it counts as a \"rest of the world\" course), from the forestry school, and some are just there to educate themselves on such an important issue. Plus the professors are both really passionate about the material.Overall, think long and hard about your workload from your other classes before you sign up for this. It's a lot of work, but it can be somewhat worth it.",
    "Lectures range from very interesting to pretty dull but the reading is consistently interesting, although there is a lot of it. There is basically no work aside from the midterms and final. I think this course taught me some very useful information that will stay with me for a while, but section was brutal.",
    "This class is kind of crazy and not perfectly organized, but it was fun, especially if you take it with friends and only do it Cr\/D.",
    "Despite the interesting and relevant subject matter, this is one of the worst courses I have taken at Yale. It seemed as if the professors went out of their way to make the course as disorganized and difficult to digest as possible. Each third of the course was accompanied by an unreasonable amount of reading (roughly 400 double-sided pages in a reading packet for the final three weeks, for example). The main issue with the reading was that most of it was irrelevant or largely repetitive, yet the professors absolutely refused to provide any guidance as to what was important and what wasn't. The course was one giant glob of information, and even upon request the professors could not provide any structure or organization. Professor Drixler's final study guide helped a bit, but it was too little too late.Additionally, the grading for this course is oftentimes arbitrary and the TAs don't really seem to entirely understand what is going on. This is a horrible, horrible course.DO NOT TAKE IT even though it is attractive for satisfying both a SC and a History requirement.",
    "good course, you should take it.",
    "The class is mixed. The readings are interesting and the material is very relevant. It draws a lot from the social sciences (sociology, demography, economics), history and cultural studies in order to address the problem of population growth. The problem is that the instructors don't do a good job of defining the scope of inquiry. There is way too much reading and people often have no idea what is going to be tested on the exams. Additionally, the professors don't really connect the readings and the lectures well, so it's almost impossible to trace the progression of the courseand understand why certain topics are included on the syllabus.While the professors clearly feel that their subject is important and relevant, they're also not very good at engaging the class.I guess this class is worth considering if you need a science credit and the subject appeals to you. But be prepared to be frustrated by the large amount of reading, tests that play free association with facts, and little direction for the course.",
    "The readings were interesting but that's the only place I learned because the lectures were awful. If you're truly interested in the topic, take this class because you will learn a lot, but the professors are unorganized and if that bothers you it probably isn't the best class to take.",
    "While I learned a lot of interesting material in this class, this class is not well taught. I would wait until it is reformed to take it. Until then, I think students will continue to struggle, and not be rewarded for their work.",
    "Yes, great material. But needs more organization.",
    "The course gives a general background of the factors that affect pop growth, but it didn't help me understand how we will deal with the problem in the future.",
    "I'd reccomend this course because the subject and the readings are extremely interesting. Some of the readings are extremely long and extraneous. Make sure you devote enough time to the readings, because some of the exam questions were very specific. The exams are badly written and poorly graded. However, I learned a lot at the end and I'm glad I took this course.",
    "Things to consider: 3 course packets, 3 midterms, 1 final, 2 differently-styled professors, very demanding exams (in terms of retaining very specific information), lectures that are very difficult to produce notes for (and that are available online), and a subject matter that is inherently somewhat elitist and racist.Regardless: you'll learn a lot of things you were taught have been wrong, or that what seems like a common-sensical solution to a problem might actually not be the best, you'll learn to think globally, and to look to the roots of reproduction (apes!) to understand it. Some guest lecturers are very intriguing. Student input always welcome.",
    "Excellent and dynamic class with readings that you actually want to read. However, the tests and grading are arbitrary.",
    "I've gone back and forth all semester on whether to recommend the class. It deals with interesting, relevant material that it's good to be actually informed about and was pretty inspiring in terms of showing ways we might save the world and stuff. And you do get an Sc without doing problem sets. Warning, though - the class consists of long lectures after lunch and three truly humongous course packets. There's a ton of material, and the organization can be a bit confusing at times. I don't think I did particularly well in the course despite the time I put in, but I learned a lot and am glad I took it.",
    "You need to take this course - the issues discussed are unique, interesting, and essential for your education as a human being. Some of it may seem like common sense, but you'll realize at the end how much you've taken away. Three reading packets is a LOT and I definitely didn't finish everything (they NEED to cut down on the reading), but most of it was really interesting and easy to get through. I liked Professor Wyman's lectures much better than Professor Drixler's, but all were worth attending. The guest lecturers near the end are fantastic and inspiring. Take this course.",
    "Its a ton of reading, but if you are interested in population issues, you should take it. Alot of people take as a gut science course, so if you have any scientific background, you have a leg up.",
    "\uff34\uff41\uff4b\uff45\u3000\uff49\uff54\u3000\uff46\uff4f\uff52\u3000\uff54\uff48\uff45\u3000\uff53\uff43\uff49\uff45\uff4e\uff43\uff45\u3000\uff43\uff52\uff45\uff44\uff49\uff54",
    "Only take the class if you are actually interested in the topics listed in syllabus. I personally thought the topics presented were fascinating and therefore I enjoyed the class though the teaching was very disjointed and confusing at times. On the other hand, if you have no interest in the topic whatsoever and only want an science credit, you probably will intensely dislike the class.",
    "This class will most likely change the way you think about society. However, there is a large amount of reading in the process. Also, exams are poorly written, testing minute details rather than concepts. I would definitely take this class, but perhaps take it Credit\/D.",
    "No. Although I think the readings were fascinating, I really think the lectures need to be improved, and the amount of readings needs to be shortened.",
    "A great look at one of the key problems of our age. The course packet was excessive and sometimes redundant, but the material was interesting. Lectures were hit or miss, but the guest lecturers were great. Overall I recommend the class, but only if you're ready for a lot of reading.",
    "This class was interesting but rather disorganized. The lecture topics from week to week did not necessarily form a coherent whole. The subject matter, however, is critically important and very interesting.",
    "This course covers many areas of study, in a way you never get bored. However, after a few weeks, the readings repeat, and their weight seems unnecessary to this class.",
    "I would recommend the course for someone who is looking for a science credit but is outside the major. The course has more to do with anthropology and sociology than science. It's also not too much work.",
    "This class is a science credit and an interesting subject, but don't take it if you are looking for an interesting and captivating biology class. There is a lot of reading and the lectures, although on interesting topics, can be hard to get through. That being said, if you are really interested in the topic of population growth, it could be an interesting class to take.",
    "It's not the most inspiring course, and don't expect to have gained incredible insight afterward. But overall, it's a nice science credit with some interesting lectures here and there. It's not as easy as other peoplesay though - be prepared for hundreds of pages of reading and ridiculously detail-oriented exams.",
    "GPPG has a very interesting premise, which it doesn't completely live up to. It raises many interesting questions, and will give you a lot of cool tidbits about chimpanzees, or birth control in France, but the big picture remains fuzzy. I do feel that I know a lot more about demography and population than I did before the class, but I think that there was potential for it to be a more cohesive class overall. Professors Wyman and Drixler are not the most effective team, and there is very little actual science taught in the class. I would still recommend GPPG, though, because overall it made me question the relationship between humans and other animals, the most effective ways to change societies, and the demographic shape of the future.",
