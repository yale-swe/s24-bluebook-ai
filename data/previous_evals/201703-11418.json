    "Prof. Bass does an excellent job of helping to organize the thesis-writing process, providing resources, and giving comprehensive and extremely helpful feedback. The meetings we had with other students writing their theses as well as the senior thesis colloquium were also extremely helpful. It was nice to not have a meeting each week (as some majors do for their theses) so that we had more time to write, but I would not have minded one or two additional workshops over the course of the semester."
