    "This is a class containing a lecture component provided by a professor specializing in the field they discuss coupled with a discussion component the following class. There is a weekly homework assignment based on the lecture and readings that is usually a topic of discussion in the second class.",
    "Yes",
    "Would prefer if HW questions were posted earlier and not due every Monday!",
    "This course offers both historical perspective and new advances on specific topics in immunology, through lecture, outside readings, and in-class discussion. I would recommend this course to another student who has a strong interest in immunology, as it exposes students to material that is not discussed extensively in the immunology survey course.",
    "It is a good course for me to broaden my knowledge and help me to think questions deeply."

   "comments": [
    "This course is important both for strengthening knowledge of immunological principles as well as providing a place for discussion and questions.",
    "Exposure to some niche aspects of immunological was just what I needed--I may not incorporate these unusual cell types or phenomena in my own experiments, but it's helpful to hear from the experts and gain a bit more understanding of their importance in the broaders sense.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of several areas in immunology that I would not have likely read about extensively in the course of my thesis research-- such as the role of B-cells in autoimmunity. It also helped me to learn more about the research and specialties of certain faculty members, which I believe will help me to establish collaborations as I develop my project further."
