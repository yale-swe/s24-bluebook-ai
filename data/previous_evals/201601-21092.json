   "comments": [
    "It's a good course to take to learn the basic concepts of operating systems. I would recommend this course.",
    "If you're looking for a class with practically no work, this is your class. 5 problem sets that each take about an hour. You also can get by just as easily without going to lecture. The material is hit or miss depending on the person, since some people are interested in operating systems and some not. That said, I personally enjoyed the material and the low workload, though given the price of tuition, this class most certainly was not worth 10-15 thousand dollars, since I was never doing anything for it.",
    "Take this if you must. Pay attention.",
    "I would recommend the course. I find operating systems interesting and this was a low stress way to learn more about them. No programming at all.",
    "Yes, I would. Definitely one of the easier CS electives, but one where you actually learn things and your grade is not subject to crazy swings or randomness if you study for the exams for long enough you can do well. The lectures are boring but you don't have to go. The p sets are easy and the exams are medium difficulty. The lecture notes are very good.",
    "Super gutty CS credit. I never went to class (most people did not), studied a couple days before the midterm and the final, and I think I did just fine. There were 5 homeworks that could be done in one or two hours each. The material is easy and straightforward with a lot of overlap from 323 (probably more than half was complete review). If you want a gutty CS credit that takes up almost no time throughout the entire semester, take this class. If you actually want to learn things, don't take it.",
    "Very chill class, pretty little work, though the final was kind of difficult. You do learn a bit about operating systems in general but probably a lot less than you would in the intensive fall class, which is expected considering how much less time this class takes and its lack of any programming. But not a bad class for how much work it requires.",
    "The material is interesting and good to know. Homeworks can be ambiguous but only takes about an hour every other week. Midterm was straightforward but the final seemed unfairly difficult. I wouldn't pick this class if you're looking for something intellectually stimulating or a quality class. Avi is very nice and approachable but sometimes unintelligible. He reads off of slides which are based off of the book he's written. Reading the textbook is equivalent to going to class.",
    "I wasn't told photographic memory was a prerequisite for the course",
    "Overview of operating system design concepts. Not too difficult, but you can learn a lot if you try.",
    "This is an easy CS elective that will also introduce you to some operating systems terms. I didn't know much about OS, so it was nice because I felt I still learned some useful things without having to put in much effort.",
    "Pretty easy course. Prof. Silberschatz lectures straight off his slides, so you don't really need to go to class. Good intro into what an OS is conceptually about. This class overlaps a lot of with the second half of the lecture material for 323"
