    "This was the second term of my full-year senior essay course. It was great, and was a very fulfilling experience to have before college was through. I'm glad I did it, and after all, writing one paper for two credits over the course of a year is not a bad deal at all.",
    "if you have an interesting topic in mind to think and write about, this is the course for you. you can replace one senior seminar with EOCN491 and continue with your senior essay with ECON492.the course is very flexible and depends a lot on what you put in.",
    "I definitely recommend doing an econ thesis because you can finally apply everything you've learned as being an econ major, and learn a lot of new and valuable tools, and write an original paper about something you are passionate about. Finally putting all the knowledge\/skills to practice was a very gratifying experience. Also, you learn a tremendous amount; so I would say majors who do the thesis and those who don't actually have significantly different levels of economics knowledge, and it almost seems odd that they are getting the same degree (assuming the person who does the thesis does not have 3\/4 A's (which is a very hard thing to do in the major)).",
    "Take it if you have a good research question and wish to find out answers for yourself. It is a rewarding but difficult process.",
    "write one if you have a good idea\/good data",
    "Writing a senior essay was a great experience, and I recommend it to all Economics majors. the department was very helpful, and made the process easy and enjoyable. Also, don't be worried about the grading. Economics is a tough field in which to perform original research as an undergraduate, and professors know this. Professors told us that they are more interested in our research process than our results, which allows room to take risks.",
    "It's the second semester of the two-semester Economics senior essay.I would recommend writing a one-semester essay in the first semester. It's much better to get it out of the way.",
    "It is a senior essay - everything you would imagine it to be. It was rewarding, but required a lot of work.",
    "It is a wonderful opportunity to apply your knowledge from your time at Yale to a question that really interests you. Don't worry if you don't have any experience, find an adviser who you feel comfortable with and it's a great opportunity to learn and challenge yourself. It is a very rewarding experience and I definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes. You'll grow.",
    "Do a senior essay. Whether it is a half or full year essay, you will be happy and more proud of your work than you could have ever imagined. I grew both as a student and a person. I was doing what I loved and studying under the person I chose. The experience was phenomenal, and even though I went into it with high expectations, they were undoubtedly exceeded. My essay and the skills I acquired are things that I will have forever. I had a lot of fun and got to explore one of my favorite topics while working with a fantastic advisor and Yale's amazing data analysis resources.",
    "Absolutely... it is nice to write about what you want and find a professor who is passionate about your research",
    "It's the senior essay. Good exposure to research in economics. Not much else to say.",
    "Write a senior essay! I loved it. That said, you have to be curious in the right sort of way to enjoy thinking about the same thing all year.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in economics and have some good research ideas that you feel passionate about.",
    "I thoroughly recommend writing a Senior Essay. The best way to really learn about the issues you are interested in is to learn by doing - and that is what the essay is an opportunity for.",
    "Definitely. Trust me. It's a completely different experience from taking a lecture or a seminar. The workload is manageable, just make sure you plan out before hand.",
    "I found it to be a very rewarding and worthwhile process. It can be time consuming and I'm sure adviser quality varies, but if you think you might want to, go for it. 2 terms of econometrics is useful.",
    "I never thought I'd write a senior essay, but it was the single best decision I made my senior year. Having a culminating work to look back on after graduation feels great. I should note, however, that you should pick a topic that interests *you*, not one that sounds \"good.\" (I know that sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised.) Having a topic that was personally salient was what kept me going through the year. Other students who got bored with their topics had a very difficult time finishing their papers.",
    "Yes if you are willing to be proactive and take on more than you think you need.",
    "Write the senior essay if you are considering graduate school or are willing to put in work and want to have a closer relationship with one of your professors or a more in-depth understanding of a topic in economics and the research process. I'm probably not going to graduate school for economics and didn't always enjoy the data work, but I am glad I did this overall because I feel like I understand research better."
