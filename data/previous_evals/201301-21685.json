   "comments": [
    "This is a good continuation to Musi 210. If you liked that you will like this. Manageable work load, and Chris is a great teacher. Unfortunately, he won't be teaching this course again since he is graduating.",
    "Yes, I think that this course is definitely an important one to take for music majors. To me, the courses goals and aims were the formal analysis of Beethoven Sonatas, Schubert's song cycle, and the introduction of the beginning concepts of chromatic harmony,",
    "Although this class is a little nichier than 205 or 210, I really enjoyed it and felt a firm grasp on advanced chromatic harmony by the end of the course. Chris Brody's a great lecturer and gives a good amount of work. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in furthering their music analysis or composition skills!",
    "In MUSI 211, you'll learn a lot about chromatic harmony. You'll start by analyzing some of the Beethoven piano sonatas, and then do an in-depth analysis of Schubert's song cycle \"Die Sch\u00c3\u00b6ne M\u00c3\u00bcllerin.\" After that, you'll go through a grab bag of chromatic techniques by analyzing Chopin Nocturnes and pieces by Schumann, Grieg, and others. In terms of assignments, you'll do some part writing earlier in the semester, and will focus more on larger, long term assignments later on like model compositions and analysis essays. I would absolutely recommend MUSI 211 to another student. You'll learn a lot about chromatic harmony, and you'll get to listen to and better understand a bunch of beautiful music!",
    "This class is a wonderful overview of 18th and 19th century harmony, covering sonata forms, lieder, chromaticism, and atonal music. We progress through Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, and other romantic composers in a lot of detail. We have two model compositions and an analytic essay, along with regular homework. This class is a wonderful continuation of Music 210, and I would highly recommend it."
