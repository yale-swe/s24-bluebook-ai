    "Interesting topic, nice class.",
    "A great course to learn and practice with historiography.",
    "Take this if you are confident in your Soviet-history knowledge. Historiography is tough without prior experience in the field. There are a lot of readings, so be prepared for that. The bulk of the work for the course (readings and responses) are not graded, which makes for a kind of directionless and at times stressful experience. The material is fascinating and the readings Professor Brinegar chooses are excellent, albeit numerous.",
    "Yes! Take this class if you're looking to sink your teeth into some interesting historiography and just talk about Russian history (which is always a little bizarre and endlessly fascinating). The class size, discussion structure, and final research project will give you plenty of room to follow your personal curiosities within the given time period. I would definitely recommend meeting with Prof. Brinegar before each assignment and reading through the sample papers she gives you -- especially if you've never done historiographical papers before, these resources will be super valuable!"
