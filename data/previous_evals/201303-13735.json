   "comments": [
    "It felt like high school. Too much material covered and an inadequate opportunity to show what you know on the tests. I think that someone with an undergraduate degree in a related field could ace this course without opening the text or attending a single lecture.",
    "Often too much slides for one course and not enough time to finish them all.But interaction with the class of some question and answer is really helpful for understanding the topic more deeply.",
    "This was a painful class to get through. I found it really boring (except for the topic on built environment). There were far too many slides and the exams were really tricky. It was not clear what we were supposed to study. I don't feel like I got a lot out of this course.",
    "I ENJOYED THE LECTURES, BUT THE DISCUSSION SECTIONS WERE A LITTLE BORING AND DID NOT SEEM TO COMPLIMENT THE LECTURES",
    "I would love to talk more about current issues - specific case studies would be awesome for wednesday class.",
    "The lecture portion of the class is pretty basic. It didn't push me hard academically, but I do think I learned a good bit and gained a more comprehensive picture of environmental health.The discussion sections were more valuable in the sense that Cathy does an excellent job of bringing issues to the table that we are likely to encounter as we go forward with our careers. Additionally, Cathy caters the discussion sections to appeal to all departments (SBS, EMD, etc.), which enriched what students get out of it.The lecture and discussion sections seemed slightly disjointed at first - I expected the discussion section to build on lecture. Instead, the lecture and discussion complement each other, which I think is probably better for students learning.",
    "The lecture portion could be improved. Very few people attended or even paid attention if they were there. Having the slides before class would have been helpful. The tests were also not at all indicative of what was learned by the students- 10 questions can not possibly cover 600+ slides per test.",
    "I think the slides were poorly organized and did not efficiently communicate the main takeaways of the material.",
    "I did not take anything away from this course that I did not already know prior to taking it. It was taught on a very low level. I was excited to learn about environmental issues, and I am very disappointed that this course turned me completely off of the subject. The only somewhat useful exercises came out of the take-home section assignments. It is unbelievable that this is a required course in a Masters level program.",
    "Strengths: enthusiastic professors, learned a lot about risk assessment& got a good overview of many environmental health issues, discussion was actually very helpful in understanding practical issuesWeaknesses: I spent a lot of time reviewing for the final and very little time on the midterm, but felt equally unprepared for both exams. The exams cover a giant amount of material from the lectures (typically 60+slides for each lecture), but the exams were only 30 minutes and had very few questions. Concepts should be tested, not small details.",
    "The lecture portion of the course covered too many topics with inadequate depth. It would have been more helpful if the lectures covered specific, important topics in environmental health more thoroughly. The activities in the discussion sections were not challenging. I would have preferred more in-depth discussions evaluating the articles in the reading assignments.",
    "The best part of this class is that even though environmental health is not a topic of particular interest in my career path, I got a lot out of this class and I'm glad I took it.The initial lectures were difficult to follow (the environmental science introduction lectures), but they became more organized and better after the original two. I also wished the section would more closely align with the lecture -- but this improved significantly as the semester went on.",
    "I really enjoyed the case studies approach to the sections. I felt like it really helped make some of the topics stick. And I really liked the variety of topics covered in lecture.I would have enjoyed a bit more focus to the lectures -- a deeper understanding of fewer topics. Also, it would have been interesting to see some of the core themes, such as risk assessment, more clearly carried through all of the lectures as they often were in section.I would suggest inviting others in to guest lecture for some of the topics, just as a way to break up the lectures. For example, someone from Rudd could give the lecture on food environment, someone from the law school could talk about legal issues in environmental health, someone from the forestry school could speak. Environmental health seems interdisciplinary, so it would be cool to see all the different sides of the issues.",
    "The sections were very engaging, and I found them to be a great addition to the otherwise boring lectures. The lectures had a tendency to drag on, and a lecture for one hour and 50 minutes is very long.",
    "I think the challenge of this course is providing students with a foundation for environmental health without making it too broad and simple. The topics covered are interesting, but I would have preferred to focus on fewer topics and gone more in depth versus trying gaining a superficial amount of knowledge about several topics. My preference is to be challenged, even if it's out of my area, and I feel like this course didn't challenge me.",
    "The discussion section was the saving grace of this course. The lectures were simply reading off of powerpoint slides. In addition, I was one of about 35 people who regularly attended class, which was completely unnecessary and I would have liked some at least incentive to attend. I had hoped that hint about carbon footprint being on the exam would have been a perk of attending class, but then it was emailed to the whole class. This did not exactly seem fair.",
    "Lectures are really straight forward, and can be a little bit hard to be engaged in. Discussions are helpful, but could be more interactive. (sometimes we just say what we think but there is little conversation or a chance to discuss at length)",
    "This felt like two different courses. I really disliked lecture but loved section. Environmental health is so big of a topic to cover in a semester-- I think it would be much more effective and well received to focus on current environmental health issues.",
    "Too many concepts covered in short amount of time and not in enough detail.",
    "I didn't learn much from this course...",
    "Best YSPH course yet.",
    "I actually really enjoyed this class. It was a nice overview of some of the major concepts and issues in environmental health.",
    "I thought that the class covered a lot of content very well. I especially enjoyed the sessions which taught me a lot about how to think about environmental health problems. I thought that the material assessed from the lecture focused a little too much on specific detail, but it gave me a good knowledge of environmental health issues.",
    "the lecture topics are very interesting and brought me lots of thoughts",
    "Lectures could be made more interesting. And brought guest lecturers.",
    "This course is really poorly designed. There needs to be more integration between the two professors... having 2 separate midterms is not a great system. The lectures jump all over the place from one topic to the next and feel like a high school enviro class. The in-class midterm had 10 very specific questions which I didnt feel was a good representation of the material. As one of the 20 students who actually came to class every time I still didnt know some of the answers to the questions.",
    "interesting materials and great discussion session",
    "Awful class! The lectures were incredibly boring and all over the place. They were very simple and I felt insulted (especially in beginning lectures) because I wasn't being challenged and felt like I was in a middle school science class. The professor, while kind, is a poor lecturer. The lectures often did not go along with the discussion sections, which were not that great either.",
    "It's a core course, and not my favorite one. I did not enjoy lectures - I found the slide decks to be hugely unorganized and not informative. They were very hard to study from.",
    "Lecture is a little be boring but section is great.",
    "strength is the professor has good knowledge and cares about content.weakness is it feels like two separate classes, very disjointed, focuses on specifics too much, especially on exams, doesn't give overall feel of what takeaway should be. since this is a core course, it should focus on issues relevant to all concentrations that we can apply to our work rather than such specifics that do not feel relevant.",
    "Strengths: the discussion sessions were a great platform to talk about the issues and they were interestingWeaknesses: lectures could get dry",
    "This course didn't offer an in-depth understanding of environmental health. I didn't feel like I got a lot out of lecture or the textbook--I did all of the reading. I did however really enjoy sections. Cathy gave excellent case studies that really helped me understand how environmental factors impacted health and the challenges we would face in addressing those health concerns.",
    "This was an interesting course, but was hard to stay engaged in because it covered so much material. Lectures had many slides that held a lot of information. When it came time to study for exams it was overwhelming the amount of information. I think it would be improved if topics were specified and more detail was put into certain areas of emphasis rather than all of the information.",
    "Lectures were long and boring",
    "It seems like I took two classes for one EHS course. There was a large divide between the class and the section. The EHS section was immensely enriching, and I learned a great deal through the papers, discussion, and assignments. However, the lecture was less enriching, as it fell far below the intellectual level of a graduate-level class. I wish the lecture had been more academic--for example discussing the latest research and papers from environmental health.",
    "It is a requirement, but if you've taken earth science, you probably already know everything.",
    "I really did not like this class overall. I was expecting something far more interesting and I came into the class looking forward to learning about current env health issues, but I felt like all that happened was information was pelted at me in a disorganized way. Sorry.",
    "It was a good fundamental course. The discussion session is especially helpful.",
    "Great balance and communication between the instructorsExcellent curriculum design",
    "The course is poorly organized. To start, the lecture portion is not engaging enough, with slides sets consisting of 50-90 slides, many of which are filled with text. I've never sat in a lecture that was this disengaging before. From what I've heard from past students this has not changed in the last two years, at least, and that' is incredibly frustrating to hear.Second, the exams need to change. This class and these exams were not the most difficult I've taken at YSPH, but I don't think the structure of the exam lends itself to real, sustained learning. It is basically a one page short answer\/fill in the blank, but there's no guidance as far as what to focus on, which leaves students with ~ 8, 50-90 page slide decks, plus the chapters to study from for this exam. So, what students end up doing is trying to cram all this information into their brains by test day, hope that they memorized the information she'll put on the exam, regurgitate what she wants onto the paper and then it's out of our minds faster than they all leave the lecture hall. How is this different from the tests we had in middle school? Even with YSPH's grading system, at the end of the day we are allmotivated to get the best grade we can (especially with their grading policy in this class, that only 65% of the class is allowed to get an H or HP - which is ridiculous and unfair in it's own right) and for many of us that means the plug and chug studying method described above - the same one that got us through middle school.On top of this, to make the test \"harder\" she will throw in little confusing nuances in the test questions (either that, or she is unintentionally making some questions confusing. I don't know which is worse - intentional or unintentional). On the final exam, a group of us stayed after to go over the answer questions and on almost every question there were at least two different ways it could have been interpreted. This is not the students fault - it's the teachers. What's worse is that if you get those questions wrong simply because of a misunderstanding, or you interpreted the question in a different way, your grade can go down quickly and sharply. This does not lead to an accurate testing of one's knowledge of the course. And, this is coming from someone who went to almost all of the lectures, outlined the notes, reached out to the professor for help, etc.I would rather have a longer (~hour long test), more difficult test, if that meant that we could have a more focused study guide and more fair questions. Making the test only a page long with fill in the blank\/short answer nuanced questions is not a gift to students; it reflects laziness on the part of the professor.As for the discussion section, I mostly enjoyed it. I felt that I learned more in this section than in the lecture. I thought the group work was great and the case homework gave me a chance to apply what we were learning in a semi-practical way. I have one complaint: 1) If anything, the section was not long enough. I felt that that by the time the instructor started the class (which was always on time) and we had a little discussion, there was little time for group work before we had to wrap it up and discuss, or we could have gone into more if we had more time for group work.Another complaint and suggestion for the entire course: the lecture and discussion run as two completely separate courses, with similar content. The grading is different, they try to link up as far as content, but the discussion doesn't necessarily make me learn the lecture material any better and vice versa. If this is going to continue, then I would designate 1.5 hours to the discussion section, because it is far better than the lecture and students learn more in the discussion.",
    "This is a pretty dull class. I'd recommend the instructor to take the Professional Skills seminar that we have to take, because her powerpoint presentations are abysmal. Literally just writes paragraphs on her slides. There's also no real way of telling what from the hundreds of slides will wind up on the in-class exams. The lack of excitement and feeling of relevance in the class kills any motivation to come to lecture and put in extra effort.",
    "Lectures very boring; discussion very good- readings were a little too scientific",
    "Strength- very difficult to cover such a large breadth of info. in one course, and we were able to briefly touch on many things. I did learn a few interesting things that I do think about in daily life...Weaknesses- lecture and power points should be less crammed with info., focus on a few major topics during class and have the book cover the rest. Make lecture mandatory as well- demoralizing to see fewer and fewer students each week (except for test days). Maybe have quizzes, etc.",
    "The lecture series was not engaging and the slide decks were way too long",
    "Material could be very interesting but the course was not engaging at all. A shame that it is a core class - YSPH should really make sure that its core classes are worth taking.",
    "The sections were really helpful in discussing the topics and learning. The lecture was too long and covered way too much material. It may be beneficial to cut the lecture and do it two times a week.",
    "The lecture component could be improved with more engaging lecture presentation. Maybe a case study based focus, using EHS analysis could be more of value to all students, regardless of ehs prior interest. Strength was in the discussions, the topics were interestings, and allowed practice of risk assessment, etc.",
    "Overall I think the course had the potential to be very interesting but too much was crammed into the lectures. I think it would have been easier to digest the material if there was a focus on a few key elements of environmental health e.g. global warming, fracking etc versus trying to cover all aspects. I found it particularly difficult to study for the exams because there was so much information covered. I walked away from the course feeling overwhelmed with all the information and not like I fully understood enough about any of the topics.The sections were very useful and the hands on nature allowed me to learn better. In some ways the course felt like two separate classes and I think the approach of the sections, where we were able to get more in-depth with certain topics was a more interesting and fulfilling way to learn and engage with the material.",
    "I learned so much",
    "This course is a very basic overview of environmental health. The book is quite good and provides a solid background understanding for the course material. The lectures are straightforward, although a little boring. The discussion sections were a mixed bag. The reading material was sometimes not directly relevant and way too detailed\/technical in some area; however, the discussion section small-group class projects were interesting and fun.",
    "The lectures were a little hard to follow since it seemed like just a string of facts rather than a cohesive lesson. The discussion sections seemed to have very little to do with the lectures.",
    "Very good basic course in environmental health. Good balance between lecture format and breakout work sections with assignments.",
    "This course is unfortunately the worst class I've taken in my academic career. Environmental health is so important and yet the lecture style and very clear disconnect between lecture and section instruction (and materials) made it very difficult to be actively engaged in the course -- it was easy to dismiss going to class in favor of reviewing the slides and text if necessary.Strongly consider making what is currently section the primary, 2-hour aspect of the course and what is currently the lecture an optional, weekly extra content Q&A section. Lecture slides and sections are more than sufficient for learning course material and feeling well versed with broad issues in environmental health.There were TOO MANY ASSIGNMENTS\/ EXAMS -- 4 take-home assignments for section, a midterm exam, and a final exam -- this exasperated the disconnect between lecture and section.Lastly, lecture exams included some random, nuanced questions that assessed little more than whether or not one hung off the lecturer's every word in lecture rather than one's understanding of the most salient, contemporary issues in environmental health as the course name suggests is the objective of the course.",
    "It's decent for a basic core class. Lectures can be pretty basic, but I did enjoy learning about the different forms of energy.",
    "I thought this course was useful. The subject matter was relatable, and though some of it seemed like a review or common sense, I enjoyed learning what I did from a public health vantage point. The lectures felt long at times.",
    "The connect of the course is great, but this class is not a Master's level course. The lectures have way too much information and are presented like high school ecology. That discourages students from wanting to take the course.Also, the exams are not reflective of the course content. Many of the questions were very open ended, but the instructor wanted specific answers.Environmental health sciences is such an important aspect of public health. It is a pity that students miss out of this content.The discussion sections were more interactive. I found most of them quite useful. If the lectures were more engaging, I think the discussion sessions would have been even",
    "The course material is very necessary to relay to students and should be required. Much of it covers topics this (our) generation has not been exposed to or does not confront anymore.I believe that the professor's slides need to be updated or streamlined as some of them seem to be data from years ago or just not very succinct.The lab section of the course is useful as it ties together the information of the lecture with the real world. Sometimes, however, it was unclear what was expected as far as answering the take home assignments given that the only material for this section was the readings and no summary materials. Nonetheless, the course was relevant as graduate students need to understand the real world applications and systems affecting health."

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Discussion is (Professor Yeckel) is a little bit better. It might be nice if we had more discussion about the readings. Maybe she could assign a small group to read extra careful and be more active in class discussion each week. That we at some people will be asked to give their take before we start on the group activities. The take home assignments are fun, it is really great to do the research because it helps us put together the lecture material and think about practical means.",

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Some of your homework questions are confusing. Please work on making them less so.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Needs a crash course in powerpoint presentation and public speaking. Also needs to do a better job of outlining the take-away points from a lecture and what to focus on for exam prep.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very knowledgeable and passionate, just didn't demand a lot of the students. Asking a large lecture hall to answer questions is awkward- the same 2 students answered every question, whereas a large # of students were on their computers the entire class...",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy was extremely engaging and excited about the material she made discussion section fun and interesting",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Put in a lot of effort, but often very confusing in phrasing of questions (both orally and written)",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She was always energetic and made sure to engage everyone in the section.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She did a great job of providing thorough feedback on assignments and making discussion sections engaging.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Catherine clearly spent time planning each section so that students could take away a lot from them. I enjoyed the hands on nature of the sections and the group work which Catherine encouraged. Overall her enthusiasm and knowledge was evident and made the sections interesting.Strengths: Clear enthusiasm, sections were organized and prepared well, made sure they were interactive, approachable.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel is so knowledgable! I enjoy listening to her talk about environmental health issues and bringing us together in group discussions. I really enjoyed learning from her",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is knowledgeable. She is also very pleasant and helpful. She appeared very anxious and intense at times. The material she was attempting to get across in the discussion sections was interesting. The readings she chose for the discussion sections were sometimes too detailed and technical in areas that were not directly relevant to the class. However, the small-group section projects that she designed were interesting and fun.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy was a very helpful instructor and really cared about students understanding the material in the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Excellent. Very helpful with work sessions. Homework assignments practical and relevant to the lecture material. Constructive feedback during in-class assignments.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Amazing instructor -- great energy, enthusiasm, and very intentional teaching style. It was clear that a lot of work was placed into bringing environmental health issues to life and drawing relevance from each of the public health disciplines of study at YSPH.Only weakness was that Professor Yeckel teaches a 1-hour section rather than the 2-hour lecture.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy was great!! She is very excited in section and I can tell she really wants to engage people. I thought she did a good job of making section fun.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Catherine was an energetic lecturer in section, whose passion for the material was evident. Sections were an enjoyable way to make sense of the weekly readings, and I enjoyed the group work. The experience felt collaborative and communal in large parts, and I thought it offered good ability to hone teamwork skills.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She is very sweet and has a lot of energy. She makes an extra effort to make the discussion sessions useful to the student. Some of the homework assignment questions could have been more relevant to the course.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel was enthusiastic about the material and provided useful information and feedback to students for the section.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0I'm pretty sure that she could not name a single student in her lecture. She clearly cares about the subject matter which I appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Abundant lecture contents.In class Q&A helped understand the topic deeply.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith is really nice and clearly passionate about environmental health. However the lectures were not really interesting and tried to cram too much in.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Not the most dynamic lecturer. Slides were a bit cluttered.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Informative!",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith does a great job of conveying a very wide range of information to students throughout the semester. I sometimes wondered how she knew so much about so many topics. I also felt very comfortable approaching her with questions and she seemed very open to feedback as well.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Lecture style could be improved to make more students interested\/ involved during the class",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0NA",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Good overview of EHS",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Little information beyond common knowledge was conveyed in class. The slides were disorganized and hard to read. I never knew what the main takeaways were when I left a class or what information was really useful. The class was not engaging nor informative.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Enthusiastic about the material and has a good sense of humor. Lecture slides should be trimmed down a bit and should be more focused. This may help keep students interested and attendance up.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe's lectures contained too many details and specific examples about a broad range of environmental health issues without thoroughly explaining basic concepts and issues in public health. Exams tested students' ability to recall lists of examples rather than their understanding of environmental health concepts.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She was a good lecturer and her lectures became more and more interesting as the semester went on. The only thing I would suggest is being a little more clear on our expectations. Sometimes the exams felt like there were no objective components, so what we were and weren't expected to know was sometimes difficult.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She was very prepared for lectures and followed the book topics which gave the course a nice structure. I would have liked for the lectures to be a bit more engaging with students.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0she was a bad lecturer, no variation in her tone.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Prof. Stowe was good. She was an informative lecturer but her lectures could be extremely boring.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe is great; I would just encourage her to try to reorganize the class to be more in depth per my comments above.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith was very nice, but lectured directly off of the slides. I also would have liked any a tiny incentive to attend class.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Lectures can be a little hard to engage in. A lot of the material is given out in a long list. The topics areinteresting and well divided among all the sessions we met. The in class tests are sometimes really hard to understand, some of the questions tend to be ambiguous because the descriptions can be extremely short.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Lectures were painful to get through. Covering so much material, I don't think it was entirely Meredith's fault. I really feel like this course should be restructured to focus and go in depth on certain issues not try and cover them all.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Lecture was too broad in scope and tried to cover too many topics. Instructor was not really encouraging of participation and even dismissed students' answers which was discouraging to many of us",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She is nice. But it helps if she can provide us with some outline of her sessions. It is hard to guess her thoughts sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She knows her material really well, and has great relevant stories.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0From comparing this semester's experience to what I heard from friends about last year's class, she has improved a lot. I thought she was very fair with the midterm and final, and her lectures were fairly interesting.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Was very accessible and provided good example",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Kind of boring. Lectures",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Laughed at students answers to questions.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She is very knowledgeable and the lectures are well organized.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Very poor lecturer! The slides need to be better organized. While studying for the exam and looking back on the slides, I realized how poorly organized it was and just seems to jump all over the place. I don't get how if every year, less and less students show up to class, nothing is changed. Lectures are extremely boring and drag on. The material is very simple. A strength of the lectures however is that the examples that she talked about at the end of the powerpoints were super interesting! I would suggest sticking to 1-2 each class and going deeper into them rather than just jumping from each one very quickly.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0HORRIBLE SLIDE DECKS. Meredith is also discouraging to people who try to engage in class discussion.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0does not make concepts feel relevant.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith is friendly and speaks well in lecture. She tried to encourage class participation in lectures, perhaps this could be enhanced.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0I didn't feel that Professor Stowe was engaged during lecture and oftentimes when she was asked questions, she was unable to give adequate answers.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith presented the material well, although rushed through some topics and didn't cover all of others.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Best part of the course was recitation on Wednesdays!! Thank you you saved the course. I learned so much from section. You are a great instructor!!",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She basically read her slides for 10 weeks",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0I really disliked the lectures. The instructor, Prof Stowe, is a fairly nice person but a terrible lecturer. She repeatedly failed to capture the attention of the majority of the class, with only about 20-30 people showing up each lecture, which was only once a week. She is way way too anecdotal while also relying on overly wordy slides that she often did not finish by the end of class. The thing I disliked the most about her teaching style, aside from pointless stories, was that when she called on people to answer questions, she would scoff at their answers if she did not think they were good enough. She would sort of laugh or get an attitude, sometimes saying phrases like, \"And? So\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\" or \"Okay\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\" in a mocking sort of way. It is hard to reproduce her tone of voice in writing, but I will say that I felt this was pretty rude. In lecture classes, even at the graduate level, students may feel shy to speak up or offer ideas in front of other people for fear of giving the wrong answer or being deemed stupid. So when your professor belittles your answer or laughs at it, it does make you shy to reply going forward. I don't feel shy speaking up in class but after several times of offering answers and getting shut down, especially when the answers were correct, I just became really disinterested in answering or even paying attention. I was a lot less invested because I thought she was so rude. I know I am not the only person who feels this way based on conversations with other people.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She made the course material easy to understand. But it would be better to shorten the slides so students know where the real focus is.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Both are excellent",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Please make your slides and lectures more engaging. The subject matter is very interesting but it needs to be taught in a better way. The 50-90 page slide decks need to go, and you need to provide more focused direction for the final exams and stop writing confusing final exam questions.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0There were many moments in class when Meredith would ask the class vague questions with a very specific answer in mind. As to be expected, she got black stares. I understand she was trying to engage her audience and get us to think critically, but her tactic usually fell flat.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Section was actually fun. Learned a lot, even though some of the exercises were a little elementary.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Lectures did not end up being interactive with questions and were often dry and long",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Nice, but lectures were a bit dry, didn't like lecture style",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She was really nice and helpful outside of class. I felt that her lecture was a little long sometimes though.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0The material covered was potentially interesting, and her assessments were a fair review of lecture, however each lecture covered alot of material so it was hard to follow, maybe a focus on fewer topics\/cases in each lecture would make the material more accessible for students.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith was clearly very knowledgeable and able to convey information to the class well. However, I found the slides to be a little confusing at times",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Professor Stowe surely loves the environment more than she loves anyone else. She can tell you all these stories on environemntal health issues and you begin to notice changes in yourself in daily life - you notice more about the environment because of her teachings. Excellent professor and lovely woman. Thanks for a great semester",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe is knowledgeable. She is also very pleasant and helpful. Her lectures were very basic and straightforward, as were her tests. The book she chose for the course is a good one. On the down side, she often treated the class somewhat like children in asking very basic questions, such as \"What is mechanization?\".",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith was helpful i teaching the material when you ask her, however, she should try to organize the lectures a bit better.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Very good lecture format. Asked questions of the class. Slides were very clear and relevant.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0No comment",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith was good but soooo many slides. The exams were kind of hard because sometimes she would ask one question - worth about 20% of the exam grade - that covered 1 or 2 of the slides from a deck of 300 you had to review. I spent a good 4-5 hours studying for first test and still got a B\/HP because I missed a slide when reviewing.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith had good knowledge of environmental health material. She worked hard to ensure class participation and student engagement. Perhaps as a result of the time of day, lectures could feel a bit long, but I felt like I learned many valuable lessons from her.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She is a nice lady. However, the lectures were not good. There was way too much information. The lectures sometimes had 50 slides. 50 slides!? And most of them were full of text. It would have been better to focus on less topics and discuss them more thoroughly.The test questions were not a good reflection of the course content due to the information overload.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe had a breadth of knowledge on environmental and occupational health and was open to comments from students."

    "Cathy's sections are great.",
    "For students first step into public health, I think some basic concepts from this course really fulfilled us the aspect from the environmental side of public health, so it is really recommended to take the course at the very first semester.",
    "Really boring. I would not recommend it.",
    "GREAT WAY TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT HAS ON PUBLIC HEALTH. INTERESTING A DIVERSE TOPICS.",
    "You have to take it, but likely won't enjoy it.",
    "I think another course that focused on a specific topic of the environment would be more beneficial for our EHS requirement",
    "Unfortunately it is a required course. At least section is a little better than the class itself.",
    "Good survey course on environmental issues. Although not very engaging at times, the material is very important so I would recommend it.",
    "This is a survey course of environmental health. It is a fairly subjective class and not very difficult, although reading the papers for section helps a lot. I would recommend taking it.",
    "This course is an overview of basic concepts in environmental health. The information is fairly basic, but that means the course is not difficult.",
    "This course is a good, broad course that covers how human health is impacted by a number of environmental factors. It can be boring in lecture but the sections are good.",
    "This is a required course and you will need to just deal with the lecture and look forward to section will allow you to have a real-world experience.",
    "It is great material to know, and the course gets you started on thinking how to apply these concepts and what to do in the real world. Definitely a course to take even if it is not required.",
    "It is a requirement. I barely went to lecture because it felt like 5th grade science class but discussion is very interesting.",
    "Awesome course that will be relevant for the rest of my career in public health.",
    "This was a basic introduction to the major issues in EHS, and it was pretty low-key and interesting.",
    "Not recommended for policy and management students",
    "Unfortunately this class is required.",
    "A very very poor class. I have heard terrible things about toxicology too, so unfortunately this is just a class you have to take. It needs a lot of improvements. There is poor communication between the two professors, and both the lecture and section are a waste of time. Very few people actually go to class and the weekly homework is easy. The in class exams are a little tricky, especially if you didn't go to class.",
    "I will recommend this course.",
    "I took it because of the MPH requirement, otherwise I wouldn't have",
    "This wasn't an engaging course and I didn't feel like I learned a lot. It wasn't very challenging and didn't take much time each week, even though I did all the readings. Section was much more interesting and engaging than lecture and was where I learned the most.",
    "Good class with interesting content but frustrating at times",
    "Environmental Science is an interesting and important topic however the information is presented poorly in this class. Most students only came to section. The book is a waste of money",
    "Theclass is dichotomized into a lecture and a section, which provide entirely different elements to the class. The lecture takes a topical approach and discusses issues at about a 9th grade level. The section is much more academic in nature, and provides a time to discuss the latest academic research in environmental epidemiology. Overall, it was a decent course because of the intellectual value of the section.",
    "Take it when you have a heavy course load.",
    "NO. This was my least favorite class all semester and by the end, I dreaded going (even though I did go to every class).",
    "It was a good fundamental course. The discussion session is especially helpful.",
    "Course is broad, does a good job covering a lot in a semester",
    "I would say: \"I really hope they changed the structure of this course in a meaningful way. If not, it's a requirement, so good luck.\"",
    "Wouldn't recommend this class, but guess what, YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT!!",
    "Pretty easy; boring; do-able",
    "Required, not difficult, and neither lecture nor textbook are required to do well.",
    "Everyone has to take this class so comments here don't really matter. Didn't go to class after the midterm.",
    "I would recommend this class for students with an interest in related EHS issues",
    "I would summarize the course as one course that actually feels like two separate courses and that skims over the essentials of environmental health. I would not recommend it because I did not feel like I walked away feeling overwhelmed with the amount covered in each lecture and did not feel like I was able to fully engage with the topics. I would say that the sections were more satisfying than the lectures.",
    "This course is a very basic overview of environmental health. The book is quite good and provides a solid background understanding for the course material. The lectures are straightforward, although a little boring. The discussion sections were a mixed bag. The reading material was sometimes not directly relevant and way too detailed\/technical in some area; however, the discussion section small-group class projects were interesting and fun.",
    "I thought this course presented us a lot of new material, however, it wasn't presented very well.",
    "Very good foundation course in environmental health and occupational risk. Format and slides were easy to follow. Textbook was appropriate and contain supporting materials.",
    "This course presents broad issues in environmental health. It is unfortunately a core requirement unless toxicology is of interest. Look into revitalizing Applied Risk Assessment as an option for fulfilling the Environmental Health degree requirement.",
    "Probably only take it if you have it, but it's alright.",
    "This course was a nice complementary course to my other first semester courses. The lighter workload and laid back approach kept stress levels relatively low, so I was happy to have taken the course in a subject matter I did not have much information about.",
    "The course needs a lot of improvement.",
    "This course gives an overview of environmental health topics that have faced our society in the last century or so, including topics such as manufacturing, agriculture and energy."
