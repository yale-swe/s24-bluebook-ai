   "comments": [
    "It is definitely a great class and I would recommend it to another student if you have an interest in neurological diseases. However, you probably need",
    "I would 1000% recommend this class to another student. It fulfills your upper level elective requirement for the MCDB major and, for those doing the neuro track, is very specific to potential career paths. I am walking away from this class with knowledge on just about everything that could go wrong in the brain as well as an understanding of just how little we really know. Neuroscience is a really exciting field right now, so for students who want to learn about it, it is honestly my favorite course I've taken. As a warning, there is a LOT of reading (two or three long science papers per lecture) but the course assignments were super manageable and honestly really enjoyable.",
    "It is a great class for learning more about neurological disorders. If you lack preparation in cell biology or neurobiology, you may struggle to follow with concepts. But there are amazing lectures who are masters of the fields they are in so you'll definitely be introduced to a lot of exciting topics and concepts.",
    "NSCI 507 is a really chill class without too much workload and is good for learning about the research behind a number of diseases. The only assignments are two papers, two discussion sections, and reading a couple papers before each lecture. Will and Sree are both pretty good professors and you learn a lot about neurological diseases and problems with research papers.",
    "If you are interested in going through a series of crash courses on important neurological diseases, this is the definitely the course for you! I really enjoyed it both as a training neuroscientist and lover of science. The course needs some improvements but they are largely dependent on the class and who ends up being part of the discussion.",
    "I would recommend it. However, you'd probably need to know some basic neuroscience if you'd like to take the course. I hardly have any neuroscience background, so understanding a lot of the terminology was quite a task. It would help to have some background knowledge.",
    "Definitely need biochemistry and genetics\/molecular biology if you're an undergrad trying to take this. It's cool that you get to hear from a different expert every class but the papers you have to read every week can be hard to get through if your background isn't very strong.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, but know it's a lot of work involved with lots of readings. The material talked about is really fascinating, however, and it's super cool to hear about the new findings of the field from the people who are working on finding them right now.",
    "A discussion based class in which you have to be comfortable reading lengthy science articles from high-profile journals. You must also be comfortable asking questions and engaging in discussion in order for the class to be a meaningful experience. That being said, those students who are motivated enough to do all that will find this to be a great opportunity to learn from excellent researchers and clinicians in the field of neuroscience.",
    "If you have an interest in clinical neuroscience or in neurobiology research, this is a golden class. The lecturers that Sree and Will bring in are all among the leading experts in the world on the condition or disease they present to the class. The papers we read are very current and definitely serve to inform our understanding of the mechanisms behind these illnesses that you hear about in the news all the time. The meat of this course is the discussion, so don't take it if you aren't prepared to be engaged. Every student has to present one paper of their choice and act as the discussion leader for another student's presentation, which makes you somewhat of an expert on some very particular research innovation from a recent publication. The expects a fair amount of biology and chemistry background, so make sure you are prepared to take it, since the learning curve is particularly high. You'll be reading state of the art scientific literature - it's easy to get lost if you aren't prepared.",
    "I had a lot of fun with this class. It may help to have taken neurobio first, because you don't get much background knowledge from the class before diving into papers, but the discussions are fun and informative. The papers are a little stressful because you don't receive much direction, but it's a good class and a great MCDB upper level if you're an undergrad."

   "comments": [
    "It definitely reinforced my interest in the nervous system and my desire to explore more in-depth as I continue on from here and in my next phase of life. I learned so much and very glad I took it.",
    "Since I am on the neuro track in the MCDB major, this class had a significant impact on my knowledge in this discipline for all the reasons listed in previous answers.",
    "The course certainly deepened my knowledge of neuroscience research. I feel more able to critique papers and to design my own experiments in the future. I wouldn't say the various guest lectures helped to deepen my knowledge of research. I think they were more useful in providing a broad survey of how different neurological disorders work. The student presentations and comments from the professors were most helpful, in my opinion.",
    "I am an undergraduate, so it increased the breadth of my understanding about neurological disease, but not too much in the depth department.",
    "It allowed me to tackle neuroscience from the lens of diseases I had not previously spent time investigating. My focus has been on autism for my entire undergraduate career. It was helpful to have a crash course in several other disease that both share and do not share similarities with autism to gain a better understanding of neural pathology.",
    "This course definitely expanded my knowledge of molecular biology, especially with regards to the nervous system, something I had hardly considered before.",
    "I can't say it has specifically helped me with my dissertation\/own research, but I have definitely gained valuable insight into the field in general, as well as another more broader perspective on how to conduct research\/the methodology.",
    "This course helped familiarize me with as well as introduce me to techniques that leading researchers are using in the lab to study the complex neurological diseases of our generation. This research background will help me in my future lab work and probably down the road to becoming a clinician as well."
