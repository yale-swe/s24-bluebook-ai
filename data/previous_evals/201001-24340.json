    "I would recommend Czech to any language student because it is challenging, fun, and most of all, different. It is not a \"middle of the road\" language like a Spanish or French, for example.",
    "I would definitely recommend Czech if you are interested in learning a new language which many at first overlook. The workload is tough but very managable, however, this is no different than other L1\/L2 classes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Take this class. Best class I have had at Yale so far. Professor Von Kunes does a great job of mixing grammer and readings to make learning the language interesting",
    "I would most definitely recommend Czech level 2 to a fellow student. It is a very thorough course and great for students interested in learning an Eastern European language. The professor is very competent and it is evident that she is very passionate about the subject."
