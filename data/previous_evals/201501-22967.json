    "Prof Ahrendt is an excellent seminar leader who directs the discussion with skill and intent. She is an expert in the topic area. The material is deeply interesting, and will transform the way you think about the issue. Prof Ahrendt also provides strong feedback about your writing; the course assignments are very well-scaffolded. Good use of guest speakers as well.",
    "This course exposes students to a new and burgeoning field. It was a pleasure to combined two seemingly disparate topics in one open course. Individual topics range from past to present and will continue to be relevant in the future.",
    "Pretty good course, recommend it only if you're interested specifically in diplomacy or music diplomacy. If you're just looking to take a music related course, there's def better ones.",
    "A good freshman seminar if you're interested in music, politics or both! Not too high on workload (the 15 page paper kills towards the end but was fun to work on) and could be a good fifth class.",
    "yes, its a different way of seeing diplomacy and music.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to another student. This was my favorite class this past year because the class discussions were always fascinating, the professor is absolutely amazing, and, overall, the material opened my eyes to a new sphere of diplomacy."
