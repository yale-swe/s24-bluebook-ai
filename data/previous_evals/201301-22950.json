   "comments": [
    "If you like technical cognitive sciency stuff and linguistics take it. Otherwise it is boring and tests are hard. Not much work though.",
    "Be careful! The first few lectures during shopping period are engaging and interesting, but a few more weeks in the lectures are laden with computational jargon and complicated technical processes that are CONFUSING for someone who's never taken cog sci or linguistics classes.",
    "It is a bit intimidating because all of the tests are multiple choice (with a few free response questions). And before enrolling, shop the class and see if the material will really interest you or not. Lectures may seem a lot longer than 95 minutes if they do not.",
    "The class is interesting. It keeps linguistics at a manageable and interesting level, especially for potential cog sci majors who want an introduction without being overwhelmed. Bob Frank is an incredible lecturer and keeps the material lively.",
    "Skip to the last paragraph for a breakdown of what the course actually entailed for us. Skip to bottom for tl;dr version.This is a great course to take if you're like me, looking for a social science credit that isn't intro-psych and intro-econ. What's nice about cog-sci is that it's a relatively new field, and so there are many arguments proposing equally likely point-of-views, so the course gives you an opportunity to flex your critical-thinking skills. It's also a really great course to take if you're struggling with a foreign language class at Yale, because it'll explain in detail why you are struggling. The professor (Robert Frank) is very engaging with his material. The material ranges from being somewhat philosophical to rather mathematical at times, so I feel like everybody found at least one part of the material boring, but the professor's enthusiasm made it bearable. (I personally found the focus on syllabification to be somewhat lacking in \"awesomeness factor\").If you've taken a computer programming course (or just know how to program) and if you have some knowledge of statistics, then the last third of the course will be exceptionally interesting. However, if you don't know these things (or don't like them) then the course will end off in a rather difficult and annoying manner for you. When you shop the course, pay attention to the syllabus and make sure that parts which seem boring won't ruin the course for you. The TA's were also good. They knew what they were doing and their review sessions were helpful for the exams.The grade is broken down into 3 non-cumulative exams (25% each) and 3 homework assignments (25% altogether). The 3 exams are all the same (including the \"final exam\" which is really just a third mid-term). The non-cumulative nature divides the workload into easily manageable chunks (you still have to study for them though, this class does require work and is not a gut). The first homework was painfully dreadful (essentially conducting a perceptual experiment on yourself and analysing data which took about 9 hours straight for me) but the second and third homeworks were short, and gave you the opportunity to read some real literature relating to the material. There are readings assigned, which certainly help with understanding the material, but the tests didn't test on any of the readings: instead they tested only on the lecture material. The slides were posted, but themselves not very helpful without knowledge of the lecture, so class attendance is important.tl;dr: The class isn't easy but it's certainly manageable. 3 exams, 3 homeworks, unnecessary (but helpful reading), going to class is SUPER important (so don't take this class if you plan to skip every lecture)",
    "Absolutely! This was a really great course. I took it Cr\/D\/F just because it was my sixth class but I wish I'd taken it for credit because doing well is fairly simple -- go to lecture and do (some of) the reading and you'll be golden. Professor Frank is really, really nice and what's rare is that he actually cares and will take time out of his schedule (which is pretty busy considering he's the head of the department) to talk with you and make sure you get the material. This is no doubt one of the best PSYC credits you could possibly take: involved\/engaging professor, genuinely interesting material (which is uncommon for PSYC; most classes just teach you common sense\/what you already know), and fair evaluations. Go for it.",
    "This class is very interesting at times and extremely dry at others. Professor Frank is a great teacher, although even his teaching can be overshadowed by the dullness of some of the material. However, when the class hits on something interesting it is REALLY interesting. Lots of ups and down depending on the topic. Tests questions are often very tricky and you can do fine without knowing much, but it will be hard to do exceptionally well without putting in some serious time.",
    "I thought this was a neat class to take if you aren't a cogsci major and don't want a big workload. The lectures were interesting and he provided necessary background (which wasn't much if you've taken intro cogsci or psych). The assignments were practical for the most part, and the tests were mostly multiple choice",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who's a cog sci or psych major because this class probably wouldn't be appealing to someone who doesn't like to read psych papers",
    "This is a very good introduction to the cognitive science aspects of linguistics. It is very idea based not detail based class, and the tests represent that well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! The material is fascinating, and Professor Franks is a great lecturer. It was accessible for someone who has no background in linguistics and cognitive science. There was a universal theme to the information, but we covered a variety of topics, so classes were never repetitive.",
    "The big questions asked in the class are \"Do humans have an innate faculty for language?\" and \"Does language influence the way you think about the world?\". In trying to answer these questions, the class can get really in depth, which isn't a bad thing. However, if the idea of spending an entire class period discussing the structure of a syllable turns you off, don't take it. I personally thought it was nice to really understand something for once, instead of just brushing by main ideas. In terms of grading, work, etc., it's pretty standard. If you like it during shopping period, it stays mostly the same. I enjoyed it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It's a really good intro course that has a lot of interesting real-life connections. I really like professor frank (not so much the TFs for this semester) The only thing is that there is a lot of reading material; however you can skim these papers, and the important studies are usually covered in lecture.",
    "Cognitive Science of Language is definitely a linguistics class before all else, so if you're looking for a class that mostly deals in psychology but connectsCog Sci to linguistics, this isn't the class for you. If you're looking for an interesting survey in a number of topics of linguistics, though\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically looking to learn how humans share a universal capacity for language, whether our language capacities\/our particular languages affect the way we see the world, etc.\u00e2\u0080\u0094this would be a great class to take. It's full of cool studies, and it's not particularly work intensive: just a couple readings from the linguistics literature for each class, a couple homework assignments, and three non-cumulative exams. Professor Frank is also a great instructor, eager to help you learn linguistics, a field that he is CLEARLY passionate about.",
    "The first part was much better than the rest.",
    "As a senior cog sci major, I wish more than anything that this class had been offered when I was a freshman, because it is just what both the Cog Sci and Linguistics departments need. Cog Sci of Language is a super-interesting, broad survey of concepts at the intersection of these two big fields, and anyone interested in either would do well to take this and get their mind a little blown.It was clear that this class had never been taught before thanks to a few snafus (some dull spots in lecture; a welcome failure to deliver on the 5-to-6-problem-sets promise), but another year or two and this should absolutely be a mainstay of both departments. Yay!",
    "I'd recommend it. The material is interesting on the whole, though it can be boring at times if you don't have a particular interest in linguistics. Prof. Frank is a good lecturer and I'm glad I took the course - I learned a lot about an interesting topic that I hadn't had a chance to study before. There were a fair number of readings and a few assignments, but the workload was far from overwhelming. Exams (including the final) were not cumulative.",
    "Cognitive Science 216 is a pretty good class. It's very interesting, and somewhere between an introduction to linguistics and a focused linguistics course. I didn't take it for any particular reason - other than a passing interest - but I'm sure students more interested in linguistics would like it very much.",
    "It's a lot of reading, as any cogsci class is. Take if you are interested in language\/linguistics. Otherwise you might regret.",
    "Take it if you think the topics sound interesting. An okay class - very interesting at points, very boring at points.",
    "This was by far the worst class I have taken at Yale. Poorly structured and poorly taught. It was a nightmare. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This is a really good intro course for those who are interested in linguistics and cognitive science! Professor Frank is fascinating.",
    "Those expecting an overview of the linguistic approach to CogSci may be disappointed, but the material is interesting enough.",
    "This class is targeted much more towards linguistics majors than CogSci majors, and I would only take it if you had a strong interest in at least one of those areas. I took this course as an intro course with no intention of continuing studies in either of the areas, and that was a mistake. It was also the first year the course has been taught, so I have hope that it will improve in future years- the lectures tend to be boring, though the readings are usually interesting.",
    "This course explored many different aspects of the cognition of language, and I believe it was a great introduction to these topics for me. I would definitely recommend The Cognitive Science of Language to anyone interested in the field of Cognitive Science or Linguistics. It wasn't too heavy in either area.The exams were mostly multiple choice and not too tricky if you were familiar with the material."
