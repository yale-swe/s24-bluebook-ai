   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Well taught, clearly taught.",
    "very very content heavy, sometimes I felt like some of the knowledge I was being tested on wasn't particularly important in terms of the goals of the course. However, the range of content was very satisfying. There were many examples to accompany concepts to help remember and apply them better.",
    "Strengths of this course include the professor, Dr. Donoghue (!!!!), taking a trip to the Peabody Museum and having a \"behind the scenes\" look at species in the environmental center. No weaknesses.",
    "Nothing to improve really.",
    "Michael Donoghue is an excellent lecturer and is obviously super engaged with the material. He made lectures very enjoyable. Sadly, he's not teaching this class next year, but I think it's still significantly better than the other bio modules. EEB is a broader way of looking at biology (i.e. involves much less memorization of metabolic processes), so it's like a nice, relaxing light at the end of the tunnel that is 103. The midterm still requires quite a bit of studying, since details about evolutionary relationships are a pretty heavy focus, but it's definitely manageable and even kind of fun. The course also involved two activities at the Peabody, which I honestly kind of dreaded at first but which turned out to be really cool. I thought that the lectures were very well organized, not too information-heavy, and genuinely interesting. The papers we read in section were also neat and very relevant to what we talked about in lecture. Overall a very solid course.",
    "Strengths: Class lectures were engaging, and the professor always gave students the opportunity to ask questions. Sections were also engaging; the TAs were very helpful at explaining the details of papers that we read for homework.",
    "Studying at Marsh Gardens and at the Peabody Museum exposes students to evolutionary and ecological concepts in a more concrete way.",
    "It was taught by a great professor, although information not always laid out on slides",
    "i liked the organization of it. very organized. exams were good - tested things from slides (although they were quite specific)",
    "This course is definitely the best of the 4 bio sequences. Professor Donoghue is great and the entire teaching team was also so helpful.",
    "The strength is Dr. Donoghue, it is sad that he won't be teaching again. He really cared about his students and the subject.",
    "Professor Donoghue is incredible, and the material itself is incredibly interesting",
    "I don't think there's much to be improved....the material was interesting, the pace was good, and I especially liked the field trips. The only thing I'd ask is that we get to do two field trips so we get to go to Marsh Gardens and the Peabody",
    "This was an amazing course-- really liked how all the information was given in a \"story.\" Study guides would be nice, but really great overall.",
    "strengths: Professor Donoghue is the best lecturer of the bio sequence, but he's not teaching it anymore weaknesses: not enough practice for exams, not enough feedback on writing material",
    "The course is taught very well, and the content is generally interesting. However, tests focus too much on memorization of specific concepts from lecture and not enough on conceptual ideas.",
    "I thought it was very well run and very well taught. Changing anything would be catastrophic.",
    "Well taught, interesting, not an insane about of work.",
    "I liked how the course was easy to understand and how there were no weekly quizzes. The fact that the midterm and final each covered half the semester's content was helpful. However, I would have liked to have a practice exam for the final, as well as receive more structured guidance about the clade and trait paper.",
    "A strength is that the course offers enrichment for students who don't feel as prepared and it is very helpful.",
    "I would have liked to see more complete slides. It is not always possible to remember every lecture and there was so much important stuff spoken by mouth.",
    "I loved this class; Donoghue was a fabulous teacher who was really passionate about making sure his students enjoyed the class (LEARN FROM HIS EXAMPLE, CHEM 136L). All of the tours\/scavenger hunt were really cool. The only thing I would say is that the assignments are kind of stacked toward the end, with the scavenger hunt\/clade paper\/reading response\/final all due within like a week of each other. Maybe the scavenger hunt at least could be opened a bit earlier in the semester to give students more time?",
    "I thought it was a great course that didnt need improvement.",
    "The content of the course was not overwhelming, but some concepts were difficult to understand or difficult to get into if you weren't necessarily a STEM major.",
    "Strengths: Like other BIOL professors, Donoghue had a lot of material to over, but unlike some other BIOL professors, he took his time in presenting the material, ensuring that we understood the important concepts, to the extent that if he didn't finish the material for one topic, he would spend half of the next lecture finishing it. The review sessions Donoghue held were also very helpful. The course itself is very well organized, with the due dates of assignments posted weeks in advance, allowing students to complete them at their leisure. Thus, credit must be given to both Professors Donoghue and Park for the fantastic organization of this course. Weaknesses: Sorry, I can't think of one.",
    "Some assignments (such as the clade\/trait paper) did not seem necessary and did not help reinforce class material. Future improvements might include more activities and assignments that draw directly from the class material such as problem sets in place of writing assignments. In addition, the class material seemed to be disconnected and choppy at times. Better organization would help the material flow.",
    "Professor Donoghue's lectures and obvious passion for the course material were the strongest part of the course. There was some overlap with high school biology in content, more so than previous modules, so the challenge level of the course could probably be increased a bit.",
    "This course was very interesting to learn. The slides posted could have higher definition so I could read the smaller font sizes.",
    "Prof was great and engaging in lecture, but sometimes lectures could be a bit dense.",
    "I loved how Michael was able to engage so well with the class without compromising comprehension of dense material. His constant motivation and passion for his work was inspiring, and I couldn't have asked for a bette biology professor.",
    "The strength of the course was having a midterm and final. I don't think the quizzes were necessary for this course.",
    "The information presented in the lectures were interesting and digestible. The variety in the style of assignments allowed us to explore different concepts within our own interests. I found that the course was mostly focused on memorization and I would have appreciated different forms of more analytical approaches to the concepts discussed in class during our exams.",
    "Interesting",
    "Strengths: the course was interesting and the professors were good (donoghue was very passionate, julie was great in organizing the course as always). Weakness: I did not like the emphasis on memorization.",
    "There was really nothing wrong about this course. Maybe one thing that could be improved is discussion sections not taking the entire time going over a journal article, especially if we only need to know the overarching concepts from the paper. There should be like 15 minutes set aside to ask questions about anything.",
    "This course was much, much better taught than the rest of the intro BIOL sequence -- the lectures were really engaging and the professor took time with questions and answered really clearly. The homework assignments were manageable, directly related to the material from lecture and interesting. The exams could be improved as they were essentially all regurgitation of specific examples from lectures, which was frustrating as this seems to favour memorisation over actual understanding of the material.",
    "There is a lot of information you need to memorize and the PPTs could have it laid out simpler",
    "Fairly graded. Many chances to improve grade.",
    "strengths - engaging lecturer",
    "The course information was very interesting and the Professor Donoghue was an amazing lecturer!",
    "Personally I think the actual of order of the slides could be more organized. While Prof. Donoghue summarizes the point of every lecture it feel pretty scattered in concept and not as cohesive as it could have easily been",
    "Discussion sections and the TAs were a strength of the course because they really helped reinforce the concepts presented in lecture. I can't think of any weaknesses, the class was pretty straightforward and there is nothing I would change.",
    "The exams could be a little bit less specific and do a better job of covering bigger class concepts",
    "Lots of information, better review sessions including enrichment section openings increase",
    "I think there should have been more of an emphasis on covering more course material during section instead of diving into new ground.",
    "I think the strength of the course is that it touches on most major areas of evolutionary biology and traces through the evolution and dispersion of life. The scope of the course also allows students to place the importance\/relevance of humanity on a time and impact scale. The weakness of the course is that it relies heavily on memorization and does not develop an intuitive thinking process.",
    "The strength is the professor. The weakness is its length. There is not enough time to learn how to take tests for this class.",
    "Maybe a little more space in between assignments. All the assignments were due at the end of the semester, one right after another.",
    "The content was incredibly engaging and the material between lectures fit together naturally. The lectures covered broad topics that were then focused on in section through the reading of academic papers. The course does cover a lot of content but the pacing makes it so that the information can be synthesize and digested.",
    "The class was well organized and well taught. Donahue's lecture style is incredibly engaging. I would like to see slightly less emphasis placed on the final and midterm, with the clade paper having a larger impact on the final grade.",
    "This course was very good, a little heavy on the memorization. I liked the activities like the reading response and Peabody museum scavenger hunt. I think that the final paper could have had more structured guidance in section because it was sometimes hard to know what we were supposed to write. The proposal was a good way to start it off and get people on the right track. I think section discussions were good and helped reinforce concepts we were learning in class in a new and interesting way. The lectures were structured with summary of concepts that helped students follow information.",
    "Overall it was good.",
    "The professor is wonderful and very engaging. You can tell he really cares about helping his students learn. It think the course could be improved by making it less memorization-based.",
    "The major strength was the professor-- Professor Donoghue made the material thoroughly engaging and kept class time productive through a system of stretch breaks, interactive content, and interesting slides. Although he has retired from undergraduate work, BIOL104 should look into keeping the slides, as they generally (with the exception of the development of feathers in Lecture 10) were easy to follow, even for hard concepts such as parsimony. I only dislike how much the class focused on slides for the midterm and final--unlike the critical thinking present in the other biology modules, it felt much more like a regurgitation of knowledge. Other than that, the use of museum and Yale resources as discussion section techniques was an outstanding addition to the course, and the assignments were generally rewarding (although while we were given ample notice to submit them, they were all due one after another during reading period, so even at the cost of time, it would make sense to make some due a bit earlier in order to discourage students from cramming an entire assignment into two days."

    "If you are interested in ecology or evolution, this is definitely a very thorough introduction to this field. I also really liked how this class was taught and structured.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class as it enables students to expand learning beyond the classroom and study actual examples evolution.",
    "Yeah, you need it for bio and pre-med, but it's also a great course, too bad the instructor is leaving though.",
    "Yes! You're probably taking this course because it's required, but if you were going to take one of the bio modules for fun, you'd do well to take this one. The workload is pretty light (also, textbook readings are optional!), the material is interesting and fun, and section is nice because we discuss actual journal articles.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because the professor was extremely good at giving engaging lectures and the course material was extremely interesting!",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The content is interesting and the teaching is really great.",
    "Yes, for intro bio.",
    "yes. if you can just take this module of the bio sequence because you place out of the others, it's really fun. most people can't though and have to suffer through bio 101-103, which isn't worth it.",
    "Yes! This class is great, however the rest of the bio sequence is not so great, so if you don't like biology, don't take this sequence.",
    "Yes! It is amazing to analyze the world around you with evolutionary perspective.",
    "Take it, it is the gem of the bio sequence",
    "yes",
    "It's an introductory course, so I would say to only take it if one is required. I know there are much more fun biology courses that are more interesting as well. This basically felt like a high school biology class so I didn't feel like it was a good use of my time to take except for the fact that I'm required to take it.",
    "Yes. This gives you an incredible new perspective on the things you see everyday.",
    "Yes. The course was generally quite interesting.",
    "Yes it was such a fun class. Super interesting, a great way to wrap up the intro Biology sequence.",
    "Yes! I really loved Bio 104, it was my favorite part of the bio sequence.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it's the only course in the biology module sequence that is completely distinct and separate from the others, and it's refreshing to take a fresh stance at the end of the sequence and see how everything pieces together.",
    "Yes, you will learn lots of interesting stuff about ecology and evolutionary biology.",
    "Yes if they are in STEM, it is a nice foundation.",
    "Yes, it was a challening class at a times but I learned a lot",
    "Yes. Maybe it was Donaghue that made this class great but I thoroughly enjoyed being in class.",
    "Yes! BIOL 104 is genuinely a good class, and compared to the rest of the intro bio sequence it's awesome. The lectures are interesting (and even if you don't think they are, they are at least clear and informative *cough cough* Weimin Zhong). The assignments are really fun; you get to go on multiple \"field trips\" and really get engaged with the course material.",
    "Yes, definitely because it was engaging and the professor was amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course only to those who need to take it as a prereq. It is highly involved in terms of coursework.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 104 to other students! A breath of fresh air after BIOL 101-103.",
    "If it was a class on its own outside the biol sequence, then yes!",
    "Absolutely! Great material and well-organized lectures.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it's needed for many bio majors and premed.",
    "Yes I would 100% recommend the course. I loved it. Teacher was amazing and content was so interesting despite thinking I had no interest In ecology and evolution coming into it",
    "YES! it is a great class and perhaps the most enjoyable of the bio sequence.",
    "Michael is awesome! Unfortunately he's retiring from undergrad teaching but he was a fantastic professor. I feel like I learned a ton.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student wishing to pursue a career in science.",
    "Yes, interesting course and great professor",
    "Absolutely. Donoghue is a god of a man, absolute privilege to learn from him. Go to peer tutor hours and you'll be chilling.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the environment and marco-biology. The course acts as a wonderful ending to the biology sequence that is both engaging and flexible to your interests, providing a greater meaning to some of the concepts discussed in earlier sequences.",
    "Ya great instyctor",
    "Yeah, the course was fine. Also most people interested in it have to take it, so might as well get it done early.",
    "I actually would recommend this course. Anyone that has even a slight interest in ecology or the environment would benefit from this course.",
    "Take if you need",
    "Yes. Great professor and supporting staff.",
    "Absolutely not. The course was poorly designed to facilitate student learning. Clear feedback from professor and TA were not readily available.",
    "yes - you have to take it, he's a great teacher",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student - it was a great way to finish the introductory biology sequence!",
    "This course is the end of the tedious and poorly taught intro bio sequence, which is enough to celebrate on its own. There aren't many opportunities for assessment, and for a lot of them, everyone does well, so you really have to do well on the exams. Unfortunately, there aren't many resources to prepare for the exams; you get one practice midterm and 0 practice finals.",
    "Yes because the professors and the TAs encourage you to learn and support you compared to the other modules of this sequence.",
    "Yes, BIOL 104 was one of the better modules in the biology sequence. It is a very good course for those interested in EEB and the information is interesting.",
    "If you gotta do it then do it",
    "I would, and also it is mandatory",
    "Sure! This class was fun and enjoyable",
    "Only if you have to for a requirement.",
    "YES. Professor Donoghue is amazing and really cares about ecology!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I believe that this course is the most interesting module in the introductory biology sequence. While the course requires a bit of memorization, the course is structured in such a way that the concepts fit together naturally.",
    "This class is the light at the end of the tunnel for the intro bio sequence. There is little reason not to take it. I would highly recommend.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, it was fun and I loved the instruction, though I believe the current Professor is retiring.",
    "if you have to take it",
    "Definitely. Even if a student is intending to major in a different biological field, this course still provides an insight into another area of biological knowledge.",
    "Yes, if you are a pre-med student or interested in ecology, this course is really good and Professor Donoghue is a great teacher.",
    "very much!! just such a fun class",
    "Honestly, you should only take this course if it is required, as it is part of the biology sequence which you should also only take if required. Regardless, this is by far the most enjoyable portion of the BIOL sequence, and it is easier (while remaining intellectually challenging and stimulating), better facilitated for learning, and generally a more engaging course with more real-world applications. I highly recommend it in this regard, and hope that Professor Prum does it justice."
