   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class (and language as a whole) to anyone.",
    "I would recommend Italian 130 to a fellow student because it is a well run, well organized course, and a fun language to learn.",
    "If you get a good section it can be really fun, and the work isn't that bad. That said, I wouldn't have taken it if it weren't for the language requirement.",
    "Well you have to take it to complete. Probably one of the harder levels just because you cover so much material so quickly. Be prepared to do work.",
    "I enjoyed Italian and would recommend it. Although the compositions, grammar, and workbook exercises can feel repetitious as the semester progresses, in-class discussions and the cultural components of the class were great. I would definitely suggest you take the course with Alexia. She was helpful and went out of her way for us with the review session she held and one time when we made recipes in the Silli kitchen. The course is straight-forward and is a good review of basic Italian grammar, which I found helpful.",
    "I would recommend Italian 130 to another student. It is a really fun class but beware that it is a lot of work and it requires you to write a long composition every week which can be tedious. You will however, learn a lot and your language skills will definitely improve. Don't expect to learn that much about Italian culture though."
