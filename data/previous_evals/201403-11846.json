    "Anthropology of Information is one of those life-changing courses! Professor Kockelman is a genius. The class is basically a journey through the book he is working on, which investigates ways to apply cultural anthropology and linguistic anthropology to media, computation, systems, and information theories. Readings are all fascinating--mainly on classic linguistics, computation theory, and lots of unusual philosophy (and some of Kockelman's own articles, which are great). Classes are essentially small interactive lectures. Though I tend to prefer seminars, Kockelman's classes were my favorite times of the week. He is incredibly engaging, and was always willing to pause for discussion or change course completely based on what we were interested in talking about. Take this class if you enjoy thinking through creative and unusual metaphors, and doing some more math-based readings!",
    "This was quite a challenging course that is almost entirely theoretical. No ethnographies. The material covers some classic linguistic anthro and then moves on to ciphers (code breaking), communication theory, computer languages, and other topics in that vein. It really got me thinking in new ways about concepts and authors I had never encountered before in anthropology courses. And never having taken a comp sci class, reading Alan Turing and others was all very new. That being said, the readings were very dense and quite difficult to engage with sometimes for the weekly reading responses. But Professor Kockelman explained things well in class -- lots and lots of diagrams! The class was mostly just him talking for the entire time due to the ver difficult nature of the material. But it was never boring. He's brilliant and fun to listen to. If you're looking for a challenging, theoretical class, take it.",
    "Anthro of Info provides you with a theoretical arsenal of ways to think critically about informationmeaning, communication, artificial vs. natural languages, enclosure & disclosure, secrets & cyphers, computers and brains, media in a broad sense, and so on. If you're up for some dense theory, this course is a fantastic example of how eye opening interdisciplinary perspectives can be. Because the topics are so broad, your direction and scope are a little hazy when you start out. But I think of it as one of those books that you read, find amazing, and aren't able to neatly summarize for a friend when they ask what it's about. If you're interested in linguistics, philosophy, computer science, or social theory, I'd say this course is a must for you. If you come from another field, it will still be very intriguing, enlightening, fun, etc.",
    "This was certainly a very unique seminar experience. Kockelman does a fair bit of lecturing. It might have something to do with the fact he's new to Yale; in any case, his lectures are enjoyable and maybe even necessary, given the complexity and breadth of the course material. Be sure to closely scrutinize the classroom dynamic during shopping period, and examine the syllabus carefully.",
    "I personally gained a lot from the course, being from the School of Art, that related and informed my artistic practice. It is a wonderful primer into linguostic models and how that relates to computational languages. Then Paul takes it further into the questions of identity, agency, and ontology that makes the course more than a primer in language but a start of an investigation into modes of language and their use in the social. I would recommend this class to many people."
