   "comments": [
    "Greek 120 is a good way to build a solid foundation in the language. The coursework proceeds somewhat slowly compared to other language classes (especially intensive Greek), but this allows for a thorough grounding in grammar and vocabulary. The homework is also not especially time-consuming, so it is a great way to pursue Greek while balancing a heavier course load.",
    "A great class to transition from grammar to real literature. Great for building on the previous class and really interesting.",
    "I would recommend it as a necessary continuation of 110 (without which 110 is rather pointless) and definitely over the intensive semester--the pace is fast enough over two semesters.",
    "See above. Very good introductory course to Greek with a good selections of demanding text selections. Very recommendable.",
    "The class is a pretty standard continuation of the introductory class: the first half of the course is devoted to grammar, the second half to reading Plato's Apology. It is challenging in different ways than the first class, but it is not really any more difficult. Once you get through the grammar sections, reading Plato is a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend taking the class for that experience.",
    "I would highly recommend a student stick with the intro Greek course for both semester; the first semester is a lot of necessary busywork and grammar memorization, but the second semester allows you to apply it to \"real\" Greek."
