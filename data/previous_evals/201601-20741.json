    "Awesome class! Manageable, incredibly interesting reading. Best seminar.",
    "AMST433 is a fantastic course and I would definitely recommend taking it! As the semester progresses you see the course themes continuously build on themselves, and you cover a really wide range of topics and places that allows for a nuanced understanding of development as it both forms and addresses the idea of the \"wasteland.\" Prof. Taft is fantastic, and she did a great job of helping us to draw connections between all the materials we had covered.",
    "Professor Taft is great! She leads a great discussion and really cares about her students. The cause was interesting but does become a bit repetitive by the end.",
    "This was a fantastic class about post-industrial landscapes and the conditions that lead to them, about waste in America, about neoliberalism and nature, about so much!!! It is a shame that Prof. Taft is leaving, because she is wonderful. The workload is good, too: weekly reading responses, a short presentation, a short paper and then a longer final one that you can really engage with and take with you after the course.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Most of the students were American or Environmental Studies majors, but I think if you are interested in the subject it's a great class for anyone. It had more of a practical city planning aspect than I was expecting at the start, but it allowed me to explore an avenue I had not given attention to. The workload is reasonable with weekly readings and reflections on reading, a partner presentation, a midterm image analysis paper, and a final paper\/project."
