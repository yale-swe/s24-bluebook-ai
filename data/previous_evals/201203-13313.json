   "comments": [
    "The class focused very little on anarchy and was almost exclusively devoted to the philosophy behind authority. If you take the writing section, you have to do a final paper in addition to the exam.",
    "If you like questions of political authority and legitimacy, this course offers an impressive reading list. Professor Ochoa does not, however, meaningfully connect or link the authors. Expect to be well-versed in a number of different viewpoints, but not in how they come together to form a canon. It is also a great writing credit because you have a whole semester to write a paper on anything you want that is tangentially related to anarchy or authority.",
    "It's definitely a unique class in the PoliSci department. If you have an interest in philosophical anarchy, or libertarian leanings, or even just some complex leftist feelings you need to untangle then this class can help you figure out this relationship between authority and those who obey it.The reading is not too heavy, although I admit I didn't do all of it, but some of the anarchist literature is really fun, really fiery stuff.Exams aren't too bad, but they're essentially essays. Professor Ochoa has a pretty specific idea of what she wants in these, so it's very helpful to either pay attention when she talks about how she wants them written or go to office hours.Professor Ochoa is very nice and very knowledgeable in what seems like an often ignored corner of political debate. Her lectures sometimes seemed a bit rushed or without structure, but we did ultimately build towards certain questions presented in the course.Finally, be prepared to leave the class with no faith in the legitimacy of any government and no way to change them. It's a bit of a philosophical let down.",
    "Yes, but be interested in the subject and have some political philosophy background. (DS or intro to political philosophy).",
    "Great class. Sounds like a niche or fringe or special interest topic, but actually hugely important, and central to poly phil, as anarchists raise fundamental questions about legitimacy and authority. Great and caring prof. A reading list which will both expose you to classics and to contemporary academic greats which you might not have otherwise heard of.",
    "Would not recommend this course to anyone and in fact hope it does not return next year, at least not with this professor. Boring, and does not live up to its name.",
    "The readings are very dense, so be prepared to read them two or three times before you really understand the contents. However, seeing how all the philosophies fit together is worthwhile, and an understanding of anarchy and legitimate authority is a must to understand today's political climate."
