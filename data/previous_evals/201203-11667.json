   "comments": [
    "Take this class because it's an easy genetics lab that you don't need to do too much work in.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. The labs are very interesting and you learn a number of helpful scientific techniques\/approaches.",
    "It correlated nicely with the genetics course but the lab reports were often very long and work intensive, with timely statistical tests that didn't offer much additional knowledge.",
    "So, as an MCDB major or a premed, you have to take 2 labs - pity is that the MCDB department has plenty good higher level labs that you can't get into or have to sign up for really early in advance, and then you have the lower level labs like Genetics Lab, which if you have already started work in a lab (especially working either with yeast or Drosophila), can seem like a waste of time.So, if you are thinking about an MCDB lab, either take this Genetic Lab early - i.e., before starting to work in a lab (because it honestly would help you learn the techniques if you have not worked in a lab before) - or hold out hope for one of the higher level labs.",
    "If you're willing to slave away at the lab reports, you'll get a lot out of the class.",
    "Genetics lab is actually a pretty good science lab. Having already done some research in genetics, it was nice to get a little background with the various model organisms. The labs were structured very well (although the Drosophilia one ran a little long), and although the lab writeups took me a long time to put together, it was very clear what we were supposed to include and I ended up almost enjoying the scientific writing. There's only a few lab reports, so nothing like the highly irritating once-a-week nonsense of some other labs, and the workload was manageable since they were so spread out. Professor Dawson is very enthusiastic about his work, as is Professor Leiserson, and the lab definitely helped me understand some of the concepts of the course better. Good choice of lab - I'm going to try to take the Microbio lab since I heard it was very similar to this one.",
    "Its a bio lab course that is a good supplement to the lecture. Its a lot of work for a 1\/2 credit though, so be warned.",
    "TOO MUCH WORK AND OFTEN GOES LATE. Not worth it, with one exception: teh genetics lecture final was sooo easy because we did so many statistical tests in lab that were barely covered in lecture.",
    "Best lab I've taken! You get to design some aspects of the experiment, and there's the right amount of independence. You will know how to map a gene like a pro by the end!",
    "A good biology lab. I know it's a lot of work (really, a lot of work), but I don't think you have better options.",
    "I know you are probably premed and not too interested in learning for learning's sake, but if you are not and actually want to learn, this is a great lab. I really learned a lot about genetics and lab techniques. Don't worry if you didn't take the intro bio lab, because you will be fine. You just can't be too sure about what grade you will end up getting. The lab reports take forever to do, but they are only due every other week. It definitely isn't the easiest lab you will take, and the lab periods can last forever, but I can definitely say I get the point of the course.",
    "This is a good lab. The experiments are diverse and interesting, and the professors and TAs are great. The lab reports are tricky, but they really help you learn the concepts. Keep in mind that the lab often goes past the allotted time, so be prepared to stay late.",
    "This lab reinforces topics covered in lecture pretty well (recombination mapping, chi-squared analysis, etc.) Unlike other labs (ahem, orgo\/gen chem), you are not spoon fed the lab protocol. Each lab has a goal and you have to think of how to test your hypothesis\/complete the objective by designing crosses.You get to work with mitosis\/meiosis, yeast complementation, fly genetics (recombination), arabidopsis (molecular mapping), and molecular genetics.It's a chill lab with lab reports every two weeks. Lab reports are no fun, but every lab has them. I think genetics lab is one of the most underrated labs here at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in genetic research. It is a fair amount of work, but you learn about techniques that are actually used and model organisms.",
    "This was without a doubt, the hardest lab course I've taken so far at Yale. Personally I encountered so many techniques and processes that I had never been exposed to, so carrying out the procedures was definitely high-stress, but in the end I feel like I learned so much. The lab definitely helps gain a better understanding of things that are just brushed over during lecture such as complementation tests, PCR, agarose gel electrophoresis, and chi-squared calculations. Overall, it was tough but good course.",
    "It's a good lab. You learn a lot, and the professor take time to explain everything and the handouts are very good. the labs are reasonable.Just be prepared for rather harsh lab report grading (there are 6 of them, and each is quite long).",
    "Great course if you want to get a survey of standard genetics lab techniques and statistical tests. A lot of work can make for some long nights, and the lab report guidelines tend to be very stringent and particular, so be sure to pay attention to those and ask questions early.",
    "Do it! Makes the Genetics course much easier to understand",
    "Great lab course. It's super helpful for teaching you concepts covered in MCDB202 (genetics lecture course). It makes you think like a researcher and definitely doesn't just waste your time with menial labs.",
    "If you are a Junior or a Senior with any meaningful lab experience, I DO NOT recommend this lab, especially if you are just looking to fulfill your premed requirements. I didn't learn anything new (AP Bio Lab + any lab experience will have covered everything in this lab), and the lab reports take a gross amount of time. Also, the lab reports fail in their purported attempt to teach you how to write a scientific manuscript (if you compare a peer-reviewed paper in any scientific journal to what is expected in your lab reports, they are completely different). And you're not graded on your laboratory skill either, which again, if you're actually interested in research, is actually a crucial component. In summary, the grading in this lab is structured to incentivize sloppy and hurried lab technique followed by a game of guess what my TA wants on this \"paper\".If you are a Freshman or a Sophomore with no intentions of working in a real lab, and have never encountered a pipette or a fruit fly, then I would recommend taking this lab. It will introduce you to some model organisms, some basic laboratory techniques, and perhaps even get you interested in doing more research.",
    "This was a great lab. It was a manageable amount of work, and reallyhelped make concepts from the lecture course clear and more interesting. Labs were very cool, and the techniques learned and analysis done were useful. Dr. Dawson is a great teacher, and I liked this course a lot.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn useful techniques for genetics but don't care about your grade\/have to take the class. It is sometimes confusing to know what to include inthe reports and because of the strict word limit you might not be able to include everything you think is important.",
    "A good introductory bio lab and helpful with some of the basic concepts of MCDB 202. Fairly work-intensive for a lab class. You get to practice things like mutagenesis screening, complementation testing, linkage mapping in Drosophila and Arabidopsis using phenotypic and molecular markers, and at the end, cloning a vector into host bacteria. Definitely more of an emphasis on \"classical\" genetics type things (which you'll cover in the first half of MCDB 202).",
    "Yes, fly unit was very hands on, could use refinement.",
    "If you are interested in biology and genetics, I would recommend taking this course. It is enjoyable if you are interested in these areas. However, if you don't like these topics and\/or don't need to take it, don't go through the hassle.",
    "You end up learning a good amount about genetic research theory. Lab reports are long - doable with one all-nighter, but start them earlier and you'll be fine. The class itself has a nice, friendly atmosphere, so it's never too stressful. Expect to go overtime by 30 minutes to an hour quite often.",
    "Stay away from this lab if you very much dislike fruit flies... Fruit flies aside, the lab was not bad and it was great practice applying what you learn in genetics lecture to real, imperfect data. There were 5 lab reports and we always had 2 weeks to complete them but several of them were extremely tedious to format and put together. I've heard there are better labs to take.",
    "Take it if you need it, bio labs are somewhat scarce. You'll learn more from the lab than you will from the class, that's for sure. The professors are also infinitely better. But lab runs long a lot, there's a lot crammed in, a report every other week coincides with the genetics class's quiz structure (which is brutal). And you will hate flies and scoring them under the microscope. But it's not particularly hard, just long and sometimes dauntingly complicated. I'd suggest starting reports earlyand being liberal with asking the instructors for advice if you don't understand anything."
