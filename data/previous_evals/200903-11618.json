   "comments": [
    "It is a really interesting class that is enjoyable to take and not too difficult.",
    "Good, interesting course. It's hard to get anything either higher or lower than an A-.",
    "Take this course only if you're sure you're going to be Poli Sci with an IR concentration. Do NOT be one of those people who takes the course \"to learn more about the world.\" Read a newspaper already.",
    "Very good introductory class that everyone should take.",
    "This class is really fun and not too high stress. It is a definite must-take class for anyone who is interested in Political Science or International Studies.",
    "Take it for sure. One of the best and easiest classes at Yale in terms of a great combo of not much work and easy grading.",
    "I would say that it is a definite course to take at Yale. It provides a great understanding of world issues, and it was interesting at the same time. I felt that I really learned a lot that I will use later in life, which is rare for many classes.",
    "A good, solid intro class to IR. I hardly knew anything about IR going into it and felt like I came out with a good foundation. The readings are relevant and interesting, and give everyone the basic fundamentals that they need. It would probably bore someone who knew a lot about IR, but for people like me who really were not knowledgeable on the topic, the content is great for being brought up to speed. Manageableworkload, good lectures, overall solid class.",
    "Take it to learn the basics of what is going on - you may be surprised at how much there is to know.",
    "Take it, you can actually understand the NYT.",
    "This class is helpful if you have little familiarity with any international events and want a general background. However, this class feels mostly like a preview of interesting topics that can be further pursued in the field of international relations, not an exploration of interesting thought itself.I would recommend this class to a student who wants to fill out the remainder of their schedule with a class with a low workload that is easy to understand without much studying.",
    "I highly recommend this class if you want to learn about the conflicts going on in the International Theater and understand their basic and theoretical ramifications.",
    "Easy class, minimal work, take it if you have a tough schedule and need a break.",
    "This is a great class. The testing is very forgiving, but comprehensive. The information is interesting and Howorth is GREAT. Take this course if you want a nice, easy, interesting introduction to International Relations theory.The course focuses much more on theory than it does policy, so be prepared to learn more about concepts than real-world applications (though many real-world examples are used to explain theory).",
    "Intro to IR was a great class for anyone who is interested in political science or anyone who just wants to get to know global issues a little better. I definitely reccomend it",
    "A pretty easy course with a lot of reading that's not especially necessary to do. The information is interesting, however, and will help aid one's understanding of the current events in the news.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn but thinks that they don't know enough to get through the course. A perfect introductory course",
    "It's exactly what the course description says. It's pretty easy to do well on the exams if you study the topics one or two days before. I did all the reading in the beginning, which I think (?) was helpful even though other people who didn't do the reading did just as well as me, but Istopped doing the reading between the midterms...it's hard to gage how much work you should be doing for the class. A lot of people didn't even come to lecture. Overall, it was a laidback class to balance the ones I actually cared about.",
    "Yes, I recommend it because the professor made it interesting.",
    "Take it for easy credit.",
    "PLSC 111 is an introduction to world affairs and the structure of the international system and international organizations. I would recommend this course with a few caveats. There is a lot of assigned reading but you don't need to do most of it (most people I've talked to seem to share this opinion). The textbooks are dull but the assigned articles are often more interesting. I feel like I've gained a better understanding of international issues and conflicts from this course. A note: all grading is done by your TF.",
    "An interesting and simple course for someone who knows nothing about International Relations.",
    "Easy class, boring lectures, really no point in attending lectures because they are all posted online",
    "I would recommend this course. The workload is fine (readings aren't bad, you have 2 exams and a final along with your section), the lectures are usually pretty interesting and the sections are helpful. It was intriguing to study some of our current world events more in depth, and the course definitely provides a better understand of what our world looks like and how we can study it.",
    "It's a good class if you're interested in International Relations. The first half of the course is about learning the theories and terminology of IR. The second half focuses on applying this knowledge to specific current situations and countries.",
    "Good class, very light workload, and exams are easy.",
    "FANTASTIC CLASS THAT ENABLES YOU TO GROW IN SO MANY MORE WAYS THAT JUST GPA. Take it for Professor Howorth, even. Professor Howorth is simply amazing and if you never take a class with him, trust me--you'll regret it.",
    "There has to be more to IR than rehashing three IR theories for a semester. There just has to be. (There isn\u0092t.) There are, instead, many people who have thought the same things as you well before you, and we will refer to these theories now by their authors' last names. By the way, did you hear Obama\u0092s speech last week, because it's your final.",
    "great class if u are into politics and international relations.",
    "Take it even if your not a poli sci major. Good stuff to know, very pertinent to whats going on in the world today. Will help you have better cocktail convos and understanding of base factors of conflicts if nothing else.",
    "It is a good class. It is not extremely easy but if you do the work you should get a decent grade. The material is interesting but pretty basic until the end of the course when you start looking at specific cases in the international system.",
    "If you, like me, know little about political science and are hoping to broaden your horizons, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I was hoping the class would get me interested in IR because I feel like it is important to have somewhat of an understanding of it, but to me, the reading was incredibly dull and I could never finish it. You have to have an understanding of IR before starting the class because it assumes you know common theories, recent history, and abbreviations for various groups, but I knew none of it, and was constantly behind. On the other hand, those of my friends in the class who and an interest in IR before beginning the class loved it. So in the end I would recommend taking the class only if you know IR to begin with. Otherwise there's no way you'll get through all the readings.",
    "Actually very interesting class--but beware of one thing: while readings are unnecessary and work is very light, and tests are easy--grading can be tough--TA's look for very specific terms and mark you down if they're not there even if general idea is",
    "PLSC 111 is an intro class that gives the basic theories of International Relations and how they apply. It is pretty interesting if you don't already know the theories, but otherwise it would be pretty boring. It's not much work and is slightly interesting, so I'd recommend it as a fifth class. Don't take it Credit-D - it's too easy.",
    "Don't take it if you are looking for a gut. you will end up not working hard and it will bite you in the end.",
    "A good class that is not that hard but is very interesting.",
    "Intro to IR is a good intro course--don't expect anything super-detailed. In fact, some of the topics covered were a bit misleading, especially once covered more in-depth. There's a lot of reading for the course, but it's manageable. Doing the reading is key for the exams, and section definitely helps make the readings more clear.",
    "Easy. Take it. And professor Howorth is pretty entertaining, if you don't think so you can always just fall asleep to his british accent and still make at least an A-",
    "Gut.",
    "Maybe take it. Most people say its incredibly easy but here's the thing: it IS easy to get a B+ or even an A-; however, it's ridiculously hard to get an A. Because the class isn't curved, you have to excel on the midterms, which is hard because some TAs arbitrarily mark off points.",
    "It is a little bit boring, but not that dificult of a class. it gets interesting at the end of the class when you look at different case studies.",
    "This class is mediocre. Don't take it if you already know anything about IR -- you'll get more out of something higher level. Take it if you really have very little experience with the subject or you're seeking something that is not particularly intense. And make sure you use lots of examples on the exams.",
    "Great class with a funny Professor. He also gets awesome guest lecturers--many of whom are quite engaging.",
    "This is a very good class if you are looking for what the class says it is: an introduction to international relations. If you already feel that you are fairly knowledgeable on the subject matter, I would suggest taking a seminar instead. I loved the class..it wasn't too much work and it was very interesting subject matter. Howorth is a great professor and I would definitely suggest taking it with him.",
    "Not the best. You don't learn a ton- and if you read CNN.com once in a while it is useless.",
    "Take it, but only if you are REALLY sure that you like the subject matter or if you're looking for an easy class. It basically only requires that you go to lectures and that you have some knowledge of current events. It's not as interesting as it might sound to someone not into Poli Sci, but reviewing some of the concepts, I think that if you give it the time of day, it can be very rewarding. Some of the readings and discussions can be interesting, if you care at all.",
    "IR is a great blend of political theory (covered for the first part of the course) and concrete issues in specific countries (covered in the second part). The material covered is very interesting and incredibly relevant if you want to understand what's going on in the world today. Plus, Professor Howorth is a funny and engaging lecturer. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "This is a great intro class. You learn a tremendous amount about the current affairs that you should already know\/want to know a lot about anyway! You basically learn the important details of affairs in Iraq, Afghanistan, China, Russia, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, India, etc. Theories are focal to this course but they are not difficult to grasp and apply to specific case studies. Tests are exceptionally fair and manageable. There is a decent amount of reading but you don't need to do it to be successful. A lot of what you need to know for the course (mostly the latter half, to be certain) can be found on wikipedia. I wouldn't buy all of the text books. Just \"World Politics In a New Era\" will more than suffice. Lectures are very informative and you feel as though you come away a more globally aware person when the course is complete. Take it! I switched it from credit\/d to a grade halfway through.",
    "I would probably not recommend this class. It was interesting and easy, but unfortunately the material had little relevance to anything most people will ever care about (and it doesn't count towards the IS major, by the way), and the total lack of thought the class required was somewhat depressing. However, do know that any work aside from that in section and studying for the two midterms and final is totally unnecessary so the class DOES have a very light workload.",
    "Good class if you are interested or want to learn more about international issues.",
    "I would recommend this class as a great way to be introduced to the field of international relations. It doesn't provide an in depth look at any particular issue, but it's still a great overview.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The lectures are great, the work is only as much as you want to put in, and the material is relevant and interesting.",
    "Definitely. Interesting subject matter and not that much work.",
    "I think Poli Sci 111 was a good course only to learn the IR theories which apparently come up later in the poli sci courses, other wise I would say don't waste your time. This course was easy and if you have other difficult classes then maybe take this class but it really is not that great.",
    "Basic stuff, pretty straightforward lecture class. Stuff you should know even if you're not excited about it.",
    "I would avoid taking this class if you want to learn a lot. The subject you encounter is, more or less, what you encounter on the news. Not much work, the reading isn't necessary.",
    "If you know anything about IR, stay away. If you read the newspaper regularly, stay away.",
    "Yes. Take it. It isn't especially hard, but it is also interesting and an important material for any informed student.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in the basics of the international system. If you want to learn a little bit about how the world works and functions in regards to political theory, take this course!",
    "Easy class. Not much work at all. Tests are straight forward, lecture is entertaining but not at all necessary if you miss it. However Howorth is so engaging you're an idiot if you don't show up at least once to his lecture. Take IR if you need a light, but interesting class.",
    "This class covers the fundamental topics in International Relations, making it a 'must take' for Political Science majors. Although the textbook readings were dry, the supplementary readings were excellent. If possible, take the class with Prof. Howorth-- he's an excellent instructor.",
    "Take it.",
    "Tests are pretty simple even if you have a limited understanding of world affairs. About half of each lecture was interesting. I would take it again even though I learned more from the readings than lecture.",
    "It's great, especially if you know nothing about IR and are a science person like me. Also the course load is not bad at all, and the readings are REALLY interesting. The class teaches you the theoretical approaches to IR, and then at the end we look at contemporary issues.",
    "PLSC111 is a great intro class. You get a great overview of the world's major issues and a solid base of knowledge about the major theories of IR. I would certainly recommend this class to another student.",
    "PLSC 111 is an overview of international relations. I would recommend as a class to shop and decide. It will be an very interesting course (if you actually are committed to the readings) with minimal work.",
    "Intro to IR is a good class. The information is fairly interesting and applicable to current events which helps reinforce the material. However, the breadth of the course makes it difficult to really delve into any material, so it's hard to get a lot out of each lecture. The lectures are pretty minimal in substantial information, so to make the most of the class you have to do some readings.",
    "An awesome class. Howorth is great.",
    "Moderately interesting. You learn basic IR theory, meaning realism and liberalism, and then do some case studies. Easy class.",
    "The class is interesting, and if you know a little bit about the world you don't have to do that much work.",
    "If I was going to be a political science major, I would definitely take this course. It is a great way to fill out your requirement and teaches you about current world events",
    "Yes I would recommend this class because it covers the pressing issues of today's world. The only thing is that is deals a lot with theories.",
    "I would. It's a good basic class for political science. It teaches an interesting framework for viewing global issues.",
    "Intro to IR gives a good overall view of the subject matter. If you have some interest in the course, take it because its helpful to know this information whether you want to study it or not. There is a fair amount of reading, but nothing that isnt manageable.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it as it gives a clear knowledge of the topic at an introductory level.",
    "Great class for those of us not in tune with current events. You learn a lot about the past twenty years or so, and can maybe chime in to a discussion about hot button issues in a way you wouldn't have been able to before the course!",
    "Take this course. It is a must. Great material, very interesting subject. Brings you up to date with current events. AND its really easy, you don't have to read one word out of the textbook all semester",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It was very interesting because you get to learn about current affairs, and the workload is very manageable. The readings given out are very informative. I loved this course!",
    "2 midterms composed of ID's, a short essay, and a long essay. Also there's a final exam composed of two long essays. Great easy 5th class and if you don't already know most of the information in the class, you should learn it. Section can make or break the grading, but either way it's easy work (workload, subject, everything).",
    "This is a very good overview of international relations, but the lack of depth can be frustrating at times. The workload is very low, just reading, section assignments, and 2 midterms. If you are looking for in depth discussions and you know about contemporary discussions, this is not the class for you. But if you don't know a lot and want an introduction without a lot of work, this is great for you.",
    "Very standard introduction to international relations. Shop the first class and you will get a pretty good idea of what the rest of the year will be like.",
    "I took this class for CR\/D\/Fail and did not read a single page of the text. I probably would get a B if I were to receive a grade. It's not hard to do well in this class if you put in a little more effort. I got a lot out of it just by attending the lectures. I feel like I am much better informed about the world now.",
    "It is a great overview of international relations that offers a solid foundation for understanding world affairs. I highly recommend taking this class.",
    "Political Science 111 was a great introduction to poli sci and provided me with knowledge about global issues of the past and present. Even if you are not planning on majoring in political science it is still a great class to take. The readings, as you learn early on, do not necessarily need to be kept up with and as long as you go to the lectures you should be fine.",
    "Intro IR is a very interesting course and it isn't too difficult as well. It's a great first political science course if you're interested in learning more.",
    "It's an easy class that could be really good if you did all the work you are supposed to, but nobody does.",
    "Intro to International Relations class can be very easy to students who are familiar with International issues and whom has a very good writing skills. However, for those who is unfamiliar with the International Relations issue and who does not have a very articulate writing skills, it is not the easiest class. Also, this is a very big lecture class. If you want to have more room for free discussions and questions, you should look at seminar classes. A lot of people miss half of the lectures because everything is determined by midterms and finals.",
    "I would really recommendthis course to otehr students. It\u00b4s great to gove you a glimpse of what goes on in the world, without the work load being too heavy. It tackles interesting case studeis and discussion sections are always very engaging.",
    "Very good broad course, not too hard. Sometimes overly liberal professor. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "yes. this class was good. there is a lot of reading but as long as you show up to the lectures you will be okay.",
    "IR is a good overview for someone who wants to know more about some of the major issues that are going on in the world right now. Sometimes it felt like we tried to cover too much in the class, so we couldn't really go too much in depth into any specific issue. There was also a little more history than I was expecting. The course also had a reputation as being easy, but I did not find that it was so easy- but maybe that's because I actually did the reading, which most people don't do and still get by fine with. It might be a better idea to take a more focused course if you feel prepared for it",
    "I would not recommend it to other students. It is not an interesting class. A lot of reading, but you don't actually have to do all of it.",
    "It's an easy, comprehensive IR class that though basic, I think is worth taking. I very much enjoyed it. The workload is really as much as you want it to be, based on how much of the reading you need to do well on the exams. I found the readings to be generally quite interesting and would occasionally procrastinate doing my other homework by doing my IR readings.",
    "Take it. It is an easy course. The exams are easy and if you're having trouble keeping up with world news taking this class is a great way to immerse yourself in such vital news.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students of all majors. The workload is light, and the course material is very interesting. This is more than a current events class, it is a study of the theories behind international relations, and I thoroughly enjoyed every lecture. The only problem was that lecture was too short, and Professor Howorth often felt rushed.",
    "This course is an introductory class to international studies. It sets the world stage for you and lets you know the possible next moves of the world actors.",
    "This is a musttake course for anyone who wants to understand what is happening with the world. This class will open your eyes to the international events.",
    "This is a very good, basic introductory course. The information and the readings are interesting and the lectures are good. I would recommend this class if you are thinking about majoring in political science, or even if you are not because the information given during this class is applicable to everyday life and effects all of us.",
    "Take it... gut",
    "Intro to IR is an amazing class that I think everyone should have to take, even if they are not interested in Political Science. While people warned me that the theories we spend time on in the beginning would be boring, that was not the case. This class will teach you more about the world, but more importantly, it'll teach you how to form your own opinion, and take your own stance on issues of global importance. Even if you don't know much about PLSC, you could certainly pass this class with a great grade. It's not a gut class and if you don't read the news often, you'll have do some of the readings, but I know many people who get by on power points and do just fine. The first two exams had short definitions, a short essay, and a long essay. The last final exam (40%) is simply two long essays. You're always given many options as to which questions you'll like to answer so if you won't get stuck writing about China, for example, if you skipped that class. The professor is an entertaining lecturer and has a lot of experience in the field (has written countless books). If you shop for a good TF, you'll have a great experience with this class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is somewhat well read and knowledgeable on current events and recent world history. The course touches on a bunch of different topics but it doesn't really provide any depth.",
    "Take it if knowing about international relations is important to you. Makes an especially good fifth class for its light workload, but it's still enjoyable.",
    "Great class deffinetly a must for any Poli Sci major.",
    "I would recommend it. Not much work at all and pretty interesting\/relevant.",
    "Great course. Has a variety of very interesting subjects, and answers questions you don't dare ask.",
    "A great class that shows you the basics of international relations. While it may not be the most demanding class, it certainly does do its job of introducing you to what international relations deals with. I recommend this class for anyone who has an interest in politics, international relations, and who does not want a supper-demanding class.",
    "I would undoubtedly recommend International Relations to another student. I think it gives all students a great tool in which to view the world. Professor Howorth is a terrific teacher. Sections are a lot of fun and the material is crucial to our success as global citizens. I think all students should take this class.",
    "I would recommend it because it is interesting and pretty easy. There is a lot of reading but you don't have to do it all.",
    "If you're interested in International Relations, this is a great way to learn the fundamentals. If you're looking for an advanced course in IR, this isn't the class for you.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course as it is an excellent introduction to international relations.",
    "A good class to learn the basics of whats going on in the world.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would recommend it for as a survey course to determine if you want to continue with more specific studies. Overall not a terribly difficult course.",
    "PLSC 111 is a great introduction to International Relations. The past, present, and future are all studied. This class helps you understand current events. I would highly recommend this class. It is a manageable workload and very interesting. I feel I am much wiser after taking this class.",
    "This is a wonderful introduction into the realm of international theory. The course analyzes states' interactions through realist and liberal perspectives. A myriad of topics are studied through the course's texts and additional articles. I really enjoyed the guest lecturers! Personally, I would have enjoyed much greater coverage of the issues taking place in Latin America. However, this is a wonderful course for anyone interested in international politics.",
    "I would recommend this course. We began by taking a look at the different schools of thought concerning the relations between actors in the world system. We then went on to examine various contemporary issues.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to a fellow student. It gives a very good overview of what is going on in the world.",
    "Intro IR might not be the most engaging class, but it\u0092s good if your interested in becoming familiar with the major theories in international relations. You definitely get out of it what you put in. It\u0092s basically no work and you can get by with just the material on the slides (I didn\u0092t even buy the textbooks). Make sure you get a good TA though, because some of them actually give assignments which will determine how much time you\u0092ll be forced to spend on this class. Take INTS 172 instead if your interested in the major, care more about current events than theory, or are up for a slightly greater challenge.",
    "I would describe it as a way to learn about basic current issues in international politics. I would recommend it for another student.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. I think it would be better to take a more advanced class; I don't think this introduction is necessary.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone."
