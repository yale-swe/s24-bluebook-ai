    "I would recommend this class to another student, but only if it is a subject that you are truly interested in and passionate about - it requires a lot of reading and out of class research, but if you enjoy that, you will LOVE this class.",
    "Himalayan Collections was a dynamic, hands-on course that not only covers information about Himalayan countries but also gives an in-depth look into Yale's various library and museum collections. Professor Turin was an amazing instructor for the course - he took the time to make sure we were all as enthusiastic about the assignments. The course ended up being a fair amount of work; however, it was worked that we enjoyed doing. \"Lectures\" were held in different collections. We never fell into a boring lecture as case often be the case. Examining different materials every week and engaging with collections in various ways led to a completely different perspective on how courses could (and should) be taught at Yale. If you truly immerse yourself in the goals of this course, you will absolutely love it.",
    "This is a unique class that teaches both about Himalayan cultures and how to utilize many resources available for Yale students. A student doesn't need a strong background in South Asian studies to take this class because a lot will be learned and there was also plenty of discussion about ethics and art concepts that could be applicable to other areas of study as well.One thing I liked about it is that every few weeks, the class location changed, so the material was fresh and our excitement was renewed. This is definitely one of those cool classes in my schedule that friends would always ask more about.",
    "Unlike any other class at Yale\u00e2\u0080\u0094a really wonderful intro to the Digital Humanities with an amazing team. Take it!",
    "No unless they change hte structure to one where you learn something about the Himalayas. At the moment this is a course in glorified cataloguing -Not how the time of Yale students should be used.",
    "Not really. The final project was an enormous amount of work and we didn't really learn anything in the class besides what we taught ourselves. It was certainly a new kind of class though and if the digital humanities are your thing, go for it.",
    "This class is most useful, I think,to anyone who wants to gain a better grasp on the resources that Yale has to offer. It lets you into the variety of archives and collections and allows you to get a connection with individuals who will be highly capable of helping you with future research, should you have any desire to do research with these resources.For me, it was less about actually learning about the Himalayas and more so about puzzling over the archives, trying to engage with the stories that they had to offer. I found this aspect of the class quite enjoyable. It was made arduous by the format used to present the research done, as it was completed using an online website creating \"tool\" called Omeka. It was limiting in its abilities that was often frustrating.Despite these things though, I found the class interesting. I enjoyed the number of speakers who came to class, some were much better than others, though. Mark's enthusiasm for the course was phenomenal. He is highly approachable and kind, wanting his students to succeed. Great professor.",
    "Highly recommend. I went into the class not knowing what to expect but was very pleased with the class. Very experimental and engaging, it allows firsthand archival access, and teaches you how to us the archives effectively, a skill that is important to have. Definitely take it if you get a chance. Professor Turin is awesome.",
    "Take it!!! It was an absolutely fascinating course and it was always exciting to be able to dig through the archives and find interesting stories and learn about interesting people. Yale has incredible Himalayan archives and resources, and as undergrads, it is so rare to be exposed to such interesting archival materials, and to have such a huge amount of free reign in the archives too. We literally just got to dig throughbox after box, folder after folder; it was amazing. Especially as an anthropology major who hasn't done much archival work at all, it was really fascinating to see that \"archival\" side of anthro and how you might relate anthropology to the archives and to digital humanities. definitely, definitely take it -- also, if i haven't convinced you yet, mark turin is amazing and you should definitely take a class with him!",
    "It's hard to describe the course - the subject revolves around Himalayan and Tibetan culture, and we had numerous guest speakers on the topic. However, the bulk of the course involves digitizing and presenting materials related to Himalayan culture, using research from the archives. I doubt it will be taught again but if you have the chance, take it! Mark Turin is a fantastic teacher and anthropologist with firsthand experience in Nepal. It was a very enjoyable class."
