   "comments": [
    "The course follows a tight but healthy rhythm of pre-readings, a screening, question-posing, and subsequent discussion each week--with two major papers thrown in. The material covered is interesting, enjoyable, and thought-provoking, as are the discussions.",
    "FILM 444 is a look at the time period of the 1920's to the 1950\/60's through the films of Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder. Not only do we see the affects of censorship on them, but we also see the transition in the portrayal of events and figures at this time in history and we see how the two directors compare to each other. It is an analysis focused class, rather than a history\/cultural based class.",
    "TAKE IT! It is one of the most amazing classes I have taken at Yale! Highly recommend!",
    "The subject matter is inherently fascinating and Ron Gregg is one of Yale's most interesting and kindest professors. He is great at guiding seminar discussion and although I loved his lectures, he definitely shines in a smaller-class format. But take it if only for the chance to really marvel at Billy Wilder's career.",
    "Great! A class with Ron Gregg is a must! And this class has great films and fun discussions!",
    "Ron Gregg is an incredible professor and this class follows suit. Lubitsch and Wilder are a joy to study and class discussions are never dull.",
    "Take this class! Professor Gregg is wonderful in class and the movies are awesome. Some are funny, some are cynical, some are melancholic, but each is worth watching. The readings are short and lovely to do. It's really worth taking just to get into the minds of two directors I had heard very little about before this course.",
    "Yes!!!!!!",
    "There were lots of different levels of familiarity with the finer points of 1920s-1960s film and the careers of Lubitsch and Wilder, and while sometimes that made it tough for the less well-versed to participate as heavily in every discussion, it never felt like Professor Gregg was holding it against anyone. It is clear throughout that Greggs main goal is to meet us where we are and show us some great films we might not otherwise see and help us talk about them. Sexual modernity and censorship are just two of many themes we discuss around the films, so if those arent of extreme interest, there could still be something here for you.",
    "This is an amazing course and I absolutely recommend it",
    "This class gives a critical overview of the Hollywood film industry and the evolution of social norms from the mid-twenties through the sixties, through the work of Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder. I highly recommend this class."
