    "Definitely valuable to focus on one project for a whole year -- I am so happy I did the yearlong thesis.",
    "I wrote a thesis! I am so happy I did the yearlong intensive thesis. It was a great way to culminate my time as a Yale student.",
    "How to put on a show, how to develop a show, how to write a really long research paper, how to research, how not to get bored or frustrated with myself while writing a really long research paper.",
    "Great encouragement for independent project.",
    "I had to write, produce, and execute an entire solo performance mostly by myself. There were so many skills that go into that, but mostly it's the sense of accountability, that if you don't do it, it just won't happen. Beyond that, it's all the stuff that goes into what makes a successful hourlong comedy performance, from the craft to the pragmatics. I think one thing that I started to think about, but maybe too late, was the form of what I wanted my critical essay to look like. In the end, I appreciated that I had some flexibility, but I wasn't really able to have that perspective until later. I wish I'd started thinking about form earlier, rather than accept prefab structures of writing. I also really appreciated the diversity of work of my classmates, especially among those who did other creative projects. It was super enlightening to see the processes of such talented people. Truly among the coolest things I've done at Yale.",
    "Chris made this the most wonderful experience, and a very important learning space. His attention to us individually and collectively created a little community that I could rely on. I learned, on top of that, research methodology that I felt was lacking from my Amstud education. I learned not only what was expected for the senior essay, but how to craft an argument."

   "comments": [
    "Most of this is self-directed, but I thought the seminar itself was really helpful. It was also just really cool to see what everyone else was working on, and get to know the other American Studies majors.",
    "This was very much a self-starting process that required independent motivation, but Christopher was a great and supportive person to have. I liked his organization of small workshops which allowed me to hear about what other people were working on.",
    "I think that the workshopping sessions we did this semester were really helpful, and I loved hearing about other peoples' projects and bouncing ideas around a group of ridiculously talented and similarly invested peers. Otherwise, the meetings with Christopher were necessary and sufficient. I think splitting us up between true papers and creative projects was an excellent decision.",
    "To me, a colloquium could be a very rewarding experience for students, but as it stands I'm not sure that it quite works yet. I think that perhaps separating students working on projects versus papers might help this, as the stages and timing of the two vary so widely. I also think that stricter deadlines might help to keep students on track as well as to make it so that the peer experience in the colloquium is actually helpful.",
    "Good amount of guidance but not too overbearing.",
    "I felt like it was very frustrating to have to write my essay before I'd had a chance to finish the piece itself. I spent a lot of time writing the essay before the piece was finished, and when it was finished, I functionally had to rewrite the essay. I wish I'd been a little more in control of the deadlines and my own schedule. I found it most helpful talking to other people doing creative projects in the way they were thinking through their own work. It was essential to split apart the essays and those doing creative projects, and I wish it had happened earlier.",
    "This was a great balance between one-on-one time and collective conversation."

   "comments": [
    "This was the most valuable course I have taken at Yale. I enjoyed hearing about each of my peer's projects, meeting with Christopher consistently, and presenting at the American Studies symposium at the end of the year. Being enrolled in the year-long seminar allowed me to be productive on my thesis throughout the year and to constantly devote my time and energy to it. The deadlines were also very helpful too.",
    "YES! Do the yearlong thesis!! It was my favorite academic project of Yale.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend doing a yearlong thesis. It was an incredible experience to immerse myself in a topic of my own choosing and to watch the way my essay shaped itself over the course of the year. Yes it does get a bit stressful in the end, but know you can do it!",
    "lol i mean if u tryna graduate...",
    "I think doing a full year thesis is a rewarding experience, and definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes definitely. Time and space to do a project you've always wanted to do.",
    "Do this if you have a strong idea of a large project or question you want to answer, and are ready to be held accountable to it. There's a lot of breadth, and at times it's very scary and daunting, and everyone I spoke to had the same experience of being like \"oh shit, what if this just doesn't happen.\" The flip side of that is that when it does happen it feels very cool.",
    "Yes, I had a great time figuring out my senior essay in a welcoming and warm group of people. I wish there had been more essay writers bc I didn't get much peer feedback, but I liked being able to get through everything together. Chris made this a great course that I was happy to take for 2 semesters.",
    "I would recommend this to another student, but start your projects early!!! Don't wait until the last minute."
