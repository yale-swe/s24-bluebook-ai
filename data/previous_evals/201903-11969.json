    "The choice of readings was excellent -- I loved how the authors spoke to each other and the books intertwined. I am glad that we dove into a particular question (the state of intersectionality) and explored it from various perspectives. I was expecting that the class would be more \"the four books every WGSS Certificate holder must have read at least once,\" or \"the four most important books in WGSS published in the past five years;\" neither of which was the case. Perhaps the full class version of this workshop could be organized around those lines."
