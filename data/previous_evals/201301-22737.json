   "comments": [
    "This course was a good introduction to the Aeneid, teaching some of the less-commonly taught books. Professor Johnston made an effort to integrate Roman socio-cultural material into the course, though there were other, unplanned tangents during class as well. I had no trouble picking up scansion and the other skills necessary for reading Latin poetry. The class did have a tendency to get monotonous or routine at times, however. Still, an overall solid way to dive into Virgil.",
    "I would highly recommend LATN 141 01.",
    "Latin 141 is a great class for those interested in learning more about Virgil's Aeneid. The poetry and meter we learn is interesting and prominent. The class consists mostly of translating. The quizzes are very manageable as are the tests.",
    "A pretty good introduction to reading poetry in Latin, with its rich web of mythical and etymological associations. Johnston is a bit of a pushover but he's really knowledgeable and will help you learn in the way you want to learn."
