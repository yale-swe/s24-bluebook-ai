   "comments": [
    "It is a great course if you are interested in doing your own observing on your own time, and willing to figure out the sometimes complicated computer software for the class. Also, it was much more time consuming and frustrating than you would think, considering it's only 1\/2 a credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. However, I should warn the student that he or she might be disappointed at times since the software for collecting data has been prone to malfunction, which sometimes equates to data-less observing nights. But the excellent images from the observations and almost boundless opportunities to explore the night sky definitely enhances this course's brilliance.",
    "Basically, this is a lab science class, but the lab reports are not tedious.",
    "It's interesting and probably something you've never done before, and it doesn't hurt to give it a shot.",
    "USE A TELESCOPE",
    "Take this if you are interested in astronomy but do not want to take an actual astronomy course. There are only six labs all semester, so it is really not very much work at all.",
    "Recommend.",
    "Absolutely. If you have a little bit of extra space in your schedule, this class really doesn't take up that much time and you leave feeling like you've accomplished something. It's small, it's once a week, and you actually use some of Yale's resources. Some of the labs are more tedious than others, but all were enjoyable."
