   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend this class as it is essential for future global professionals to understand research and what lies beneath.",
    "I would summarise GLBL 802 by saying that it has been one of the most rewarding courses in my university career. I have really struggled but learnt an incredible amount and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone that wants an introduction to statistics.",
    "No. Not worth it. Too much work, learn little.",
    "Yes and No. On the one hand it was a good review of stats terms but on the other hand I feel like I did not learn that much in STATA.",
    "i would tell a friend its a great class that goes over really interesting material that can be helpful to your research. i would highly recommend it.",
    "If you are interested in stats or researches, this class is definitely a good one as a start.",
    "This course is a must-take course for any student interested in international relations or public policy. Knowing statistics is important in a variety of fields, and this is the course that will give a student a solid foundation.",
    "A graduate level introductory statistics course. This is NOT a STATA course. I would recommend it, because Professor Thomas is nice but not because the material was easily understood throughout the semester.",
    "Statistics for political scientists. A basic introduction to statistical theory with a focus on applying it to social science topics and studies, particularly emphasizing the ability to interpret statistics.",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course to fellow students in Jackson and in other programs.",
    "excellent introductory course on statistics and quantitative analysis",
    "Would recommend this course. Good introduction to applied stats and necessary in my opinion in order to critically evaluate research which can complement public policy.",
    "This course is a graduate-level introduction to quantitative research methods for those with little background in this area. It provides sufficient instruction to be able to understand and evaluate basic quantitative research and statistical data. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a basic-level understanding of this subject.",
    "I recommend for those interested in quantitative analysis.",
    "It is an intro to statistics class that covers a lot of the theory without a lot of the math.",
    "Probably the most useful and important a social science graduate can take. Gives an excellent overview of the unknown world of stats, which turns out to be hugely interesting",
    "Good introductory course; begins with fundamentals and gets progressively more complex and difficult. Professor Thomas is lively and has very good lecture notes. However, attending and paying attention to lectures is necessary to properly understand the material. Problem sets are often difficult, but not impossible, and simply require lots of time. Make sure to attend office hours, particularly for the theoretical aspects which are extensively tested in the midterm and final.",
    "GLBL 802 is a good introduction that presents basic statistics in a manner that makes the value and applicability of the methodology clear. I would recommend this course to someone looking for a basic introduction to statistics.",
    "GLBL802 is an introductory class in statistics through a social science lens. I would recommend this class to another student in a global affairs-related field, as it provides essential tools for quantitative analysis.",
    "\"In a semester you will understand foundational statistical concepts and be able to decode much of the research\/quantitative work that you may encounter in the professional sector you will enter after Yale. Plus, the instructor will *actually* make it interesting and will continually bring these concepts back to scenarios you will encounter in the real world, i.e. the perennial \"why do I care?\" quandry. If that sounds like your cup of tea, then this is the class you should take.\""

   "comments": [
    "It provided me with the more structured understanding of the statistical methods used in the reseach. Also i have never used Stata before, so it was very helpful for me in this sense too.",
    "I now have a basic understanding of statistics and how to produce and interpret them. I deem this useful in just about any research or professional position.",
    "I am taking this course with a hope to learn advanced usage of stata which is extremely important in my work and research but I got out very disappointed.",
    "This was a good review of stats, but we stopped right in the middle of regressions, so one has to take another class to know how to do those.",
    "It's probably the most useful course that I've taken thus far, I had no statistical background and I learnt a lot.",
    "I learned things I can help to advance my research for the rest of my life.",
    "Some basic concepts would be so helpful for my future career.",
    "This course will serve as a basis to learn more advanced quantitative methods, both for reading and understanding research and creating my own research.",
    "Somewhat; I have taken statistics before and didn't go as far into theory. This course is not particularly useful for the field I want to enter after I leave Yale but it will make me a better consumer of statistical analysis.",
    "I feel much better prepared to conduct and evaluate research in my field, therefore leading to more robust and relevant conclusions.",
    "to a great extent. came in with little knowledge of the discipline and walked away with a good knowledge of it.",
    "I'm sure it will help me when I have to evaluate research.",
    "it gave me the tools to be able to back up my claims.",
    "The approach this course took demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses regarding how statistical methods are used within the public policy realm.",
    "I hope to do quantitative research and analysis in the future, and it definitely deepened both my interest and knowledge of the field.",
    "This course provided me with great foundational tools. My only point of constructive criticism is that I wish we had spent more time working on regression (and perhaps less time on small sample tests), as I believe that would be of greater utility to many of the students who will not elect to take additional statistics coursework."
