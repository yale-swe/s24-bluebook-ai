   "comments": [
    "I learned how to read critically, be creative, and think like a writer. I can't watch movies without thinking about how the writer must have structured it and how the plot diagram was created. Definitely became a better writer!",
    "I learned how to be open in my wiring and to experiment with new writing forms that I might not be as comfortable with.",
    "Particularly in the area of drama, I learned a lot of new elements about the elements of craft which make up a good piece of creative writing. I also think that I became a better writer just by virtue of being forced to practice every week.",
    "I learned a great deal about writing poetry, plays, and short fiction in this course. I also learned how to critically observe writing in different ways and consider the question of intention behind creative writing.",
    "I learned how to write more clearly and more accurately what I intended on writing in my prose and poetry. No matter how good of a writer you think you are, this course is a wide-arching and logical introduction to the craft of creative writing. We also got to make a portfolio in the end that helped us really understand our individual total progress.",
    "I realized who I was a writer and what kinds of things draw my attention. This class helped me contextualize my scope as a writer.",
    "By taking this course, I learned much new knowledge about writing fiction pieces, poetry, and drama.",
    "Good practice in three different writing forms. It was a fun challenge to do the three different genres. I only wish I had more time to dive into the three different writing styles."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There honestly isn't much I would change about this course. I think it was challenging but manageable.",
    "This course was very engaging and based primarily on discussion. Every student got a chance to have one of their works workshopped; however, I wished we could receive more feedback on our writing pieces before we turned in our final portfolio.",
    "Although I recognize that this class is not designed to be a workshop, I do think I would have gained a lot out of sharing my work with other students on a more frequent basis. I also think the writing to reading ratio could be a lot higher, because we didn't really have the time to engage with the texts on a meaningful level (for example, spending half of a class period on an entire play) and the amount of reading came at the expense of additional writing assignments. I also think it's borderline ridiculous to cover fiction, poetry, and drama in a single semester. In summation, think this course could improve a lot if it was a two-semester cycle, or split up into three different courses (intro to fiction, intro to poetry, intro to drama). It was just way too much to cover meaningful reading, study of craft, and writing of fiction, poetry, and drama in a single class.",
    "I thought the course was strong in its coverage of all three topics. The only change I'd suggest would be to require more out-of-class independent workshops, as I found these very valuable.",
    "The strengths are that you will get an intelligent introduction into prose, poetry and drama but the weakness stands that there is not enough time for the poetry and drama units of the course. A lot of your writing will miss you professor a couple of times and it can be disheartening but that is the only flaw of this course; you have to remind yourself of the subjectivity to creative writing.",
    "The course is strong because it is a small class that forces you to be engaged in and attend every meeting that you can. Also, you may write about any topic that is interesting to you for each unit, which helps to make the course more enjoyable. Can't think of much to improve upon.",
    "Excellent survey of writing. I think that the only challenge of the course is just as you are feeling comfortable trying to explore the genre the course moves on to the next genre. I think that the lectures between the three sections could be held at a separate time so that there would be more class time for discussion of the craft."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Anyone who is looking for a fun, challenging, and new perspective to writing should take this class! Danielle Chapman is an excellent professor and I hope my future professors can hold up to her standard.",
    "Yes, it is a very good way to learn what it means to be a writer as well as finding your own unique voice.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is not that serious about writing (such as someone who's majoring in something drastically different and taking this course just for fun). It's a light workload and a fine introduction to the basics, and you might produce something good out of it. For students who have experience with creative writing or care about it on a deeper level, I would strongly recommend taking a more intensive introductory course in either fiction, poetry, or drama.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's interesting and thought-provoking as well as genuinely fun.",
    "Yes. I learned many new skills that I otherwise may not have. Even though I am not majoring in any area that quite has to do with creative writing, it is a very fun class and you get to read great pieces by other students as well as discover your own unique writing style.",
    "Yes. If they are interested in writing it is a great exploration of different genres. Also writing courses at Yale are few and far between because they have decided to make it not possible for everyone to explore creative writing, so basically if you get into the course take it."
