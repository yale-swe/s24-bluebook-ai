   "comments": [
    "Yes, seeing as anyone who has begun with ITAL 110 must take ITAL 120 in order to receive credit, I would certainly recommend that they take the course with Karen Raizen if it is offered again.",
    "The grammar is reviewed and new grammar is added, however it is based on the previous year. One is introduced to the italian culture and politics as well as movies and literature.",
    "Italian is really hard.",
    "Yes I would, as long as you love the language, this class will be worth it",
    "Realistically, if you took l1 you have to take l2. That being said l2is great! You'll learn enough to start speaking about more interesting things, and the greater emphasis on literature and film was great.",
    "I would recommend taking Italian, because the language is simply beautiful, and the department is a blast. L2 was much more manageable than L1. The textbook chapters were supplemented by readings by Boccaccio, films, and an opera. In addition, at the end of the term, extra credit was offered for attending the Italian film festival which was great fun. Also at the end of the term, final projects meant researching an aspect of Italian culture. (Most people chose to research food!) These assignments made L2 much more of a cultural class than L1. Professor Raizen is absolutely amazing. She has a lot of supplemental power points which help elucidate grammar idiosyncrasies. And she was always eager to meet outside of the classroom to clear up any confusion and go over tests. Her instruction made a huge difference!"
