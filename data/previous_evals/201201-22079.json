   "comments": [
    "Hindi L2 is exactly the same as Hindi L1. Same teachers, quizzes on Friday, grammar during the week. If you liked L2, take L2.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in taking a South Asian language. The work load is not very heavy, the instructors are fantastic, and the course is all-in-all enjoyable. We have two weekly quizzes--one based on grammar, the other on vocab--and a journal entry every week. We have some homework, but it's altogether less than L1. Our midterm is to write and perform a skit, and our final is a writing assignment. The language itself is challenging, but the class simplifies it.",
    "If you took Hindi 110, you will obviously be taking this class. Enough said.",
    "Well, if you took 110, you don't really have a choice. The class is a lot more work and really disorganized, but by the end you'll be surprised at how much your Hindi has improved.",
    "Not the most rigorous treatment of the language, but definitely enjoyable and manageable and a good introduction to the language. You will get as much our of it as you put into it - it is easy to get by putting in a minimal amount of work, but if you're willing to put the time in you can learn a lot. The week spend watching a Bollywood movie in class and the midterm skits were a highlight. Definitely worth taking if you're trying to fulfill the language requirement or at all interested in learning the language.",
    "I would recommend Hindi 120 to another student because the teachers are quite good and interested in helping the students to learn. The workload is fair and the TA's for the classes are kind and approachable.",
    "Great continuation of Hindi L1. Similar types of homework, fun projects, and movie clips\/music. Workload is very manageable, and you will definitely learn a lot of Hindi.",
    "Hindi 120 is the L2 continuation of Hindi 110. You need to take both in order to get credit.Although this class can seem a bit disorganized at times, I've noticed steady improvement in my Hindi language ability. I also really enjoyed it! And as far as structure and assignments, it's very similar to the L1 class.",
    "Hindi has the potential to be a great class. The professors are sweet and forgiving. However, the structure just wasn't there. I took a romance language throughout high school, and felt that the way those languages are taught is much more effective (a lot of memorization, speaking drills, and repeated conjugation worksheets). In Hindi, if you really wanted to learn the material, you had to rely generally on self-directed study, which is fine for some but especially for me made it very difficult to see results. This is partly due to the fact that there are simply fewer teaching materials on Hindi available, in comparison to a language like Spanish or French. However, the script is simple and easy to memorize- I had it down within the first two weeks of class.There were also twice-weekly quizzes (Monday and Friday) and daily homework assignments and journals, though I'm not sure how those were graded or if they even counted. The whole class structure and grading scale was very mysterious, come to think of it.... I might not recommend this class.",
    "Chill, fun class. Take it if you want to keep learning Hindi!",
    "important not to stop at hindi 110 because 120 is where you really begin to understand and speak.",
    "Hindi L2 was pretty much a review of Hindi L1. While it was good to get a more solid grip on the material from first semester, I wish we had learned more advanced language concepts and learned more about Indian culture. But hey, it was Hindi class -- it was fun."
