    "Math 544 is a good introduction to algebraic topology. Sam (topolojesus) is very good lecturer and helpful outside the class. The material can be hard but it is accessible. Th homework is fair and engaging. I would definitely take it again.",
    "It depends on what level he is at. If he is familiar with topology and algebra, then sure take it. Otherwise the workload might be difficult to balance.",
    "544 covers the fundamental group, covering spaces, homology, and some cohomology. No background in algebraic topology is really assumed, but the course doesn't move slowly so it helps to have some familiarity.",
    "The course covered all the basics of fundamental groups, homology, and cohomology from Hatcher. I think the course would be crucial for most pure math graduate students.",
    "Math 544 is a very good second course in algebraic topology. I would highly recommend this course to other students, as it provides solid foundational knowledge for the modern study of topology."
