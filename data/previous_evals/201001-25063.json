    "I would for all the reasons mentioned above.",
    "Interesting lectures, not too much reading, the papers and section are the only grades, and the papers are difficult to write well.",
    "I would say that this class is a good class to take if you enjoy thinking about morality and its relationship to society. Be prepared to do some deep thinking, and to read difficult (but short) material. I would recommend this to all students at Yale. You might want to start off as Credit\/D, but may find that you will switch after the first paper.",
    "Take it credit\/d\/fail or you will probably get some sort of B or C. The readings are not heavy, and the lectures are good, but Shelly is pretty biassed in his accounts of the theories that are discussed. Section is a headache because everyone talks over each other to get a good participation grade (25%). With all of that said, the course brings up very interesting and very important issues, and everyone should have a solid foundation in ethics--take it!",
    "I can't see coming to Yale and not taking Intro to Ethics\/Life\/Death. You need to ponder these things at some point to feel like an Ivy League student. Take it Cr\/D\/F! Unless you have an ungodly amount of time to spend harassing Prof Kagan and your TA all semester.",
    "This course doesn't survey a whole lot of philosophers. It focuses on a few, really studying closely their positions on ethics and objections to them. It is the perfect Cr\/D course. Three 5 page papers that are based on pretty open ended questions and don't require you to do a lot of course reading and no tests. But the sections require you to be caught up with lectures\/readings.",
    "It's what you've probably heard about it. Great class, and although you've probably heard horror stories about just how harsh of a grader Kagan is, there's a magic formula to owning his papers: write them in the style of a math proof (i.e. with all the requisite jargon), but devoid of any real substance. If you want to know how to write a good philosophy paper, your best move would be to look up a few math papers from journals and try to emulate the writing style.",
    "Good as a second Philosophy course, because it gets very technical at times. Take Life first. Better course, and will tell you if you like Shelly Kagan. Very good though.",
    "great class, lots of fun, take it!",
    "You don't really want to take this class. Kagan's lectures are decent but they focus far too much on his own opinions and not on the theories and texts themselves. The grading is notoriously harsh. For some reason Kagan has developed a reputation as the rock star of the philosophy department, but out of the 7 philosophy classes I have taken, he is my least favorite professor.If someone else is teaching it, Intro Ethics may be worthwhile. If Kagan is still teaching it, look for a class taught by Della Rocca or especially Ken Winkler.",
    "Very interesting class. Shelly is engaging (albeit zany) and brings up some really interesting and relevant points about moral philosophy. Can be a little repetitive, but not annoyingly so. Provides great background knowledge on the philosophy of some of the most influencial writers in ethics - mainly Mill, Kant, and Hume.",
    "I find ethics less interesting than other branches of philosophy, but for people interested in ethics, this is a great starter course. Moreover, this is a topic that anyone seriously interested in philosophy should have at least some background in. Definitely take this.",
    "Hard, enigmatic, but altogether rewarding.",
    "This was an exciting class that I honestly looked forward to attending each lecture. While the papers definitely take a great deal of thought, they are quite rewarding in the end. Grading is tough, so the Credit\/D\/Fail is a good option for most; however, it is not impossible to do well. Professor Kagan challenges you to do well. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in philosophy or ethics.",
    "Take this class if you REALLY are interested in learning about important Ethical ideas. If you are, it will propel you through some of the more difficult moments in the class. If you are an inexperienced writer, you might have some difficulty, but other than that, work-load wise this class is very reasonable. More than any class I've taken at Yale, you are taught by ideas and discussion, not by plugging through hours at the library with thousands of pages of reading. Shelly Kagan is a joy--he carefully guides you through some very tricky waters in a way that is clear, helpful, and interesting. Later in the semester, if you've been doing well, the lectures do tend to become a little more boring only because Shelly is making sure that everyone understands what is going on--but I'd much rather master the material and be a little bored than be totally lost in philosophical musings.In fact, for me the only negative of this class is the presence of the semi-rabid, grade-grubbing EPE majors...Intro Ethics is a requirement for them and let's just say that they can become a little annoying in section when you're actually trying to make progress. Sorry to generalize.",
    "Take this class if you want to skip lectures and get good grades. Now, if you suck at writing, keep looking. This will SUCK.",
    "Absolutely Recommended. Must take.",
    "This class is a great introduction to different moral theories that emphasizes the philosophies themselves rather than the philosophers (the readings are way way less important than the lectures--reading is also really light). Definitely take advantage of having the opportunity to learn from Kagan, because his explanations are very clear and also very insightful. The paper writing process wasunbelievably difficult--it requires you to learn a whole new style of thinking and writing. At the same time, the process of learning a new methodology was really rewarding--part of what college should be all about, I think.",
    "Philosophy 175 is a look at some of the major theories surrounding morality. It's heavily lecture based, so if you don't learn well through lectures, itmight not be the class for you. It is very interesting and thought provoking though. I would definitely recommend it to someone I knew was interested in this subject.",
    "Definitely. I think the lectures, reading, and writing were all incredibly interesting. If you're taking it for credit, it definitely forces you to engage with the material so much that you can't help but get a lot out of it. I wouldn't take it for a grade though unless you've already had a bunch of philosophy classes.",
    "Yes if you're interested in the field of ethics and like thinking about this sort of thing and have opinions on it. Makes the lectures more interesting, section fun, and paper writing easy (although the grades are another story). On grades: it can be brutal. I kind of tend to believe if you have a knack for philosophy papers you'll do well. But going to your TF and talking about what you're writing about helps a LOT. Start out credit\/d and see how you do.",
    "This is an introduction to ethics and various theories of morality that try and answer the question: \"how should one live?\" I would recommend this course to every student at Yale, and I would recommend taking it as soon as possible. Your ideas and decisions regarding this course could alter the way you go about your career here at Yale.",
    "Intro to Ethics is a intro philosophy course on the philosophical theories of ethics. It does not include debates on the ethics of specific topics, but rather broad, philosophical theories by different philosophers on how morality is determined. The topic is very interesting, but do not expect it to really affect your life and how you view ethical dilemmas. Also, the grading is extremely difficult. I would recommend this class, but only if you're really interested in the topic.",
    "This course is perhaps the greatest myth at yale. Unlike cold war, con law or some of the other mythical courses at yale, intro to ethics with Kagan is a huge disappointment. In short, at some point in your yale career you will be tempted to take this course. So long as it is taught by Kagan, recall the ending to the story of Adam and Eve and ignore the temptation.",
    "I'd recommend it. Shelly's an epic lecturer, and it's an opportunity to think deeply without stressing too much over weekly homework.",
    "I was excited at first, but was overwhelmed with how much time we spent on Mill and Kant. I think a more broad survey over different theories would be better. I discovered I wasn't as interested in Ethics as I thought, but it was still a good class. Learning to write a philosophy paper well was a valuable skill to acquire, and there's no class like a Shelly Kagan class to motivate you to learn how to write such a paper well.",
    "While the class does offer a very basic coverage of topics in ethics, t covers essentially four texts, and it is filled with people who intend to take only one philosophy course at Yale. To anyone who enjoys reading philosophy or thinks that one should read more than a very select few authors a semester, do not take this class.",
    "The course and the section are good on their own but the class as a whole is missing something. I just didn't find the material interesting \/ important enough to care about. We spend too much time discussing these deep theories that will never matter in real life.",
    "You should probably take this course, and you're probably fine taking it with a lecturer other than Kagan, just because Kagan is pretty good but I don't see why another professor wouldn't be as good. It's not the best course at Yale, but it's pretty good, and it will definitely give you some new perspectives on what actions are moral. If you're taking it with Kagan, I'd suggest Cr\/D option, not because Kagan is ridiculously hard but because the grading feels so arbitrary that it's tough to predict how you'll do in the class. Also, make sure you write to the prompts--you will get a D or F on your essay if it is a good essay that does not directly address the prompt. If it says to evaluate Utilitarianism, then you need to do more than just show how the philosophy would treat a scenario...you need to EVALUATE.",
    "EPE major and therefore forced to take this class. I took it Credit\/D\/Fail and have no regrets using my one Credit\/D on it!Grading: The grading is medium but more annoying is the fact that you will not know your grade until the end of the class (if ever). Because Kagan and TAs try to kill you with low grades on the first paper and are willing to weight later papers more, which you will presumably improve on, so you will not know your grade. They give low grades on the first paper just to meet the expectations that they've set.Workload: Easy to medium. Reading is minimal and only like 17 pages of writing for the entire class. Section is required, however.Section: Terrible. Because section is a big part of your grade (25 percent), you cannot ever miss. Far worse, however, is that students try to show off a lot and dominate the discussion--at least in my section. That ruins the discussion section environment.Lectures: pretty good... Kagan has his own unique style. The conversational style can get a bit sleep-inducing midway through the year, but it is pretty cool overall.Overall: If you are interested in philosophy a lot and don't mind the way that it is taught in a university setting, you may like this class. Kagan is definitely unique and it is worth figuring out if you like his style. I personally discovered that I do not like philosophy and do not like the graded discussion section style for philosophy debate. Other students may have loved it though.",
    "3 papers and mandatory section. The workload is manageable but you have to go to lecture to fully understand the concepts which can be somewhat difficult to understand upon the first read. This course is great and i highly recommend it.",
    "This course was very interesting, although it became slightly redundant further on. The grading is very harsh, which is unfortunate because an introductory course ought to encourage student interest in a field, not discourage them from trying new things out.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! The lectures aren't absolutely necessary to do well in the class, but I would say that you should go anyway, becuase Kagan is a fun lecturer. The topics and papers are fun to think about and argue with your friends about. Definitely take the class with two or three other people you know, if you can.",
    "Great class",
    "This is a very good introduction to philosophical attempts to deal with morality. It is harshly graded, but if you show improvement, the grades respond. Shelly is an engaging lecturer who has philosophy lecturing down to a science. He hits on all the main points one might have about ethics. If you are not the philosophical type and will be thrown off by the use of reasoned arguments to consider ethical questions, then this is not for you, but if you understand and would like a philosophy course on ethics, this is a great course.",
    "Reading light.Class repetitive in a pleasant way.Papers graded tough.Kagan is a real character, and he's very accessible to talk to after class.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. Unnecessary if you have taken Directed Studies.",
    "Great course! take it!",
    "it's a great class but if you really want to get the most out of it, do the readings. honestly.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone looking for a thorough introduction to ethical issues, regardless of whether you intend to continue on taking philosophy classes or not.",
    "This class was a good overview of the basic theories of ethics. I would recommend this class to someone who likes to think abstractly about the larger questions of life--right versus wrong, free will, etc--and who would be willing to work very hard to get a good grade. This class does not require as much time as others, but it requires a high level of analysis. However, don't be scared away--if you work hard, you can get a pretty decent grade.",
    "If this will be your first philosophy course and you're looking for an accessible introduction to ethics, then I'd recommend it pretty highly. If you've taken real philosophy classes before and have come to expect any kind of philosophical rigor in dealing with concepts, then you should probably look elsewhere.Kagan is very very good at getting his audience to understand what he wants them to understand, but often lets theatrics take the place of honest consideration of his less favorite avenues of thought.Please understand when you take this course that your getting \"Shelly Kagan's Ethics.\" Now, Kagan is an incredibly intelligent professor and his views are certainly respectable, but every time Kagan introduces a philosophical objection or possibility only to throw his hands up and declare it 'stupid' or 'silly,' PLEASE be suspicious and take it with a grain of salt.Regarding the 'hard' paper grading. Shelly does seem to be earnestly dedicated to the idea that papers should not be graded easily, but that we should improve over the semester and that our better papers at the end should count more. Accordingly, he gives the TA's serious rein to grade harshly. Unfortunately, the TA's often seem to take this freedom as an opportunity to grade harshly according to personal preferences rather than this ideal of a 'good philosophy paper' Kagan goes on about. However, as a student, it's still certainly manageable to discover your TA's preferences and pander accordingly, so don't let the \"harsh\" grading be a deterrent. Also, just Credit\/D it if you're worried.",
    "Kagan is a very good professor and does a good job of presenting the issues, even if you're not particularly interested in them. However, if this is your first time dealing with philosophy, don't be turned off by the analytical nature of the class. Theclass is incredibly analytical, and that makes section and papers irritating at times. Philosophy doesn't have to be analytical, though. There are more personally interesting ways to look at philosophy.",
    "Philosophy 175 was a fun class that explored more modern ideas in ethics and morality. The readings were difficult, but Shelly's lectures clarified them greatly. However, the lectures can get repetitive at times. Shelly's grading is difficult, but when you earn a good grade from him you know you *earned* it and as such it is more meaningful than a good grade in a gut class. I am disappointed that I did not come out of this class with a thorough idea of what morality is and what actions are morally permissible, however I think that this is due more to that nature of morality than to any particular aspect of the course.",
    "It depends on who the student is and what parts of philosophy they find interesting.",
    "A survey of ethical though from Mill, to Kant, to Hobbes, with some tangential thinkers in between. Just for the importance of the philosophy it is a good class to take.",
    "Yes, but I found the grading to be very harsh.",
    "People say that Kagan is a hard grader, and this is most certainly true. Even if you've taken other courses with him, the curve in this class is much tougher than in either Death or Life. Other than that, this is an amazing course. Interesting ideas, a wonderfully engaging professor, and everything you could want from Yale. All EP&E majors are required to take it; I think that should be expanded to everyone in the college. Take it, but be prepared.",
    "You'll be suprised at how the seemingly arcane topics covered in this course are applicable to section discussions across disciplines at Yale.",
    "Yes. It was fun and the papers aren't too difficult once you figure out the format.",
    "The curve is very hard, that's true. But if you try hard on the essays, go to lecture, and write the papers like Kagan wants them to be written (he has a handout at the beginning of the semester)then you should do fine.",
    "A must for anyone with a slight interest in philosophy. Kagan is engaging, the issues are relevant, and the workload is manageable. This class did much to heighten my interest in philosophy.",
    "Intro to Ethics is an excellent course. The readings are generally short and manageable, though they require full attention and careful reading to digest. Shelly Kagan is an absolute master at explaining the reasoning of each philosophical approach examined in the course. There may be a lack of strict standards in the grading of the papers by different TA's. I would recommend taking int Cr\/D but still trying hard on the papers.Shelly Kagan is a jedi of step-by-step reasoning. He leaves very little unexplored, and he has a fine way of elucidating philosophical concerns. He is entertaining and good-humored. His lectures progress logically and are as clear as one could hope. He shows his concern for students by his willingness to discuss issues with them after class and during office hours.",
    "A great course if you're looking to learn about some basic moral philosophy. Don't expect to get an A. What you will get is a great basic foundation in understanding morality and ethics, and a tough, honest critique of your analytical thinking.",
    "Despite the fact that I took Intro Ethics credit\/D, it was my toughest class this semester. I would say: don't take it, unless you're really into philosophy or ethics or want to do ep&e. I ended up leaving the class not knowing if I have learned anything at all, and being incredibly frustrated with the process of writing philosophy papers. Kagan is a good lecturer but the papers and the grading system absolutely sucked.",
    "It's an interesting class that helps you understand the many different theories about ethics that are floating around out there. However, if you're looking for a system of ethics to guide you through our morally ambiguous world, you're out of luck. As I've said above, you'll learn a lot in this class but the answers you find will only lead to more questions. At the end of the day, the one thing that I realized about ethics was that there are NO real answers, just more questions to ponder."
