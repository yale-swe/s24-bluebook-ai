    "I felt like I left the course with a deep understanding of the natural experiment methodology, but more importantly with a broader understanding of the nature of causal research in general. By the end of the course, I began to be able to discern between well-executed studies that present convincing theories and evidence and weaker studies. I feel like I could now come up with experimental designs on my own and evaluate them. I also appreciated the practical focus of the course. The GIS assignment and the text analysis tutorials were hugely helpful."

    "I really liked the way the syllabus was divided up. Reading several different approaches to one subject was a really effective way to teach us how to evaluate research designs. It also made it so you could see the evolution of the field and understand the current important questions. I also appreciated the practical focus of the course. The GIS assignment and the text analysis tutorials were hugely helpful.",
    "I really liked this course but I would have liked to have learned about qualitative methods in more detail, especially how to incorporate qualitative data into a quantitative project. We did cover this in terms of text analysis, and it would have been great to have hands on experience with other examples."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. One helpful aspect was that it gave such a broad overview of different subjects and research questions. While focusing on a particular set of tools, we were able to see how they would apply to questions from all over the field. This left me feeling like I had a real sense of what the important questions are in the field, something that usually takes years to start to understand. I would also recommend it because it helped me think of several projects I want to undertake on my own and made me believe I could accomplish them.",
    "Yes, definitely."
