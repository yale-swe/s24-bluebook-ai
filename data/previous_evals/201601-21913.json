    "NELC 116 is an amazing course. I went into it knowing barely anything about the topic and came out knowing so much more information. You should definitely take it if you have any interest in mythology.",
    "The course is a very good introduction to the literature of Mesopotamia. The coverage is broad and should find resonance with many students. Interesting connections are made to the biblical, ancient Egyptian,and Greco-Roman traditions. A good course overall for reading not just Gilgamesh but also interesting myths with weird demons and philosophies on life. Recommended.",
    "The first gods in human culture and how they trickle down to our religion today. I would totally recommend to another student because its fascinating and makes you think and Professor Frahm is a really cool guy to learn from as he knows EVERYTHING."
