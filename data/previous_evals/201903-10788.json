    "This course really challenged me and encouraged me to think critically about how I could improve my Japanese. Even though it was really difficult at the time, I now recognize grammar patterns and vocab at at substantially higher level than I did before.",
    "This class built upon what we learned in Japanese 110 and 120, finishing up JSL 3 and starting the Sura-Sura textbook. We learned new grammar and kanji and vocabulary, but it's not all that different than 110 and 120 in structure.",
    "My pronunciation got improved a lot. The pronunciation exercises are very helpful.",
    "I developed a thorough understanding of different grammar forms and vocabulary in Japanese, as well as a greater fluency in the unspoken tonal dialect of the language."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I didn't find the class to have any weaknesses -- it just has a lot of work.",
    "Strengths: I like both JSL and Sura-Sura as textbooks for learning Japanese - especially since Sura-Sura includes reading portions that show how kanji are used in writing. The class is well-structured for learning the content in each lesson, and we know what we're going to be tested on. What could be improved: we already spend a significant amount of time on speaking in class, but I think more actual conversation practice would be useful.",
    "One main weakness was the fact that oral exams were not schedule to ensure that all students had been to the preparation clinic beforehand.",
    "I think the structure of the course is excellent. I hope we can have more grammar exercises in the class time.",
    "Strengths: This has been the most fruitful learning experience of my life with respect to density of Japanese learned in such a short time, and I can't understate how important is. The Professor is stern about the basics but willing to explore the class's questions about Japanese culture in depth. Weaknesses: The tutorial sessions were hard to follow and adequately study before tests, and were not an expected or very welcome addition to a course that already requires a serious time commitment. The daily Kanji tests that began during the second part of the semester were extremely hard to study for on consistently short notice. It felt like \"jumping through the hoops\" was sometimes prioritized over language learning, for example the strictness of rules around tardiness. Language to me is often about improvisation and adapting to the situation at hand, and the emphasis on memorization rather than free response felt very limiting. For example, even in the final, we were expected to regurgitate a story from the textbook from memory rather than come up with our own stories. Lastly, for a new student, the abbreviations used in homework sheets were extremely difficult to understand at first."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! I love Japanese and Nishimura Sensei does a great job of making students excited about the material.",
    "If you've taken JAPN110 and 120 and want to continue your studies, or if you're coming in as an intermediate Japanese learner, I'd recommend it. It's certainly not easy (intensive language learning never is), but it's well-structured for learning and I enjoyed it.",
    "If they have the time, yes. It's very time intensive but well structured and taught.",
    "Yes, I will to those who want to study Japanese.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is serious about Japanese language learning and wants to be challenged by their classroom environment."
