    "I would recommend it only to those interested in fluid-dynamics",
    "Overall a very good class, contains solid introduction part as well as some advances topics. Instructor explains material well and in a comprehensive way. One would get an understanding of basic ideas and problems in the field of turbulence.",
    "The course provides a comprehensive overview of turbulence phenomena, challenges, past and current methods for solving them. This course is rewarding, because the lectures are clear and the instructor is extremely helpful. I would recommend the class to students with a background in fluid mechanics, who want to learn the fundamental physics behind turbulence and develop a new way of thinking.",
    "I would summarize it as course that gives you a good idea, without the need of getting into a too complicated reasoning (i.e. avoiding complex math, etc), about a broad range of aspects of turbulence, and I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student because it helped me clarify my previous ideas about the subject.",
    "I did not find that course required much prior knowledge of fluid dynamics, so I would recommend it to anyone planning to do research in a related field.",
    "Would recommend without any hesitation. Excellent course."
