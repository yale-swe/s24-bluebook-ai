    "Strong class, you read the African-American literary canon with a great Professor. The structure of the course can be annoying (weekly reading responses) but the syllabus and discussion are excellent.",
    "Amazing reading list. Like most classes at Yale, meeting once a week does not provide enough time to discuss the readings. Professor Goldsby is an amazing professor, and she would be an amazing lecturer if this course ever becomes a lecture. So don't despair if the course changes a bit. Professor Goldsby knows this material so well. Most importantly, not only is she passionate about the material she teaches, but she also manages to transfer her enthusiasm to her students.",
