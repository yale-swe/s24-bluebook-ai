    "Excellent survey of key discrimination cases.",
    "I learned more in this seminar about American law and its economic impact than I have in my previous three years of undergraduate courses. It was fantastic!",
    "This course introduced me to the art of reading legal documents and sifting through court opinions, dissents, and rulings. I also learned a great deal about the extent of discrimination in the United States and contemporary issues in race and gender politics.",
    "Presentation skills and learnt a lot more about the relationship between the law and discrimination, and about key US cases that changed the face of anti-discrimination legislation. I learnt how to distill information and facts into cohesive and persuasive arguments as a result of having to defend my views and opinions in front of people who may not have been of the same persuasion.",
    "This was a great overview of the frameworks which the courts use to adjudicate issues of discrimination. Based on this course, I have a more complete understanding of the history, development, and application of these standards.",
    "Good overview of core debates in the law and economics of discrimination"

   "comments": [
    "Most class is student led discussion, so you're relying on your fellow students' engagement and preparation.",
    "strengths were the instructor and the outline of the courses.",
    "This course was well-taught and engaging. Professor Jaynes made meaningful contributions to student-led discussions throughout the semester, which was appreciated especially given his expertise. Looking back, I would have appreciated discussions about policy recommendations and possible solutions to the issues we studied throughout the course.",
    "The strengths are the material, the relevance of the subject matter, the cases, and the seminar style. Hearing different viewpoints was a huge strength, it says something about the classes ability to attract people with different beliefs. The weaknesses are that there were too many (unengaged!) people in the class which suggests that it would benefit from only admitting students who truly wanted to be in the class and took the subject matter seriously.",
    "I thought that the professor was incredibly knowledgeable about the material, and I really benefited from his commentary. Sometimes I thought that student discussion could be improved, and I wish that the professor took a more active role.",
    "The core issues are addressed, but it would be nice if more recent research and cases were added to the syllabus."

    "Honestly the best and the easiest senior econ seminar you can take. Gerald Jaynes is an amazing professor and the material is very interesting.",
    "YES! so interesting and the instructor is awesome",
    "This is an excellent senior seminar with a light reading load and engaging discussions. The material covered throughout the course was highly applicable to contemporary issues in race and gender discrimination, and it served as a great introduction to law and Constitutional studies. The majority of the meetings were student-led, though Professor Jaynes provided meaningful contributions throughout.",
    "I came into the class with really high expectations... The subject matter, materials and discussions are super interesting. It makes yo think a lot about your own beliefs as well as what other people think and why. The class depends a lot on who is in the seminar and how engaged they are with the material. If you have personal investment to learn from this class and challenge yourself it is worth it. Professor Jaynes has the potential to be a truly dynamic, engaging and powerful force in the class but seems to have decided not to be that kind of an educator. Be prepared for a few WILD moments, micro(macro?)aggressions and other strange occurrences, all of which will make you a stronger person. Also, the grading situation is so confusing. Not a lot of economics, more reading and writing. If you are interested in law, discrimination, learning how to debate and defend your viewpoints in a closed environment then definitely take the class.",
    "Yes!",
    "Excellent course! Take it if you can get a spot!",
    "Yes! Great senior seminar, especially if you are interested in the economics of discrimination\/inequality"
