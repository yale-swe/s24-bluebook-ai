    "This is a nice class in French literature, definitely worth the language or humanities credit. The three essays were not long, but the readings took some time, even though we did not spend too much time on them in class. But most of all, professor Girard is awesome and knows everything about what she is teaching.",
    "I think this course does not have a particularly strong syllabus. The format of the course packet makes the material hard to read (slanted scans, cut off text, font too small, lines too close together most of the time, and line numbers missing for poetry most of the time -- making citation difficult). The most disappointing thing about this course, for me, was that I expected a course that would include a good balance of seminar-style discussion, and instead I got a class where the professor kept talking most of the time, and when she wasn't, students were giving their presentations. The fact that the professor talked about the context of the works and biographies of the authors made me want to not come to class -- I could have found that information myself if I had wanted it. Where has the art of literary analysis gone? I don't understand why the grading includes 15% for class participation when there is no opportunity to participate? The only thing that is good about this course is that because there is so much information thrown at you, your listening skills improve. However, my speaking skills have most definitely deteriorated. I think the mandatory presentation is completely unnecessary -- it takes valuable class time for no trade off whatsoever. As for writing the papers, they were very frustrating, because the prompts were not that interesting, and besides, WE DIDN'T GO OVER THE MATERIAL IN CLASS, so I was expected to come up with my own analysis, with ABSOLUTELY NO basis taken from class. I can't say that my writing has improved, because all the professor does is mark where your mistakes are, and just maybe offer one line of advice for the content. My Directed Studies papers were much richer because I had exciting, stimulating, sometimes even infuriating class discussions to develop my own ideas from. In this class, all I was able to actively do in class was yawn and nod. I guess the \"Participation Grade\" just means the prof will give whatever she's in the mood for. I'm disappointed. If I didn't NEED this class because it's the \"gateway class,\" I would not have taken it.",
    "If you are interested in French Lit, take this course. It deals with many classical works, as well as contemporary.",
    "This is a pretty great course. There's a lot of reading, but the rest of the workload (3 3-5 page papers, an in-class presentation on basically anything relating to French lit, and the final oral examination) is pretty light and Mme Girard explains the history of and much of the importance of the books themselves in class. The readings themselves are quite varied and interesting, covering a huge chunk of the French literary canon (medieval female authors, Voltaire, Moliere, Pascal, Proust, etc.), but unfortunately excluding anything post-mid-century and anything by non-white\/ethnically French authors. If you've done 160, this is a great complement to the speaking-and-modernity focus of that course, and I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in continuing to read in French; my reading speed and comprehension definitely improved over the course of the semester.",
    "This is a really wonderful course! The opportunity to read, write about and think about literature in French is not to be missed -- and Professor Girard runs fascinating, wide-ranging and helpful discussions. The papers are fun (and not scary at all) -- a chance to practice composition skills and develop original interpretations. The readings are easily manageable and very interesting. The final exam is really tough, though; the workload up to that point is not much preparation for what the final turns out to be, and it's difficult to give a polished extemporaneous oral presentation after a semester of reading, writing and note-taking. That said, take the course! You'll get to read lovely books, in a lovely language, and spend several hours a week thinking about what they mean. This is one of the most fun classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Good introduction to literature, but not so great for improving language (especially speaking\/listening) skills. Professor Girard is wonderful. There is a lot of reading to do and a difficult final. I would recommend the course depending on your tolerance for reading and literature as well as your French ability."
