    "Great start to introductory intermediate Spanish, but requires dedication (paid off in learning and comprehension)",
    "I would recommend the course for other students who really want to improve their Spanish skills. I learned so much more in this course than I have in any other Spanish course. Even though it is difficult, by the end of the semester I could tell that I had improved so much more than I expected to.",
    "I would say its a class that you should take if you want to learn or perfect the language.",
    "L3 Spanish is tough because you are attending every day, but as long as you go ready to participate and with your outside of class work done, anybody can succeed in the class.",
    "It's the perfect Spanish class! Take it."
