    "If a student wants to review grammar before entering an L5, this class is perfect for that. I would recommend it, and I'd especially recommend it with Mercedes Carreras.",
    "Your standard L4 Spanish course. You're most likely taking this course because you have to get your distributional requirements out of the way. I have one piece of advice: fight with everything you got to be in Mercedes' section. She was the absolute best. Funny, smart, informative, everything. Even though I was dreading taking Spanish because I've always been awful at it, I ended up enjoying coming to class every single day: because of Mercedes. If you take this class with anyone else, you're missing out. Mercedes or bust.",
    "Continuation of 130. Take it if you have to.",
    "Though Spanish L4 was not that type of class that I thought I'd look forward too, Profesora Carreras made it one of my favorite classes at Yale. She was a wonderful professor-- kind and patient, with a good sense of humor. She made concepts more easily understandable, and worked with us through using webSAM for the first time. Unlike other language professors I've interacted with, it really felt like she was trying to help us, rather than grade us down on exams and in homework. I feel like this made me learn Spanish better as I was less anxious about doing everything perfectly, and could simply practice my speaking more.Class meets every day and there are assignments due every day, but if you must take the course take it with Profesora Carreras. You will have a good semester.",
    "This is a good class to take to maintain your spanish speaking ability",
    "Overall, this course was solid. The class was engaging and a lot of the material was fairly interesting. There were a couple scheduling blips but hopefully those will be smoothed out in the future. While the majority of the class was a back and forth with the professor, I thought theprofessor still did a great job engaging the students and keeping the class interesting. We also did a lot of grammar practice, which I appreciated and I felt really helped me learn the material.",
    "Span 140 with Prof. Carreras is very chill.",
    "SPAN 140 is a well structured, well organized, and standard language class that is a smooth post-class to SPAN 130. Definitely take this class with Professor Carreras, who is truly a diamond in the Spanish department and amongst all of the professors at Yale. She is thoughtful, sensible, and all around intelligent - you don't want to take this class with anyone else. Her amazing teaching style has encouraged me to continue pursuing Spanish at Yale and has even inspired me to be a better person in general! I loved SPAN 140 this year and despite waking up early every morning to attend it, SPAN 140 was definitely my favorite class of the semester.",
    "Spanish 140 is a class that focuses on advancing your proficiency in Spanish by studying more advanced vocabulary, enforcing grammar rules and structures,and utilizing interesting literary works and media. The text book is easy to use and navigate. There are a few exams and quizzes throughout the semester, as well as some oral activities and presentations. You will walk out of this course feeling more confident in your Spanish speaking, writing and understanding abilities. I would recommend this course to another student because I feel it was really effective in advancing my abilities."
