   "comments": [
    "This is a brilliant class, and I really learned a lot. The style of the lectures didn't feel too pedantic or dull, and the slide shows - which didn't have words, only images of structures and spaces - were a really effective way of complementing the professor's ideas and making the class flow. The sketchbook assignments were also pretty stress-free and fun.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Although the drawings take some time if you really want to get something out of them, they are absolutely worth it and contribute to the course. Take it, at least for Cr\/D if not for a grade.",
    "If you think you may be interested in architecture, I would definitely recommend this course. Even if you are not the best drawer, it is still interesting and worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone slightly interested in architecture (not necessarily for the major, just any interest). It is a lot of work for section, and you never really know what your grade is, but the TAs are super helpful and always available and the professor is really interesting.",
    "If you enjoy drawing and like working with your hands, this is the class for you. It won't necessarily improve your technical drawing skills, but it will sharpen your style and artistic sense.",
    "Great course. Take is if you like architecture, art, or just thinking visually. You don't need to know how to draw before hand. I had zero drawing or art experience and did well. You will have weekly sketchbook assignments to do things like \"draw a gothic window on campus\" or \"make a series of sketches that show a path through an urban space\". You will have one 3-5 page paper bassed on the one or two readings one week (instead of a sketchbook assignment). Besides for the paper the readings are not essential for the class, although they are incredible interesting and informative and certainly good to read if you are considering majoring in architecture. For a sort of mid-term and final you will have design projects where you build models. One very annoying thing is that you get no graded material back until your course grade at the end. You get weekly feedback on your sketchs and comments on your sketchbook half way. You can gauge how you are doing basses on TA comments (they look for effort and improvement over artistic skill) but you still get no letter grades until the end. I actually didn't mind going to class at 9:25 since it was such an enjoyable lecture. Tip: takes notes in your sketchbook and draw things you see in lecture not just written notes. grading is very subjective and they like it when your sketchbook is filled with tons of stuff so everything you every put down on paper for the class do so in your sketchbook.",
    "YES. SUCH A GOOD CLASS. The workload is really what you put into it--however, however much you put in is how much you'll get out of it. Lectures are really great, and the TA's are so awesome.",
    "The class was a great introduction to architecture from a variety of perspectives: material, light, climate, the client, the function, the architect, and at the end philosophy, the environment, and technology. Professor Purves is a great lecturer, and the work is engaging. The weekly drawing assignments were as rewarding if you put the work into them, and a lovely way tocomplement the lecture component. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone even vaguely interested in architecture.",
    "Fun class, but definitely one where you get more the more you put into it. The drawings take longer than you might expect, so section is not a joke. As a non-architecture major, I felt slightly in the minority and it can be kind of embarrassing to show up to section with a half-assed drawing when everyone has has these amazing things to show. You don't really have to do any of the readings except the one you have to write on for the paper, but there aren't any tests.",
    "yes, interesting and unknown topic. not a lot of work",
    "take it! it's a great class, you get to draw and you see your built environment differently",
    "This class is a great general introduction to architecture. Take it to experience the great lectures and to learn about drawing in a low-pressure, constructive environment.",
    "Definitely an introduction to Architecture, but you never know what your grade is which is somewhat stressful.",
    "Great class for architects and non-architects alike. Chill sections that aren't terrible.",
    "It's a great class to challenge yourself to think differently and learn about something new. It can often be frustrating depending on how invested you get in it but I'm glad I took the class",
    "Yes I would recommend it, even if you aren't an architecture major.",
    "This is a really fun class! Basically an art class but with an incredible amount of background or context. Not too much work and a really great way to diversify your schedule. I would recommend it even you are positive you will not be an architecture major!",
    "They try to make it fun for everyone, and not just majors, I would recommend it to anyone, but that's because I really like making things and drawing- some people would have probably liked more discussion about the readings rather than having unrelated drawing assignments. The class was fun for me, and I'm going to major in it, but I knew that before I took the class so I don't know how most non-majors feel about it. I think it's more work than you'll think it will be",
    "This is a class that is worth it. If you're interested in architecture and perspectives at all, this is the class to take. It's definitely not just for majors, but it definitely shouldn't be taken lightly. Sketchbook assignments every week will take a chunk of time, but you don't have to look at it as work. It was pretty nice to just draw every week and still feel like I was doing something!Not all of the readings are necessary, but there are a fair handful that are really interesting! There's also an essay that will require you to synthesize some knowledge from the readings with a building. Take this class! Purves is incredible!",
    "Simply what it says it is: an introduction to architectures. Professor Purves's lectures are engaging if you are already interested in the subject matter. Assignments are generally fun to do.",
    "Take it! This is the best class I've taken at Yale. It will make you want to be an architecture major. There are weekly drawing assignments, one short paper, one design project, and one final design project. The only downside is that you don't get any grades until your final grade at the end of the semester.",
    "This is a great fifth course if you have no interest in majoring in Architecture. It's also a great fifth course if you are interested in majoring. There is only one assignment per week, and lectures are super interesting. Near the end of term when everyone begins to lose interest, Purves brings in guest speakers from different fields. For those of you who are interested in the major, it's a great time to see where the field can take you. The TFs are also super helpful.The class definitely taught me how to think in a way I've never before experienced. I see the world (and Yale) very differently now. I will most likely make all my suitemates (pre-meds) take this CR\/D their senior year.",
    "yes, take it, but know that it is not easy. it is fun though, and it you dedicate time to it you can get a lot out of it.",
    "Take Architecture 150! I learned to view the world with a different lens! I learned how to draw by learning how to see. I learned how to appreciate Yale's great architecture. Purves is a great lecturer and the course has interesting guest lecturers as well. TAs are experience architecture students and are available to help you. Just make sure to be creative in your assignments! I took this class for the Humanities credit, and it was one of the most fun and eye-opening classes I've ever taken.",
    "Yes because the lectures are great. I did not enjoy the sketchbook assignments though (you need to turn in 1 major sketch a week, and get critiqued on it).",
    "Yes, absolutely. Take this course. Fascinating lectures given by an incredibly eloquent lecturer are very interesting. The projects don't really even feel like work.",
    "YES YES YES, take it! I know it's one of the earlier class but it's worth it. Professor Purves is great, one of the best lecturers I had at Yale.",
    "It's required for potential architecture majors, but I'd still recommend it for non-architecture majors as well. Assignments are almost exclusively model-building and drawing, so it will provide some diversity to your homework.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It\u00c2\u00b4s a fantastic gateway to architecture and Professor Purves is makes anything sound fascinating. The TAs are always, I mean ALWAYS available, and the assignments are incredibly fun. DO IT!",
    "take it CR\/D\/F unless you're a serious architecture major. NOT A GUT",
    "Fantastic course--if you have even the slightest interest in Architecture, take it. The lectures are interesting, and even though it's a lot of work, it's worth it. This class will really make you go out of your comfort zone; you'll learn a lot about yourself and you'll make friends with the people in your sections. It's one of those classes you'll never get the chance to experience once you leave here--so I'd say go for it.",
    "Yes. It is an accessible course that initiates one into the rudiments of architectural theory and thinking architecturally.Strengths: Cumulative nature of drawing assignments help initiate those who are less well-versed technically to gain drawing skills and build confidence, so don't worry if you think you can't draw. Assignments were also very fun and not too much of a chore.Downside: One has to devote a lot of time to the course if one wants to fully maximise the experience, and this can be difficult if architecture is not one's intended major.",
    "Definitely take it whether you are majoring in architecture or not. The sketch book works could be tough sometimes, but generally they could be very refreshing in the middle of a bunch of problem sets.",
    "highly recommend even of you are not an architecture student. some of the projects will take more time and effort to complete, but you will end the semester with a nice sketchbook full of assignments to show for your work. Professor is nice and the TAs are interesting people. Take it if you are considering it.",
    "LOT of drawing, that's basically all you do for your assignments. Took it cr\/d but I had an anxious time ensuring that I dnt end up with a D - no grading rubric, really high standards wrt rest of your section and TAs.. But maybe that's just me. Also I feel like I learned nothing abt how to think about architecture just a whole bunch of jargon.",
    "Be forewarned, Intro Arch is very much an art course, especially in the sketchbook assignments and critiques. That said, it is very interesting. Purves is an excellent lecture, and as long as you can check your ego at the door, you will enjoy section and the critiques of your and others' work with the teaching fellows. Though understand that you will not be exposed to any civil engineering in this course.",
    "I would recommend it. Easy reading that you don't HAVE to do. The most fun coursework of all my classes.",
    "Yes! I recommend this class. But be careful, this is not a gut humanity class if you are not good at drawing.",
    "This is definitely a low pressure and very engaging course. I would take it whether I were an architecture major or not, and it's very easy to follow even without any prior experience with drawing or architecture.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it, but be prepared to draw. It's a little more work than you would initially expect, but it pays off in the end. The grading is pretty lenient and there's only one short paper, so as long as you're willing to put in some effort, this class is fantastic.",
    "I would recommend ARCH 150. This course was not as specific as I had imagined it would be - it was an extremely broad, general survey of architecture, and you're not required to really \"learn\" architectural terms or vocab or anything. Regardless, lecture with Purves was always enjoyable and engaging, he's an incredibly intelligent, interesting lecturer.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who is looking for a class to take off of the \"normal\" selection of courses. Even if you do not want to pursue architecture, it is a fascinating course.",
    "When they say you don't need drawing experience, it's not really true. If you can't draw, you have to put in tons of hours working on exercises that take artistically inclined peers much less time. So be prepared for that. And the TFs are really harsh, at least mine were. So be prepared for that too. I suppose its a good class for those who want to be an ARCH major, but if you're taking it, like I did, hoping to just learn some cool things, then I don't really think it's the class for you. It's very much a preparation for the ARCH major and is 95% drawing. They should really have section be optional for non-ARCH majors.",
    "I took this class credit\/d and I really enjoyed the class. I had always wanted to take an architecture class and this was a fun and easy way to do so. The workload is very manageable and the assignments are genuinely interesting. After taking this class I have a much greater appreciation for buildings and good design in general.",
    "A must for anyone with a bit of drawing background. Otherwise, probably very difficult. Either way, you'll come out with a totally different understanding of form and art,",
    "Take it if you are interested, but maybe as a Cr\/D\/F if you are not planning to be an architecture major, as you have no idea how you are doing in the course as it progresses unless you are very good."
