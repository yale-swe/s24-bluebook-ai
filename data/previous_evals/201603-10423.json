   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about artists i had previously not known about, and i learned about what to look for in works of art and how to appreciate it",
    "The biggest thing I learned is the idea of the critique and how to properly question artist motive. Going in, I was not sure what to expect but through our discussions I feel I have better perspective about my own work. I also received exposure to other type of artists (the class is filled with graphic designers, film artists, photographers, and painters). The seminar is focused on process and the reason for doing what we do.",
    "In this course, we were able to develop our artistic practice by becoming more familiar with other aspects to a practice outside of art making, such as artist statement writing, or the reading of important, informative, and generative texts. We read the works of famous philosophers, culture critics, and art historians, as well as had an opportunity to discuss our own work at length.",
    "Amazing class. I really learned about myself as an artist and the necessary history to feel connected to the artist community."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very good, though i wish there would have been more trips to art galleries around New Haven.",
    "Because the course falls in the art department, and is part of the art major, there was a sufficient amount of art making and conversation around our own work. I do believe that at times, the class would have benefited from slightly more reading to inform our art practice.",
    "We went to Jonathan's home and spoke with him individually and gained a real connection with him and the subject matter. It was a really incredible class and great learning experience. Getting to see everyone else's work and show your own in order to develop your style was great."

    "Yes",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. You gain a greater understanding of who you are as an artist and of the art community as a whole. It's an incredible learning experience."
