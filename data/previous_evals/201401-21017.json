   "comments": [
    "Yes, take it. There are no surprises; it's a regular Spanish class.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in Spanish language and culture, definitely a great choice.",
    "Not a bad class -- take this class if you have to.",
    "Take it. Honestly the easiest Spanish course I've taken yet.",
    "Take it if you have to... But overall-- it's the language requirement.",
    "TAKE IT WITH REYMUNDI! She's easily one of the best professors I've ever had at Yale. The daily homework and constant grammar practice is a bit tedious (but necessary for L4), but Reymundi makes class very entertaining. She's incredibly dedicated to the class and wants you to succeed. Overall, my Spanish has improved greatly because of this class, and she's made me want to continue studying the language. I couldn't recommend her more highly!",
    "A really great class. The reviews from past years suggested that the class was very difficult and a huge step up from Spanish 130. Even though I was not very good at Spanish in high school, I really didn't think it was way harder. My advice would be to stay on top of all the assignments, as the missed points definitely add up in the end. My last words of advice would be to take the class with Se\u00f1ora Reymundi! She is always ready to help, and she is very lenient on the tests and quizzes, but not unnecessarily so; she takes off points when you miss concepts, but it's enough that you remember not to make the mistake again and not too much to hurt you in the long run. Great class, would recommend!",
    "SPAN 140. Not amazing, not terrible. There is a lot of busy work and not a lot of time spent actually speaking in Spanish. That said, your Spanish will improve by virtue of the fact that the course meets every single day. Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Great finale to spanish grammar. Take it if you want to continue learning spanish because you will need it.",
    "Take this class if you need to -- you'll certainly learn some more Spanish. Although the topics themselves aren't the most interesting and having homework every night is certainly a pain, the class was still enjoyable. In class, there are discussions, you work in pairs a lot, and the class covers a lot more than just grammar. We read several short stories, we watched the movie No, and we read a short novel (\"Las batallas en el desierto\"). On the whole, the classroom environment was fun and energetic. I would certainly recommend the class, assuming that's where you are in the Spanish sequence."
