    "This course is tough but in a good way. Makes you think and helped me learn this material at a much higher level. I've enjoyed it.",
    "This course does not follow logically from Epi II! I felt I had some good understanding and momentum with respect to my epi studies after Epi II that was erased with this class.There is a baseline level of knowledge assumed by the professor that is actually non-existent. For example, our final take-home exam was based partly on the Poisson regression model. We had not covered this in-depth in any way in any of our other classes until the week before the exam was due when it was covered in Categorical Data Analysis. The only way to get through this class is to have been exposed to the material in an in-depth manner in other classes.The lectures themselves are very difficult to follow and there is little summary of key points. I understand that Dr.Risch is trying to get us to think critically about epidemiology, but the manner in which this is approached, both in lecture and in discussion with homework, does not match the level of experience we have with epi and biostats. In other words, the course is too advanced for our level of study. Since this class is very mathematics heavy, perhaps it would bebetter suited to advanced biostatistics students with some knowledge of epidemiology who would like to learn more.The homework assignments were experiments in trying to decipher what it is the professor was asking us to do (we spent much of each discussion section doing this). Then (and only then) could we begin to figure out how to answer the question. This took away from actually learning the material!!The final exam included material that we had not seen all semester. For those of us who had not taken any genetic epidemiology courses, question 3 was nearly impossible to complete. Further, it is disheartening to walk into an exam that the professor has already told us that most of us will not do well on. I question whether other biostatistics and epidemiology professors at the school would excel at this class if they had to take it.",
    "This course offers a more in-depth look at epidemiology than most students are used to. As of writing this, I feel more confused than when I can in to the class. But I have been assured by previous students that this course finally makes sense down the road.This class would be more immediately useful if the material were \"dumbed\" down for students to more fully understand.I also believe that it would be useful for the course to use more standard stats software.",
    "This class makes you think. It approaches epidemiologic concepts in ways that are unfamiliar but also very interesting. Rather than simply start with the formulas we know in Epi, Dr. Risch derives many of the concepts that are essential to the core of Epi. It is a very thorough class that covers a lot of material. The homework assignments did seem at times to be very different from the material covered in the class, however they were always very educational.",
    "This course provides a lot of the mathematical\/theoretical background for basic topics in biostatistics and epidemiology (chi-square tests, maximum likelihood estimation, logistic regression, etc). You are not expected to memorize the proofs or derive them yourself, but you are expected to garner useful and interesting concepts from this deeper knowledge of how these tests work. Harvey does have some interesting points to make and you will think about these topics differently after taking this class.Unfortunately, examples are given in GLIM, which is a statistical analysis software that is no longer actively maintained or distributed, but that Harvey continues to use. Because GLIM is extinct, it doesn't seem worth the effort to learn the syntax, and the examples are therefore pretty meaningless. The course would benefit from giving examples in SAS instead of GLIM (other courses do this, often providing the SAS code, which is wonderful because then we can actually use the code in real life). Also, more clinically relevant examples would help. The final exam is one of the more random tests I've ever taken and included topics we did not cover in this course; in fact, every answer I gave was one that I knew from another class.",
    "The notes are difficult to look back on. It would be helpful to have typed or searchable notes for clarity when going back over the lectures.",
    "The material afforded a more complete understanding of epidemiological methods and statistical modeling. Overall, the material was challenging but rewarding. Lectures could have been improved with more examples or supplementary articles to illustrate the concepts covered."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Dr. Risch knows his stuff and has strong convictions regarding proper conduct of epi research. I enjoyed hearing his take on everything",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Great knowledge and depth of information",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Dr. Risch is clearly a brilliant scientist. His level of knowledge and experience both in mathematics and epidemiology seems unparalleled at Yale; however, the translation of this knowledge to students is not well executed.I struggled greatly with understanding the lectures,how they translated into the homework assignments, and more importantly into tangible skills.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Dr. Risch is perhaps the most intelligent professor I've ever had. He is responsive and truly cares about his students. His course is insightful and offers a unique perspective that isn't encountered in other courses.The only downside to this, of course, is that his lectures and notes can be difficult to follow for those who aren't prepared for his perspective.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Dr. Risch was a great teacher. He covered very difficult concepts and while you often walked away from class more confused, reviewing the notes and asking questions in class often helped to clarify them. He was also very receptive to students and really made an effort to ensure that students were understanding the material. He did a really great job.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Harvey is a well-intended, smart person who possesses deep knowledge about epidemiology. He is flexible on the logistics, such as being willing to change our take-home exam date. The mathematical proofs are not always high-yield learning, but some of his commentary (which generally follows the proofs in his notes) provides an interesting perspective. Homeworks are chosen to reinforce a certain concept. As mentioned, using SAS instead of GLIM would help. In addition, I think most students will not grasp the mathematics at the level Harvey teaches it, so the class was often lost during these parts of the lectures. A more practical approach would generally be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Great professor!",
    "Instructor: Harvey Risch \u00a0Dr. Risch was responsive to students and knowledgable."

    "Sam is absolutely the best",
    "Samatha Streicher was fantastic, and was instrumental in helping us get through this course.",
    "Sam was a great help. She was able to clearly explain the material and answer any questions we had.",
    "Samantha was a truly excellent TA. We would have all failed the class if it weren't for her patience, deligence, and hard work. She was fair, incredibly responsive to email, and always available to her students.",
    "Samantha was an amazing TA. I'm really not sure this class would have been possible without her. I learned a considerable amount each week from the TA sessions and office hours. This was the one class where I felt compelled to go to the TA session each week because I knew that I would learn a lot from her. She made completing the homework much easier and walked through the concepts learned in class. This class covered a lot of complex topics that were often hard to understand in class. And yet she made things easier to understand and was very receptive to students. She was also very knowledgeable about the topics covered. She was a great teacher and a fantastic TA.",
    "Samantha Streicher was the TA for this course. She did a fantastic job. TA sessions were generally spent discussing the homework assignment for the week. Some of the problems were obscure (quadratic equation to fill in a 2X2 table, anyone?) and I would have had no idea how to approach them without Sam. I learned a lot from the other students in the course as well. Without the TA sessions, this course would have been much more painful.",
    "Samantha is a fantastic TF. She was great at clarifying lectures and any questions we had.",
    "Samantha was well versed in course materials and responsive to student questions and concerns. She was timely and through in answering emails and was able to effectively communicate material and expectations during discussion sections."

   "comments": [
    "This course is very challenging. Be prepared to dedicate a good amount of time a week and be frustrated by some high level lectures, but you can't help but get a lot out of this class. Wouldn't necessarily recommend taking it if you don't have to, though.",
    "Challenging but managable course with a great TA.",
    "I would not recommend this course to students unless it is required.",
    "I would not recommend this course for students who are not serious about a future epidemiology career, but for those who ARE serious about an epi career I would highly recommend it.",
    "This is a great class for students who want to learn more about epidemiologic topics. You will learn the basis for measures of disease occurrence including different methods of charting follow-up, how the ANOVA and regression models are derived, the difference between regular logistic regression and matched logistic regression, how to derive the formulas for KM curves and proportional hazards regression, and a brief introduction into Poisson regression. The professor is a great teacher and really receptive to students. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "I would say that this course does make some interesting points about epidemiology, but the approach is not practical and is somewhat outdated (GLIM, handwritten notes). Other courses explain the material in a less esoteric way and, had I not already taken those courses, I probably would have been lost. I would not recommend this course unless it was required.",
    "Great course! Very theoretical and difficult material. Homeworks require alot of time.",
    "The material afforded a more complete understanding of epidemiological methods and statistical modeling. Overall, the material was challenging but rewarding. Lectures could have been improved with more examples or supplementary articles to illustrate the concepts covered."
