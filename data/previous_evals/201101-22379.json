   "comments": [
    "Good course if you are going to be an econ major and don't want to take the normal intermediate macro.",
    "This is your standard intermediate macro course, except with useless derivations of certain math theorems and longer equations on problem sets. The lectures are long and boring, and a lot of the material is honestly uninteresting, but a few of the models are cool to learn about. The professor tries to be creative on the problem sets, but usually it just results in unclear wording.",
    "An excellent class. Moscarini clearly cares about his class and the effort he puts into it is astounding. The notes, textbook, assignments, and test are all well-designed. If you put in the effort, you will take out a lot. Moscarini has managed to do for me what few economics professors can do: inspire passion for a subject.However, there are a few downsides. The problems sets are extremely difficult and time-consuming. The lectures move too quickly to be comprehensible. This is a higher-level course that will challenge you but if you are willing to dedicate yourself, you will enjoy it.",
    "Professor Moscarini is a good lecturer, and he makes really witty jokes. The problem sets are manageable, though occasionally WolframAlpha or Mathematica was absolutely critical because some problem sets contained extremely difficult algebra - algebra that would take you a long time to do by hand, or algebra that you don't know how to solve. If you are considering going into econ grad school (or doing the Econ+Math major), you absolutely should take this course instead of Econ 122. Great class overall.",
    "I shopped both Intermediate Macro and Macro Theory for 2 weeks. I picked Macro Theory because the class was at 1pm instead of 9am, and the instructor was a better lecturer. Though this class is tough because so many of the students in it are brilliant, the professor recognizes this and I think grades will be fair. I stuggled in this class at first, but once pastthe learning curve, the problem sets became easier to do. I don't think this class required too much mathematically- know partial derivatives and you'll be fine. I started out not knowing Lagrangian and picked it up along the way. I would recommend it if you want to be an econ major but for some reason can't take the fall macro class.",
    "If you an econ major and good at math, take it. If not, don't waste your time.",
    "Take it if you have to. It is a difficult course.",
    "Macro Theory is a pretty good course. The math can at times be overwhelming but the reward is definitely worth it. Homework is reasonable and the difficulty of the class is very manageable. I would recommend that any one interested in econ grad school shop this class because it is very mathematicalbut also very engaging.",
    "Economics 126 is a great course for anyone looking for a more in-depth look at Macroeconomics. Although the course does involve a bit more math, it is not substantially more, and it really helps with developing the intuition behind the models that we study.",
    "Moscarini is a good lecturer. He is funny at times and can be engaging especially when he discusses real world implications. However, his problem sets can be confusing at times (not just the math, the question sometimes doesn't make sense). The final is long, but it could have been a lot harder. Some aspects of the course are easy. Others are quite challenging and you will see that in the problem sets. Also, the second problem set for us was ridiculously difficult, but I think that he does that to scare people off. It was arguably the toughest problem set all year.",
    "not as good as micro theory, and some overlapping material, but still worth taking. From what's i've heard, it's a much better class than intermediate macro",
    "It's a more math intensive version of intermediate macro. If you're an econ\/math major you really should be taking this over intermediate.",
    "If you want to get fairly deep into econ and the math involved, yes.",
    "Econ 126 goes over in detail the essential models that are used to describe the macroeconomy nowadays. If you didn't like past Econ courses, then this one will likely not be any different. It does, however, provide a great perspective into the mind of economists looking at issues such as the recession in 2008. Much of the course goes over theories that can be used to understand economic shifts today, which is very interesting. Professor is helpful but hard to understand at times. Knowing the terminology is expected, and reading before lectures makes the lectures much more useful. Math is not difficult, not much beyond taking a derivative. Not the most exciting class, but a solid one.",
    "Econ 126 was a good class for those seeking a deeper mathematical basis for macroeconomics. It was taught well in class and in section, and it didn'ttake too much time. As psets were due on Mondays, I probably spent 2-3 hours on average every Sunday doing each week's pset, but this could've been spread out accordingly. I would definitely recommend the class as I learned a lot, and the professor and TA were great teachers.",
    "Econ 126 is definitely a challenging class. The problem sets are short but they take a deceivingly long amount of time to complete. Professor Moscarini is a fine lecturer, but his lectures often don't go into examples, which is why the problem sets can be so hard. For the final\/midterm, I spent days reading the entire book beforehand. You will spend a lot of time on this class. That being said, I felt really proud of myself after the final because I felt like I really knew the subject matter well. It is rewarding in the end. I would only recommend this to someone who has to take the intermediate macro requirement and thinks that they're up for a challenge.",
    "The class was rather boring. I learned more from reading the textbook.",
    "After Econ 126, you will probably be able to read and understand most of the economic materials on Bloomberg and WSJ.",
    "If you like macro and you are generally apt at math -- take it!",
    "Take this course if you are genuinely interested in the material and want something more rigorous. True, it is hard (it was terribly hard for me) but I loved taking the course because of all the other brilliant people in it (who were definitely better at Econ than me) as well as the professor and the material. Intermediate Macro does not measure up to this at all. Please please please if you're at all interested in real econ, take this course (unless you want an easy ride in the Econ major, which really is a shame)."
