    "Generally everyone I know has a good experience with ENGL 114. Take it freshman year, especially if you're not a big writer. Its a great way to get writing credit, learn some useful material, and meet a good professor. And with Michael Komorowski, don't think twice - do it.",
    "English 114 is a great class that everyone should take before writing real academic papers, because it helps you with your writing like no other class I've seen here. Make sure you get a section you like, because otherwise (I've heard some horror stories) your experience will be miserable. Mine was fantastic though, and the class piqued my interest in economics and the financial crisis as well as helping me with my writing.",
    "The course is engaging to a wide array of current events in economics and politics, If you're interested in these fields, the course is a perfect fit because it motives each student to improve their writing based on their individual interests. It will be hard to get into because of the number of people that want in, but if you do get the course, enjoy it.",
    "English 114 13 is a great introductory writing class that anyone with an interest in the economy or politics should take. It is a fair amount of work and the teacher is no easy grader but you will learn a lot and it will be a very rewarding experience.",
    "Yes, absolutely take it if you have an interest in the subject.",
    "I took English 114 to get my writing credit and took this section because the topic (global capitalism and the future of democracy) was of interest to me. It was enjoyable (and an easy A), but if you were reasonably good at English in high school (basically, if you went to a decent high school that prepares you for college), then you don't really need to take English 114. I liked reading the papers on economics and politics for the course, but I probably would have been better served by taking a higher-level English course or getting my WR credit some other way. If you want to take English 114 though, I would recommend professor Komorowski; he's pretty lenient, and for almost all of the essays you get to turn in a draft and then get graded and then turn in a final, so it's pretty hard not to get a good grade.",
    "I think this course benefitted me a great deal, but I was not a great writer before I started. If the student feels like he or she is a very good writer, I'd take a more challenging class.",
    "The professor for this course is great and the subject is not nearly as dry as it sounds on paper. I really recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their writing, learn how to make an effective argument, and learn more about capitalism and democracy. It's a really great course.",
    "Take his class if you are interested in the material and about current trends in the global economy. Workload can be a bit much at times considering the amount of reading we had to do but manageable. That being said, I definitely learned a lot and the readings were all very interesting. Would definitely recommend this class.",
    "\"Global Capitalism and the Future of Democracy\" dealt with a lot of interesting topics, from the question of the nature of democracy to the recent financial crisis. As you would expect the course attracted lots of Econ-interested kids, which was good for discussions - most people really got into the subject matter. It's a seminar, so obviously not easy to get through successfully without reading the texts (especially if you don't have much prior knowledge of econ).I would recommend the class.",
    "A pretty easy class that I did not get much out of. If you are trying to improve your writing skills, take a different class."
