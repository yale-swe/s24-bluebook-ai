   "comments": [
    "Recommended, though this is not a history course. Don't expect to learn the backgrounds of all the Middle Eastern countries and Turkey in class.",
    "There's a LOT of reading, but most of it is very relevant and extremely interesting. Be careful about taking this if you're already taking on a heavy load, because you can get overwhelmed. The professor knows the subject very very well and is extremely supportive. A basic background in developmental political economy is helpful but not absolutely necessary. Overall, a very heavy course load with a very rewarding amount of information learned.",
    "Yes! Absolutely. Emerging from this course, I have a better understanding of economic systems in general: I learned so much. Also, what is unique about this course is that often the readings were contradicting of each other. In one week we would read two disagreeing readings and we were forced to draw our own conclusions. It was intellectually fulfilling, and simply, great.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because it's really informative. It basically goes over the historical issues of the Middle East from a very methodical point of view. Also, we didn't focus on the sensationalized aspects of the Middle East, i.e. Islam, veiling etc, aka \"the cultural arguments\", and I really liked that because that seems to be what everyone else likes to talk about. Although we did take the last lesson to cover those topics.Everyone also seems to take something different from the course, i.e. I hated lessons that other ppl really liked, vice versa.",
    "This course is so completely worth. It is a ton of work and there is a ton of reading and essays and a mid-term. Concerning the reading, do it, do all of it. Why? Because you will learn a TON about the subject and have a good survey of the literature and its necessary to really have meaningful conversation in class. That being said, the work in this class can pile of ridiculously, when you have 250+ pages of reading and an essay due the same week. Still worth it though, it would be useful to have at least a little econ background.",
    "Highly recommend this course. You will walk out of the course with a fluency in the discourse of development through the lens of the Middle East. Prof. Eder is very engaging and passionate about the subject matter.",
    "i would highly recommend this class to anyone who has a chance to take it! you wont regret it",
    "This course is a wonderful class. It surveys economic concepts (with a focus on developmental and middle eastern subjects) WITHOUT BEING BORING and WITH A GOOD PROFESSOR. What a miracle! Imagine not having to take econ but still learning about economics! You can go in with very little economic background and come out with so much more knowledge of the subject. And Professor Eder is a gem; take a class with her before you graduate, you will be thankful. I would definitely recommend this class!"
