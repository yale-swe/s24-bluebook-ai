   "comments": [
    "Professor Lee is an amazing instructor. However, this class is extremely frustrating at times and requires a lot of work. It is really difficult to get an A. If you are up for the challenge, the class is thoroughly enjoyable.",
    "if you want to work really hard and not do well",
    "If you are choosing between 114 and 120, THEN TAKE ENGLISH 120. End of story. No questions asked. Take 120.",
    "Take it, but also take some other light courses, then you will be alright. The workload is not terrible, but you will have to work pretty hard for your final drafts.",
    "Professor Lee has big ideas, big thoughts, but her poor organizational skills, time management issues, and lack of office hours makes the class unattractive. That being said, she will teach you how to write if you stick it out.",
    "Reading Violence was an interesting course, although the reading were a little difficult to get through at times (because of content). There are 4 essays and the class really centers on peer-review. I loved class discussions but honestly, there may be a better section to take. Professor Lee is fantastic in class but she didn't really offer office hours and at times we didn't even get feedback on our drafts before the papers were due. Although I think it turned out ok, a lot of the time I felt lost and was very stressed.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. It was incredibly stressful and not rewarding. My friends in 120 seemed to enjoy the class a lot more and get more out of it.",
    "English 114 can definitely be a great class to take and you will notice an improvement in your writing. The topic of 'Violence' was very interesting to work with and class discussions were usually pretty good. However, I would not recommend Professor Lee! Although she might be interesting in class, she gives minimal feedback, if any, on drafts for papers and did not hold regular office hours. In addition, the amount of work you do on a paper rarely translates to the grade that you are going to get. It is near impossible to get an A for a paper."
