    "English 171 is a class of readings in Chaucer, supplemented by lectures on the backdrop of London and Europe as a whole during the Middle Ages. Readings typically are not that long, though they are in Middle English, which, based on your familiarity, could take a little while to get used to. There are three papers (2 5p and one 10p) built upon close reading of the texts (i.e. not much outside research), and discussions once a week. I would certainly recommend it is you want to read great stories (Chaucer is full of humor, in fact often in what we may think of as a much more modern, raunchy kind of way), and get in a writing credit.",
    "An excellent closer study of Chaucer with a brilliant professor. Our class was small enough to substitute one of the weekly lectures with seminar discussion. The lectures on 14th century English and French history helped contextualize the text without ever replacing the text as the focus. This course is very much about close reading. Discussion centered on etymologies, plot, and the fictional project of The Canterbury Tales (and a few other works by Chaucer). This class confirmed my sense that Chaucer is a great, great author, as vivid and timely in this century as in any. If you have enjoyed reading Chaucer at any point, take this course. Prof. Butterfield is an erudite reader and scholar and a sensitive facilitator of discussion. Her love of this material, and of literature, is lifelong and rigorous and apparent."
