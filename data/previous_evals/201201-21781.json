    "Yes - this class was fantastic. DeCanio is brilliant and you get to spend lecture picking apart different arguments that authors present about public opinion and democracy. Grade is 20% participation, 80% final paper - so the work load is not bad at all, but you still get a lot out of the class. I highly recommend it.",
    "Anyone who is even slightly interested in public opinion would love this course! Sam is the man!",
    "Wow. This is the guttiest gut known to man. ONE paper...start early and ask your TF for help, and you'll be good to go. DeCanio is a star and he was hilarious. The reading is pointless, and even he knows that, but the lectures are engaging and the atmosphere is chill.",
    "Take it! It may seem scary that the final paper is 80% of your grade but don't worry--it'll work out in the end if you start it early and get input for your TA or the professor. I haven't gotten my grade yet, obviously, but I think it will be ok. It is nice that the paper can be about anything you want within the scope of the class. If you can handle this freedom then you'll like the class. Word of the wise--eventhough it seems like you don't have to do the reading because it is a lecture and there are no tests, please do it anyway or at least skim\/find a summary online. It becomes very awkward when only 3 people in class or section know what is going on. Plus, it'll make you look better when you do.",
    "Take it. Very interesting topic that is relevant to our lives. VERY light workload. I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "Good class. Took and wasn't a polisci major",
    "Really interesting class. I'd take it if you're interested in american politics and\/or voter habits. The discussion can get a little off topic, but it's fine. Also, be prepared for a lot of discussion, despite the class being a lecture. And the final paper is worth an abnormally large portion of the grade, so that's something to consider when planning your finals period.",
    "It's a really interesting PLSC course that provides some cool insights into the world of public opinion, voter manipulation, and a host of other political topics that have relevance today. Prof. DeCanio is a great professor, and does a solid job engaging with students. The reading's not too heavy, and adds a lot to what's talked about in class. If you're looking for a course about public opinion and current political topics or just want a fun, light PLSC course, definitely check this one out."
