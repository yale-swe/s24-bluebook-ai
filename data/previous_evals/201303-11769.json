   "comments": [
    "The profs will constantly say that you're only \"scratching the surface\" of the Catholic tradition, which I'm sure is true, although you get a dose of the most important names: Augustine, Aquinas, Teresa of Avila, some mystics, as well as some folks you wouldn't immediately associate with Catholicism, such as Machiavelli and Dante.Don't attempt to do all the reading - it's way too much - but make sure you have a passing familiarity with each one. There are some brilliant lectures along the way, so I'd recommend goingto class. It's only two 50-minute lectures per week.",
    "This class was absolutely fantastic. I imagine that the other students may gush praises for it, too (at least I'd hope so). I had Carlos Eire for section, and he's an amazing section leader in a really quirky and great way. All of the professors are incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter, and as a former Catholic, the discussions and material didn't stray from the academic, which made it accessible to all. I do wish, as another student pointed out at the end, that we'd covered liturgy more, but alas, that's part of the problem with a course so broad. Hopefully, the professors will take to heart the students' desire for a year-long course in this subject rather than just a semester-long one. In sum, take it!",
    "This was my favorite class of the semester. The workload is manageable, but in order to get real value out of this course, you need to do the readings (which can be easy to put off). All three professors are great. I am Catholic, which probably gave me an advantage in understanding the material, especially at the beginning of the semester. Still, though, if you don't have a strong background in the subject, don't be put off by the fear of sitting in class surrounded by religious studies majors or lifelong Catholics- the material is accessible, and the professors do a great job.",
    "Every student at Yale should be required to take this course so they don't go around pretending they know entire intellectual traditions of which they have only really scratched the surface (if that!). Wonderful readings, lectures, and professors - one of Yale's best. Makes you hunger for more from this area of study and from these professors.",
    "This is a broad (broad!) survey of Catholic history and intellectual thought. You will read literature, theology, mystical texts, and more. The course aims to introduce you to the diversity of Catholic experience and thought throughout two millenia. If you a non-believer, a cradle Catholic, or anything in between, you will benefit from this course. Looks at how Catholic thinkers have influenced and been influenced by the surrounding world. Takes you all the way from the Gospels to the 21st Century. Must do the readings to benefit, not a gut course, but enjoyable, interesting, and rich. They don't make you buy any textbooks, which is nice.",
    "Yes, I'd take this class! It's pretty easy, the midterm and final and papers were chill (especially the papers), and you get to hear lots of brilliant lectures and go to special events at the Art Gallery and Beinecke. A good fifth class, I think, and well worth as much effort as you want to put into it.",
    "This course has its moments. For someone who's invested in the subject material, it would could be worthwhile. But there's a ton of reading, the lectures don't always cover the reading, the professors each bring different perspectives to the table (though none of them has an expert perspective on Catholicism, theology, or church history), and the assessments don't really hold students accountable because they barely test anything (4 passage IDs and an essay crammed into a one-hour final make for a not-very-thorough evaluation). Also, this course was an organizational mess. It seemed that none of the professors really wanted to step up and take the lead, which was a problem when it came to assessments. To give one example: we were supposed to have three five-page papers during the course. After week 9 out of 12, we had handed in one of these papers. They ended up pushing one of the papers back into reading week, which seemed grossly unfair to many of us. Students plan their class schedule around how their reading week and finals period will look, and they told us on the last Monday of classes that we would have a paper due in reading week because they were too disorganized to correct our papers in time to hand them back and assign the next ones. In other words, this course is not for the faint of heart and those who depend on knowing exactly when every assignment is due.",
    "Catholic Intellectual Traditions was a wonderful course where I learned a lot about Catholic thinkers and the tradition as it has changed over time. It was great having three unique teachers- one in philosophy, history, and literature respectively- and it truly enriched the experience. For me, the reading was a lot, but it was worth it. I truly enjoyed this course and would recommend it to others in the future.",
    "Yes. However, I would recommend it only for one with a strong personal experience in the Christian tradition (one doesn't need to be Catholic but definitely Christian to fully appreciate the works that are read, their inspiration and the feelings and thoughts that they inspire).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! The material is incredible (almost all primary sources) and the professors are nothing short of amazing. I was riveted by every lecture, and I couldn't wait to do the reading. This really is an incredible class - take it!",
    "This course is a reading heavy course that provides a very strong and wonderful overview of Catholic Literature, philosophy, and intellectual\/historical development. The course is absolutely amazing and the vagueness of the topic allows it to work for multiple majors where it may or may not be listed under. this class is led by three fantastic professors who when bringing in guest speakers add to an already amusing, engaging, and just pretty much awesome class. The course is not just for Catholics and there is a lot that can be gained from the class regardless of your religious background.",
    "If you want to feel more qualified to talk about Catholicism from an intellectual perspective, this is a good class. Even if you're Catholic and would rather approach it from a more personal, spiritual perspective, it works too. They'll consolidate the syllabus, so it can only get better, and it was already a good experience in the first place.",
    "This is a pretty good class that will hopefully improve in the coming years. The course isn't super cohesive, and it doesn't really work for me to have a different professor teaching every time, but if you don't mind that then you'll probably like the class. The readings are quite long but the papers aren't too bad.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I imagine this course might be more challenging for non-Christian students (especially the first three weeks' topics - intro, gospels\/Acts, and councils). However, this course material is incredibly important to understanding the Roman Church as a living institution, and its interactions with the secular world.",
    "I highly recommend this class. With the knowledge that this is a survey course of sorts, you learn a lot about just how universal Catholicism really is -- beyond just what the teachings are. This course offers a good taste of history, philosophy, theology, and even literature. The readings are great, the professors are great. The workload is quite manageable too. Take this course.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale! It's certainly the best class in term of the material covered. If you are at all interested in Christianity or the Catholic Church, you should take this class. The readings during some weeks can be a lot, but you should still do them. My only regret is that this class wasn't offered when I was an underclassman.",
    "I highly recommend this course to any student who is interested in the history of Christianity or the Catholic Intellectual Tradition.",
    "Interesting, but not fully ready yet. Definite divided audience problem where different faith backgrounds were concerned.",
    "I will recommend this course for every student who is interested in European history because it lays foundations for understanding not only Catholic tradition but also Western European philosophy and religious culture.",
    "If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in reading primary sources and getting a feel for the origins of Catholic and early Christian teachings, definitely take this course! It should have more wrinkles ironed out next year and be even more enjoyable.There was a lot of reading that was not necessary throughout the semester, but the midterm and final were based on passage recognition (I did all of the reading for these during reading period- totally do-able). There were three short essays (around 4 pages each) with multiple prompts; you could always write about something that interested you.Each of the three instructors had a different and importantperspective that really fleshed out the tradition of the Church. Even if you do not have a Catholic or Christian background, this course and its material is super-approachable and enjoyable. I learned a lot!",
    "yes i would. very good and interesting course\/not very much work",
    "I cannot recommend this course enough, and I think the endorsement will be stronger for the second iteration. In the course's first run, the professors have had the opportunity to test the syllabus and get a feel for the various lectures. Naturally, this can translate to a mixed and choppy experience, but the sheer power of the lecturers and readings combined makes every lecture and section feel like a treasure. For anyone who thinks he or she has an opinion on Christianity and a good grasp on the West's intellectual history (including, even especially DSers), this course will surprise you and perhaps challenge you with the depth and amount of intellectual output produced by the Catholic tradition, from which most concepts and principles we take for granted in the European tradition sprung.",
    "It was awesome! Definitely take it. A significant amount of reading but all really good stuff and you'll walk away with a much deeper understanding of the Catholic tradition.",
    "History 280 01 is a course focused on the intellectual tradition of the Catholic Church up until Vatican II. If you want to learn about Catholicism this is the course to take. I would recommend this course without any reservations. There is a joy to this class that is indescribable."
