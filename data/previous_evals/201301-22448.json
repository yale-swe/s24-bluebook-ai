    "Average intro EE course. Take it only if you are an EE major",
    "Ask yourself this question. Are you man enough to handle the sheer awesomeness of taking a course at Yale with a decorated Army Colonel who just happens to be a walking encyclopedia of all things computer? The answer is no. Nobody is. Bill Gates shopped the course, and decided to become a plumber after getting schooled by the colonel. Deep Blue tried to play the Colonel in chess, got beaten in three moves and was then reprogrammed as an FPGA. Chuck Norris descended from the sky onto the class, only to run back home, realizing he had no idea how to add floating point numbers. Long story short, this course was clearly made to breed a race of Ubermensch, led by Col. Sadowski in their quest to purge the world of ignorant Apple users. Take this course at your own risk and peril - you may ascend to a higher state of being, having gazed upon the forbidden wisdom of EENG 201.",
    "I had an excellent time in EE 201. Learned a lot and in a very constructive and thorough way. Labs were pretty painless and helped me gain more insight into doing as opposed to just theoretically understanding. I can't really add much in terms of improvements. Professor Sadowski was great. I know because there's only one section you may have no choice on who the professor is, but if you can, take 201 with Sadowski. I would recommend EE 201, even if you know nothing about Electrical Engineering. You will come out with some basic knowledge and a constructive way of approaching problems and thinking.",
    "Take it but be prepared to commit some time to this class regardless of whether you're a EE or CS major.",
    "A good class, not going to make or break you if you are not sure about your desire to do EE. It's required of course, could push you more into the EE\/CS track if you think you are into it.",
    "Good introduction to computer language and logic.",
    "There might be more interesting courses if you don't need to take it.",
    "This class was definitely a good introduction to computer architecture. It starts off a little slow, with aheavy focus on binary and hexadecimal representations, and then after that you start the logic chapters, which are more interesting. As the course progresses, the topics get harder, but more interesting. The labs are not too time consuming, but they are helpful to remembering the material later on.",
    "Warning this class requires high school algebra!This class was very easy, and unlike other engineering classes did not require advanced math. I would recommend it to any one who want to learn how computers work, even humanities majors. One heads up check during reading week to see if the difficulty level has changed.The class taught how processors and memory are built from logic gates, from semiconductors, and how software through machine language runs the processor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. There is some outside lab work, but it's not overly time consuming and is a nice change of pace from written problem sets and papers. Also the final design project is really interesting, and not as much work as one would expect. Overall this was a great course.",
    "Take if interested in EE, circuits, or similar stuff.",
    "EENG 201 is a fun introduction to computer engineering that ranges from the physical layer of solid state transistors to computer architecture. No single topic is rigorously studied, but you will still leave the class with knowledge on the basics of computer architecture.",
    "How to go from transistors to microprocessors. If you are in EE, you need to take it, and it will be relatively enjoyable. If you are not in EE, I would also recommend it if you want to get an understanding of how the hardware of a computer works."
