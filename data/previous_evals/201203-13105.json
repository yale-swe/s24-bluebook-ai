    "Yes. Take it only if you love to paint though because seeing people not work is frustrating. Also, with Sam if you have other ideas that don't involve painting per we, that will work too.",
    "It's an intermediate painting course. You continue to work on your skills and personal investigations. Motivation to work needs to come more from yourself than before, but other than that it's the same as any other art class. You get out of it what you put in.",
    "It's what you make of it. My lukewarm experience may be as much my own fault as the class itself, but I do wonder whether a completely self-directed (i.e. no assignments whatsoever) course of study, or just painting outside of classes, might have been more productive for me.",
    "A mix of assignments and encouraged independent projects",
    "Lot's of freedom and individual attention. Both Sam and the TA were fantastic and full of advice of future projects\/improvements on current paintings. Sam turns on music throughout the class. Invites nude models at the end of the term. If only the course required more frequent, hard deadlines, I would have produced more."
