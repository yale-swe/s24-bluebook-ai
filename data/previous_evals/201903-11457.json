   "comments": [
    "It was incredibly difficult to learn in this course, and I was completely disengaged for most of the time. Ayesha is a wonderful and thoughtful professor and always prepared, and Dr. T is also very entertaining, but sometimes I think I showed up to class more often than he did. The class was also far too large for a seminar, and our discussions were not nearly as engrossing as I have known many seminar discussions in humanities courses to be.",
    "I learned a lot about the perception of the East from the West",
    "In this course I learned about how translation affects the meaning and delivery of a story, as well as some interesting ways to think about big questions in society.",
    "I didn't learn much of anything if I'm being honest. I now know the origins and some of the stories of the Arabian Nights, and a little better understanding of the Middle East and Islamic traditions and cultural values, but that's it.",
    "I learnt about the complex manuscript tradition surrounding the Nights, as well as a fair bit about how the corpus of stories deemed the Nights have evolved over the centuries\/been read by different cultures.",
    "I learned to question many basic assumptions about reading.",
    "I better understood how the Arabian Nights fits into the context of Middle Eastern literature, how other cultures take up the Nights and respond to them, and how they came to have iconic status in \"Western\" consciousness. I also learned a great deal about the practice of translation.",
    "A great course looking at the Nights and its interpretations throughout the ages. I would have never thought of reading comics and watching Disney movies alongside a novel written by a Nobel laureate, but this course brought them all together. The syllabus is full of interesting works, and the class discussion was always eyeopening.",
    "I learned how to think beyond high school literary critique. I learned how to look at a work as complex as the 1001 Arabian Nights from many different perspectives and think about it in the context in which it was written and that of today. I learned how to write a detailed paper about an opinion I have that stemmed from the work and run with and develop my creative process. I really think that this course opened a new view of literature for me.",
    "Very few.",
    "I learned to think critically about The Thousand and One Nights, in terms of the text, intertextual elements, its reception, and recent interpretations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course would do much better with far far fewer students and perhaps one teacher.",
    "No weaknesses. All strengths: content, professors, and the class dynamic!",
    "Strength is professors, weakness is that some items on the syllabus were peculiar",
    "This class was fun and somewhat interesting, but provided zero feedback beyond random checkmarks on papers and a less than desirable midterm grade. The course instructors pride themselves in having a class where \"a B represents a very good grade\" in order to balk at the reports of grade inflation. Better feedback and more concise grading guidelines would be an improvement.",
    "This is a fantastic course. It is very engaging and the work load is manageable because it is very entertaining and fun to complete. I actually do not have any suggestions to improve the course as it far exceeded any expectations I had.",
    "Strengths are the easy workload and class structure. Weaknesses are that the course is terrible for actually learning and receiving feedback on papers, writing styles, and anything to do with grades. The final project was something out of a third grade art project. Discussions felt random and off-topic oftentimes.",
    "I liked that it was taught by a pair of faculty each with their own expertise, but wished that more feedback was given.",
    "The main weakness of the course is that there is next to no feedback on the thought papers and it is difficult to say what you learned.",
    "Honestly, this course for me was all strengths and no weaknesses. The reading and paper assignments were reasonable, I adored the creative liberties given to the students, and the syllabus itself made for fantastic reading\/watching. The course was organized and changes in the syllabus were well thought out. Prof. R and Dr. T had infectious energy, especially when they bounced that energy off one another, and their respective backgrounds as scholars of comparative literature and Arabic provided nuanced perspectives on the works we read.",
    "I love the creative assignments and the final project. The strength in this course depended heavily on the instructors dynamics, and Dr. T and Aisha have an amazing chemistry.",
    "This course has many, many readings. I can't tell if that's a strength or a weakness, but it requires a lot of time to be able to follow the class the next day. However, there is not much writing. The flexibility of the course is definitely one of its strengths. The way that the professors teach the class is very conducive to learning at the student's own pace and taking from the work what resonates most with him. It's truly ruined all other literature classes for me, in the best way possible.",
    "For starters, it is impossible to have an effective discussion with 30 kids in the class, in a massive classroom where you can barely see the other end of the table. It is even more difficult when one of the professors only shows up about half the time, and then the students are blamed for being absent or late. All of the assignments were \"fun,\" which was fine, except I don't actually feel like we ever made any serious effort to understand the literary dimensions of the texts we were reading. The final assignment was basically a joke (we had to make a 3D model or sculpture of some kind, and the teachers literally encouraged us to use play-doh). It was always unclear to me whether this class was a lecture or a seminar and therefore what the expectations were. I liked some of the readings.",
    "I am so fond of our dynamic teaching duo, whose back-and-forth humor was the highlight of my mornings. The ethos behind our thought papers for class encouraged me to think not only critically but also creatively, and it freed me upI was always excited to do my assignments for class! I loved the readings in our class, as well as the facilitation of class discussion that really probed me to think deeply at the same time as it encouraged me to speak my mind. Furthermore, I really appreciated our class visit from Yasmin Seale, who recently translated Aladdin."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Teaches you a lot about the collection, and doesn't require that you come in knowing much. This class was not easy for its workload, but it was extremely enjoyable. Honestly, I think that taking this class makes you a cooler person.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who needs a breath of fresh air from the typical Yale course. Its interesting and different.",
    "Yes, but not if you're taking it as a gut fifth class. You will end up skipping the readings, which is manageable with creative discussion answers, but you will regret not giving this class a full workload of attention. If you're tight for GPA reasons, probably not because the grading scale seems somewhat volatile.",
    "Absolutely. If anyone has any interest in fantastical stories or The Arabian nights in general or just wants to take a fun English class this is the class for them. The professors are extremely engaging and make the class a joy to take.",
    "I would only recommend it if you really wanted to learn and read about the Arabian Nights, as well as a collection of other random novels, graphic novels, or stories that pertain to ideas from it. I don't feel like I've learned much but it was an easy class. If you really value structure to your classes, don't take this. The first 30min of each class was dedicated to how students felt about the reading or movie. Discussions felt a little irrelevant and off-topic at times. If you care at all about your grades, this may not be the best class because they didn't show us any sort of grade until 3 weeks before the end of the semester, well after the drop or credit\/d\/fail deadline. Most people's grades I believe are B-A range, however, there is little structure to grading and absolutely NO feedback on writing or the papers we submitted.",
    "Yes, especially since the Nights are rarely discussed within academic settings and most students would have limited interaction with this corpus of stories.",
    "Totally! One of my favorite courses at Yale. Even if you're not all that interested in the Arabian Nights themselves, if you've ever enjoyed a bout of storytelling or wondered how literature gets transmuted and reinterpreted when crossing cultural and geographic boundaries, this course is for you.",
    "Yes -- the course is multi-faceted, enlightening, and just plain fun.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student! It is a wonderful class in which newcomers and experts of the Nights alike can learn something new. One never gets bored in class, although one might fall asleep because they stayed up late the night before reading.",
    "No. Don't take it. Definitely not. Especially not when it's at 9 AM on the top of science hill. I switched to CR\/D halfway through the semester so I could skip when I wanted to.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student!!! I particularly enjoyed piecing together how each weeks readings refracted a particular aspect of the guiding themes of the course."
