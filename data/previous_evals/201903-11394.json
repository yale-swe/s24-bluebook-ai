    "I learned to play multiple gamelan instruments as part of a group, and learned about the traditions and histories of gamelan inside and outside of Java.",
    "I became familiar with the history of Javanese Gamelan and learned to play Gamelan music.",
    "This course taught me how to play several instruments that are part of a gamelan ensemble. But even more, it allowed me to learn a significant amount about the history, politics and culture of Indonesia through reading and talking about this fascinating genre of music.",
    "I learned a lot about gamelan performance but also about the history and context behind it in Indonesia.",
    "I learned how to be humble as part of an ensemble",
    "I learned a ton about gamelan music and Central Javanese culture, including traditional dances, the art of shadow puppetry, and the influence of Islam. I also learned how to play many different gamelan instruments and how to play different gamelan musical structures.",
    "We learned what Indonesian Gamelan ensemble is and how to perform the music."

   "comments": [
    "The content and instruction of the course is unparalleled and makes it something I look forward to every week. I enjoy the structure of the class, which in some ways resembles gamelan learning in Indonesia, and I enjoyed being able to do something with my hands, as someone who doesn't major in the arts. I would have enjoyed getting to know my peers better, though.",
    "Rehearsals were always productive and accessible. The weekly readings were also interesting and often prompted productive discussions.",
    "Gamelan is a classic fun and interesting 5th class to take as a junior or senior. Maho is a really great person and professor and cares very much about the class. Students in the course become tight knit and develop a bit of a community by the end. The music is a lot of fun to learn and discussions are often quite interesting and relaxed.",
    "no weaknesses, structure of the class is great. We discuss the readings for a short while which is important to understand the meaning behind our music, and then we rehearse for the rest of class.",
    "Such a great course.",
    "This class has so many strengths. Maho is an amazing professor who cares so much about her students and about making the class both educational and really fun. Most of the readings are interesting, and the journal responses are not very time consuming. The vast majority of time in class is spent rehearsing, which is so enjoyable, and the performances are fun as well. The midterm is also very straightforward, and the final paper allows you to focus on mostly anything you want to write about. I really cant think of any weaknesses.",
    "so fun and learned a lot",
    "The class was fantastically structured for a music class. It included both the practice of Gamelan and its history\/context."

    "I can recommend this course without hesitation. You will walk into the classroom with awe day one and that'll continue through the semester. It'll be a class you look forward to as a welcome break from more traditional classrooms. Even for, or especially for a non-music major without musical background, it's an incredibly unique opportunity that you shouldn't turn down. It was easily among my favorite classes at Yale! Plus, it's something you can keep doing after college if you can find a local gamelan!",
    "Yes, this class is incredibly fun and impactful. As a non-music major with little music background, this course was accessible and engaging despite my lack of experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to a student who has always wanted to try taking a music course and needs a fun, interesting and fairly easy 5th class for their semester. Youll develop a community and learn more than just how to play a few instruments. Its a special experience and a class you definitely wont forget.",
    "YES",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who enjoys music. You dont have to have any previous musical experience; as long as you appreciate music, you will love this class. Learning to play all the new instruments is so fun and rewarding, and the other aspects of Indonesian culture that you learn about are really interesting as well.",
    "yeah!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you want a different pace of learning. Gamelan is by no means a \"normal\" class when compared to any other seminar or lecture offered at Yale. It's very practice based. You become very close to your peers in the class by nature of the practice."
