   "comments": [
    "I learned some of the fundamentals of probability theory. I also learned about many of the basic models used by statisticians in order to utilize these concepts. However, I wish there could have been more real-life applications in order to gain insight.",
    "Good foundation in probability. I now feel much more comfortable solving probability problems.",
    "I learned more about statistics.",
    "Thinking about probability in new ways.",
    "I learned the most important elements of probability theory and how to apply them to real problems.",
    "I learned some things about probability, but not a lot. We were mostly taught formulas. Everything was \"use this formula\" or \"use that formula.\" The problem is that we skipped through some of the basics. For example, the concept of a random variable was new to me and didn't come intuitively, and we never really learned its properties, so I was always left wondering which changes I was allowed to make to a given formula to achieve the desired result. It would have been a much more useful course if some of the presuppositions hadn't been made regarding what we could understand or already knew. Prof. Wu is very smart and clearly knows his stuff, but it was difficult for him to communicate it clearly to us. As a result, there were items on the final that I knew should have been intuitive\/easy, but we spent too long learning formulas for ideal conditions and not long enough on their rules. For example, it was assumed that we could extrapolate law of total probability to continuous RVs from discrete RVs and then combine this with a convolution. Yet the only way we actually learned that in class was as two separate by-products of other examples we were doing. The things the professor said were \"intuitive\" were not so intuitive to me, nor to many other people, judging by how full the office hours were.",
    "You learn so much about probability in this class, perhaps more than you ever wanted to know. It really changes your view of the world though, and I really enjoyed the class for that reason. You learn how to tackle real-life scenarios in a probabilistic framework.",
    "This is a great introductory course to probability theory which certainly helped develop some probabilistic intuition. It also gives a great introduction to how probability theory is used across many fields as well as a preview of how probability theory is the basis of statistics and statistical theory.",
    "I learned about various laws of probability theory and how to apply them.",
    "I learned to think critically about problems, using my own skills to derive which formulas to use and why, and gained a greater understanding of how these probabilistic problems are approached.",
    "Solid foundation in probability theory.",
    "Lots of understanding of probability theory.",
    "As advertised, I feel like I gained a decent understanding of probability theory from the course.",
    "The class proves a number of concepts that are fundamental to the theory of statistics and probability. I learned a ton in terms of understanding probability and solving probability problems. I also feel like I have a strong basis to now understand statistics.",
    "Got a comprehensive introduction to probability theory.",
    "Probability",
    "Basic understanding of probability theory",
    "I learned about the notation of statistics and probability.",
    "I learned the theory of probability-- how to look at various distributions, understand the mathematics behind them, and solve various problems with such distributions.",
    "I feel like I got a really good introduction to probability through this course. I developed an intuition that I never had before, despite being quite mathematically inclined.",
    "I learned the ability to think critically and apply knowledge derived from lectures to real life problems.",
    "This course offered a good look at probability. I left with a solid grasp of both discrete and continuous random variables, and the ability to manipulate both.",
    "The course successfully taught the topics expressed in the syllabus, however the teaching of confidence intervals was somewhat lacking",
    "I learned a lot of valuable problem solving techniques, and also many ways of thinking about real world problems in terms of probability theory that are extremely useful (I practically think of every problem in terms of what I learned in this class, which is really wonderful)",
    "I was really excited to take this class. However, I was extremely disappointing. The lectures were unhelpful and the homeworks were ridiculously difficult. As a result, I don't think I got anything out of this class.",
    "We learned about the basics of probability theory.",
    "This class is designed to give you a good idea about not only probability, but random variables and how to manipulate them as well. The content is hard to grasp though, so it's important to have someone good teachig it.",
    "I gained a solid foundation in probability theory, learning a more rigorous basis for many ideas I was vaguely familiar with before.",
    "I learned probability theory.",
    "Learn how to think about probability and questions related to probability. A hard, problem-solving oriented introduction to the subject.",
    "I definitely learned a lot about probability and statistics in this course-- you cover so much material, and it becomes exponentially harder as the semester goes on. Totally worth it though, because it is so important to know the foundational basics of probability.",
    "I learned A TON in this course. I knew nothing about statistics coming in and Professor Wu managed to cover so much.",
    "Never having taken a probability course before, I learned the basics of probability theory -- everything from expectation and conditioning to common distributions and linear regression; for both discrete and continuous random variables.",
    "I personally didn't get the class at all. But there definitely were people in the class that did.",
    "I learned a lot about probability theory and its applications. The course moved swiftly and covered a lot of material during the semester. I developed various insights that influenced my view on probability and statistics. However, the course covered too much material, so it was difficult to fully understand every topic."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There needs to be more review in terms of notation. I often understood the concept, but the theorems and their notations were not clearly explained. Our textbook also used different notation than the lectures. Another weakness is that the class had a very wide array of skill levels, so while some students had never taken a statistics course, others had already taken advanced computation and statistics in high school. The grading was also very picky in that we wouldn't get much credit for doing the correct work and messing up 1 or 2 numbers.",
    "Very good lecture notes. Solid problems, if a little easy.",
    "I think the course was well-taught. However, it should not be required for the Applied Math major. Advanced students should be allowed to take a harder class. For example, I had proved the Central Limit Theorem, one of the last topics of the course, in a more rigorous manner in another class.",
    "It was a well organized course.",
    "Strengths: Very thorough Weaknesses: No real coherent throughline on material. It's not always clear how topics relate to one another. The course was also not taught in an engaging way.",
    "You'll some properties of statistics but won't feel very well-suited to apply them. There was usually a \"catch\" to each example he did... we'd be given a formula, and then there would be an example or two to illustrate how the formula worked. The issue was that the homework problems would have some issue where we had to combine multiple topics before learning each individual one, use some other \"intuitive\" property, or do some extremely messy calculus that undermined learning the underlying probability. Bottom line is that I'm hoping to major in statistics and yet feel like I know nothing about probability after taking it, which is very concerning. It could be improved if it had a more concrete discussion of each topic and began with simpler examples. He assumed that we could easily figure out the simple examples and so only gave complicated ones (often while combining with other concepts). This resulted in \"assuming out\" many of the basics, and then when we had to use our \"intuition,\" many of the basics needed to know if certain operations are \"allowed\" were completely missing--this made the final extremely difficult and frustrating because I know that given a more organized teaching of this course, I could--and should--have understood how to do the problems given that I've completed the course. We got the essential basics of probability, which is good, but then we went into combinatorics and then random variables, which is where things went sideways. It took me a few weeks to understand how the random variables were supposed to work, and that set me back in understanding all of the other material. Also, please get a more helpful textbook. This one was very disorganized and did not help to understand anything; it was often completely devoid of examples. If the lectures are going to be disorganized and confusing, the least we need is a textbook that isn't.",
    "The problem sets and lectures were all beneficial in helping me understand the material. The problem sets and lectures also complemented each other very well. I greatly enjoyed the challenge problem on the last problem set and would have enjoyed something similar on previous problem sets.",
    "I have many problems with this course; I thought the lectures were enjoyable and the subject matter interesting, but the homework problems were very difficult to the point where I felt I couldn't do them if I weren't at office hours for a few hours every week. Also, the final exam was incredibly difficult; it was essentially another full problem set with about 25-30 separate parts, none of which were trivial. I feel like I learned a lot from the class, but I don't feel like I was able to use that on the final exam.",
    "The teaching was very interesting, but outside of the problem sets, it was hard to get a good grasp of how well I understood the material--the midterms were wildly easy and difficult, on both ends of the spectrum.",
    "The course was structured in a clear and organized way. The pace of the class was not too fast, and still allowed us to cover a lot of material. The problem sets were interesting and made me think. In my opinion, the assignments should have included some more basic problems where we were able to just get used to the basics of how formulas\/concepts worked. I highly value the difficult problems that are interesting and make you think, but I often felt like I didn't have a great grasp of the basics well enough.",
    "Good examples and applications.",
    "I think that over all the course was decently designed. My one complaint is that the online textbook we used along with the lecture was inadequate. It did not give very clear explanations and was largely unhelpful. It would be nice to have a different textbook on offer in future years.",
    "The course is too theoretical in the homework, but the test is applied. We are asked to prove theorems in the homework that doesn't really help us understand the concept.",
    "Really enjoyed many of the problems in the problem-set and final. Felt mid-term was disappointingly simple.",
    "The course balances nicely between proofs and applications. The psets help the students understand the material more thoroughly. There really were no weaknesses.",
    "The exam was way harder than midterm and p-sets and I'm not sure why.",
    "Lectures and homeworks were well designed an engaging. Great class, would recommend taking it with Professor Wu.",
    "Overall very good. Maybe could have taught more topics such as Markov chains, Chi square.",
    "The strength was good, interesting problem sets, but the lecture was a little monotone.",
    "The strength of this course was Professor Wu. Although I felt that he went too quickly through a lot of concepts, he does a good job explaining concepts, and his lecture slides were generally helpful. The rest of the teaching staff, however, was not great. They were helpful for completing the problem sets, but not much else- I never really felt like I ever truly learned from them.",
    "Strengths: the topics are very interesting, and when you understand something it is very rewarding. Weaknesses: It was very poorly taught, and most of my learning relied on meeting with other students quite often. I almost felt like I didn't have a professor.",
    "A strength of this course is that we covered a lot of very interesting material. A big weakness is that Professor Wu taught the course too quickly for the students to fully catch on to the material.",
    "The lectures were pretty good and having all the lecture slides posted on Canvas was helpful, even if that meant that people were less likely to attend lectures. The difficulty of the problem sets was very fair and helped me keep up with all the material. However, the final exam was way too difficult compared to the rest of the course. Though I did very well on the midterm and other aspects of the course and felt comfortable with all the practice finals and problem sets, everyone felt surprised by the questions on the test.",
    "Strengths: Problem sets are challenging and truly engage the student. course is organized and lectures placed online Weaknesses: Psets perhaps a tad bit challenging or too long Lectures feel useless. Not enough assessments other than psets.",
    "This course had several major weaknesses: 1. There were not nearly enough course materials. Coordination with the textbook was weak, and we only had powerpoint slides to study from. 2. Nothing was taught in the sections. Rather than going over the material, reinforcing concepts, and providing us with new material, the TA's chose to go over problem sets. 3. The final exam came out of nowhere. You need to provide us with some sort of review material (a packet, concept list, practice test).",
    "This course was pretty cut and dry. You go to lecture, do the problem sets, and either get the material or you don't. The material was presented pretty well, but if you didn't quite catch the topic on the first go around, it was hard to catch up. TA office hours tended to be less than helpful, and Yihong was pretty intimidating for many students, I think.",
    "The course is comprehensive, but is taught at a very quick pace. It's very easy to fall behind, and catching up is quite difficult. Often the lecture slides were very difficult to follow without going to office hours or without the teacher explaining the content multiple times.",
    "This course was not taught well. Homeworks and the final were disproportionately hard compared to what we did in lecture. Topics covered in lecture were not covered clearly and many people struggled keeping up with it.",
    "This was a good course, and almost all of it was excellent. This class is how math\/quantitative classes should be taught. There were good problem sets that were reasonable, interesting, and almost always made me think in interesting and new (but reasonable) ways. The problem set solutions were posted on line, so if I did get a problem wrong I could check the answer, and also all of the lectures (which were excellent) were posted online. While these may seem like small things, they facilitated my learning (every math\/quant course should require posting problem set solutions) and also challenged me. The biggest problem was the final. The problem sets (because the TAs helped give answers to the problems) had very high averages, and therefore the professor gave an impossible final (with a 67 average) and gave us no warning about if the class would be curved or that it would be a difficult exam. Many people (like myself) worked on the exam in inefficient ways and were totally caught off guard. It is not a problem to give a difficult exam like this, but there was no warning and it was a not a good reflection of how well I knew the material (and also how well organized and taught the rest of the course was). One additional thing I would improve is that I would recommend not posting the unweighted final scores without curve guidelines on Christmas (I am Jewish and it still stressed me out). Even if there is a curve in the end, it was very stressful for me (and other students) to receive a low score on a difficult final without any sense of if\/how you would be curving the course.",
    "It really covers the ground for basic probability theory, but the pace could have been a little faster.",
    "This class does not have a good textbook at all. It's structured around introducing new concepts each lecture without actually providing enough opportunities to practice them on questions so that you get a firm grasp on them, the way a class like MATH 120 does. The problem sets expect this degree of mastery over the concepts, which is why they become more like a quest to attack extremely hard problems using a not-so-direct application of a new concept without actually having a basic comfort with the idea itself.",
    "The course was generally well done. Some of the lectures could get a little dry. Unfortunately, some personal crises prevented me from fully engaging with the course, and I would have enjoyed it more at a later time. But overall it was well taught and generally the homework was useful and at an appropriate level.",
    "The lectures for this course were fine but way too fast. The problem sets were hard but doable with help from the TAs. The midterm was very straight forward and fair, the final was a disaster for everyone (as far as I could tell), and just absurdly difficult.",
    "The lectures were way too fast. Professor Wu also didn't really seem to care about individual student learning (as shown by the final exam, for which we received no proper preparation material even he was asked extensively to provide more material).",
    "I thought this course was very well taught and structured. Professor Wu is teaching for his first time, and I thought he was very thorough with the material and lecture notes. People sometimes complained he went too fast, but I think that was due to the fact that there was so much to cover. The problem sets were difficult but doable, and always very interesting. Midterm was alright, and the final was very difficult.",
    "I thought Professor Wu's slides were excellent. They were super clear and easy to follow.",
    "Strengths: - Fascinating and relevant subject matter: This point should speak for itself. - Yihong Wu was an amazing professor: His lectures were clear and concise with detailed notes available afterwards. The problem sets included fascinating applications across a variety of domains. The pace of the class was perfect. Weaknesses: - Minimal interaction with TAs \/ professor.. but this was mostly by choice. - 9:25AM is early.",
    "Prof. Wu goes extremely fast in class, so you need to really understand to keep up.",
    "The lectures were very organized and well planned. Yihong was also a good and engaging lecturer. However, the course covered too much material. And, the final exam was significantly harder than the midterm, which made it difficult to do well in this class. Furthermore, the problem sets often took anywhere from 5 to 12 hours and were pretty complex and theoretical."

    "If you're interested in theoretical statistics, then this is a good course. Don't be fooled by the word applications. The course involves a lot of proofs and difficult notation. It's not a terrible course, but you're interested in using stats in the real world, this is not a course for you.",
    "Although you wouldn't be able to find me in Davies on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday mornings, I actually would recommend this class. Lecture notes were posted online and were detailed. The problem sets were reasonable and usually helpful. Overall, it was not too hard but taught interesting and useful material.",
    "Yes, but only if you're considering a major in applied math\/statistics\/data sciences etc.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student less prepared than myself who was also interested in the theory of probability. Otherwise, I would either recommend a more applied course using R etc. or a more advanced course.",
    "Yes.",
    "While the material in this course is interesting, this doesn't actually come across very well in the quotidian experience of taking the course. Lectures were extremely unengaging and the professor did not do a good job of preparing students for the exam: practice exams were just finals from previous years (with no answer key provided), no review sessions were held, few guidelines were put forth (and the ones that were turned out not to be relevant to the final, really). Overall, I would not recommend this course to anybody, but it is important material to learn. Perhaps taught differently it could be good.",
    "I'm so sorry; I really want to major in statistics, and this is the first course in the major, but under no circumstances can I recommend it to another student with this instructor, despite believing that everyone should know some statistics, because this course won't teach it to you. The material is involved, but it should not have been nearly this difficult to learn. We were given lots of formulas and then had to apply them, but the problem is that we skipped over many of the basics (of combinatorics, random variables, properties of things that we learned, etc.), so if those things, the fundamentals of probability theory, aren't intuitive to you, then you will have to teach yourself all of them while keeping up with the abstract, complicated examples which combine multiple topics before clearly establishing individual ones. If they are intuitive to you, then you probably don't need to be taking STAT 241. So I don't know what to tell you. Also, at the time of this writing, this course only offered in the fall. So I guess that if you want to be a stat major and need to take 241 under this instructor, I should warn you to be prepared to teach yourself a lot of it, and don't expect the textbook to come in that handy, either: it also assumes that you know or can intuit much more than virtually anyone in the course whom I knew, could. The problem sets have confusing problems with messy calculus. Often you'll spend an hour trying to figure out the probability portion and then two hours wrestling the calculus or algebra into place with series notation, etc. Prof. Wu is a nice person and understands the material, but he seemed to lack much understanding of how to teach effectively so that we could learn. The office hours were exceptionally busy given the class size (not to say that correlation implies causation or anything...) which made it difficult to ask the TF's questions. They were also nice people but could not help us to understand because they also assumed that we really knew the basics. Please don't give up on statistics, but I want to make sure you're prepared for what's coming. The final exam was very frustrating given that it was again a new combination of topics for which, taken separately, we were not well enough prepared, and yet I knew that if the course had only covered those basics, I probably would have really known a lot about this stuff and had no issue with the final. Maybe I'm just an idiot and everyone else thought it was intuitive, but based on how other people feel about the final I'm guessing that's not the case. He seemed rather disinterested in preparing for this course (which was illustrated by the frequent typos in the slides... clearly not a labor of love), which resulted in omission of many of the basics in favor of complicated examples and problems for which the answer became clear only after having seen the methodology for the specific problem or example; i.e., seeing one example was not illustrative of the concept, nor could I extrapolate its methods to solving any other given complication of a given topic. Had we spent more time on the basic parts of each topic (which would be considered \"simple\" by someone who already understood them), we might have developed a more reliable method by which to solve other complicated examples. Bottom line is that I feel as if I know next to nothing about probability theory and would not feel confident solving any given problem in the real world on my own which I would have hoped to feel confident solving given the scope of the course.",
    "Take it if you need to. I have a hard time imagining it as a \"fun elective\" for anyone else.",
    "This is a great introduction to probability theory, a field of math and statistics that is both very beautiful and very useful. Professor Wu was a great lecturer and provided great problems on our psets; the problems were both helpful in reinforcing the concepts taught in class, and interesting and challenging. The problem also gave us the time and opportunity to really understand the concepts being presented, which was helpful in developing intuition to solve more challenging problems and extensions of problems presented in class.",
    "Given the amount of work I put into this class and the amount I'm getting out of it, I would not recommend this course to another student. It's very interesting subject material and I enjoyed learning it, but the homework problems were so difficult and the exams so cumbersome that I'm disillusioned at this point. If you have to take this class then take it, but expect to be in office hours every week, unless you're naturally good at probability theory, which I quickly learned I am not.",
    "It really depends on the teacher, but as long as you're not in it for the grade, it's an unbelievable course that allows you to think about the big topic of probability in a cool way, be prepared to think about things for yourself.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. The material is interesting and very useful, and it was well taught.",
    "Decent teaching, and lectures slides posted online. Homeworks are fine if you work with other people- but beware of the intelligence of those around you-- the averages on homeworks were always around 98%, and not because they were too easy. The midterm was easy, but if you made a stupid mistake, you lost a lot of points, so be very careful. The final was very long and hard. Who knows how it will be graded. Overall it's a fine class. Take it if you have to or if you're very interested in it. The teacher is good enough that you don't have to avoid him.",
    "This is probably a better alternative to STAT 238 if you plan on taking future classes in the department like 242. While not inspiring by any stretch, the class was for the most part manageable and provided a decent introduction to probability theory. The problem sets were well designed and didn't require too too much work. The midterm was easy but the final was much much harder, so be prepared for that. Overall, a decent course that you probably have to take.",
    "No, don't take this class. It's boring and a waste of time if it's with Yihong. Granted that it was his first year teaching, but there wasn't enough resources for help. Most other classes have practice exams to give you an idea of what's on the test, Yihong just posted the previous prof's tests but there wasn't an answer key and the material didn't line up. When he answers questions in class, it's very condescending, as if why don't you already understand this material.",
    "This class is pretty hard. Don't take it unless you have someone you can do the problem sets with.",
    "Yes - if you're considering a math or statistics major this course is fundamental.",
    "take it for a major instead of 238, don't otherwise",
    "I think this course gives a very good overview of probability, and can be useful for various other disciplines such as physics and data analysis.",
    "Yes, Yihong is very nice. The application topics he covered (random walk, gambler's ruin, etc.) were very interesting.",
    "If you want a theoretical approach to probability theory, this course is for you.",
    "You are probably taking this because it is a requirement. The problem sets were very difficult but it was helpful to work with other people. The midterm was fair and easier than the problem sets, but graded very harshly. The final, on the other hand, was ridiculously difficult. This was pretty frustrating, especially since we were not provided many resources to study. There were no review sessions, only a few hours of office hours (with subpar TAs), and only one practice exam that did not have an answer key.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this course to another student. I would recommend to stay away from the course if you can. It is extremely hard, and the professor didn't seem to care about us learning. The final almost felt like a trap at times.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's challenging, but enlightening and interesting.",
    "Yihong was a fantastic professor. His lecture slides were really well prepared. The midterm was very fair and psets were consistently challenging but always fun. His final was impossibly difficult with the average being about a 67, it really felt like a homework assignment instead of a final exam.",
    "I've heard mixed things about 241 from past years, but it was a great course with Prof Wu.",
    "The probability that this class will take up a lot of your time is pretty high if you aren't the type of person who is naturally gifted in math. Weekly psets are usually pretty challenging, but with peer collaboration are still doable. The final eats you alive though, beware.",
    "Do not take this course with Yi-Hong. His final test came out of nowhere, his course materials were poorly organized, he did not communicate with his TA's.",
    "I would recommend this course for a solid introduction to probability. I have some afterthoughts about taking the Stat 241\/242 sequence instead of the combined Econ 135 course, but overall a good class. It is required for Applied Math, and for people with some calculus background and the desire to think through problems, it was definitely a doable and even enjoyable class.",
    "I took this as a first semester Junior in CS and hated it. Thought it would be \"cool.\" Was wrong.",
    "If you want to learn probability theory, then take this course. It's quite difficult to understand and the professor, Yihong, thinks at least at five levels above the rest of the class. However, you will come out with a good understanding of the material (if you do the work, go to office hours, and read the additional Blitzstein text). GO TO OFFICE HOURS FOR THE PROBLEM SETS, AND DEFINITELY GO TO CLASS. Yihong's slides are often difficult to understand unless he's explaining them, plus he will often explain concepts entirely on the board, and these won't be posted online afterwards. The course text from Dartmouth is free but difficult to read - I would highly recommend buying the Blitzstein text from Harvard and watching Blitzsetin's STAT 110 lectures online.",
    "I would not recommend this course. The topics covered are very hard and the teaching is not strong enough for you to be able to cope with them. Only if you already have a very strong understanding of statistics already would I say this course is manageable.",
    "This was a good course, and almost all of it was excellent. This class is how math\/quantitative classes should be taught. There were good problem sets that were reasonable, interesting, and almost always made me think in interesting and new (but reasonable) ways. The problem set solutions were posted on line, so if I did get a problem wrong I could check the answer, and also all of the lectures (which were excellent) were posted online. While these may seem like small things, they facilitated my learning (every math\/quant course should require posting problem set solutions) and also challenged me. The biggest problem was the final. The problem sets (because the TAs helped give answers to the problems) had very high averages, and therefore the professor gave an impossible final (with a 67 average) and gave us no warning about if the class would be curved or that it would be a difficult exam. Many people (like myself) worked on the exam in inefficient ways and were totally caught off guard. It is not a problem to give a difficult exam like this, but there was no warning and it was a not a good reflection of how well I knew the material (and also how well organized and taught the rest of the course was). Overall, I would recommend this course since I think the professor will learn from student feedback the problem with the final, and the rest of the course was excellent and extremely interesting and reasonable.",
    "Don't take this class with Yihong! He's a really nice guy but not a very clear teacher. The homeworks were extremely difficult, and the final was a complete curve ball.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course because a proper knowledge of probability theory is critical in today's emerging technologies.",
    "Yes, if you are looking for a challenging introductory statistics course.",
    "A good if unremarkable course. Covers all the basics of probability theory (obviously), which makes it a really useful foundation for many, many classes in stats, math, physics, etc. With Yihong Wu, it was generally well-taught, although the lectures could become a bit dry. It can take a some effort to follow the lectures, not because they are difficult but because they get long, and a bit aimless. I often zoned out a bit in class, but the lecture slides were helpful and posted online. The homework and exams were all helpful and very fair. Overall a useful and decent class, but not a life-changer.",
    "I actually liked this class a fair amount before the final. The lectures were pretty good, the problem sets were interesting, and the midterm was really fair. The final was just terrible and totally came out of left field.",
    "If you are a stat major, you have to take it. Otherwise, I think the subject is useful, but you could learn a lot of it in Econ 135 with more application. I cannot tell if this class was bad or the professor is what made it awful.",
    "Definitely take this course! If you're an Applied Math major and have to choose between STAT 238 and 241, 241 is more of a challenge but you learn so much more.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It covers a lot of material in one semester but the concepts aren't too difficult.",
    "Yes, 100%. Basic probability theory is important to understanding different aspects of life. In this class, you learn how to rigorously define and solve fascinating problems that have a random nature. Although dice, cards, and coins are common, the applications of these concepts extend to a myriad of different disciplines. For example, the famous random walk: take one step left or right with equal probability -- what is the change you'll return to where you began? Or the optimal stopping problem: suppose you're driving past hotels, can't turn around, and want to choose the best hotel -- how many should you explore before choosing the next best one? These examples just scratch the surface of the types of problems you'll explore in this course. I hope it's clear just how important the subject matter is to various aspects of daily living.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is an amazing introduction to probability. The course starts from basic probability axioms and moves on to discrete random variables, continuous random variables, and many applications. The slide shows are great references for how probability is built from the ground up and used. Make sure you have taken multivariable calculus and maybe linear algebra or vector analysis before this class, because these are needed when dealing with multiple continuous random variables. Prof. Wu is very helpful, patient, and kind. The tests are very difficult and the homeworks take a long time, but I thought the curve was fair and the class over all taught a lot of important material.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student if they were required to take this course. This course is definitely challenging and requires quite a lot of mathematics and calculus background. While the material covered in the first half of the semester was challenging yet manageable, the second half of the semester covered a much greater proportion of the material and was significantly more difficult than that of the first half. This unbalance made the second half of the semester much more difficult and made the final impossible compared to the midterm. The course lectures are overall informative, but some topics near the end of the semester were glossed over and not explained well. The problem sets can be pretty lengthy as well."
