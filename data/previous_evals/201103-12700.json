    "I would recommend it if you want a lot of practice with melodic dictation. In our section, we barely did any sightsinging, and we did a few harmonic dictations, but mostly 2-part melodic. It was a relatively fun class though, and hardly any work outside of class.",
    "It's a good course - I personally found it sort of boring, but if you want to improve your listening skills, you'll definitely learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class to fellow musicians of all types. It'll push you to the next level.",
    "Don't take this class with a TA unless you already knew their teaching style before because you can't trust a TA with such an unstructured class. That being said, what you get out of this class is really what you put into it, because this class doesn't give you anything lol. But you'll probably have to take it for the major so try to take it with Sarita."
