   "comments": [
    "This course takes you through composition through the lenses of 5 20th composers. Each class is dedicated to in-depth analysis of model pieces and for homework, you will create a portfolio of model compositions. The discussion is high-level and you cannot walk into the classroom unprepared. But Friedmann makes it all worth it. He is a walking treasure trove of musical wisdom and makes an effort to know every student in the class. Very highly recommended.",
    "Music 305 isn't so much a course as it is an extended series of Master's Teas with Professor Friedmann. Friedmann is in many ways a brilliant thinker about music, but class sessions can feel kind of random and without direction. You'll gain more familiarity with the workings of a few twentieth-century composers, but don't expect to walk out and be able to parse anything by Stravinsky in a trice.",
    "This is a class studying the music of Bartok, Debussy, Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Webern. There is a heavy focus on model composition, so it is particularly great for composers, but performers will gain real insights as well.",
    "Every student in the music department should be familiar with the language of 20th century music, whether you are a composer or not. A challenging class, but very necessary in your education\/life. Prof. Friedmann is a dynamic professor and certainly makes class time enjoyable. I recommend going to his office hours and asking for help constantly--- it makes all the difference.",
    "A great introduction to the works of Debussy, Bartok, Stravinsky, Webern and Schoenberg. Because there are so many composers involved, you can't go too far in depth with any one, but the class provides a good foundation in a couple of each composer's representative works which would be helpful for further\/individual study. Mostly geared towards composers in terms of what is discussed in class about the music, but also helpful from a theoretical perspective and definitely applicable to performance.",
    "An introduction to the modality of Debussy, the symmetry of Bartok, varied repetition of Stravinsky, set theory and tone rows of Schoenberg and Webern.",
    "Definitely take it if you're interested in 20th century music or composition. Friedmann is really insightful, but kooky. If he's unclear, make sure you ask him clarifying questions because he has a tendency to just let things slide. Also even though he seems rather ambivalent about outside reading, looking at other pieces by the composers and doing outside theoretical reading will help you immensely. What's quite scary is that he doesn't give any grades on assignments through the semester, so I still have no idea what I grade I'm getting.",
    "This class was great for learning different styles of composition in the 20th century. Pieces by Debussy, Bartok, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Webern were analyzed, and we would compose introductions or full pieces that incorporated similar ideas. I recommend it for anyone who would like to either get a better understanding of these styles of music (\"atonal\", octatonic, 12-tone, ostinato, etc.) or a better feel for writing music in general.",
