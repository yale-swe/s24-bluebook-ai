    "I explored the idea of a teenager to a great extent. Doing so taught me a lot of history and things about myself. I learned how to use a variety of sources and draw the important information out of texts. Mainly, I learned how to really flush an idea out.",
    "This course enabled me to critically think about the construction of history and ways in which categories of people change and stagnate. A focus on analyzing primary sources also improved my writing for history.",
    "I learned quite a bit about the history of teens, which is something I knew almost nothing about before taking this course. I improved my writing skills by learning how to incorporate non-traditional primary sources into my papers. This course exposed me to a lot of non-traditional sources, which is something I really enjoyed."
