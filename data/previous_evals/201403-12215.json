    "Take it because you are interested in learning about the material. Don't take it just because you think it is an easy class. It is an easy class for sure but if you are interested in the material, which I was, then you will also enjoy the class, which is important.",
    "Highly recommended course, regardless of whether or not you've read the story. You do readings of the original text and other variations and scholarly articles outside of class and spend class time discussing readings and close analysis of the text. Perhaps the course would be better with more focused discussions in class. Otherwise, amazing course.",
    "A wonderful in-depth look into one of the two great Hindu epics.",
    "There's no reason one shouldn't take this class once. Flick is nice, kind, Wonderful, the class itself chill but such a great learning experience.",
    "Amazing class! Must take even if you don't know anything about the Ramayan. Very engaging class, and a light workload."
