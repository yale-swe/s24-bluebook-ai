    "A great class! A must take for any science student.",
    "If you're interested in physics it's worth taking.",
    "You'lltake it if you have to take it. If the course continues to use Sturge as the primary textbook, be aware that this course will be the least pleasant course you'll ever take. Prof. Stone is a good lecturer, albeit he packs a _ton_ of information into each lecture, and he jumps from idea to idea a little disjointedly sometimes. The sorts of thought processes and intuitions necessary to succeed in thermodynamics are very different from those required for e.g. EM, QM, classical mechanics, etc, so be aware of that and expect to have to work pretty hard.",
    "This course was a great survey of the topics of thermodynamics. It is recommendable to anyone who wishes to be an engineer.",
    "This class covers a huge amount of material, and Stone often does not do a great job of presenting everything to the class. His psets and exams are extremely difficult, and you will need to spend a lot of time every week to stay on top of everything. By the end of the course, he was rushing to get through the last few lectures and we covered 4 chapters in the final class, which was horrible. If you have questions about any topics, talk with the TA (Alex) who is fantastic and can present the material differently than Stone.",
    "An Ode to Physics 420: Course Review and Exercise in VersificationThere is no way to succinctly summarize the feelings this class awakened in me. So, to the poor pitiful souls considering taking it, I apologize in advance for the length of this review. Unfortunately, the number of problems with this class is indicative of the disordered manner in which it is taught (S=k*ln(Omega)! I learned something!) Especially the last lecture: a speedy survey of four chapters of physics that will surely go down in history as one of the most confusing hours of my life. But you, my fellow students, deserve to know the truth. Hopefully, it will convince you not to take this class and consequently set you free.Oh Physics 420, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways:A workload, greater than for any other class,Week after week mercilessly kicks ass.The breadth of material, vast as an ocean,Stirs in me some depressing emotions.Your exams impossible without fail,After class, I wish to drink lots of ale.Best part of lecture? The 10:15 end:A limit the prof frequently offends.Desire to attend I rarely possess,It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to wake up and get myself dressed.That was a good start, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite do it. Seeing as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve designated this review an \u00e2\u0080\u009cexercise in versification,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I will make an effort to experiment with several different media: Just one sonnet is not sufficient to encapsulate my thoughts. In an effort to exemplify the regression into less civilized states that I routinely experience while completing problem sets for this class, I will now compose an acrostic poem in elementary school fashion:Physics? No. This was a sick and twisted math class.HahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaYou should really heed my advice: don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take this class.Strengths? It has none. Unless you count the punch packed by problem sets as strength. In which case, this class has the strength of Manny Pacquiao.I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe I survived this.Certainly the worst class I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken at Yale.So. So. So. Bad.420: The approximate number of hours spent being stressed about this class. Hours I will never get back.Ah. That was satisfying. Finally, dear readers, I will try my hand at humor and leave you with a limerick: An experience as horrendous as this one requires laughter to survive.There once was a Physics major from Yale,Who through psets and lectures would sail,They then took this class,Spent hours in Bass,And now sings a very sad tale.Although it pains me to have spent even one more hour on this class beyond the hundreds I have already, I have no regrets about writing this brutally honest review. If I convince only one wayward student not to touch this class with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole, I will have done my job.",
    "Overall, although the class is really hard, it really is a good class. The material is interesting and is likely very different from anything you have learned in the past. I found it interesting to learn two very different approaches (thermo and stat mech) to the same types of problems. Professor Stone is great. He legitimately cares about his students (he took the time to learn everyone's name), and he wants them to do well, even if this doesn't seem to be the case since his tests are insanely difficult. You probably won't take it if you don't have to, but it was definitely better than I expected going in.",
    "In an average Yale semester, one must take 4.5 credits to graduate. What would happen if you took 4.5 credits of Physics 420? Between classes and seemingly intractable psets, you would spend about 90 hours a week on work. You would do 4 problem sets during reading week. You would cover nearly the entirety of four very dense and often inscrutable textbooks in the last week of class. You would also learn from a brilliant physicist, but the pedagogy rarely compensates for the pain. This course should either be diminished in scope -- we covered 4 major chapters in literally a week at the end just to finish in time -- or made to be a 2-semester course.If you are a masochist, or want to be ridiculously prepared for grad school, then this course just may be for you!Also it may console you to read \"Sturge's Durges,\" the textbook author's less well-known but often more applicable work.",
    "This class is tough, there's no way around that--problem sets are long and tests are very difficult. That said, if you put in the time you'll come out having learned a significant amount of material and a lot of useful skills (expansion in small parameters especially). Stone is good at emphasizing important concepts, so it really pays off to go to lecture and actually listen. Going to the TA session is almost a requirement since the homeworks are so difficult, but Alex is helpful and generally pretty good at explaining things. Stat mech is tough because it integrates concepts from lots of other fields (chemistry, quantum, etc.) but taking this course with Stone will give you a really solid foundation.",
    "Physics 420 is a conceptually challenging class, but nothing you can't handle if you're used to taking challenging math or physics classes. The actual number of concepts that you will learn is not many, but they're not trivial to understand. It'll really teach you some fundamental things about how the world works, so if you're really into that or if you've just been dying to bridge that gap between chemistry and physics in a more rigorous way (I was), this is the class for you. Doug isn't the easiest lecturer to follow, but he knows his stuff really well, and he encourages and fields questions well during lecture. He's also always willing to make time for you, whether its for an after-class discussion or a longer one outside of class time. Work together on homework, because even if you understand everything, the algebra can be long and tedious without having much edifying value. Exams are hard, but everyone does poorly, so as long as you've asked the right questions along the way to really understand why things work the way they do, you'll be fine. I really enjoyed this class, despite the grind of waking up at 9 am, doing problem sets, and getting owned by exams.",
    "Take it if required. Very difficult course on thermo and stat mech. Know what you're getting into.",
    "I have never written a scathing review before in my entire time at Yale, but I feel it is necessary to do so now. Do not take this course unless it is required for your major. PHYS 420 covers way too much material in too short a period (4 chapters in the last two weeks!) and you will be required to learn all of it on your own because attending lectures with Doug Stone is not helpful at all. The problem sets will ruin your week, EVERY week (easily 10-15 hours). A problem set was due during reading week (the day before final exams began). An extremely challenging midterm and final are curved with very few students getting A's, less than 20 percent of the class. I have never been so outraged with a professor's lack of respect for his student's time. Do not take this class.",
    "If you're looking at this course, you should by now be aware of the circa fifteen hour p-set per week per course among required physics courses. I've heard some say this one is extra hard. I would just say that it's about the same as a quantum course or electro. The material is interesting, though one of the books can be a little thick.",
    "This course is quite difficult. If you plan on taking it, plan on committing a large amount of time to it. If this class is for your major, obviously you have to take this class. If it's not, although the class is very good, I would advise you NOT take this class unless you are interested in Stat Mech and you are pretty proficient in math and physics.To those who plan on taking it: Take Prof. Stone seriously and do the readings before class. Do NOT under any circumstances fall behind. The course starts out at a medium difficulty and steadily ramps up in difficulty as the semester ends. The last couple weeks move very fast, so be prepared."
