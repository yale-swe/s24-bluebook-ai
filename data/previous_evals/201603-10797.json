    "I learned a good grasp of how the atmosphere works, oceans, and environmental change.",
    "This class provided a good overview of many climate processes. I learned the most about the atmosphere and oceans. At times, the level of depth that this course went into seemed a bit inconsistent- at times we were only given a brief overview of massive topics, while at other times we focused very heavily on a few concepts and explored them in detail. Overall, I think this class gives a good introduction to a lot of complex concepts at play on Earth.",
    "I learned the scientific basis of how the atmospheric and oceanic systems worked. I also learned about climate change and renewable energy.",
    "Contextualizing many aspects of the atmosphere, ocean, and the environment and the interconnections between these three things.",
    "I learned a ton in this course. It was basically a crash course in understanding exactly what is in the title. You learn a bunch of useful things like how and why weather events occur, why global warming is happening, how renewable energy works, how the oceans circulate etc.",
    "I learned a lot about the connections in the forces that affect the ocean and atmosphere. I learned what controls the currents, why some clouds precipitate and other don't, why the wind is blowing along the isobars, and much more. This is actually a problem because I would have preferred learning a little less but with more understanding and application.",
    "I learned about ozone depletion, climate change, how winds form, how ocean currents form, how clouds and storms form, how pollution diffuses, and why planets have atmospheres. I also learned how to read meteorological soundings and other complex graphs.",
    "Comprehensive knowledge of the processes that control climate change, both orbital and anthropogenic Thorough pro\/con analysis of renewable energy technologies, and where their potential lies in the United States How earth is habitable for humans, e.g. heat distribution by rising\/falling air and ocean currents, black body radiation, the greenhouse effect, etc. The chemistry behind harmful processes such as surface level ozone creation and ozone destruction, and how they have\/might be mitigated (Montreal Protocol, HCFCs instead of CFCs, regulation on vehicle traffic and primary pollutants, etc.)",
    "I learned a lot about hydrology, weather, climate, and natural processes from this class. It's a fantastic survey course on this subject, and I wish I had taken it freshman year instead of junior year. It provides a solid foundation in environmental science for anyone interested in that field."

   "comments": [
    "This course is horribly taught. Prof. Smith teaches assuming students have had a good background in physics and chemistry, despite marking the course as an intro course. He is frequently unavailable to meet to explain problems and offers the least useful exam reviews. None of the PSets match up w\/ the exam. Why ask students to learn something then test them on completely different material?",
    "I believe one of the strengths of this course is how consistent the teaching style is-- the lectures were presented in a straight forward manner that were easy to follow. One weakness of this course is that this lecture style felt a bit boring\/slow paced at times.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, but found the transition from lots of learning on the board to powerpoint slideshows somewhat confusing. It would have been great to maybe have gone over a little less material but have had a little more time to think about the concepts. It was hard to keep up with the presentations in class, and when the professor used the white board it slowed things down a little more. Besides that I really liked the class!",
    "I would encourage more preparation\/guidance for the lab final.",
    "You learn a lot in this course and it is all very interesting. I think it is a good overview and that it is very useful stuff to know. I do think that the tests were a bit frustrating--Professor Smith would put stuff on there that he mentioned super briefly in class and wasn't on a slide, and the grading was sometimes finicky and very confusing. Another weakness of this course it that it often doesn't go a lot into the background behind formulas or concepts, and as a result the problems we solve and the questions we answer end up being very plug-and-chug. I am not sure if this could be fixed, however, as the course needs to cover a lot of material and there are no college-level science prerequisites, but some more explanation of background could be helpful regardless. It was sometimes a bit difficult as well to know what we had to know from the lectures and the textbook for the tests.",
    "The biggest problem with this class is that it is physics heavy. I haven't done any physics in 7 years and from the first few classes during shopping week the class seemed a lot less dependent on physics knowledge.If I knew this I would not have taken this class. Thus, professor Smith needs to underline that the class will use a lot of physics and chemistry and that students with a weak background in these two subjects should reconsider taking the class. This should be outline in the syllabus too. Additionally, the class is definitely not an intro class as it requires some background knowledge. The organization of the class should also be different: professor Smith often cannot cover all the material in one topic in 50 minutes, instead of meeting 3 times a week the class should meet twice for longer periods.",
    "Great class. I really liked the material and how it was taught. My only suggested improvement is that it would be helpful if the professor would include some more annotations on the lecture slides. Especially slides that contain graphs or figures (e.g. profiles salinity and temperatures of ocean water masses), it would be useful if the most important 'take home messages' were somehow summarized on the slides or in notes below it.",
    "The course was well organized. All material was posted on Classes V2 and Open Yale Courses in a very structured and timely manner. Problem sets and exams were fair and aided learning.",
    "This course had a very well structured curriculum, providing a good mix of depth and breadth across lots of interesting and relevant topics. The homework was helpful, and the lectures were engaging. I think 9:25am isn't a great time to have class though, since students would regularly come in halfway through the lecture or skip it entirely because it was early. I think a later time slot would improve engagement."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely not. This course is horribly taught. Not only does Prof. Smith reuse the exact same jokes as the online recordings of this course, but he also uses the exact same timeline. This wouldn't be an issue if done right. This man rather gives the same exams at the same time in the timeline even though he'll skip over entire sections in class. He doesn't explain material well, nor does he even attempt to but simply adds important things in in the last moments of class. He can teach well to a student with a strong background in physical science, but does not create a welcoming environment nor one conducive to learning. PSets are graded harshly w\/ multiple points taken off for typographical errors.",
    "If you're looking to take an introductory geology sequence and learn a lot about the earth's mechanisms, this is a great class- it covers a wide array of topics and explores some really interesting things. Professor Smith is great about answering questions, both during lecture and after class. At times, this might not be the most engaging and exciting class, but you'll definitely learn a lot.",
    "This is a great course to understand what's happening in the world. Good to have some intro chemistry or physics, because it does get a little mathy. Fast paced and engaging, you'll come away with a better understanding of climate change by starting with the basics of how our planet's systems work.",
    "If the student is interested in the environment and the physics behind it, this class is a great overview that is accessible to many if not all students.",
    "I LOVED THIS CLASS! Definitely take it if you are at all interested in the Earth",
    "I would recommend this course if you are willing to study hard and want to learn a lot of useful scientific concepts and things about the world.",
    "This class is the biggest trap at Yale. It's far away from an intro class as it requires a strong physics background and some chemistry background. Also, the class is very very physics heavy although that's not what someone would assume from the first few lectures. There are a lot of psets (one every week) so be ready for constant work. 3 midterms is also a lot, a better balance would be 2 midterms and a final. This class is a lot of work and if you're not good at physics prepare for some painful and long hours of studying.",
    "Great class! If you're interested in enviornmental or atmospheric processes, take it. You'll never look at a cloud the same way. The class can be challenging mainly because the midterms are often a bit crammed for time. Otherwise, though the workload and the content is very managable.",
    "Highly recommend for all EVST and G&G students, especially those interested in climate change over time, meteorology, renewable energy, or even the geologic history of New Haven. The course is a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information, but the math and physics equations are manageable. Professor Smith is extremely knowledgeable and has taught the course for years; you'll be in good hands. The Excel portions of the associated lab can be slightly tedious, but they are interspersed with fun excursions to the Quinnipiac River and the roof of KGL to launch a weather balloon.",
    "I really liked this course. It's a great overview to earth sciences, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in the natural world."
