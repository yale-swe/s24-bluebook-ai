    "It's solid, but heavy at the end\u00e2\u0080\u0094you only have reading responses every week until the last month when BAM you have a paper, a presentation, which is where all your grades come from.",
    "I highly recommend this.",
    "Very fun class, but also very rich conceptually. I think it's a great class to take if you're acquainted with one of the two disciplines (philosophy or psych\/cogsci) because it allows you to get exposed to concepts that are bound to push you intellectually. The discussion is also very fruitful, and Prof. Guglielmo does a really good job at getting us to think about the deeper implications of what we read. I always entered this class and left it with a smile on my face, it never felt like a burden and I would definitely recommend taking it!",
    "I would recommend this class most highly to anyone who is interested in the cognitive science of blame and punishment (and in moral psychology in general--the course is perhaps too narrowly titled). Do know, however, that both your success in and enjoyment of this class are entirely contingent upon how completely you prepare for class discussion each week. Feel free to read only one of three assigned papers, e.g., and BS a reading response... But know that such a decision comes at the expense of knowing what is happening when three classmates who have done the reading inside and out get into a debate about some intricacy in one single paragraph of one of the readings (and how it relates to three other issues in law, philosophy, and the world). I worked hard in this course and feel I was rewarded both with a rich understanding of moral psychology as well as with a deep satisfaction at having improved my analytical abilities and my comfort with this type of material. However, I could imagine very easily how the course might be stressful and overwhelming if one's interest wasn't truly there.",
    "A great mix of psychology, philosophy and cog sci on really important issues surrounding morality, blame and punishment. It was also very manageable for someone with very limited exposure to all of these fields previously",
    "Good senior seminar, great last class (just desserts). Definite recommend!",
    "Psyc 462 is a class that largely discusses broad topics in morality, but with particular focuses on the influences that drive our punishment behaviors and mechanisms of blame. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The discussions were always lively, the topics were fascinating, and I walked away feeling like I learned a lot about not only these specific issues but also interesting ways to think about and approach broader concepts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, although a strong background in psychology of philosophy would probably be advisable."
