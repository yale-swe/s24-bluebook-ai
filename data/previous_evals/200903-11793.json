    "I would absolutely recommend this class. It is different from most classes here and really allows you to improve your musicality.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any singer who just wants a low-key class that's fun, but still enriching.",
    "Lots of a cappella singers or other musically experienced students take this class. It requires lots of sight-reading since we never really rehearse any one piece exhaustively. If you already have some musical experience and are interested in old music I HIGHLY recommend this class. If you're just looking for an easy class, this won't be fulfilling or enjoyable because while it's easy, you need to have some interest in the subject material and singing for it to be fun.",
    "Great and fun class. Good music with a professor who really knows her stuff. High level singers might be frustrated by classmates who aren't as skilled but the class is a wonderful break from \"normal\" Yale school work.",
    "Highly recommended. This is an enjoyable class for singers at any level."
