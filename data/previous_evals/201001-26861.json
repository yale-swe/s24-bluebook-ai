    "So recommended. Hands down THE best intro fiction class at Yale. Professor Cunningham is one of the most encouraging, helpful, friendly and just damn awesome professors around. More than that, his comments are always insightful and dead-on, and he'll always bring them up in a way that encourages the writer, not driving them down. A great course--take it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Michael is amazing, and you will come out of it with a sound knowledge of writing\/fiction fundamentals and your very own short story, which is incredibly rewarding!",
    "Great course. Michael Cunningham is amazing and I learned so much more than I thought I would. I feel I became a better writer in the course and Michael Cunningham helped me gain confidence and really find my groove as a writer. He knows his stuff!",
    "Definitely. If you can get in, take it. It's a great experience and everyone will have something to learn from it. That being said, if you've been writing for a long time, you might find the pace of the class somewhat slow.",
    "This class is incredible and was one of the defining moments of my Yale experience.",
    "No summary is needed. Take it now. Now. People I know in michael's intermediate workshop don't seem to like it quite as much. Take this one.",
    "Take. This. Class.If you can. If you get in, you'd be crazy not to. Absolutely amazing.",
    "Take it!",
    "This is a very laid-back class that focuses both on writing fiction and studying contemporary short fiction for certain elements (character, voice, etc). While the class is pretty loose, Michael Cunningham's feedback is really spot-on and useful. And the classroom environment is really fun.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Cunningham is brilliant and a wonderful professor. You focus on a different element of fiction each week, reading published stories and writing exercises. At the end, each student writes a short story and the course becomes a workshop. I have only wonderful things to say about this class and its professor.",
    "This class was an intro the the art of fiction, learned by reading the work of great fiction writers and analyzing their techniques, and then applying them to our own weekly writing assignments.I would definitely recommend this course."
