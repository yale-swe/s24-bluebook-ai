   "comments": [
    "Take it!",
    "If you have taken or are taking another, upper-level WGSS or Soc course, don't bother with Sex&Gender because the topics are covered in too simple a way to interest someone (like me) who has taken\/is taking higher classes in the same area. That being said, it does provide a good intro for anyone looking into WGSS and Soc, and is sufficiently interesting that I would recommend it to those sorts of people.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Absolutely take this course. A lot of guys are scared away from this course because of its name, but it would be an awesome class to have a little more intermixed. Discussions could get really interesting that way, TRUST me.It's a great course that doesn't require absurd amounts of work. The concepts make sense and give you a completely alternate perspective on society.",
    "Definitely, if they're willing to go to the (early) lecture and do the readings. You get what you put into it. If you put in a lot, it's easy and eye-opening.",
    "Would not recommend",
    "I think that Sex and Gender in Society is a fine course. It is not wildly interesting but it's a good, easy credit. There are more interesting sociology courses out there but it's a good introduction on interesting topics. It covers a lot more than you might expect from the name (issues of race and class, things like egg and sperm donation) so I definitely think it's worth reading over the syllabus and shopping. Professor Almeling is a pretty good but not great lecturer.",
    "You will acquire a lot of interesting facts about sex and gender, but you won't walk away with the \"lens\" for evaluating gender inequality likeone would anticipate.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to other students, especially those planning on majoring in sociology. This course would be beneficial for any individual, however, because the knowledge taught is applicable to all life settings.",
    "Overall good class. Important to go to class to get lecture notes. The readings were a little overwhelming, some of them were interesting,",
    "This class goes through the life-course, starting with pre-school and ending with old age, and it focuses on how gender expectations affect individuals as well as structural institutions (such as work, family, education). I would recommend this class because you'll start to see so many things in your everyday life that are \"gendered\", even when it comes to your own actions. Professor Almeling made lecture interesting and was very approachable and encouraged students to go to lecture. Also, the class is a fairly low workload, and the readings are interesting. There is an 8-10 page research paper at the end of the term, which does require a good amount of work, but you have a lot of freedom on the topic you choose.",
    "A good introductory course if you are interested in Sociology.",
    "If you have not taken an intro to sociology course, take this one! It is a great introduction to the ideas and research methods of sociology, and is appropriately taught. The information is very interesting and will cause you to think about everyday situations in new ways. Be warned though: the effects of sex and gender in society are presented as facts and\/or statistics, rather than a discussion of whether these effects are good or bad, right or wrong.",
    "Sociology 134 01 is a sociology class in sex and gender studies that deals with a lot of ideas behind the 2nd and 3rd wave feminist movements. I would recommend the class to anyone interested in gender studies, and to students also who had never considered taking such a course before.",
    "I would recommend it as an introduction to sociology or gender studies - covers some great (if broad) topics and will definitely improve your understanding of how genderplays out in society, especially if you haven't pursued the topic in an academic setting before.",
    "Yea I would recommend it. The final paper, though 8-10 pages, is really straightforward cuz it's research and there is sort of a layout that you have to write it so it goes by quickly. Just make sure to start it early... you can write about whatever you want though, so that's a plus.",
    "Very good intro class. Force you to adopt a new gender-conscious lens to look at the world. Yes I would recommend this class. Extremely understandable and easy-to-take notes lecture. Cool topics and materials",
    "Take this class if you want a very broad introduction to themes in women's and gender studies. The basic course themes seem simple enough, almost to the point of common knowledge--for example: sexuality as a spectrum rather than a dichotomy, inequality between men and women. However, exploring all the ways in which these themes manifest themselves is interesting, and surprising in some cases.The class doesn't have too much work, but this doesn't necessarily go in your favor. Make sure you know how to write a solid paper in sociology, as this counts for the majority of your grade, and is based on something that YOU do (survey, observational study, content analysis, etc.) rather than just research.",
    "Definitely Not.",
    "Sex and Gender in Society is a solid introductory course in gender studies. It examines basic sociological concepts through the lens of sex and gender. Professor Almeling definitely makes the course engaging. She is beyond competent and does fascinating research in the field.Most of the readings were interesting enough to me that I did them thoroughly and in a relatively short amount of time.I would recommend this course to another student. It increased my interest in sociology, and I'm now reading a few sociology books on my own.",
    "This was a good course, especially as a first taste of sociology\/WGSS. After this course, I think sex and gender is more at the forefront of your mind and more readily comes up when you read the news and such, which can make for interesting discussion. It's nice how the course goes through various life stages since you might not have realized to what extent sex and gender are involved in all those areas. The main work you have to do is the 8-10 page final paper, but you pretty much get to pick the topic and do your own sociological research, so it's not too bad."
