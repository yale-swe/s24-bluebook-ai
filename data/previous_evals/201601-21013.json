    "Exactly as expected; continuation of RUSS 110. Russian is pretty difficult. Don't get yourself started with it unless you have a really good reason to.",
    "RUSS 120 is a continuation of RUSS 110. This class is when you hit a plateau of sorts in language study where after the initial excitement of starting a language and absorbing a lot of information, you start to really focus on the details and specifics of the grammar. This means that constantly speaking and practicing is crucial. However, my language ability definitely feels much stronger having now taken this course.",
    "10\/10 would recommend",
    "If you are interested in Russian, this is a great intro to the language. If you're picking a language, the small class size and great instructors make this a great choice.",
    "Certainly take it. If you're prepared to put the work in, you'll get a lot out of this class."
