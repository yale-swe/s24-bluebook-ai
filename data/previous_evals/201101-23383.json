    "The textbook was useful, but I found that I could gain a basic understanding of the material without reading it. Parts were very theoretical. Although I plan on keeping the book for future reference, I honestly didn't read many of the chapters this semester because I wasn't gaining much from them.",
    "the professor did a great job at explaining key concepts",
    "There should be a pre-req for this class. I'm not sure what the pre-req should be but as a person who just wanted to learn about hydrology in order to come out of it with the skills to have an intelligent conversation with a hydrologist, I felt significantly disadvantaged compared to those who have been studying water-related subjects throughout their FES education. Maybe stats should also be a pre-req.",
    "4,6: While I realize that the students in this year's class came from a very wide range of backgrounds and mathematical facilities, the course moved far too slowly and (I never thought I would say this) I wish there had been more homework. Making calculus a prerequisite (or offering both this course and the hydrological modeling course) would have alleviated this issue.7: Prof. Saiers obviously knows his material and is an incredibly intelligent scientist, but he on more than one occasion made mistakes during his lectures, or the overhead slides used different notation than the handouts and the textbook. This made things unnecessarily confusing and frustrating, particularly for students on the lower end of the course.",
    "I don't feel like we covered a lot of material well in the class. We covered little material, but not in depth. In the first half of the semester, I did not learn anything I hadn't learned in the 2-week section on hydrology in the Physical Sciences foundations course.We were also constantly let out of class approximately 30 minutes early, which was a little confusing. I felt like the instructor was making it clear that this class was not a priority for him.",
    "The course content was too light. I do not feel that it was enough for a graduate level course. Perhaps this is because the professor was avoiding delving into the math (differential equations). If that is the reason, then perhaps there should be a calculus prerequisite.I will say, that as someone that is not planning on doing applied hydrological research\/field work, I learned enough to be able to interpret the work of others as an environmental manager.",
    "I got the impression that Jim Sayers did not want to teach this class. He is a really terrific lecturer, but there was not a whole lot of teaching going on. Martin, the TA, needs to learn how to communicate with non-hydrologists.Also, we were told that calculus was not necessary, which may be true. But, to get anything out of the class I think it is absolutely necessary. I think those students that are comfortable with derivatives and partial derivatives got a lot more out of the class.",
    "Prof. Saiers is clearly an expert in the subjects address in this class. Also, he is a nice guy and generally approachable. However, the structure and organization of the class was so poor that it is hard to believe Prof. Saiers is the Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs. The material covered on the homework assignments, midterms, and final were so disjointed that an observer might have thought the three were all from different courses.Thus, this class lacked focus, and it was clear from the beginning that the Professor simply did not want to teach it. Classes in the beginning of the semester were cut 20 minutes early in some cases. Homework was mostly MatLab based \u0096 we learned nothing about how those programs were written, just punched in numbers. This was absolutely pointless, and provides us few real tools to take into the field. Some lectures, such as the one on nuclear waste storage, were advertised as \u0093fluff\u0094 by the Professor himself \u0096 really a great value to students, donors, and loan institutions financially servicing tuition.The final was also extremely unfair to non-native English speakers. True\/False questions inherently focus on picky uses of the English language instead of hydrology concepts. For over two years at Yale I have never encountered such a puerile form of testing. I studied enough to have written a well-formed essay, but instead had to play a stupid true-false game to demonstrate my knowledge. If only Nature, Science, and other publications allowed \"true-false\" submissions, this might have been useful for my technical future.Also, how unprofessional is it to have one question on a six question exam consist of material delivered by your TA \u0096 worse, you did not even attend the TA\u0092s lecture, so you have no idea the quality of the material delivery!The final\u0092s \u0093practice sheet\u0094 hardly resembled the final whatsoever. Professor, why did you even give it out? Only one of the exercises actually resembled what we did on the exam.In any sense, this experience reinforced sad conclusions reached from another course this semester and my previous two years: take as many courses outside of FES as possible, because FES Professors are not interested in teaching anymore, and we are in for a giant headache revolving around uncertainties in scope and commitment to courses. This not solely the Professor\u0092s fault, because it is hard teaching to a diverse audience, but still, more needs to be done to streamline and build expertise at FES such to avoid situations of disorganization in the classroom. It can only start with the Professors.",
    "Good course. Instructor provided very clear explanations and assignments were helpfull. Content was light, the class should be expanded to include additional content.",
    "Re Question 8 - I think this class covers a huge amount of material, and might serve students better if split into a two classes - perhaps \"theory\" and \"practice.\" Generally speaking, I think it is essential that FES continue to provide rigorous water resources education in order to prepare students for what will be one of the most pressing environmental management challenges of our lifetimes.",
    "The instructor did not seem too enthusiastic about the course.The course covered very little materials, I could have learned all course materials in one week.The class definitely needs field trips.",
    "Professor Saiers is one of the best lecturers at FES, and some of his lectures were AWESOME. The lectures that talked about wetlands, engineering, the nuclear reactor lecture--I looked forward to class because of these lectures. Somehow though, the course itself was frustrating. Lots of time was spent on how the equation came to be, rather than when you'd use the equation. I had expected the course to be more preparation for hydrological work (ie, if you are a hydrologist and they ask you to figure out how much water, etc, how would you figure this out?), and it ended up being much more focused on modelling. It felt like several courses squished into one. However, I still got a lot out of it."

   "comments": [
    "There seemed to be an uncomfortable tension between a modeling class and a general hydrologic theory class, especially towards the beginning of the course. It would be nearly impossible to balance the course to met all needs, but I think more of an applied theory class (e.g., more background on hydrologic theory and pen and pencil calculations rather than the MatLab modeling).The modeling problem sets could be more useful, but I also feel like a class dedicated to modeling would be necessary for someone hoping to use this in the future.",
    "Professor was visibly irritated by students on certain occasions and TA seemed easily frustrated by student questions.",
    "Everything was well executed.",
    "The professor taught the course with a strong focus on deriving equations. There could have been less emphasis on equations and more on concepts that can be practically applied out of the class room. I would have liked a more \"Applied\" hydrology class where we actually learned the applicability of the equations we used. Labs would have helped so we could see, for example, a solute moving through a plume of streamwater. It was hard to visualize a lot of the things we learned without a practicable example.",
    "It often seemed that Prof. Saiers and the TA (Martin Bouda) were not on the same page as far as the material goes. Not sure why this was.",
    "The curriculum and syllabus for this class needs to be refined. It was a hodgepodge of watching Jim go through hydrology equations, running simulations in models (but never really learning how the models were built or how they work), and learning more introductory information about hydrology.I am told that this year's class was the result of joining two hydrology classes: a modeling class, and an intro class. As someone studying at FES with a focus on water resources, I would prefer that they were split back into their two original classes. The coursework would be more informative, applicable, and valuable.",
    "This course had a lot of potential, but most of the lectures covered the mathematical derivation of equations rather than really explaining the theoretical and practical applications. The material in the book was interesting, but I feel that it wasn't covered in a way that personally appealed to me.",
    "Maybe having a field trip in the future would be beneficial (although I understand we probably didn't have one this time since the class was so big). More homeworks would also be helpful.",
    "More content.",
    "the course seems designed to not let anybody get behind, and overall it is too easy. it's not necessary to spend class time reading through homework or going over so many problems together. I would rather we continue to plow through new material, and people will just have to work to keep up. the class was very large, and perhaps would have been smaller if Jim had made it harder. There are so many topics I wish we had covered (ecohydrology, land use impacts on hydrology), because I already have a science background. Many class sessions were ended after less than 1 hour. So I just found the class way too easy and coddling. But when Jim was teaching us new material, he did an excellent job.",
    "Nothing needs a significant improvement.",
    "I think it really needs to be two course: intro and modeling. It's not fair to those people who are novices and it's not fair to those who want more serious hydrological modeling to combine the two.",
    "Pace",
    "We had just few homework so we did not have a constant work.We used Matllab program however as we had 4 homework we did not learn to use the program very well.We spend a lot of time talking about formula of hydrology process however I think we should do more practical and real exercises.Sometimes the level of exams were not according to the level of the material checked in classes.",
    "This course is attempting to teach to both advanced and novice hydrology students. The gap between these two groups created a very confusing learning environment. It really should be split into an Intro to Hydrology course and a more advanced course.",
    "The class is light on content and depth. The course syllabus should be expanded.",
    "maintaining a good mixture of intro and modeling. Maybe some field work would be good. Classes early in the semester were let out early - maybe that was let students catchup who did not have appropriate back ground but some field work would have been interesting to understand some of the concepts, especially to use the instruments in the field.",
    "Although billed as \"fluff\" I thought the discussion on radioactive contamination was very interesting and relevant, and would have liked more real world connections such as that. Some field trips (maybe optional, perhaps to superfund sites?) would have provided some valuable real world examples as well.",
    "We need some field trips or lab works.",
    "I actually think that we should have had more homework assignments. They are useful for forcing engagement with the material, and for providing practical examples of how to use the concepts we learn about in class. I understand that it\u0092s a huge time burden to the instructor and TAs who are flooded with questions every time we have a problem set, but it would be useful for us.",
    "a new instructor who is more passionate about the subject,or a more indepth class taught by the instructor.",
    "It was confusing to have homework assignments that were all in Matlab, and then be tested on ability to identify what we're solving for and problem solve by hand. This improved over the second half of the class though, when we had the in class problem solving.It would've helped me if the material was taught in a problem solving approach, rather than how the equation evolved--why is the evolution of the equation so important?",
    "The midterm was too difficult especially the level of challenge presented in the course and in-class assignments. Assignments were also a bit difficult and time consuming.",
    "Somewhat opaque grading by the TA was frustrating. Also, in some lectures Jim seemed to be rushing through the material and would hardly finish on time, and in others he stopped early and let us out with extra time remaining. It would be better to try to structure lectures to consistently use the available class time."

However, you don't need any calculus (as this course is currently taught) to do well.",
    "it's worth taking, but if you have lots of interest in hydrology and a strong science or math background, definitely actively seek out more knowledge, talk to jim, and just do a lot of independent learning, since it might be too slow of a course for you.",
    "I strongly encourage students to take the course and take the most out of it and use the teacher and TA's resources.",
    "This is a well-intentioned course but the emphasis that it puts on quantitative interpretations of hydrology as the only meaningful way to understand the concepts can be a little short-sighted.",
    "Students interested in water management should definetelly take the class. The professor is very good and the application of models very helpfull. It is just an introductory class though and the content is a bit thin. If you are looking for more depth in the material it might not be the best fit.",
    "The computer lab sessions take longer than expected to complete the assignments at the beginning of the semester.",
    "To social scientists: Brush up on your basic math (algebra \/ conversions) or be prepared to hassle the TA for more basic explanations.To natural scientists: Take it. It's awesome.",
    "Students do not have to use high mathematics technique.",
    "Embrace Matlab. It\u0092s good for you.",
    "Don't take it.Buy ahydrology book.Study on your own.",
    "Oh man. Figure out how to make this class work for you, I didn't, but that doesn't mean you won't.",
    "Take it if you are interested in water. Otherwise, think twice if it would help you."
