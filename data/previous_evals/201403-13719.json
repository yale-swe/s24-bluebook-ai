The course clearly has a definite plan - a little more information on the syllabus would be useful, particularly at the start of the semester.",

I am extremely grateful to Jeff for his time and commitment to my learning.",

    "The assignments in this course, exams and project all forced me to thoroughly learn and internalize the material, which is excellent - it ensures that I will retain it and be able to use it in the future.",
    "Before this course, I don't think I really knew what an asset is. The course gives a great foundation in the basics that has already been useful in my other classes at YSD."

    "The last few classes after the basics are covered (for example, Payroll) are different enough from the material that came before that they were a little confusing. It would be useful to understand how they fit into the arc of the course earlier, so we can be better prepared to take away what we need."
