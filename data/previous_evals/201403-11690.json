    "First part bad, second part really good. If you are deciding between it & something else, probably do something else.",
    "FANTASTIC CLASS!! Take it if you get the opportunity. Very interesting material. The professors are amazing. The guest speakers were super interesting. The class discussions were the best I've ever had. Definitely manageable reading and work load.",
    "Absolutely recommend taking this class. It provides a great in-depth look at leadership, as well as its role within the Obama administration. Take this course if you have any interest at all! The professors have incredible first-hand experience, and are really knowledgeable about the subject.",
    "Great class, met once a week, half of the class focused on leadership and the other half on the Obama administration. Requires a lot of work and blog posts, but definitely worth it. The teachers are amazing and you can learn a great deal from your fellow students. MUST take if you get in.",
    "Definitely take - great opportunity to access unique points of view.",
    "take it if you can get in. i didn't think it was that writing intensive, but i like writing so that could be part of it.",
    "It's a course on leadership in the context of politics. During the first half of the course, you study leadership from a more theoretical perspective (readings include Adam Smith, Daniel Defoe, and Benjamin Franklin). The second half of the course is an extended case study on the Obama presidency. During the second half, there is a guest speaker (i.e., a veteran from either the Obama presidential campaigns or his administration) for every class and they were all incredibly fascinating to hear from and speak with. The readings were fairly light although there was quite a bit of writing every week (two blog posts and three comments in the first half, and then a single blog post and three comments in the second half; it came out to about 3 or 4 pages of single-spaced writing every week). Fortunately, the mid-term and final papers were relatively short so I felt that over the entire course the workload was healthy. If you can get in to the class, you absolutely should take it! It's a great opportunity to reflect on leadership on a theoretical and also personal level. Moreover, you learn a lot about the Obama presidency and the quality of guest speakers is out of this world. Almost every class reminded me of how lucky I am to be at Yale...",
    "This was an interesting class, but much more of a discussion of what it takes to get a leadership position and rally people behind you than the duties of a leader when both are important aspects. Weekly blog posts can get annoying especially because they are due Sunday at noon, but the work is manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class to somebody who wants to confront the difficult questions to presidential leadership and who wants it to be addressed in a personal way. I enjoyed this class very much.",
    "This was a fantastic course and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone, whether interested in politics or not.",
    "This was a fantastic class: 1\/2 leadership-practicum and 1\/2 exploration of the Obama White House's first term. John Paul and Madhuri were great teachers: organized, caring, intelligent, and extremely dedicated. Both seem genuinely interested more in being mentors\/guides to their students' lives and careers than in being simply instructors. John Paul is a veteran leadership professor, and Madhuri was (for a long time) a close aide to now-President Obama, so she knows him as a man and leader extremely well. There was also a series of distinguished guests from the Obama White House brought to the second half of the class, and these guests of course had wise and insightful things to add. The readings were interesting, as well as manageable in length. The course will help you develop a personal leadership philosophy, and then will explore President Obama's administration and travails as a case study in leadership. 7 pm classesalong with all of the visiting political practitioners, the unique assignment structure, incredible well-chosen classmates, popular press readings, etc.really gave this seminar a unique and somewhat unacademic tone.",
    "This class was a thorough examination of leadership, especially in the context of political leadership. It combined an academic look at political leadership (through primary texts - Adam Smith, Jefferson, Hobbes, etc), with a case study of President Obama's leadership trajectory\/style, through the lens of people who have worked with the President over the course of his career. I hope this college seminar is offered again, and if it is, do everything you can to take it! It is absolutely sensational, and I feel very to take it! It was certainly a lot of work - lots of writing and reading each week with two essay exams (take home), but it was WELL worth it. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale!"
