   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a lot of reading, but an amazing seminar course where you get to discuss your ideas and have your opinion voiced in the class.I would absolutely recommend it to another student.",
    "It's a survey course of tragic texts from Ancient Greece to very nearly the present day. It's a great course if you want to read a lot in the tragic genre and really get an understand of how it changes over time. There isn't much writing (just four 4-5 page essays, spaced out through the semester) or an over-whelming amount of reading. Keep in mind, however, I did take the epics course last Spring, so maybe my idea of \"a lot\" of reading is skewed. Definitely take the course if you want a writing credit that isn't mind-numbing or research intensive.",
    "This was BY FAR my favorite class this semester. It is a general survey of Tragedy from The Iliad up until the modern tragedies. We read 22 texts, so it is a pretty intense reading course, but I feel like it introduced me to such a great range of texts that it never read repetitive or laborious. I feel so much more intelligent and educated after taking this class, and I feel like it has been a great equalizer. Coming from a high school where the most advanced text we read was probably Jane Eyre or Othello, delving straight into these advanced texts was a challenge, but I felt adequately guided and my confidence has soared since being in this class. YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO TAKE THIS COURSE WITH MURRAY BIGGS. He made every single class enjoyable and informative. His intelligence can be intimidating, but he is so knowledgable and really helpful. He gave back each of our papers in one-on-one sessions, and consequently I feel like my writing has improved (even if my grade stayed pretty steady.) I will be scouring the bluebook each semester to find more of his classes! Overall, this course is hard, but definitely worth your while. If you're willing to do the reading, this class should definitely be at the top of your list!",
    "Take this class if you like reading.",
    "English 129 is a survey course of important tragedies that laid a foundation for and formed the European literature tradition. We went through four units, writing a short 4-5 page paper for each: The Iliad, Greek tragedies, Shakespeare, and modern tragedies. All of the works we read were plays, besides the Iliad, sothey were relatively quick reads, which was fair considering the number of works we read over the semester. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Anybody interested in literature or European culture could benefit from a familiarity with these texts, and they are exciting to read. The workload is not light, but it is very much worth it. I would take this class all over again!",
    "I would definitely recommend English 129 to a student who is interested in the European interpretation of life and knowledge, as this class spans thousands of years of European expression and covers all of the major \"bases\" in tragedy (Homer, ancient athenian plays, Shakespeare, 20th century, etc...).",
    "I recommend it to anyone who likes reading. In summation, it's a great literature based course that has you reading a lot, thinking critically about some really fascinating material, getting to discuss it with people who find it just as interesting as you do. Everyone should take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is an overview of the Western canon through the lens of tragedy.",
    "It's a lot of reading, but the subject matter is very interesting; would highly recommend.",
    "This class with Biggs teaching it was the most entertaining and revealing English class I've ever taken."
