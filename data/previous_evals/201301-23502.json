    "I would definitely recommend this course--it was one of the most helpful courses I've taken at Yale, in terms of courses that changed how I listen to music.",
    "It's a Schenker course that relies on Cadwallader\/Gagne",
    "MUSI 549 is an introduction to Schenkerian Analysis. It is a chance to become familiar with the viewpoints of a multi-level structural analysis of tonal music, and understand the principles behind the reading and creation of Schenker graphs. I would recommend this class - though check class size before enrolling - especially if the concepts are unfamiliar to you. However, Dr. Poudrier is great about giving individual attention to students that need it."
