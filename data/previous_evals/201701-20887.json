   "comments": [
    "Obviously your experience in this class is decided by your advisor and as such the strengths and weaknesses of this course as I experienced it are different from those of this class under other advisors. I enjoyed the community surrounding the MV lab, my friendships with the other undergrads, grad students, and Madhu, as well as the autonomy to conduct my own project. This course was a really great experience.",
    "I think it's great that these courses exist. I have learned more through my research project than I did in a lot of classes.",
    "This is a great excuse to dive deep into an independent project. I sincerely hope that Yale keeps this course as it is.",
    "Great course. I was free to do my project and I was able to come up with a plan and execute. I should say I can see how this course may be disappointing if you don't have a project in mind, but if you do, then it is heaven.",
    "Both my advisor and Prof. Bennett were helpful in helping me do well on my project. I really enjoyed doing research!"

   "comments": [
    "If you are an independent learner who wants access to a brilliant professor and knowledgable grad students, come take this course with Professor Venkadesan. I learned so much working with Professor Venkadesan over the past two years and would highly recommend this experience to anyone interested in conducting research and applying classroom learning to a rich intellectual problem.",
    "If you have a clear project in mind, yes. If not, this is not for you.",
    "Yes! This course allows you to do carry-on an independent project (which can be a research project with an advisor). You learn how to set your own timeline, reach out to others for help, and give presentations.",
    "474 really just depends on your advisor and specific project, so make sure that you plan to work on something with a fairly clear goal, otherwise you'll feel pretty lost. It's nice that 474 doesn't have as many milestones as 472, which sometimes got in the way of actually working on your project\/research, but make sure to keep track of everything you're doing anyway so you're not caught flat-footed at the end of the semester."
