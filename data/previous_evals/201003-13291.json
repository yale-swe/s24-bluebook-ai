   "comments": [
    "Yes, great class to learn about math",
    "Yeah- pretty light workload and not too taxing.",
    "Only if you have a burning love of history of math...I thought I did but my flame has been dampened a little since this class",
    "I would recommend this class if you're willing to push yourself to do the reading and have good discussions. Professor Summers is one of the smartest people living and contributes massive amounts to every discussion, but there are lulls in the discussion sometimes that necessitate students stepping up. Still, it's a very interesting class, especially if you're a math-inclined person. Especially math- or science-inclined people should also note that non-QR people in the class frequently say double- or triple-take-worthy quotables reflecting a strange understanding of real-world phenomena.",
    "I would recommend it... but tentatively. Shop it and see if you like bill summers as a teacher cause his style of seminars is kind of different",
    "This course is a great opportunity to read the original words of some of history\u0092s greatest mathematicians. If you\u0092re interested in mathematics and\/or philosophy, the syllabus is reason enough to take the class. The workload is very light, however (a final paper and presentation), so you need to be self-motivated to get a lot out of the readings. I would recommend this course to anyone who\u0092s curious to know how math has evolved from Euclid up through modern computer science.",
    "Not really, unless you have a paper topic in mind already.",
    "I definitely would if you are interested in philosophy, history of science or intellectual history."
