    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "It's a course that combines an overview of research methods with the preparation of a research proposal. In a perfect world, a student might cover these over two semesters, giving more time to think and discuss research methods and design. That would also allow for more time to prepare the proposal, which felt rushed, but maybe that is necessary.",
    "Very useful for all pragmatic purposes, provides excellent skill-sets for proposal writing. I would recommend to anyone who is shaky and uncertain about grant-writing."

   "comments": [
    "The class was fantastic in helping me think through my dissertation project--how it will be designed, what are the intellectual merits, its broader impacts, what literatures it will contribute to, and more.",
    "Absolutely! It played a critical role in shaping my research prospectus and in that sense, it was a complete success.",
    "It helped me get an excellent sense of the pragmatics of getting funding, about things that we usually take for granted -- important essentials that no one really talks about."
