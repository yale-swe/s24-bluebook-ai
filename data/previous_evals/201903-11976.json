   "comments": [
    "This course challenged my perspectives and gave me a whole new view on art and its social impact. I learned about so many different works of art from around the world and was challenged to create powerful and moving art myself too.",
    "This course was a transformative exploration into different modes of artistic creation. An excellent intersection of discussing syllabus materials and on-your-feet exercises\/workshops. By the end of the semester I felt not only that I have a stronger sense of whose shoulders I stand on when I say I want to create theater that signifies politically, but also a toolkit of how to do that. Eryn is a wonderful mentor and friend. I could not recommend this course more, for anyone, but particularly for artists interested in strengthening their knowledge of\/skills in socio-political creation.",
    "We were exposed to a wide variety of works in various genres and mediums by contemporary artists relating to sociopolitical questions. We used these readings\/viewings as grounding to embark on our own creative practice. We were encouraged to take risks and step outside of our own comfort zones as artists.",
    "Something deep and incredibly meaningful changed in me because of this course. This was not just academic learning, this was life learning. I felt awakened to the beauty and joy of life, I felt more aware of and appreciative of my body, I felt so much more confident and expressive and myself. I have never had an academic experience as transformative as this class. The best part was, no academic rigor was sacrificed. I felt incredibly engaged in our small (5 person) discussions on works of art and literature representing trauma and deep emotions. I learned so much more about historical traumas like the Holocaust and Apartheid and the ways in which art has represented them. I now know much better how to close-read dance and theater, how to create works of art (!!) (something totally new for me!). I feel empowered and emboldened to keep doing this sort of work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the works we covered on the syllabus and Eryn's incredibly engaging teaching style. Weaknesses: It did feel like a lot of homework some weeks, but that was usually due to many small assignments building up and seeming daunting. It was always manageable in the end.",
    "My only complaint with this course was that three hours can be a long time. It often didn't feel that bad, because the first half would be discussion-based and the second half more creative\/workshop-style, but sometimes the discussion ran long (good! there was lots to say) but I would find myself exhausted before long.",
    "One great strength of this course is its syllabus, a truly interdisciplinarybut never unfocusedexploration of the intersection of the personal, the political, and the artistic. We read graphic novels, watched films and dance pieces, read plays, visited the YUAG, and it seemed like the intellectual\/artistic thread from one week to the next was continuous.The level of personal attention we received in our small class was also a definite strength. There were no glaring weaknesses to the coursesometimes our sessions felt slightly rushed when we had a lot of material to cover, even in the 3-hour blended discussion\/creative format. But the class did not feel overstuffed.",
    "Strengths: an enormous geographical variety of works on the syllabus, we were time-traveling, we were traveling through the perspectives of many different types of people all over the world. Also Eryn's loving attention to the class was a huge strength. I loved the structure: 1.5 hrs of discussion and 1.5 hrs of movement. I loved our interdisciplinary work, engaging with many types of art and literature. I also loved using the women's table and the YUAG! Improvements: really struggling to think here. Nothing is jumping to mind. Wow. Nothing."

   "comments": [
    "If you want (or need) to leave your comfort zone, take this course! It will engage you and challenge you all while turning you into a change maker and powerful artist. If you're used to more conventional theater studies\/ art classes, you could probably use a venture outside of your bubble and this is exactly the class to do that with. It's super quirky but that's what you love about it.",
    "Highly highly recommend. For anyone interested in the intersection of social change and artistic creation. The course has transformed the way I view myself as an artist and maker in the world. Take it!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in performance, in politics, in art or imagination. Having experience in performance is not necessary to succeed in this classsome of the students were THST majors and some did not have a performance background. This is the class to take if you want to make mind-blowing art! This is a class where we actually DID IT rather than just talking about it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY MUST TAKE!! No matter what subject matter another student interested in. This has been the best course I have taken in my entire life. I do not say that lightly! I truly mean that. This was a personal as well as intellectual growth class. We set goals and look back at them often, we get incredibly individualized feedback and attention, we explore and play and push boundaries. I loved finding a new, more artistic side of myself in this class. I cannot recommend it enough."
