   "comments": [
    "I would try to take this class with a professor and not a postdoc.",
    "Don't take with this professor, at least until he has a few more years of experience. He went way too fast at the beginning and so people were lost from the start, and didn't really slow down at all until late in the semester. He never paused to make sure everyone was following him, and would skip steps on his work on the board, so it was impossible to understand what was going on. And the homework was absurdly long. And he told us he was annoyed by how many people did above average on the first midterm, so he purposefully made the second one even harder.. There's just no reason for that. Terrible experience. You most likely have to take this class, so take it with someone else.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE, but make sure you take it with at least one friend. Try to form a study group. Definitely do the readings (they're not long anyway). Go to the problem set review sessions. Give yourself 5+ hours for each problem set. All that being said, this class is great in how it relates to a surprisingly large amount of things in real life. I'm not sure why, but this course made me like math again.",
    "Terrible class. Absolutely miserable. Please avoid taking it unless you really, really need to. I don't feel like I learned any math this semester; I just learned a bunch of little tricks to solve differential equations, but there's so many tiny details to remember, it's unlikely this class will be of much use to me in the future. Oh well. It was required.",
    "I recommend taking this course, if you're a science or engineering major - differential equations are everywhere and this course teaches you a lot.",
    "The problem sets are brutally long (often taking up to 10 hours) and are often tedious. However, the material learned in this class will be very applicable for most of the people who take it. The tests ranged from very straight forward to extremely difficult. The only way I was able to get through this class was by going to the weekly review sessions held by the TA (Matt). If Matt is still TA'ing the course make sure you go. He does an incredible job summarizing the important parts of lecture and goes over example problems that are pertinent to the homework and tests. He explains things very clearly, and most of what I learned in this class was from him. Only take this class if you have to because it is a huge time commitment, but if you do have to, you will come away having learned a lot.",
    "It's a hard class, no doubt. The psets are very confusing sometimes and take very many hours. The material is confusing when it's first presented, and definitely gets harder as the semester goes on. Take it if you have to, but be prepared to put in a lot of extra work to teach the material to yourself. Dobbins wasn't a very good or clear lecturer, and lectures weren't very helpful. Definitely go to the review sessions with Matt, he's incredible. They are what will get you through this class.",
    "If you need it, this evaluation won't change that fact, but you should know what you're getting into if you take it with Dobbins. He is clearly a new teacher with little teaching experience. Lectures are dry and usually delivered to the blackboard, and unfortunately the book is at times lacking in examples that have any depth. Maybe lectures would have been worth my time if I had been able to stay awake. Problem sets are tedious, not taken out of the book so there's no getting out, not refreshingly challenging, sometimes including way too much pointless algebra. Hard problems too hard, easy problems too much meaningless work. First exam was fine, but teacher probably thought it was too easy because the next exams were ridiculously long, with very, very few people finishing early, even after extra time was added. It should not be a challenging subject, but the way this course is taught makes it a chore at best, if not a painful and difficult class. Can't tell you what the curve is like because he's never told us, but averages on the exams are usually in the 70s and I never saw very many \"100\"s on the tops of psets.",
    "ENAS 194 is an overview of ordinary and partial differential equations, with some time spent on solving systems of equations. I really liked the subject, but the lectures were not the best and the problem sets were extremely time consuming. Going the TA office hours definitely helped.",
    "I actually am an MCDB major (not an engineer), so I was probably one of the few people who wasn't taking this class for a requirement. The class is a lot of work (expect to put in 10-15 hours per week on the problem sets), so I wouldn't take it along with too many other hard classes. That said, I did enjoy the material a lot and it's definitely very useful.",
    "If you don't need it, absolutely not. Especially if Dobbins is teaching it. Bad lectures and just plain evil problem sets and tests. If you need to know differential equations for the future, though, this class will make sure you know them. You just might end up teaching yourself or getting the TA to teach you most of it.",
    "The material is hard but not terrible, but the problem sets are unbelievable. Prepare to spend easily 10+ hours every week on frustratingly long problem set questions. If you have to take it, then do, but I wouldn't take this class for fun.",
    "The course was very difficult and time-consuming, especially if you don't come in with sufficient preparation. The professor tries his best and he really cares about his students, but the incredibly fast pace of the course is hard to overcome. I wouldn't recommend it, but it's required for engineering majors, so good luck with that.",
    "Great class for differential equations and good teacher. Difficult tests . Don't underestimate the time you will spend on problem sets.",
    "It was very rigorous and nervewrecking at times, but in the end it was all worth it. I would recommend it if you're an engineer only.",
    "DiffEQ was my least favorite class of all-time. Obviously don't take it unless you have to (but if you're reading this, you do). Avoid Dobbins (but apparently last semester's teacher was worse). He teaches terribly, and often comes off as condescending when you ask a question.This class made my life so stressful. Every week, I couldn't imagine how I'd be able to do that week's problem set. They took so many hours, and were so hard. I went to the residential college math\/physics tutors every week, and also went to the T.A.'s review sessions, but even after all of that, the homework was still challenging to figure out.Don't get me started on the tests.",
    "If you enjoy using math to model physical systems, you will enjoy ENAS 194. While the course required a fair bit of time and effort, I never felt that I was doing busywork. The problem sets took a lot of time, but I learned a lot from them and thus did not have to devote tons of time to studying for exams. The tests were quite fair and reasonable. I would recommend this over the math department's class on differential equations. The class was required for my major (as it is for most people in the class), but it was interesting and useful enough that I would recommend it to anyone who is good at math and enjoys scientific thinking.",
    "Unless you just really love math and are really interested in differential equations, only take this class if you have to. I'm an engineering major, and yet it was still the most intense class I have taken (yes, tougher than orgo). I dedicated a tremendous amount of time to it, yet I still don't feel like I did that well.I did get a lot out of this class, however, and that was some serious bonding with the students with whom I spent many a Wednesday night with working on the psets. You really don't know someone until you've seen them have a panic attack at 3 am with a half completed math pset destroying your sense of self worth and intelligence. There is no way I could have gotten through this class without the powerful support network I established with other students in it. By the end of the class, it was as if we were soldiers who went through a 4 month long war together. We were really close.Dobbins is a really caring teacher, who will do everything he can to help you, but he's new to teaching, and not that good at it.",
    "This course was brutal. The problem sets were really long and tedious, and working through them every week was horrible. I would not recommend this class to someone unless they really need to take it. It is a ridiculous amount of work. I had to switch to mechanical pencils because I couldn't work through one problem set with my friends without using 4 pencils.",
    "Differential equations doesn't have to be hard - you're basically learning the mathematical mechanics behind solving 10 or so types of diff eq's. This class, however, is difficult, especially with Dobbins. His problem sets are long (8+ hrs a week), so start early. The weekly all-nighters some of my friends pulled did not serve them well. If you go to the TA Matt's review sessions, you will learn almost as much as you do in class. If you're doing engineering though, you might as well take this class and learn the material well, it will benefit you later on.",
    "ENAS 194 is a challenging course. The information you learn is interesting and definitely useful, but make sure you're committed to the class on your way in. The problem sets are long and require a lot of work each week, but the TA review sessions are incredibly helpful and are there to make the course information more accessible to you. Even if you don't have to take it for your major, I would recommend shopping the class and seeing if you like the professor. The material is useful in all kinds of fields and the class offers a lot of practical diff eq applications.",
    "Dry, a lot of material, exams were difficult. Dobbins is a terrible lecturer. Problems sets took hours to complete. At the end you feel like you learned a lot, but the process is brutal. Go to Matt's study halls\/review session--they'll save you.",
    "Do NOT take this course unless you have to for your major. Which you probably do if you're even looking at it. That said, Professor Dobbins being new to teaching the course had a lot to do with my tough experience. His problem sets and exams were quite long and challenging. Overall this was the worst class I've taken at Yale thus far.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Dobbins tries really hard, but he isn't the greatest lecturer, so I found it very helpful to attend the weekly review sessions, which would clarify things we had gone over in class. The class is a lot of work- the problem sets were long and brutal. However, you will really learn how to solve and understand diffy q's, and the problem sets were challenging in a good way. A rewarding class, but be prepared to work.",
    "Enas 194 is a tough course, but you will learn a lot about the applications of differential equations. There is a weekly problem set that can take a long time and be quite a challenge, but the workload is manageable.",
    "Its a class that you have to take if you're trying to study engineering. It was the first time that Prof. Dobbins taught it - and thats why it was exceptionally difficult. The material is hard. Problem sets are meant to take more than 10 hours.",
    "I would not recommend ENAS 194. The class is quite frustrating with little payoff.",
    "Again, this isn't a course most people take for fun. If you're taking it, I assume most of you have to take it for your major. If you are taking it, I would recommend avoiding it with Dobbins. It's unnecessarily tough and too time intensive. Lectures were brutal most of the time.",
    "A lot of work, but the tools being taught are incredibly valuable for many scientific disciplines. It's hard to really recommend or not because most who take this class will need to take it for their major.",
    "Diff Eq is a rigorous class, so stay focused throughout the semester. I am not sure if Dobbins is the best person to take it with either.The material comes by fast and the psets are harded than class material, so make sure you work with friends, get extra help from tutors, read on your own,etc. Don't be scared of the class either -- the most important part is to just keep up with the material, as it is very easy to fall behind as the semester progresses. Good luck!",
    "Check who's teaching it. I would not recommend it with Dobbins, unless Matt is the TA."
