    "I did absolutely 0 of the readings, and I did fine in the class. There are only 3 assignments (2 tests and a paper), each worth 33% of your grade, so if you just buckle down, you can do well in the class.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in Jewish history and would like to gain a clearer picture of the foundations and evolution of Judaism.",
    "This class is pretty cool: I took it because I was interested in the topic, although I quickly fell off the bandwagon with doing the reading. The lecture is occasionally dry, just because it's so long, but go to lecture and take notes and you'll be fine. And bonus: Prof. Marcus is an incredibly sweet man, so try to meet with him outside of class! He'll give you good feedback for your paper, which is actually pretty fun to write.",
    "Jews. Diaspora. Narrative. Gutty. Fulfills a preindustrial and a LAAA, so I would go for it."
