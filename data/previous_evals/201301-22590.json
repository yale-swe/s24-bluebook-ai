    "Scaz is a great lecturer, and the material is really interesting. This class is highly recommended.",
    "Only if you're careful not to make the same mistake as me. I took this course because I really wanted to do the final project, so if anyone reading this is also considering 473 for the same reasons be warned. The project can be a wonderful and fulfilling experience but it can also be a complete disaster. My recommendation is start making friends with others in the class early and figure out who you work well with and who you'd want to work with for a long time. Also, make sure you are genuinely curious about your project question - if you were given an extra week of time would you pursue this project on your own? The project makes or breaks the class, so be cautious when approaching it. Talk to the TA and Scas on your own before making any commitments.",
    "Not a lot of work in the first half, but the final project gets very time-consuming. During the lectures, you learn a lot of interesting aspects (both theoretical and practical) of robotics. I only wish there were a Intelligent Robotics II, since my group only had a month to work on our project.",
    "Fantastic course with an incredible professor. Comprehensive overview of robotics and intelligent systems. Bridges the gap between computer science and psychology. Incredible professor. He is hands down the best professor in the entire computer science department--there is no comparison. Explains concepts fluidly and with ease. Cares about helping students truly understand the material, and sincerely wants to help students succeed. One of the best professors at Yale.",
    "If you find a great final project then this course has the potential to be one of the best in the CS department. The class is split in two: the first half is standard fare, with two problem sets and a midterm. The material focuses on different robot architectures. At first it seemed super technical and irrelevant to those not planning on building their own robot but after a while I became fascinated by the way architectural changes reflect changing conceptions of \"mind\" and \"intelligence.\" I would never have appreciated these changes if I didn't have a strong technical foundation. After spring break, you spend all of your time working on your final project. Scaz tends to suggest human-robotics interaction (HRI) projects. Many people were frustrated by this, since these projects have little to do with the rest of the course material. If this concerns you, relax. It takes a little more effort to brainstorm for non-HRI, techncially challenging project ideas, but in the end Scaz was really supportive and our efforts paid off... I had an amazing time building a head-mounted eye gaze tracking system. I highly recommend this course! I had a wonderful time.",
    "Don't take this if you've already done AI. The class is not a lot of work. And your final project will probably be some sort of Human Robot Interaction trial, so make sure you'e on board for that.",
    "This is a great course and a nice change from most of the intense CS electives. Scaz is a great lecturer and most lectures are actually quite interesting. Time commitment is not too bad until the final project which will pretty much occupy all of your time during the few weeks before finals.",
    "A great course which is unfortunately capped at 20 students. Apparently there is significant overlap with Scaz's other course, Artificial Intelligence, but you learn a lot about the historical trajectory of robotics. In theory, your grade is based around some homework assignments, a midterm, and a final project, but the final project is really the only thing that counts - invest yourself in it + impress Scaz and you will get an A.",
    "Interesting class - enjoyable lectures, fun project component to it.",
    "Yes I would totally recommend as long as you are interested in the topic.",
    "Take Robotics if you're into learning about how robotics systems are structured and how to use them for social research. Overall, a decent class with less workload. Better for Cognitive Science and Psychology than for Computer Science. Does not teach engineering robotics at all. The class mostly goes through robotic control systems and cognitive concepts (learning, decisions) at the start of the semester, going into more specific subtopics in the second part. ________________________________________________________________________ The coursework consists of two problem sets on different robotic control systems, a midterm, and a final project that's very open-ended. The final projects tend to use robotics to find out something about human-robot interactions for the most part. ________________________________________________________________________ Scas is a clear and interesting lecturer. The subject matter is also pretty naturally interesting, even to non-science majors who have some programming\/experiments experience. Outside of giving you a credit, it teaches you psychology\/cognitive science research techniques using robots as well as robot control system structures."
