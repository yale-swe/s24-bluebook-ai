    "It's a two hour seminar once a week pretty far up the hill, near Highland and Prospect at Calvin Hill Day Care. Then, you sign up for another two hour session each week to observe a classroom. Observations are very long and don't have to be two hours. Work is comprised of eight journals about your observations and a final paper about a specific child. Readings should be incorporated into the journals but are rarely discussed in class - instead, class is mostly observing at other sites in New Haven or guest lecturers coming in to talk about a particular topic among language, literacy, and play. At most, skim the readings.",
    "It's like PSYC 140 put to practice. I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in language development from a real-world perspective. The time spent with actual children learning about their behaviors is invaluable. The professors are also really nice. Beware--there is an extra commitment of two hours a week. But it's time well spent.",
    "Pretty much all of us in the course took it for the observation component. The workload is non-negligible but not too bad; eight 3-5 page journals (pretty quick, as they're mostly stream of consciousness), which in our year was cut to six journals, and a 10-15 page paper. I took it CR\/D\/F and so these were pretty easy. The class portion of things is fairly boring--nobody does any of the reading, and you don't have to--but the observation is fantastic. Take it to watch little kids at play for two hours a week. Also a fairly easy WR if you need one, although it's a hard course to get into if you're not a senior.",
    "This is a fantastic class to take if you love kids. Not only will you gain practical experience in a classroom but also a very firm theoretical foundation in child development.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it! It can be a bit of a pain getting to Calvin Hill early in the morning, but otherwise it's really enjoyable and the observation period in the classroom is fascinating and so much fun. It really provides the students with a quite unique opportunity, and a lot of insight into child development! And the chance to get out of the Yale bubble and spend time with children is really refreshing and wonderful.",
    "PSYC 128 revolves around the weekly observations at Calvin Hill Day Care. It's a good class; lectures can definitely drag on sometimes, but the teachers are both very nice and extremely passionate about their profession. The class entails three or four 5-7 page journal papers based on the weekly observations at the Kindergarten and a final 10-15 page paper on the child you pick to observe. The classisn't particularly challenging; the hardest part is the hike in order to get to class.",
    "If you can get in, and have any interest in children at all, definitely take this class. I cannot recommend it enough.",
    "If you are at all interested in childhood development then you should not leave Yale without taking this course.",
    "This course name says it all: we explore language, literacy, and play. You get to marvel at how children map out language and writing for themselves, and at the infinite imaginative bounds and physical and intellectual growth that takes place during play. There's a class and an observation at Calvin HIll. I would definitely recommend the course. It is very interesting information that you can apply towards your psychology knowledge, and also just use to reflect on your own childhood.",
    "yes. the workload is 2 hrs of observation a week, in addition to lecture once a week. if you can get in, make sure you try and catch the bus up because calvin hill is pretty far! write-ups of your observations and then a final paper is the majority of your work. the reading is kind of a lot but pretty light. Nancy and Carla may seem intimidating at first, they come across as scary strict ladies, but once you get to know them they are sweethearts and are really just 2 women who are really invested in their jobs. both are really nice, and i loved the class.",
    "I highly recommend this class. It's one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The observations are a blast, and it is not that much work."
