    "Ok, someone said this in the previous evaluations, but I skirted over it thinking it was just a silly comment, but I will repost it, and please please please take it into consideration ready? Here goes: NEVER TELL STEVEN ANYTHING PERSONAL ABOUT YOURSELF!!! IT WILL BE THE ONLY THING HE REMEMBERS ABOUT YOU AND THE ONLY THING YOU TALK ABOUT. NOT YOUR WORK, JUST THAT THING THAT HIS OLD LITTLE BRAIN GRASPED ONTO IN PASSING!!!Please follow this instruction to the letter, it may mean your sanity.",
    "Having come this far in the architecture major, you have to take it. That's about all I can say -- your individual experience will vary greatly depending on the project Steven and Tom pick as you competition to enter. Ideally, you'd want something that would require you to put together all the skills and design sense you've developed over the past three years, and apply them to the solution of a complicated architectural program, AND learn new skills of 3D rendering. Unfortunately, if your project is as off-beat, non-architectural or simply uninteresting it may be difficult for you to really see what you make as an appropriate senior project. This is compounded by Steven and Tom's lackadaisical -- and that's being charitable -- attitude towards the studio. Expect to have class canceled a handful of times, without explanation. Expect your TAs to have no clue about the syllabus, requirements for deliverables or the professors's vision. Expect Steven to perform ad-hoc desk crits en-masses for the whole studio in the seminar room, speaking generally to everyone all at once, and then leave. Expect to perhaps not have a project that would make sense in the context of your portfolio (i.e. make sure your previous work in Senior Fall and Junior Spring Studios is up-to-standard and can be shown to firms).That being said, the trip together is fun.",
    "I mean, no. The last two senior projects have been less than inspired. This was tough, the professors and TAs were absent. Don't expect desk crits from Steven, he won't show up to most classes. The trip, however, was the highlight of my Yale career, so that's awesome! Really, the MOST fun.",
    "It's a requirement. Pray that you get a better competition than we did. We definitely needed more guidance to approach a project that required us to incorporate principles from engineering and art, at an incredibly large scale too. I learned a lot from the final review that would have been useful to know earlier on in the semester. There just needs to be more planning and structure in this course."
