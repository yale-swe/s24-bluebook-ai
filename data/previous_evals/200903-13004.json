    "Russian is really fun. It's hard, that's for sure, but fun. You won't be terribly conversational by the end of the 1st semester, but it is a new alphabet and the grammar is quite complicated.",
    "Russian 110 was a good course that introduced some of the fundamentals of Russian, and worked on writing, speaking, and listening. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to begin learning the language.",
    "I would summarive Russian 110 03 as an excellent course for those who are new to the Russian language. It appropriately covers the fundamentals of the Russian language, and allows students to learn a lot of Russian in the course of the term. It challenging in a good way, and moves at a pace which is appropriately brisk. Students who are diligent in their attendance and disciplined in the completion of their homework will succeed in this course, especially with the support of those like Victoria Thorstensson. I highly recommend this course to other students because of the afformentioned reasons.",
