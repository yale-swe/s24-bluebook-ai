    "YES!",
    "DS philosophy spring semester is 10 times more complicated as DS philosophy fall semester, mostly due to the complex arguments posed by Berkeley (pronounced \"bark-li\"), who is conveniently the namesake of Berkeley College, and Kant, after whom no known Yale colleges or buildings are named. Surprisingly, the surname of Sterling, after whom an infinite amount of Yale buildings are named (taking 'infinite' in this sense as the third subset of the category of Quantity), does not appear on the DS Spring syllbus. Despite all this, Professor Sattler does do a very good job making sense of all this, as well as the befuddled arguments and relations of ideas that comprise your fledgling paper that you bring to her during Tuesday office hours.Seriously though, this class will open your mind.",
    "Philosophy is my least favorite of the DS sections, but I'm still glad I was in the class. It was great to finally be able to read and learn about what all the big names say and argue and think. Philosophy texts are in my opinion the most difficult to read and understand, but lecture and section are very helpful in that aspect. Sattler is a great professor. She was able to take all the big arguments of each of the texts and help us to break it down in section to understand each step of the proofs and see what each philosopher was arguing. She was also able to give a good overview of philosophy in general, sort of the big picture of what each philosopher was trying to do and how he fit into the context of his time, which aided in understanding difficult texts as well. She was also able to go beyond simply the text and answer other interesting questions that were more advanced. Very intelligent and very helpful professor.",
    "A comprehensive look into the foundations of Western Philosophy, focusing on student criticism and writing style. A great class whether you plan to continue the path of philosophy or not.",
    "DS Philosophy second semester, at least for me, is more interesting than it was in first semester. In class readings the works are more argument-based, at least more clearly as argument-based.",
    "I would definitely recommend DS to another student. Philosophy classes taught me to think more broadly and expanded my world view.",
    "It's like first semester, but there are more works and they're more interesting. If you liked first semester then keep with it, if not then you probably shouldn't."
