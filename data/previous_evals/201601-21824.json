   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't recommend this class just because it's kind of pointless. I never knew what was happening or why we were talking about the current topic. It feels structureless, and I don't see someone benefitting from the class.",
    "Don't take this class. Not worth the stress and potentially poor grade due to grading inconsistencies. Not an interesting class.",
    "Interesting topic with a lot of potential, but the class fell flat for me.",
    "Overall, the class was fine. Sometimes the lectures were boring but it was an easy class and there weren't that many assignments. There was also a take home final so if you're looking for an easy 5th class this would be a good one to take.",
    "I would say that LING 116 is a good introduction to linguistics and cognitive science. I would recommend it to other students who were looking to try something that was not in their intended major.",
    "Do take the class! No matter if you are in the field or looking for a dist cred, this class is bound to be fun and very inspiring. The class has a very manageable workload and contents are fun to learn. The assignments were so much more fun than I thought (no spoilers!) haha",
    "LING 116 is a class for a very specific kind of person. If you are interested in linguistics, which is a somewhat arcane field that relies a lot on terminology that does not necessarily provide clear answers to the questions it poses because of its exploratory nature, then this might be the class for you. If not, I would advise taking something else.",
    "CGSC 216 is definitely more of a linguistics class than a cognitive science class, so it may be worth shopping to determine whether or not you find it interesting. That having been said, I found the course quite interesting. CGSC 216 is not particularly difficult on the whole, but the class is likely more rewarding with additional effort. In any case, the professor and the TFs are skilled and the material is diverse and clever, so it is definitely worth looking into this course.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Extremely unorganized. It was always hard to know what the main points of each lecture were. Tests were very challenging. I personally enjoyed the more abstract, philosophical portions of the class, but unfortunately the class is geared more towards how we learn the nuts and bolts of language (syntax, phonology, etc). So if that's your gig, take the class. If not, find another linguistics class.",
    "I would not recommend this course as an introductory linguistics or cognitive science course. There are just many better ways to learn about what linguistics is, and the cognitive portion was not very enlightening at all.",
    "Its a good introduction to linguistics if you're not planning on a linguistics major. Otherwise you should probably just start with the introductory courses for the major.",
    "Terrible class, terribly taught, total disappointment. For you own sake, do not even think of taking this class.",
    "Interesting topics but tedious class.",
    "I would recommend this class because it was interesting and I learned a lot.",
    "This was a really interesting class for anyone interested in linguistics or cognitive science. You cover a lot of different topics and approaches to the question of how language works in the mind. All the reading is the original papers, and there are four homework assignment, a midterm, and a take-home final.",
    "Great class with a lot of exposure to linguistics, but a rather last-minute teaching squad that never really seems to have itself completely together. I enjoyed the class, but that was more on pure enthusiasm for linguistics - others when need energizing teachers and classroom discussion might want to look elsewhere, or start the class Credit-D before switching."
