We analyzed different types of papers (from academic to policy reports), and discussed them. I developed analysis skills and expanded my knowledge on development theory, gender-related issues, and cases around the world."

They bring different perspectives to class discussions and that was very interesting for me. However, I would have liked to have different activities during the sessions because the structure of the class was often the same. I remembered the class when we had a guest speaker who share her experience and the work she is doing with us. I really enjoyed this session. Also, I would have liked to learn more about the experience of the professors as they are doing interesting research and work."

    "Yes! but I highly recommend to taken when students have a background on social sciences or have taken seminar courses before. For me the course was very challenging as it was the first time I was exposed to readings and terminology on anthropology as well as to seminar-style discussions. I took a lot from the course, I really enjoyed learning from the other students, but I barely participated as I did not feel at the same level of them."
