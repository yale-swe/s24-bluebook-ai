    "Love how the Professor integrates theory with practice - his own research and other examples. My favourite class this semester!",
    "One of the best organized classes I have taken at FES. This class is so well run, taught with highly integrated original content covering a wide range of topics. Really excellent class and I would recommend it to all masters students regardless of interest b\/c of its applicability across disciplines (energy, terrestrial studies, climate).",
    "Class textbook wasn't great but did the job. Some articles felt esoteric but I suppose that was intended to introduce students to a range of topics.",
    "Interested in climate change, policy and communication. Was an excellent overview of atmospheric science as well as climate change.",
    "One of the best FES classes !!",

    "Good slides with graphs and illustrations to convey scientific concepts.Xuhui's an expert and was very good at answering random questions out of left field.",
    "Fascinating, complex, and crucial subject matter brought down to a level where a beginner with a basic understanding of physics and chemistry can understand it. Must take course for FESers. Seriously.",

   "comments": [
    "The student led discussions turned into presentations about the paper instead of class discussions, which made it very easy not to do the reading.",
    "The group project presentation was great but the associated paper was too long and rather superfluous. I'd recommend cutting out the paper and replacing it with a mandatory group discussion with the professor about the topic. It would be nice to have a small group setting with the professor to discuss topics that we will be present and receive some feedback.",
    "Overall, was pretty good, but maybe a bit more guidance on how to do difficult questions in the problem sets. This was not a big problem though.",
    "The TA was not very helpful. Xin's English could use some work, but far more distressing was that she didn't seem to be able to explain some of the basic concepts in the course--in particular, during the review sessions.",
    "Final projects could be done earlier in the term to avoid the end of term crunch."

    "The TA was helpful when asked, though only had office hours on one day, so it was hard to just drop in and get basic help if you didn't have a specific question.",
    "The TA was very responsive to questions\/concerns of the students. Both with answering questions throughout the year via email or office hours as well as helping to prepare the class for the exams, the TA was exceptional. Her knowledge and availability, in her addition to her willingness to aid students was significant contributions to my performance in the course.",
    "The instructor was always available by email, and I have no complaints there. The TA was also available, but much less helpful than she could have been because she did not seem to understand the material very well herself.",
    "Great whenever needed",
    "Excellent TA. Very helpful and promt."

However, the course was very logically structured and Prof. Lee's lecture was, in the end, incredibly helpful and really doesn't need much improvement. I would urge students to sit through a class or two before deciding that Prof. Lee's accent will be too distracting--in the end, it won't be too distracting, and the quality of the class and Prof. Lee's understanding of and ability to explain the material makes the class one that is well worth sitting through.",

    "disadvantages are that it takes more time to work on a group project like this because of the meetings needed to figure out how to divy up work and where the project is heading. The upshot is that we learn from one another and get to see how other people approach the same problem",
    "Advantages were the chance to discuss the topics discussed in class further, in a small setting. Disadvantage was that the group paper did not add much learning value.",
    "Group project ran smoothly. Good to have a sense of a new topic I'd never thought about, without having to write my own 20 page paper by myself.",
    "The main advantage was having others to share the research load on our final research project. Disadvantages were minimal with my particular group because we worked well together, but they could have been greater since the object was to write a group paper, which can be a real hassle.",

    "Go to all the lectures and take good notes in the powerpoint slides.",
    "Sit up close to the front so that you can hear and better understand Prof. Lee. There is no real need to do the readings before class because Prof. Lee will basically just cover what was in the reading (with a few minor exceptions). The readings are useful for going back after class if you missed something or forgot how a particular concept worked.",
    "Take good notes",
    "Great survey course with nice blend of practical\/applied blended with academic readings"
