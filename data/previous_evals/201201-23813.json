    "Global Health Seminar provides a variety of lectures on important global health issues, but the information is presented in a manner that makes it challenging for students to engage with the information being given. The lectures are not strung together in a meaningful order, so it is hard to walk away from the course with a new perspective on global health. The information being presented is important and a good foundation for understanding public health, but it could be presented in a more thoughtful way.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is its ability to draw a wide range of experts from different backgrounds and specialities to describe current issues in Global Health. Many of the speakers were incredible, although the ones that impacted me most were Stephen Lewis and Albert Ko. The course may be improved by hosting discussion sections before the presentations to discuss the readings and prepare to ask in-depth questions to presenters.",
    "Get rid of the module. Have the speakers every other week.",
    "I really enjoyed the speaker series that was a part of this course, however I don't think that the module fits very well into this type of non-credit seminar class. It seemed that most students - myself included - were not able to dedicate enough time and energy to the module to make it a worthwhile learning experience because we were balancing our time with other classes for credit and jobs, etc. I would recommend that the GH Seminar just be a speaker series in the future. The types of projects that the modules covered could be a part of another optional class for credit.",
    "It tries to appeal to everyone and by doing so appeals overall to no one. There are some topics that people are interested in and some that people are not interested in.The module is a great idea but could be done better. This semester the module was also at least better done than the previous semester. When I've attended 0 credit seminars for my previous degree, there were just speakers you listened to and asked questions. A seminar with both speakers and module portion (which requires more work even though it is stated that it doesn't) is just more work than necessary.In terms of the presentation, people should be kept on track and not go much over their 10 minute allotted time.Speakers should only have 1 hour to speak and then a half hour for dinner since the seminar is after business hours.Also having required readings is not useful if you aren't going to discuss them as a part of the speaker\/module.",
    "It introduces you to the different paths available to somebody wanting to work in global health.",
    "Great speakers, excellent subject matter and useful topics covered. Module was very well executed and gave us the opportunity to have small group discussions with experts in the field of women's health\/rights.Weaknesses: Not much chance to get to hear about other student's experiences abroad and share those in a discussion-type setting. A smaller class size would be more conducive to informative class discussions.",
    "I really enjoyed the GH seminar and learned a lot from the various speakers.",
    "Strengths:The seminars were really interesting. I also liked the opportunity to meet the speakers in information sessions. Some of the presentations provided a great overview of a topic. The seminar helped to understand what global health encompasses.Weaknesses:I did't think the seminar was organized in a logical order. It could have been better to have each presentation build on or at least relate to the other from the week before.",
    "Needs substantial work. Does not provide a good overview of global health. Seems disjointed, little opportunity for feedback or participation.",
    "excellent."

He was easily approachable and a great mentor for many of the students in the class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0Michael Skonieczny was an excellent moderator, but a rather peripheral figure to the guest speakers and assistants who helped coordinate the modules. To be honest, I can say very little of Skonieczny as a professor.",
    "Instructor: Michael Skonieczny \u00a0I didn't have much interaction but I did enjoy the speakers he brought in this semester.",
