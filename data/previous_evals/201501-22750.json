    "Pretty interesting! A bit more of a survey than I expected -- I wished we'd gone into more detail in some areas, but we did cover a lot of different aspects of Sociology. Workload was very manageable: readings were interesting, papers were fun to write and graded fairly, and the final was incredibly easy. Overall, very enjoyable -- a worthwhile introduction to a new field!",
    "Don't take this class if you're not willing to commit to doing all of the readings. He's really into calling on everyone in the class to contribute to the discussion. Really interesting topic!",
    "Yes. \"The beef, by the way, was quite good.\"",
    "This class is awesome! Smith is a great professor and it's really fun to be in his class. The material is really fascinating. Smith does cold call in class but the readings are manageable most weeks and the other work is minimal. A couple of shorter papers and you get to design them based on the class material, they were really fun to write.",
    "A great class in some ways but frustrating in others. The syllabus offers a wide variety of perspectives on an oft-neglected field: you might hate some of the readings and love others, but the overall story they tell is pretty interesting. Most of your grade is based on two independent research projects. These are a great opportunity to conduct your own fieldwork and delve more deeply into the literature on a subject you care about, and end up being a ton of fun. Unfortunately, seminar discussions can be lackluster. Professor Smith himself is lively and entertaining, and really interesting if you press him, but he mostly steers the conversation towards surface-level takeaways. I think this was a 5th class for many people in my section, because there was a distinct lack of enthusiasm. That said, the time each week seemed to go by pretty quickly, and they organized some cool in-class activities (ie deconstructing exhibits at the Peabody, studying signage in Rosenkranz, etc)."
