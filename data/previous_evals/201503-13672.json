    "A well organized introduction to life as a doctoral student in the program. It was nice to get to know my fellow cohort as well as the framework for being a successful student.",
    "I loved hearing Karen's strategies for success",
    "The best aspect of this course was being able to have discussions with a number of experienced scientists (through weekly visitors), and to simply chat as a group about a number of topics associated with doctoral programs, higher education, the fate of the university system, teaching in academia, publication strategies, etc. Having a dedicated space to talk about these things helped to mature students' perceptions of science and provided some guidance as we continued to develop our own skill sets. Also, I particularly enjoyed discussing transformative research and being strategic as one plans their short- and long-term research programs.",
    "The readings on academic writing were really useful, as was the section of the class devoted to speaking style\/describing our research\/etc.",
    "The information provided about PhD and academic career, as well as the chance to get to know my cohort better are very valuable to me."

   "comments": [
    "I would expand this course to more than just the first semester for phd students. Perhaps there could be a course that meets every other week during the spring semester.",
    "I thought it was a well developed class.",
    "I did not enjoy the ethics section of the course but understand it is a degree requirement",
    "This course involves a module on science communication. While I fully believe that discussing the challenges of communicating science is important, I feel as though this portion of the course could benefit from some adjustments. In general, practicing public speaking, mock interviews, audio recordings, etc. can be useful for analyzing one's own idiosyncrasies as they discuss their research. However, I couldn't help but feel that some of the exercises we did at home or in class were overly contrived and served more as an expose of my introversion than anything else. In real-world situations I find that I both prepare extensively and am motivated to communicate my science since I have made the choice to do so. When this type of activity is prescribed it becomes artificial, which in turn makes me question whether the communication qualities we observe during such exercises are really representative of an individual's communication style at all. I think it could be just as useful, if not more useful, to spend time analyzing audio clips, videos, and interviews of a number of people outside the class (those in public office, sports players, famous scientists), helping to drive home the important take-aways without the discomfort that comes with being ill-prepared.",
    "Did not find the discussions with the seminar speaker that helpful. Some were better than others, but definitely worth capping the time spent with the guests because a few went long and ate into time that could have been spent on more useful information...",
    "It would be easier if we can get a more flexible final assignment since everyone has their own pace on research progress."

    "This course is required so you will be taking it. Generally, I would say that I came into the course with some skepticism about its utility but was pleasantly surprised by the material. We had a lot of really interesting discussions and it was quite valuable to hear from a wide range of scientists about their career trajectories and what advice they would offer to early phd students. My advice is to new students is to be open about course (if you have the same skepticism that I initially had), and to use the course to connect with your cohort, since you will never again have a course with all of them. In fact, you may never have a course with any of them again.",
