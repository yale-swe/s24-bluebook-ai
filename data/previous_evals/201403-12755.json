   "comments": [
    "The course is challenging if you don't have previous experience with proofs. In my opinion, the book used poorly written, so it almost useless, especially when the professor introduces something you don't understand.",
    "MATH 270 is a math class in which you cast doubt on what you have been taking for granted since you started arithmetic. Workload is not heavy and Pro. Zuckerman is a great guy. I would recommend this course to any of you regardless of your major.",
    "This is an introduction to Set Theory, and a completely new way to think about very basic things you use everywhere else in math. Professor Zuckerman is great and makes the class really cool. Not too much work, but very eye-opening. I would highly recommend this course to anybody who's interested!",
    "Absolutely. If you're interested in proof-based mathematics, definitely take this. There are no computations, only proofs. I definitely write much better essays now because my proof-writing has improved!",
    "Be as anal retentive about your definitions and responses as possible. A single word can completely change a definition, but as a way of building up mathematics it is a fascinating point of view.",
    "Be careful. This class looks incredibly easy during shopping period but gets much harder. I personally wouldn't recommend it for the material. Even though set theory is an important area, the teaching and textbook are dry, dry, dry, and the way the class is now, it's super unintuitive and just not that interesting if you don't enjoy endless definitions--it never clicked for me, nor struck me as beautiful. (Also, in case you're thinking about taking it just for the QR credit: um, no; Set Theory is about three times as much work as Math 120, so while it's reasonable by math standards it's no gut.) If you end up taking it: go to lecture, because Zuckerman covers and tests material that isn't in the textbook. For the midterms, make sure you have all of the definitions memorized verbatim.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. It's a great introduction to proof-writing, and covers concepts that are very different from the material you'll learn in other math courses at Yale. Prof. Zuckerman was great. He explained every concept very clearly and methodically, and always made sure that the class was following lectures before moving on to the next topic. His review sessions were also very long and thorough. Overall, I probably enjoyed the class as much as I did because he was teaching it. (He was also very funny.)",
    "I would recommend it. Interesting if you're not a math major, relatively easy if you are. Increased my proof writing skills drastically, as the grading is rigorous and demands clarity. there isn't a lot of work and you'll learn how things you just take for granted such as addition or functions or natural numbers are actually more complicated than you thought. you'll learn how to treat these subjects rigorously and look at them in a different way.",
    "Good course on introductory set theory with a focus on proofs. Covers a decent amount of material and good pacing. Professor Zuckerman was very good at explaining difficult mathematical concepts and answering questions from the class."
