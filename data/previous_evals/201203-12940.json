   "comments": [
    "Yes, you get to build stuff and have a real engineering experience. It's a HUGE weakness of Yale engineering and needs to be remedied. It's sad that Yale engineering prides itself on not being a\"trade school\" but some engineers literally cannot build things or know how things work.",
    "This class varies significantly with the teacher. However, ABET MechEs are required to take it. Therefore, I hope, for everyone's sake that someone new teaches it next year. If Professor Foley is once again asked to teach the course be prepared to do a TON of paperwork and to dedicate all your time to this class. Building and designing an actual product is really fun, but documenting all of your progress is really time consuming. Honestly, the best way to approach this class is to come in knowing what group of people you want to work with (usually a team of 4) and what project you guys want to tackle. Wasting time in the first couple of weeks deciding on a project will come back to bite you at the end of the semester. So, do yourself a favor and get a head start- it will make your whole semester smoother.",
    "In the end I think it is worth it. But be prepared to pull one all-nighter a week for the weekly 20-page reports and several all-nighters in the last week as the manufacturing phase, which starts way to late, gets underway. The course was a disaster in terms of structure and student-teacher understanding, however, I think that the plan for next year--a mandatory, scheduled lab section--will help correct that issue.",
    "If you are a mechanical engineer, this is definitely a very fulfilling and challenging course. With that being said, it takes a very special kind of professor to make this class a positive experience, and I would be wary of how the course is going to be structured if you are someone who doesn't have to take it.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to to get your degree. The idea of creating a product might seem interesting, but it's not worth the effort. This class is a 40-hour work week job, except you're also taking 3 or 4 other classes at the same time, and it becomes unmanageable.",
    "You have to take it as an ABET. Group nature of class led to the stronger people pulling the weaker\/lazy with no way to motivate them. Make sure you pick a group you can work with. Get to know Nick Bernardo well - he is a great resource to have not only in fabrication but also in the design.",
    "If you don't take this class, don't call yourself an engineer. Don't make your B.S. degree into a load of BS by not taking this class. Hands-on design and building, teamwork, writing technical reports, bringing a project from concept to completion, it's all there. This is the only real engineering class at Yale. A piece of advice: keep up the pace all semester (it's manageable), or it will crush you in the end! It's more important to make decisions and move with them than sit around and look for the best solution, because the end of the semester will hit you faster than that golden bird you are hoping will fly through the window with your perfect solution."
