   "comments": [
    "A basic course in ear training and figured bass (for piano). If you have time, spend extra time outside of class and see if your instructor is willing to help you out (most are eager to see their students want to improve). It's definitely a fun course, and you'll get a lot out of it; the piano lab is tailored toward each student based on skill level, so don't be afraid if you haven't touched a piano in your life before.",
    "This class is so much fun! It pretty much involved doing dictations and sightsinging exercises for 50 minutes twice a week. But Moira made it so much fun! She's the nicest person ever, and she has a great sense of humor! This class involved so much laughing.",
    "The course is a useful--if rudimentary--place to build and practice aural skills. None of it is too difficult for someone who already has a background in music; it might be substantially more of a challenge for someone completely new to classical music or to performance. The course is meant to supplement other study within the music department, so I would advise taking it if it were to go along with other music coursework, but possibly not to take it just as an elective. For a student uninterested in music theory and history but hoping to advance as a performer, the opposite holds true: this course could be a good stand-alone course for training purposes and does not require previous knowledge of theory or prior exposure to any one genre. This is not a course I would recommend to every student I know, but I would definitely suggest it to anyone interested in developing musically.",
    "218 is a relatively easy class, and it teaches valuable skills. Take it.",
    "This class greatly helps you develop your aural skills by having you dictate chord progressions, melodies, and bass lines throughout the semester. However, if you have minimal experience in aural practices and singing, keep in mind this course moves very quickly and you will be playing catchup the entire time.",
    "Music 218 will improve your skills in sightsinging; harmonizing bass lines and playing chord progressions on piano (no matter your initial piano experience or skill level); and dictation of melodies, harmonies, and chord progression. I thought it was a very useful class that reinforced a number of skills that all good musicians should have. This class had a very light workload and was relatively straightforward, but I enjoyed it and thought it was a fun, relaxing addition to my day. In the end, I was proud of the skills I had developed in this class-- if you'rea musician or interested in the major, I'd recommend it, especially with Moira!"
