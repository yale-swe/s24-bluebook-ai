    "A fine class. You will learn a lot.",
    "Fantastic L2 experience with Mme. Sherak. She undoubtedly teaches the best section available...great class environment, relaxed and familial vibe, and she hammers home material without you even realizing you're learning so much so quickly. If you struggled in L1, there's no need to fear Sherak's L2 sectionyou'll get caught up and more. Perhaps even more importantly, she understands how stressful life as a Yale undergrad can be, and exhibits tremendous kindness in allowing an extra day for compositions and being a solid source of emotional support in general.",
    "Dislike french in action as a method of teaching. It's confusing and not very helpful especially for people who already speak multiple romance languages. It throws in a lot of obscure vocabulary and the tests become more about how much you remember from the story than how fluent your french is. I feel like the \"traditional\" language teaching methodology (learn grammar and vocab and THEN watch films and read books to learn idiomatic expressions) is a lot more effective. That said, the professor (Sherak) was the nicest person who was always there to help and encourage you. If you want to take this class, take it with her!",
    "I would recommend it! I find that the amount I enjoy my classroom experiences is determined by the professors that guide them (more than the material often), and Madama Sherak was a great experience.",
    "Yes - you'll learn an amazing amount of the language.",
    "French 120, like French 110, is a very difficult and time-consuming course, but it is also incredibly rewarding with the right professor and a great deal of focus. The course continues the French in Action videos, which grow progressively more ridiculous and require more and more patience to understand, but by the end of the course, I felt much more comfortable with the language and felt I had been exposed to many aspects of it that I never thought I would be studying at the end of a first year of it. I would recommend the course to a student willing to put in the time and effort that a course of this breadth and speed requires--it is definitely worth it.",
    "I would recommend the class and the instructor especially. However, under the best possible circumstances I would recommend that someone take a light load elsewhere and devote significant time and effort outside of class (drills and tutoring) if they wish to absorb and speak the language with lasting proficiency."
