    "I would recommend it. One research paper for the year (very comprehensive - about 20 pages). Every other week you give a short presentation on the research you're making towards the research paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone wishing to focus on one topic in science and learn about it in depth.",
    "Easy sc, just don't leave your final assignment for the last minute.",
    "Probably not. I mean, it's a light workload, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee you a good grade. Also, about half way through the semester, you start to wonder what your tuition money is going towards. Other science credits are a better bet.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. A great way to get a science credit especially if you're at all interested in biology.",
    "I would recommend Current Issues in Bio Science to another student. Its a fairly easy science credit with not that much work. You also get to choose your own topic which you research for the entire semester, and therefore, you are only studying what you want to study. Beware, we have absolutely no idea what we are getting for our final grade because he has given us zero indication."
