   "comments": [
    "It's a laid back environment to improve your language skills and it's far less work than it sounds like in the beginning of the year.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in seriously working on their grammar and their ease in writing French. It is great if you want to work on your fluency both in writing and speaking.",
    "Exactly how it sounds, that's how it is. It's a class on French grammar. That being said Madame Sherak is awesome, so the grammar's not so bad. Its a great way to improve your writing skills (that's why I took it). The workload is not too hard and Sherak is super flexible and aware of people's course loads. Overall, would recommend!",
    "Strong summary of major French grammar concepts learned from a textbook and then applied through writing and reading of literature.",
    "FREN 198 is a class in which you learn detailed French grammar in a fun way (movies, creative stories, etc.).",
    "It moves at a fairly quick pace, and there is a good number of small writing exercises that add up by the end of the semester, so I would say that it's probably a better course for someone who is already quite comfortable with their written and spoken French than for someone who hasn't had as much practice. I took it as a way to sort of brush up on some of the finer points of proper grammar, since I hadn't taken such a course since high school, and found it an excellent way to do just that. It was a great choice for my final French course of undergrad."
