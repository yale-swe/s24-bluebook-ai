   "comments": [
    "If you like musical theater, DO IT. Guest teachers are great, and if you get to take it with Annette and do the new voices concert that's a HUGE bonus.",
    "Not for the thin-skinned, but if you want to learn from a great professor and develop your skills, by all means, take it! Note that it's mostly an acting class, not really a \"singing\" class in that it does not focus on vocal technique. Annette is wonderful!",
    "I would recommend that you take this class if you are looking to pursue a career in musical theater, and I would recommend that you dedicate time to your preparation of songs so you can really get something out of the experience.",
    "Thank goodness for the Shen Curriculum, and for the fact that some sections of the Theater program at Yale acknowledge that students need practical training and professional coaching if we are to be anything other than dramaturges and starving artists. Having taken this class twice, I learned just as much the second time; criticism on song scene-studies and advice from industry professionals were both invaluable. This is an especially worthwhile class to take as a freshman and as a senior, and the value of the class varies wildly each semester based on who else is taking it - hold out and study with a large group of people you respect and admire the talent\/potential of.",
    "This course is a fantastic way to further your skills as a performer of MT. The three-hour class meetings flew by; there were five song performance assignments and two papers, and in general, you performed every other week. Many visiting artists came in to supplement the different units, which was great. In particular, a visit from a working Broadway casting director was tough but enlightening. Professor Jolles isn't afraid to push students and doesn't allow complacency in work, which I think is a strength. My class also featured a concert in New York, which was an amazing experience-- getting to work with so many professionals throughout the semester gave me so much to think about and work on, in addition to reminding me of why I love musical theatre.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are interested in musical theater and ready to put time and energy into performances. You get out of the class what you put into it."
