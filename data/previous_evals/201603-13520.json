    "Awesome class. This course really delved into TB, HIV, and malaria, with most of the focus on malaria it felt. I found this class to be more of an interest led class, so it was small in size, which facilitated discussions and a friendly environment for learning. Would recommend this course!",
    "I really enjoyed the content of this course, but would have preferred that classes were more interactive (since small class size). The amount of time that homework took was unexpectedly high, since they required readings above and beyond what was read for class and (usually) could not be answered based on what was learned in class.",
    "Strengths: This course is good for those interested in knowing the basics about these three diseases. Sunil is great and adds really great experience and anecdotes. I thought the last lecture tying up NTDs and the Big 3 was a really nice note to end on. It seemed to cater to many outside the EMD department as well, which was nice to have a diverse crowd. Weaknesses: I found the assignments to feel like busy work though I thought the journal presentation was useful. I didn't think the final presentation\/paper had a clear objective. The material was a little too basic; I was hoping we would be able to go into more detail on the three topics, but never felt like we made it past a basic intro for the diseases. Improvements: I think it might have been nice to have had all of the lectures for the three diseases parallel each other. For example, first lecture for each disease: intro and biology. second lecture: clinical aspects and treatment. third: epidemiology and social considerations, or something along those lines. Without clear objectives, everything gets kinda jumbled, the lectures begin to run into each other and we don't cover much for certain topics (like TB), and we end up only having a shallow understanding of the diseases, where I think the point is to develop a much deeper understanding than you would get from PID or other survey courses.",
    "If you want a solid class on the Big 3 that requires a fair but not impossible workload, take it. I would emphasize that each reading response takes hours or research and reading to complete so please be warned. Other than that, Sunil is a fantastic person so you'll likely enjoy the weekly classes.",
    "Very good, all topics were current and interesting.",
    "I definitely learnt a lot in this course, about all facets of the big 3. Because we were covering a lot in class, I found the homeworks helpful in consolidating what we'd been taught and giving us the chance to delve deeper in certain areas. There was some overlap between the readings before class and the reading required to do the assignments - I think it would be helpful for there to be more of an overlap - after a while, I just did the readings for the assignments because it all got a bit too much. The presentations on organizations involved in the big 3 were really interesting and added a nice twist at the end of the course."

    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sunil was a truly awesome professor. He is extremely knowledgeable on all three topics and has vast global health experience to augment the course. He is very understanding and willing to grant extensions - I really began to approach him as more of a peer toward the end of the semester, which was great. It was truly a pleasure to be one of his students!!",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0He's great. He really adds both a clinical and public health outlook to these topics. He was very responsive and graded assignments quickly.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sunil is an incredibly sweet and knowledgable person. His powerpoints are also very informative and he clearly cares about the topic. If I could offer a suggestion, it'd be to go a little more slowly and build up on the content instead of whizzing through dozens of, at times, dense information. Having a final paper and presentation on the same topic also felt a little redundant.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Very knowledgeable on the topic and responsive to students' suggestions. Sometimes monotonous.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sometimes the classes could feel a little dense - there was a lot of information being conveyed. I understand there's a lot to cover, but I wonder if digging a bit deeper on a few more focused areas might be beneficial. But Sunil is a great teacher who clearly knows his stuff and is passionate about it and that comes across in class."

    "A survey course on Malaria, TB, and HIV. Not restricted to EMD students but open for people interested in many aspects of these diseases, including behavioral interventions, cost effectiveness of programs targeted at these diseases, etc. A nice easy course (with a bit of busy work) but good for those genuinely interested in the topics.",
    "It's a good class, although I'd recommend working on the reading responses a little at a time so you don't scramble to finish them a day or two before it's due (because that'll lead to a rather sleep-deprived state of being). Having a final presentation and paper, while a little redundant, is far better in my eyes than a exam.",
    "I highly recommend it because you will learn in depth about the big three diseases.",
    "I would recommend it - you get a broad base of knowledge in a highly relevant area."
