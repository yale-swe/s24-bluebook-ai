    "This course if for students who are willing to put in daily work. For some courses you can get by by cramming a lot of information for midterms\/finals. To do well in this course you need to put in a certain amount of time everyday for homework. It's not very difficult material but it's necessary to keep up with it.",
    "It's a lot of work-- especially when you get to Sac de Billes (the small novel at the end of the course). Don't think the work in shopping period is representative of the whole course, and the workload picks up. I learned a lot of French this semester, though. What you put in is what you get out",
    "While the readings are mostly dark, L4 French builds on an assumption that you know the basics of grammar--it tells you how to use it, and tries to get you to think in French, rather than thinking in English and then translating!",
    "Definitely take it if you've already had several years of French. You learn a lot about the nuances of the language and it's not too hard if you take the time to review the materials periodically and you don't just leave everything for the last minute.",
    "If you are fairly comfortable with the language, I would highly recommend taking the course with Mme Hoffmann. She's a enthusiastic and lively teacher who will always take the time to help students improve their French skills.",
    "If you're taking French L4 to fulfill a language requirement, take this section. If you're doing it because you love French, take this section. Either way, Mme. Hoffmann is an engaging, delightful human being who loves what she does and loves her students. If you do the work everyday you will never find yourself extraordinarily stressed out by the tests, and the grading is very fair (I would go as far as to say somewhat lenient). Do make the effort to speak in class, it will do lots for your French.",
    "yes definitely, take it if you want to learn more French.",
    "If you really want to learn French, take it. Also, you'll get your distributional requirement done more quickly if you do just L3\/L4. Do block out at least an hour, maybe 2 every night for your assignments. It's hard to skimp in this class, because the work really is fast-paced and relevant. But at the end you will begin to feel conversational and it's a great way to cement your learning from L3."
