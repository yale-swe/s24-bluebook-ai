    "Death in Philosophy and Literature is only literary at the end--if ever. This first semester felt in many ways like a trial run--many of our classes were canceled, we did not get to all of the texts (including many of the texts I had been most excited about!). Also, class was run more like a lecture, and we had to email in three questions on the reading every week. Discussion was extraordinarily limited, and more often than not turned into a round-robin Q&A. The ideas related to death revolve mostly around rationalizing fear of death--so as to reveal the poignant beauty of life. Take this class as a fifth class, but only if you have a particular 'question' you want to ask about death, or if you really appreciate good office hours.",
    "Nice small seminar, even if this is your first philosophy class. Professor Hagglund is very approachable but he sometimes he spends most of the two hours lecturing\/talking about the readings, and although I personally didn't mind, it isn't always a discussion class in that sense. Very reasonable workload, just one reading per week, along with three discussion questions. The final paper can be an extension of your midterm paper which I found was really nice. Definitely try to talk to him about your paper, it helps a lot",
    "I don't think I would recommend this class. the readings are great, but the discussion was pretty awful, that is to say non-existent. hagglund begins his class basically with a lecture. he isn't very open to suggestions or topics that he hasn't previously thought about. And he has a habit of snickering with a few students about ideas like god, or basically anything that isn't strictly atheistic. He is also pretty disorganized, often coming in late, often forgetting a book or something. and on top of that he is a pretty harsh grader. that said, there were two papers, the first could even be a draft of the second, so there wasn't much work at all. And like I said, the readings were really good.",
    "While it may sound tempting to take a small seminar on death with a famous professor, this particular class was regrettably lackluster. One would expect high expectations and sophisticated analysis in a senior seminar for the lit. major, but class meetings - and readings - were pedestrian. Reading 20-30pp of Plato, Lucretius, or Montaigne for a session and then diagramming the arguments doesn't really cut it outside of freshman-year philosophy lectures. Nor does an overall thesis that amount to \"fear of death is illogical.\" For a professor born just the other side of the Kattegatt Sea from S\u00c3\u00b8ren Kierkegaard, that seems a little simplistic. No doubt Prof. H\u00c3\u00a4gglund is capable of much, much more. But he didn't seem to realize that so, too, are his students. (Also, his contention that the death drive and the pleasure principle are one and the same is just a flat-out, flagrant misreading of Freud.)"
