   "comments": [
    "I learned different ways to think about technology, like how technology shapes our culture but also how our culture shapes the kinds of technology that's created. I'm leaving this course with new perspectives on my everyday interactions with technology. We had a fieldnotes journal assignment in which we wrote twice a week about different interactions and observations we had with and about technology. This assignment changed the way that I talk about technology with my friends and also how i view it.",
    "Knowledge: a comprehensive view of anthropology and STS research on how our conceptions of technology have changed over time, and how technological systems and our bodies, social roles, and realities interact with one another. Skills: engaging with course readings and classmates' ideas in a seminar setting; being able to write weekly about observations in one's own life about experiences with technology; writing several thorough papers exploring ideas in the class such as the politics of ordinary things and technological determinism.",
    "This seminar gives an overview of topics and theories in STS (science and technology studies). This includes questions of what exactly constitutes technology, how are they differentially experienced, how do politics and norms embedded in technologies, who gets to create technology, etc. This class had an incredible mix of theoretical readings, engagement with technology in our daily lives (through journalling), and creativity (through one of the assignment where we had to redesign a technology and also class exercises that really engaged imaginaries).",
    "I loved this class - I was always so excited to discuss the readings in class. I think the topics of this class are incredibly important right now, and Professor Messeri did a great job facilitating discussion.",
    "I learned about how to understand the relationship between technology and culture through the eyes of anthropology.",
    "I learned to think of technology thorough the lens of Anthropology, to understand devices and the arrangements of institutions and practices they make possible as social and cultural phenomena.",
    "I learned how technology has immersed itself in our culture in ways previously invisible to me. I learned everything from historical information regarding technology to its impact in current day to predictions for the future.",
    "Awareness of relevant issues in STS, practice doing weekly ethnographic work, exposure to critical theory",
    "technological determinism some stuff about uber tools vs technology physical vs. virtual dichotomy",
    "I learned about the ways in which culture has been greatly impacted by advances in technology throughout history and up to modern-day culture.",
    "Honestly most readings were actually fascinating, which I've only said about a handful of classes at Yale, and class discussions challenged and broadened my knowledge about how we interact with technology and what the future might hold.",
    "This class totally changed my understanding\/perspective of technology. I have a much better ability to critically think about technology and how it is intertwined with culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really liked the class discussions, class activities, and the assignments (journal assignment, midterm paper, final paper, discussion posts). The weakness of the course is that the readings were sometimes long and boring.",
    "This course had many strengths. Professor Messeri is a thoughtful, engaging professor who keeps seminars lively and interesting at all times. The course readings, though sometimes long, were also very thought-provoking and rewarding. The semester-long journal was a great way to further flesh out ideas from class, and I also had a lot of fun writing the journal entries. Overall, this was one of my favorite classes at Yale so far.",
    "Messeri is an incredible instructor and an incredible asset for this course and for the anthropology department. She introduces theories, topics, and content beautifully and structures each class session very well through a variety of teaching techniques that worked really wellthings like collectively brainstorming ideas and webs on the whiteboard, breaking off into small groups, creative class activities, etc. She is by far one of the greatest strengths of the class. The class also has a great mix of readings that helps us engage with both theories but also with the broader realm of technology and how it is used, perceived, and experienced. The class can be a bit more work than other anthropology seminars there is a midterm paper and final paper as is standard, and there are also journals that need to be written twice a week. While the requirements keep these as relatively short (200-400 words) they often were on the longer side. That being said, I would hate to see this assignment eliminated and thus perhaps the expectations could be better outlined.",
    "This class is fun -- the readings are interesting, but it's not necessary to read them incredibly in depth. The discussions are fascinating, and the two were fun to write. I also enjoyed doing the field journal, which made me think about technology in my day to day life much more than I had ever before. I think what might make this class better is if we got to share our field journal topics with the class because this might have helped me widen the lens with which I was viewing my technological influences.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! The readings were really interesting, which made discussion during class very engaging. I especially enjoyed reading Uberland. The fieldnotes journals were also great in keeping me aware of the interaction between technology and culture in my life.",
    "The discussions are very lively and the professor does not really lecture, but rather clarify the main ideas in the readings and how we can apply them to think about situations we find in real life. The readings are also very entertaining and not hard to read, although they are quite long for some sessions.",
    "Strengths of the course include the seminar format, which produces engaging and thought-provoking discussions where we are able to learn from our classmates and professor. The readings were engaging, the fieldnotes were fun to write, and the larger projects\/papers gave students freedom to explore an area within the broader topic that they were interested in. Weaknesses are that sometimes grading felt a little arbitrary, with broader guidelines, but then specific expectations when graded.",
    "This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. The discussions were well structured to facilitate student contribution, the material was consistently engaging, and feedback throughout the course was extremely helpful. Perhaps in a future iteration of the course, the weekly journal entries could be reduced to 1\/week, as the task became more tedious as the semester progressed.",
    "strengths: open learning environment. you could say pretty much anything in class and be edified. but i felt a little bored by the conversations and felt that the questions the professor provided facilitated lackadaisical answers... weaknesses: strange discrepancy between the prof's leniency and surface-level questions in class and harshness of grading. really didn't make sense",
    "The readings are generally very engaging, as are in class activities.",
    "Strengths: Material, class discussions and activities, feedback to improve learning. Weaknesses: Grading system was subjective. Neutral: Assignments will challenge you and do take quite a bit of thinking.",
    "Great readings, interesting\/well-facilitated class discussions, brilliant professor"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yeah! It was interesting overall and the assignments were really fun to do.",
    "Yes yes yes - this seminar was topical, thought-provoking, and helped me to think about 'technology' in new ways which have changed some of my perspectives on technology in our world today. The assignments and readings were sometimes long but always doable, and Professor Messeri is wonderful.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you're at all interested in how technology effects our daily lives, how different people use technologies, or science and technology studies more broadly. It covers a broad spectrum of perspectives and concepts, and each of them is very interesting (let's talk disability studies. let's talk silicon valley. let's talk uber.) Messeri is also an amazing instructor whom you should absolutely try to take a class with! The first class session gives a generally good impression of the class and framing why it is this course is necessary, but be sure to stick around for at least both weeks of shopping period to get a full grasp on how amazing taking a class with Messeri is.",
    "Absolutely!!",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this course! Prof Messeri is an amazing instructor and I learned a lot from this course. From the interesting weekly readings and the field notes journal we write twice every week, I am more aware of how technology can change my identity, the community I live in, and the society overall.",
    "Without a doubt. It deals with ideas we rarely find elsewhere and that are recent and relevant.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This course was engaging, thought-provoking, and so interesting. I loved going to class. Most of the readings didn't even feel like an assignment because they were relevant and interesting. It makes you notice things around you that you didn't before, especially with regard to the way technology is taking over in so many ways.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to STEM and social science students. This course (and STS more broadly) is a necessary intervention in the gap between disciplines.",
    "Probably not unless they're into STS",
    "Yes. Super fun, and relatively easy to complete the assignments because the topics are much closer to your everyday life than the average paper.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student as the content was very interesting and important for people to consider as technology is taking over society more and more.",
    "What you learn in this class can help you become a more informed consumer, more ethical creator, and more responsible world citizen. A variety of sources for learning and activities were provided for the class (videos, games, art, etc.). Feedback was plentiful, and I did feel that this class helped me not only be more accountable and aware of my work, but also grow in my writing abilities. This being said, grading was extremely subjective (there was actually a set amount of points on each assignment that was explicitly set aside to be simply a measure of the professor's subjective rating of your assignment). Would recommend for the great content, but be careful regarding grading.",
    "Take this class!! It will be one of the best classes you take at Yale, regardless of your major. It will deepen your understanding of society at large. It will make you a more critical thinker. Take it, take it, take it."
