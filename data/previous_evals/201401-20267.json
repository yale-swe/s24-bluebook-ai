   "comments": [
    "The course materials is pretty cool, but I will say that you won't really learn any \"new\" math until maybe the last few weeks. Fresen is rather bad at his job and isn't connected to the real world. Obviously, take with caution.",
    "Take course ONLY if you are confident in your abstract mathematical reasoning and proof writing courses.",
    "It's an interesting class and you'll learn a lot valuable skills you can use in other subjects as well. Try not to take it with Fresen though. While he has definitely improved his teaching style since last year (when I took 225 with him), lectures are still kind of disorganized and he doesn't use a textbook, so you completely rely on your own lecture notes and it is really hard to get the big picture in analysis. If you have to take it with Fresen, I would recommend reading over some standard analysis textbook in the beginning of the semester to get the big picture. I used \"Understanding Analyis\" by Abbot. It's a fairly simple text, but it helped me getting some overview over what was happening. Then, come to every class and make sure to organize your notes well. For the exams, I found it most useful to memorize the proofs of some of the most important theorems, since most of the questions will ask you about those. Good Luck!",
    "Hard, with lots of material to learn, but ultimately very interesting. Worth it if you are prepared for a challenge.",
    "A requirement. Not the most interesting material, (but I'm an applied math person)",
    "Take the course with another instructor. The materials we covered were manageable, and the workload is manageable as well. But the instructor is not the best. We did not have a textbook, and all we could rely on was the instructor's lectures. However, the lectures were often messy, and once the instructor had trouble with the lecture himself.",
    "It's an interesting course, though it's not as rigorous as the high numbered analysis courses. That said, probably worth taking overall. There were only 4 problem sets this year, each of which could be rather time consuming. Also, you do have to put in quite a bit of time outside of class and homework to actually learn the material, since Fresen doesn't teach from a book but often glosses over points in lectures.",
    "lots of work; take it if you need it.",
    "Taking this course with Daniel Fresen is a good idea. He is very clear, and he understands the material very well. I certainly learned a lot in this course. He is a very harsh grader, but I think that's a good thing to have every now and then, especially in a math course. The homework isn't very consistent, however, and is returned a little slowly.",
    "It's a swell course, but be advised that the tests come almost entirely from theorems proved in the lectures.",
    "I would reccommend this course. From early on, pay attention to writing down all the proofs presented in class in full, and make sure you know and undertand all the proofs presented in class before the exams.",
    "I would happily recommend 300 to another student. The class was a very fair one - the tests and problem sets were very representative of what we went over in class. Less work than 250, and also a narrower band of focus than 250, so overall more enjoyable if you want to drill down on a single topic.",
    "It's a good introductory class, and changed how I approach mathematics from a computational to a proof-oriented style. If you've taken classes like 120, 222, and 250, this class will be pretty different.",
    "I recommend MATH 300 to math majors or combined math majors -- real analysis is an important part of the study of mathematics, and MATH 300 does a good job of providing an introduction to the material. The exams are very difficult, and there are very few problem sets, which means you have to stay up-to-date on all the material throughout the year in order to do well. That said, I enjoyed the class overall.",
    "I had a reasonably good time in MATH 300. Professor Fresen and his cellphone from the year 1995 are hilarious, and you will learn a lot. Problem is, Fresen gives little homework, so you have to memorize a bunch of proofs the night before the exam. Although about a third of the class drops out after the first midterm, you shouldn't be too worried: your classmates aren't as smart as they look. If they were actually stone cold pros they would have taken MATH 301."
