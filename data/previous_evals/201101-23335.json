   "comments": [
    "Nice professor, topic is a bit redundant from class to class - not necessarily the epic life-changing Yale class that the name suggests, but not bad if the readings appeal to you.",
    "Yes. Definitely. From a Science major's point of view, this class is great. It forced me out of my comfort zone and caused me to think about things in a new way. It's a great class to take for a humanities credit.",
    "easy class - two papers (one 8p midterm paper, one 15p final paper) and a group presentation on one weeks readingsinteresting books, probably more interesting than your other classesprof alreyes is really nice and a great teacher",
    "This is an excellent literature seminar, and Professor Alryyes is a very intelligent and subtle thinker. Take this if you're interested in exploring complex issues of personhood and life.",
    "Recommended if you have intellectual questions or concerns about life and death. Be aware that Professor Alryyes assigns a LOT of reading, so be prepared to read 1-2 books per week or at least look like you did the reading during seminar.",
    "A great class that lives up to the possibilities of its name, delving into philosophy as much as literature (while not requiring much background in either). Prof. Alryyes is a great discussion leader, and the syllabus is fantastic. Take it!",
    "English 399 illuminates problems in defining life, problems that make you think about life and death and being human and the soul. It is interdisciplinary. The professor is good-humored and kind.Its strength was its willingness to embrace questions and ambiguity, and its look at the theme of the course from a variety of perspectives.",
    "At the beginning of this course, I knew that it was definitely a hit or miss based on the broad title and ambitious agenda. It lived up to the hype and was a wonderful course. Definitely take this if you are a deep thinker and willing to put in the time for the reading. Don't take it if you are looking for a gut.",
    "Not unless it were extremely restructured. It's mostly philosophy texts despite being listed as ENGL\/LITR\/HUMS, and the class has very little focus or cohesion. There was also little balance, as some of the most thought-provoking readings were barely discussed while other, less substantial ones were beaten to death.",
    "I definitely would recommend it if you are interested in looking at \"life\" from a variety of perspectives and discussing various effects on it and meanings of the word. Be prepared for a lot of readings and two not insignificant papers, but the class is great!",
    "This was a fantastic class which covered a wide variety of different material. I absolutely recommend taking a class with Professor Alryyes",
    "Yes, take this class if it's offered again with Professor Alryyes! It's an unexpectedly cohesive class that covers all aspects of defining life and makes you think much more deeply about everything from eating meat, your own life, bioethics, war, disease, androids, and many other things that I didn't think could get incorporated into a single syllabus."
