    "Yes!",
    "Take this class, and take it with Jill Campbell. Jill Campbell is one of the most wonderful professors I have ever had. She is kind, she leads the class to wonderful discussions, she is easy to talk to and approach, and she gives wonderfully helpful comments on papers. She is extremely responsive to students and gives her students all of her attention. She responds to emails quickly with long and thoughtful responses. Wonderful professor.The class only have three five page papers. There is a lot of reading but it is definitely manageable! It is all interesting reading.",
    "ENGL 127 covers American lit ranging from Walt Whitman to more contemporary works like The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. I really enjoyed the opportunity to take a class in which my homework consisted of reading actual books (although the amount of reading is not trivial). Class discussions were great, and I enjoyed the three papers I wrote for the class. Prof. Campbell is great.",
    "Yes. You read great things.",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this class! The reading is interesting and Professor Campbell is AMAZING!",
    "I would indeed. I'm sure you've heard this elsewhere, but it's a good deal of reading. If you fall behind during the week, make sure you catch up during the weekend. Class discussions without doing the reading are really not productive for you as a learner. Try to take it later in the day (aka not 9am) because the seminar-style class discussions might put you to sleep. The books you read are some of my favorites, and it can even feel like you're just reading for pleasure again like back in the day.",
    "The class is a standard literature seminar with an anthology of books to read and papers to write. Professor Campbell was amazing and really fun. Her class had three papers and a final which all 127 sections had. The work is manageable and not too bad.",
    "I would recommend that you take this class if you really want to get an idea of American Literature. The reading can get a little bit heavy, especially during Moby Dick, but it's all very interesting. You should also take it with Professor Campbell. She's so sweet and her grading on your essays really helps you to improve.",
    "Definitely! I came from a school with amazing English classes that were small, had great readings, and were discussion-based, and Readings in American Lit was just like that. It was also extremely refreshing to have reading and writing assignments and step away from problem sets and huge lecture classes.",
    "Take this course! More specifically take this course with Prof. Campbell. Eng 127 has a lot of variation based on the professor and each section has its own individualized reading lists. I really liked the choices that Prof Campbell made for our class and it was nice to have a wide range of styles of writing. We read plays, novels, poetry, and novels that combined all of the above. It's also an excellent course to take to improve your writing. There is a lot of reading, so be prepared. If you're someone who struggles with reading literature in a short time constraint than this might not be the best course to take.",
    "If you want an overview of American literature, take this class with Professor Campbell! She is really engaging and the reading list for the class is great. The modern novels are the best, but the conversation in class will keep you engaged regardless.",
    "I would recommend it to someone with a strong interest in writing, but not necessarily someone who is looking to focus on the American classics, as we did not focus too much on the giants of American literature.",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in English or American Literature. Professor Campbell is also fantastic - sign up for her section if you can!",
    "Not a survey of highlights in American lit, but a more theme-directed, narrow course. Take it if you want to explore an aspect of American Lit and want to develop your writing skills in an intro English class"
