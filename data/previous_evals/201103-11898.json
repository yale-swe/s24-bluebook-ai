   "comments": [
    "A lot of the math and biological basis of vision, with a little bit of algorithms. Many interesting topics but very fast paced. Prof Zucker covers a lot of subjects, just try to grab onto what you can and enjoy the ride.",
    "Take it! This class is amazing. All that math you've learned is going to come back, but this time it will be exciting and applicable and understandable. One of my favorite classes at Yale, changed the way I think about the world.Oh, and there's a (really easy) midterm and some (also pretty easy) problem sets now in addition to the final and the project.",
    "Great, great class!! Very difficult for someone who didn't have an extremely strong background in physics or bio, and who didn't know a lot of the math. Be ready to not understand anything 80% of the time, but be ready to be mindblown when you finally get it :)Totally worth it, and Prof. Zucker is a boss. Take it!",
    "Interesting course that integrates a lot of different science and math topics together. Despite the fact that its not a pre-req, you really should be comfortable with both linear algebra and vector calculus to get the most out of this class.",
    "CPSC 475 is an interdisciplinary approach to computer vision. The professor assumes very little background on students' part and builds math, computer science, and biology from the ground up. There's very little structure to the course and you might wonder what's going on. Hardly anything is posted online, there's no textbook, and the only resource are paper copies of lecture notes handed out in class.",
    "It's a very neat introduction to the problems of vision, and a good way to learn a lot about how math is used in a practical context. It's a cool course to take, and it's a CS elective that requires very little programming, so go for it.",
    "I would base your decision to take this class on how much you like math. I would say most of the class is a mixture of fairly complex mathematics, neuroscience, and a little bit of computer science here and there. There isn't that much work, if you're worried about that, the only problem is that sometimes the concepts are a little bit difficult to understand. If you're pretty solid on math, I would recommend this class, otherwise, I would probably shy away. Probably worth the science credit though, if you're a fellow CS major.",
    "You learn less computer science in this course than other CS courses at Yale, and definitely learn more biology. This makes the course accessible to the bio majors trying to learn about vision, but will probably be much easier for students with backgrounds in math and computer science.This year we only had 4 homeworks, which made the course load light during the semester. But the final project can be a lot of work if you want to make a good one. If you're CS, I suggest taking the course if you need a lightweight CS course for your major, but be prepared to learn a lot of biology too. If you're a bio major, its helpful to have at least a familiarity in computer programming and linear algebra, though you can definitely pick it up yourself if you commit to the course.By the way, the climax of the course is a cool algorithm Zucker is responsible for, called relaxation labeling. Google it if you wanna know more.",
    "To get the most out of this course, you'll probably have to read a lot beyond what's covered in class. The topics covered are very broad and so they're all just skimmed through during lectures. The lectures themselves are often unorganized, so you might have a hard time making sense of whats going on. That being said, if you're really interested in computer vision, Professor Zucker has a lot of experience in the field and was actually quite friendly and helpful to meet during office hours. This is not the kind of course that you should take if you merely want to explore computer vision: you'll only like it if you're already sure about your interest in the field."
