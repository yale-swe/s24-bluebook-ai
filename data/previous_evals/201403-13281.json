    "TAKE IT!! Your reading comprehension will get a lot better, even if your speaking seems like it won't. Honestly, just take it to spend 4.5 hours a week with Hiroe sensei in a fun class setting. It isn't too hard as long as you put in the work.",
    "",
    "A good way to continue Japanese at Yale. Since advanced classes aren't as structured. I would recommend shopping different levels to see which you like best.",
    "This class was definitely interesting. The reading was quite diverse, and I liked some readings far more than others. There is homework due for every class, and by the end of the semester I was a bit weary of doing homework each day. Class is fun and engaging, and I feel like my reading comprehension improved a lot over the course of the semester. Lots of writing.",
    "Hiroe is a very diligent teacher, but the class is taught with less verve and fun than other Japanese courses. You'll learn at a reasonable rate, and the workload was about 1.5 hours for each class (3 times a week).",
    "JAPN 156 continues to hone your knowledge of kanji, vocabulary and grammar structures. The format is similar to that of third year (JAPN 150 and 151) where you have readings with associated vocabulary words, and kanji quizzes. (The majority of kanji quizzes asked only for hiragana reading and English definition, which was nice.) There are only two major tests, a final speech, and no final, so assessment-wise, the class is manageable. Hiroe-sensei is a great instructor. Recommended!"
