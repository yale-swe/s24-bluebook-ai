    "I'd recommend it to any graduate student interested in philosophy of language or linguistics. I'd also recommend it to a graduate student interested in another area in which contextualism is important, but with the caveat that it will be harder for them.",
    "This course was an in-depth seminar covering a wide range of foundational topics in the philosophy of language all relating to context sensitivity. We read classic papers at the foundations of various topics, as well as extremely recent papers, such that this seminar prepared all its students to enter into a wide range of contemporary and relevant debates in philosophy of language. I highly recommend this seminar to any student interested in the subject matter, which is more important and foundational than its course description may suggest."
