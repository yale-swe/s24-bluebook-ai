    "I would highly recommend the class, it's very useful as an introduction to the field. Plus, the paper can be used as our metrics paper.It's also a nice introduction to the workings of US political institutions, for non-Americans. Now I have a much better idea of what's going on when I read the newspaper or watch the news.",
    "I like the course a lot. Ebonya has structured the class very well and the discussion in class is usually very helpful and enlightening. I would definitely recommend the class to a fellow student.",
    "EC790 is an invaluable course for any graduate students interested in Political Economy. It is strongly recommended due its good integration of empirical and theoretical work."

   "comments": [
    "It can lead to the metrics paper, there is a lot of opportunity to discuss it in this class; plus, a lot of useful feedback.I expected to learn more empirical methods and results in this class, but ended up understanding theoretical methods a lot better. We learn about different techniques in the theoretical metrics classes, but you don't get the nuances until you see it applied. The small class atmosphere meant that we weren't afraid of asking questions whenever we didn't understand something.",
    "This course gave me a sound understanding of the major theories and debates in Political Economy, which will undoubtedly inform my future research paths. Beyond this, the class requirements (research paper, presentation,&c.) were well-crafted to both encourage original research and develop crucial skills necessary to become scholars in the field."
