   "comments": [
    "Lots of paper-reading. I didn't exactly like the way the syllabus was structured around a select set of issues, but education is a very big field encompassing many different types of issues, and it's not feasible for a course to cover all areas.",
    "The beginning of the semester when we look at returns to education and econometric review can be really boring. Once you get past week 4 and move into empirical work on various education reform policies, it is really interesting. Watch out for two reading responses per week, which can be a lot. Also, it's important to start planning early for your final group project (50% of your grade).",
    "Yes. Prof Hastings is passionate about the material. The twice-weekly reading responses are tedious but ensure an indepth understanding of the material. Final project can take a WHILE to finish, so start early!",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class as it was taught this year (of course the rest of the econ senior seminars aren't too swell, so maybe you do want to take this). The focus was almost exclusively on the econometrics of the research papers we read. We didn't talk at all about policy implications, which was disappointing. The class wasn't too challenging, but definitely consumed a good amount of time in weekly preparation.",
    "Take this class only if you're truly interested in the topic. We had to write a one-page reading response for every class, and the class met twice a week. The papers were also not always easy. I learned a lot in this class because of writing these reading responses, but do consider that they take time. If you like reading empirical analyses of interesting theories of educations, this class is for you. Prof. Hastings is also extremely smart and knowledgeable about the subject.",
    "Good overview of the main issues in education economics. Worth taking if you are interested in the topic.",
    "The subject material is good\u3000to\u3000know,\u3000but\u3000the\u3000lectures\u3000were\u3000boring\u3000and\u3000the\u3000papers\u3000we\u3000had\u3000to\u3000read\u3000were\u3000a\u3000bit\u3000of\u3000a\u3000slog.\u3000Also, this\u3000class\u3000isn't\u3000being\u3000offered\u3000again\u3000because\u3000Professor\u3000Hastings\u3000is\u3000going\u3000to\u3000be\u3000at\u3000Brown\u3000starting\u3000next year.",
    "If your interested in Education this is the only Econ class Yale has to offer on the subject. You won't learn a lot from class but the reading material is definitely worth it.",
    "Interesting material, but Professor Hastings is kind of noobish",
    "I wouldn't take this class unfortunately. The papers are interesting but it's a drag of a class to sit through two times a week.",
    "YES if Hastings comes back."
