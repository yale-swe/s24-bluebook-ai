    "Deliberative democracy is a great way to explore contemporary themes in democratic theory and to consider institutional design, empirical research, and behavioral ideas alongside classic political theory. Yes, I would recommend it to anyone interested in those ideas.",
    "The course first develops the paradigm of deliberative democracy from historical and conceptual perspectives and then proceeds to consider frontiers in current deliberative democratic theory, considering various ways in which the paradigm has been challenged and adapted, adopting a sympathetic but critical perspective. Highly recommended."

    "Yes definitely. I hope that I will most likely write my dissertation on a topic brought up in the course.",
    "The course provided a sense of what it means to work on deliberative democratic theory by elucidating some of the main questions and approaches in current scholarship. This experience was invaluable preparation for doing contemporary theoretical work."
