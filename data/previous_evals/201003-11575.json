    "I regret buying the Cartoon Guide and not buying another one of the recommended texts. I did not find the Cartoon Guide very helpful",
    "Text books are merely recommendations. I used the cartoon guide and it wasn't that helpful.",
    "question 7: the only interactions i had with any of the TAs this semester was when they handed graded homeworks back. i never went to their office hours, so i cannot comment on whether they were good or bad as TAs.question 10: i have been pleasantly surprised at how much i have learned in the class and how applicable it is for what i later intend to do at FES.",
    "Great professor! One of the best I've had at Yale.",
    "Questions 1-10The pace of the class was at times overwhelming, but the Professor might be the most pro-student, accessible, and friendly faculty-members at Yale. Please go visit him or the TAs during office hours with questions, because he\/they are open and happy to help - this was a really good feeling and added to the course's value.Room for improvement: assign more ungraded practice from textbooks and perhaps slow down some of the topics in the middle of the semester for better understanding.",
    "No textbook required -- which was great! I didn't end up getting one of the optional suggested ones, but don't think I ever missed it. If you're not a math person, you might want to -- the lectures go through material really fast!The course is Stats, which isn't really the most exciting topic. However, Jonathan made it as interesting as I think it could possibly could be, and I'm glad I learned stats from him.",
    "1. There were suggested textbooks, but I didn't use any of them.",
    "Explanations for answers are below.",
    "If you wish to delve more into theory, as the instructor would tell you - this is not the course for you.",
    "Question 10: I don't think I needed to complete an extensive intro statistics course to pursue my career path. The extension school class I took as a prerequisite to F&ES admission covered the same material, and I believe an intro financing or accounting class would have been much more applicable. Given the range of students seeking the MEM degree, the school would be well served to carefully consider the range of student interests and career objectives before imposing across-the-board MEM requirements.",
    "N\/A",
    "I think this is a course that students can pass out of but it is a great refresher course for this that want to learn practical and applied statistics. My only criticism is that the professor spoke VERY quickly and sometimes rushed the explanations a bit. With that said I loved his energy and great sense of humor.",
    "Both teacher and TAs for this class were available and willing to answer questions, explaining the concepts and providing good examples.The second best thing was the proffesor's teaching style. As useful as statistics can be, this course is not easy to grasp and to understand. The professor made it possible for the class to have a lively interaction with him and with each other.I thank the teacher for sharing his love towards this subject. If you are reading this wondering if you should take it, AT LEAST give him two weeks. Shop the class. His style kept me interested in Stats from beginning to end. It is not easy to do that with a topic most students ran away from.",

    "A lot of useful information packed in. Professor tries to make a somewhat dull subject matter interesting",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer presents very well organized lectures. I was always able to find what I needed after class in our notes. I also appreciated that we were able to work with real data sets in most all of our problem sets.",
    "The enthusiasm of the instructor, use of examples in teaching concepts, meaningful\/useful homework problems (nothing was just busy work), the instructors understanding of graduate student life and demands- he was very flexible and reasonable with due dates, office hours, etc.",
    "Instructor-prepared course materials. Worked better than any textbook. Totally clear.",
    "The professor is wicked funny.",
    "The teacher is funny and interactive. I feel like I now understand the basic language of Statistics and can comprehend statistical analysis found in science journals and other publications.",
    "JDRS took a subject that could probably have been torturous for students to learn in a big lecture format and made it interesting, fun, and easy to learn. i really appreciate the energy and excitement he brings to the classroom, and how helpful he has been when we don't understand the material.",
    "Made learning Statistics fun, even if a bit silly once in the while. A good overview and applicable to future work in the environmental field.",
    "The professor and the subject.",
    "Very clear explanations, funny and engaging professor.",
    "The professor and the lectures. The way the professor teaches us what we need to know to and does not bog us down with extras we will not need to ever use.",
    "Learnt how to use Minitab",
    "The professor -- I might have ended up hating stats if I learned it from another person. JDRS did a great job of making stats as interesting as I think it possibly could be.Also really appreciated the notes handouts. I will be keeping these as reference for a long time!Oh, and take-home midterm and final exams -- very much appreciated!",
    "I could build up my statistical intuition through this class",
    "JDRS did a very good job of making statistics more than just slideshows of equations and graphs. I think his excitement for stats during every lecture made the class much more interesting. I also enjoyed the two trivia days, which were excellent ways to review the material.",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer's teaching style. You'll hear this ad nauseam but he's damn entertaining - to most of us, anyway. Who else could make learning statistics fun???",
    "JDRS' lectures! He is hilarious. And when I finally started to come out of the fog of confusion that was the central limit theorum :)",
    "I cannot think of a better statistics professor than Jonathan Reuning-Scheere",
    "Jonathan seemed very enthusiastic about the course material and teaching in general. His positive attitude was helpful.",
    "learning how to apply stats to real environmental policy problems",
    "The examples given in lectures (with instructions on how to use the software and explanations on the methodologies)",
    "The Professor - despite being a math undergrad, I felt like I gained clarity on many things that were vague before.",
    "I don't enjoy stats, but Jonathan made the material as interesting as possible.",
    "The professor was very animated, which was significant since the topic was not of interest to me.",
    "The instructur, Jonathan Reuning-Scherer.",
    "My favorite part about the course was working on the group project. The project allowed me to apply what I learned in class onto a \"real world\" problem, thus validating the skills I learned over the course of the semester.",
    "The professor was very entertaining. Always enjoyed attending classes.",
    "I am so grateful that I took this course. I can't imagine a better Intro to Statistics class out there. First, Jonathan is a great instructor. I really benefited from the more creative learning formats that Jonathan used: personal stories, visualizations with objects, the use of the clickers, and funny little sayings. They were entertaining, but they also helped me feel confident about how I understood the content. I also thought that the class was HIGHLY ORGANIZED and this made me at ease. In a class where many students are really trying their hardest to wrap their minds around the concepts, the last thing that you want is being distracted by when the next assignment will be handed out or confusion on how to study for the midterm. Jonathan did a great job balancing what we should know and be able to do by ourselves (which is very little) with what we should do with a little help. Also, I would not have survived without the help of the TAs, so I highly recommend that in the future the caliber of TA is scrutinized (Xuemei was great!) and that only TAs who really know what they are doing are there to help, because many of us leaned on them.",
    "- The professor is incredibly entertaining! I thought he was very fun to listen to.- The professor always was happy to help explain something further or help you out if you were confused about material.",
    "The problem sets and take-home tests were very helpful to understanding the concepts. The instructor was also really helpful in office hours.",
    "Without a doubt his energy and sense of humor. Some students did not appreciate it but it was frankly the main reason why I took the course. Statistics can be a very dull and dry topic and I have taken a few stats courses and no one brought his level of excitement to the course. He did the best job of any that I can think of to",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer makes introductory statistics incredibly digestible. I never dreaded coming to class and learned a lot not only about statistics, but how to think in a statistical framework.",
    "Considering the material, and considering this is a subject I want to have an overview of but not explore deeply for years to come, the instructor makes this class as entertaining and engaging as I can possibly imagine. Not a bad goal to achieve I think.",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer is probably the most engaging professor I've ever had. This subject could easily be boring, overwhelming, or difficult to comprehend, but his classroom attitude makes the material both interesting and accessible. He exemplifies why FES is so great -- a statistics course anywhere else would be a necessary evil, but here it is fascinating, exciting, and fun. Thank you so much!",
    "The professor brings a lot of energy to the lectures. He will forewarn you that it verges on being too much, but when you consider the alternative (dry and dull) you really begin to appreciate it. He understands that few of the students truly want to be in a stats class, so he makes every effort for it to be as painless as possible.",
    "The Instructor has the ability to make what may look difficult highly accessible by the learners.",
    "The use of clickers! I specially liked interacting with the teacher through the clickers, it gave him a good idea of how well we were understanding the topics. I believe the clickers should be used more often. That way the students will also remember to bring them to class.",
    "The professor did a good job of keeping the class engaging it what could be a very dry subject.",
    "engaging professor who can skillfully explain complicated material, engage with students, focuses on learning, rather than treating the class, tests, and problem sets as academic exercises.",
    "Professor was very invested in making sure the students learned the material.",
    "JDRS presented the material in very clearly, which was helpful since I think many in the class had little experience with statistics.",

   "comments": [
    "Sometimes it was hard to follow the professor; in part because he moves quite fast, and also because he knows so much he can jump ahead to concepts that are beyond the material in the class.The distribution of the completed homework should be done in a more organized fashion - for instance, just put them in alphabetical order!",
    "No improvements needed.",
    "Print the class notes so they can be inserted into a binder.",
    "maybe give students just one week off from problem sets\/midterms. that would have been nice.",
    "Helping to understand what we do wrong.An option for review and discussion after assignements - perhaps an open TA session",
    "None",
    "The lectures go through material really fast -- can be hard to keep up!",
    "Speed. We could skip most of intro parts because many of us have taken stat during undergrad. Then we could have more time to focus on ANOVA, regression etc.. had an impression of him speeding up at the final weeks.",
    "Often JDRS would read off of the notes on the projector. The downside to this was that he would talk by bullet points and not in greater detail. There were many concepts that I looked up in a textbook or online because I didn't get enough description to grasp the concepts in class.The other area in need of improvement is the software that goes along with this class. It would be nice to have a free Mac friendly version of Minitab. Also, I went to the tutorial session on Minitab, but still found myself lost during the psets sometimes (yes, despite the step by step directions in the notes!) This might be hard, but perhaps in subsequent years, a bit more of lecture time could be devoted to explaining the software.",
    "Ideally, we'd have covered fewer topics and each in more depth. I came away from the class understanding how to 'do' statistics but not necessarily with the full understanding of how and why I was using each tool. Might just be that I'm not a quantitative person...",
    "This sounds stupid - but it would have been really great if the photocopies of the lecture notes could have been printed in such a way that you could put them in a binder and conveniently flip the pages like a book - they were printed some wrong-way-up so that it was really inconvenient to look back through them. BUT it was really nice of JDRS to have them printed for us in the first place.",
    "For those of use who haven't had a math class in a long time, it might be useful if more space in the handouts was dedicated to defining variables and terms in the equations. These are spelled out at the beginning of each section, but refreshers might be helpful.",
    "It would be helpful if we were given more examples about how to actually apply a certain analysis to a certain data set. Also, instructor availability was a big problem (see below).",
    "overall great class. Sometimes too fast.",
    "Order and structure. It's very hard to follow without a clear view of the whole picture.",
    "More office hour availability.",
    "The pace was very, very fast. I think too much material had to be covered.",
    "The one thing I would suggest is an in class tutorial for Minitab. (I missed the out of class tutorial) Though it was my fault for missing the tutorial, there were times I was confused when working within minitab.",
    "I thought the course was great. No particular area for improvement.",
    "- Better TAs. Noel and Xuemei were hard to understand and often times were not that responsive when students came in with questions. I stopped going to the TAs because they had inconvenient office hours and locations.- Better homework graders. On several of the homework assignments I got points taken off on questions that I had given the right answers to.- The handouts in class were somewhat helpful but also were confusing at times. I was not familiar with minitab and it was very frustrating to try and do homework assignments using minitab when we hadn't really been taught how to use it. It would have been cool to get more details in the handouts on how to do all the steps in minitab.",
    "The instructor goes very fast in class, so the lecture is difficult to follow sometimes. It might be better if students had to write down some lecture notes, or if the professor slowed down a bit.",
    "I think that it would be great to apply these basic stats concepts more to environmental issues as examples.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Although I have taken statistics before, it has been specially difficult for me to understand the statistics behind the stories and other sources of information we were given. Understanding how to pose a question and read a question as a statistician was something I am still left struggling. I would advice that we are given a short lesson on this, perhaps even a short piece and a class discussion onto how to read statistics in our every day lifes.The class was too fast at times and I was left turning around without knowing which direction to go. Although the books helped clarify much, as well as the in-class notes, I feel that perhaps if the lessons are timed in a different way there will be more room for those, who like me, were slow at understanding the jokes and stories the professor used as examples?",
    "Not much.",
    "At times, it felt like the problem sets required a simple knowledge of which buttons to click in Minitab, rather than an understanding of the statistical operation in question. Not always, but sometimes.",
    "The use of different instructional soucres was disjointed. Following a textbook for this course would be invaluable. It was difficult to cross reference what was covered in class with more knowledge on the subject. A course packet would be a logically next step, bought at the beginning of the year.",
    "The pace was a bit fast, and I sometimes got lost trying to follow all the presented material. Although most of the time this was cleared up by doing the weekly problem sets.",

    "TA office hours were extremely helpful, as are the professor's review sessions.",
    "Instructor office hours were extremely useful. I would start my homework before office hours, attend to ask any pressing questions, and be completed by the time office hours ended. I would highly suggest attending at least one professor office hour class a week.",

    "Instructor and TA hours were clear and adequate. moderately quick replies to email prior to final project. Quick replies during final project",
    "The professor held plenty of review sessions and open office hours to meet with students. I took advantage of both of these early in the course and they were helpful.",
    "The instrutor answered my questions immediately and clearly.",
    "The TAs were just okay -- I went to sessions for homework and sometimes got more help from other students than the actual TAs...although they would always confirm if those students were correct, which was helpful!The professor was always very helpful and it seemed like he made extra effort to be available for students.",
    "TAs were very helpful and dedicated while we were doing problem sets.",
    "The TA availability was fine- the location, however was not. Greeley labs are a bit far from the main campus and from Kroon Hall.As for JDRS, the drop-in sessions were very helpful. The one comment I have is that, perhaps the forestry and the undergrad stats class should have separate drop-in sessions. Often, students from both classes would be asking questions and sometimes I didn't have a moment to ask about a problem.",
    "All were readily available and super helpful.",
    "I did not use any of the TA's, but I went almost every week to JDRS' drop-in sessions, which were EXTREMELY HELPFUL.",
    "The professor was incredibly helpful whenever I talked with him, which was relatively frequently. He must be commended for being so responsive and available to students.",
    "Jonathan talked a lot in class about how available he was and how he was very interested in helping us. However, out of seven e-mails I sent, I have only ever received a reply to two (28.6%) of them. When I came to meet with him he was late to the point that my meeting time was almost over by the time he arrived, and other students were waiting. It sounded like he had a lot of other obligations, and with as willing as he seemed to be to help, that willingness did not show in his actual performance.I never met with the TAs. My only interaction with them was through grading. They graded very subjectively and did not provide a great deal of feedback about how to improve, but rather took large amount of points off if something was not stated perfectly according to a rubric.",
    "great. professor always available and helpful",
    "I never met with any TAs. Jonathan seemed very available and always happy to talk. His review sessions were helpful.",
    "The professor was overbooked and hard to see for a one-on-one appointment. However, once you got him, he was very patient and helpful.However, the TAs did not attend the lectures or even glance at the posted lecture slides, which made it very difficult to seek assistance and\/or clarification on the material.",

    "Jonathan was the most available instructor I had this semester, without question. I really benefited from seeing him during office hours and the Monday noon session. The TA's were also very available, I mostly worked with Xuemei on Wednesday office hours from 3-6 pm. I really liked having this session versus the 1-hour time slots, because there were times when I really needed 2 continuous hours worth of help on the homework.",
    "I did not think that the quality of the TA help was sufficient so I stopped going to the TAs early on and just went to the instructor. He was always glad to help, very patient, and very friendly. The instructor was hard to reach over email though.",

    "The info sessions hosted by both TA and professor were extremely helpful. The class would've been very difficult w\/out them.",
    "TA sessions ought to have online sign up shifts. The same way the meetings with the professor are set online, having the TA sessions sign-up website will allow students to know how many people are expected, and if perhaps there will be need for extra sessions.This will give students an advantage when time managing. For example, I have been in TA sessions where 15 students are crammed in a small room in marsh, all trying to get answers from one TA. This was not efficient and ended up in people leaving without having their questions answered.",

    "I only took this course because I didn't feel my so so grade in my prior statistic course (C), would let me pass out of this MEM requirement. I don't think I will need to know this material to this extent, or even close to it, in my career path.",
    "I took this course to get a basic understanding of statistics. Data analysis is important in both science and policy fields and this course is a great introduction in obtaining data analysis skills.",
    "A requirement.",
    "I actually took this course because I am applying to SOM in January, and SOM admissions had advised me to take quantitatively-focused courses this semester. This might have been a course that I had opted not to take, only because the concepts initially overwhelm me. But, thank goodness I did take it, because I thinkthe basic understanding of Statistics that this course has provided and a familiarity with Minitab are real assets that I can foresee myself using in research projects and even as a consultant in the future.",
    "I wanted to take a refresher course since I hadn't taken statistics in over seven years.",
    "It was a class that I could have placed out of but I thought it would be a helpful refresher.",
    "Foundation course and wanted to solidify my statistical knowledge.",
    "Strongly suggested in MEM curriculum",
    "See above.",
    "Foundations course - probably would not have taken it otherwise.",
    "I took this course because I understand that Statistics, understanding its language and learning how to use its tools, is highly important for policy making and analysis of data in the environmental arena.While working, I had the opportunity to do other more interesting assignments and even coordinate projects if I had had received a better education in statistics from my undergrad. This time around, I believe a strong base has been set. I took this course because I wish to use statistical analysis in future jobs and use such data on the discussion table.",
    "I know it's very important to understand and know how to apply statistics in whatever I do.",
    "I wanted statistical knowledge and experience.",
    "I wanted to solidify my background in the subjects even though I had taken courses on related courses previously.",
    "See question 15.",
    "Its shame to graduate and not knowing stats. Almost all scientific literature with a number on on it has some statistic concept applied."

He mixes comedy and performance with teaching in a way I have never seen. And it is clear how much he cares about the students, wishes us well, and is proud and thankful to be teaching at FES. To make statistics fun is an achievement.",

    "Good to do the project in groups, it was helpful to exchange knowledge among the group.",
    "Discussion is helpful to enhance my understanding of the class content. Group study can be frustrated some time when your group memeber is not doing what they are supposed to.",
    "The final project was optionally a group project. My group was great, so I have no complaints, and I thought the project was much more manageable with multiple people working on it. I also learned things from others that I wouldn't have known (or thought about) otherwise.",
    "It was nice to discuss and compare results with friends because when you're dealingwith stat program, you can never be sure if you ended up with the right model.",
    "Working on the final project was like herding cats. I'd probably have learned more\/done a better job if I'd just done the work myself. That's always a danger with group dynamics and not a reflection of this course.",
    "I had a difficult time with the group assignment. My partner and I had very different work styles, and I felt like in the end I rewrote the entire paper because I wasn't happy with the work she did. We will remain good friends but will probably not work together again! I don't really see any advantage to having worked in a group on this assignment. There was a little bit of time saved in data analysis, but I don't think that was worth it.",
    "It was a great way to integrate the overarching lessons of the course.",
    "It was good to work with other people analyzing a different type of data, though it was a bit difficult to all get on the same page. I would say overall it was a positive experience.",
    "it was a great work to work with. we all learned from each other.",
    "Advantages: By doing teamwork, we learn to deal with people and we have the chance to manage greater ammounts of information.Disadvantages: Some end up working twice as hard as others.",
    "Group paper writing is particularly painful, per usual. I did appreciate the opportunity to collaborate and bounce ideas off one another.",
    "I worked in a group to solve the homework problem sets and to work on the final project. Working in groups made it easier to understand the concepts and problems that were assigned.",
    "Great to work with others. On areas where you don't feel strong, someone else will. Each of our strengths carried us through the project. And I got to know the other members of my group better than I knew them before.",
    "I really enjoyed completing the final project for this course as a group. There were many homework assignments that I completed as part of an informal homework group and we pretty much used that informal group as the basis for our final project group, so it was pretty easy to transition into the final project during a stressful finals period.",
    "- Advantages = you get to work with smart, talented people- Disadvantages = it's hard to coordinate meeting times when everyone has very different schedules",
    "The final group project was a fantastic way to apply the skills we gained over the course of the semester. It helped me understand how applying statistics to real-world problems requires flexibility, creativity, and persistence. I loved it.",
    "The advantages of working with a group was that we could delegate different parts of the work and learn from each other's area of experience (be it at work or academic).",
    "The final project was a good opportunity to apply what we'd learned in a \"real life\" setting rather than an exam which wouldn't test us in a way reflective of real life.",
    "It was very necessary for homework and studying.",
    "It was great because we worked in small groups on a project that could be easily divided up. It was also nice to go over statistical approaches with project partners.",

    "If you want to be reminded your rusty stat memory, it's your course. But if you are confident enough, don't take it!",
    "Go through the notes from lecture immediately after the lecture, and make sure you understand the concepts yourself. For me, I'd often understand the way JDRS explained it in class. However, when I looked at the notes on my own time (usually a week later), I'd struggle to remember what we talked about in class.If you stay on top of the notes, you should be fine.Also, sit near the front. Then you won't be distracted by all of the laptops in front of you. Trust me, it makes you much more attentive and less prone to listlessness.",
    "Work in groups on the problem sets. You'll learn a lot more and it'll be less frustrating. Don't sweat the 'valley of probability' - it'll get easier after you get through that part. Take advantage of office hours and review sessions! All hugely helpful.",
    "Go to the drop-in sessions, and do as much of the HW beforehand as you can, so you know what your questions are.",
    "Its a great way to learn intro statistics from a great professor if you've never taking it before.",
    "This is the class for you if you want to learn a little about the basics, especially basic theory of statistics. This is probably not the best course for you if you want to learn how to analyze your data more efficiently.",
    "take it seriously. It is very useful.",
    "Try to follow a textbook. Ask for organization of lectures.",
    "Consider trying to pass out of this class, or obtain an exception to the requirement, unless statistics is particularly relevant to your career plans. I'd suggest speaking with your established mentors (as I did) to determine if stats is relevant for your aspirations.",
    "1. Go to the minitab session2. Work in groups on the homework assignemnts.3. Do not fall behind. This course moves very quickly.",
    "Go to the office hours. Go to the TA hours: both are EXTREMELY helpful!",
    "If you have never taken Statistics before, this class will be challenging. Many of the lectures may be hard to follow and there will be a point in the semester (likely in the \"Valley of Probability\") when you might consider dropping the course, but don't do it! It does get much easier and intuitive and the actual information that you are learning starts to feel much more useful to whatever it is you hope to do after graduate school.",
    "It's entertaining but moves very, very quickly. If you don't need statistics for a research project then don't take this class.",
    "Use the optional textbook, and sign up for Prof Reuning-Scherer's office hours a lot. He's really helpful and smart.",
    "Review the course material each week so that it doesn't catch up with you when midterms\/projects come up.",
    "Go to the office hours!",
    "TA and professor-hosted help sessions are vital. They make life soo much easier.",
    "Get into class ready to take notes. The professor provides great handouts; USE THEM. Get a good pen, put your own notes around the handouts and have a cup of coffee ready to keep up with him.GO TO TA SESSIONS. These are so helfpul. My best way was to go to the Professor's session on Monday and then TA session on Wednesday for extra questions.Have fun!",
    "Get a good text book and read it too.",
    "Attend the lectures, do the problem sets, and you'll know what's going on.",
