    "If you are a singer (you don't even have to be good, the bar for getting credit is very low) and you have taken Music Theory, take this class to receive your free credit.",
    "It's voice lessons... You have 12 of them a semester for one hour, and a jury at the end of the semester. Highly recommend it.",
    "Do it! This helped my singing a lot.",
    "Take lessons for credit!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking voice lessons for credit if possible. It does not take too much time out of your schedule and is incredibly helpful.",
    "If you want to take formal voice lessons with great instructors, take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend voice lessons to another student. If you are serious about singing, you are no doubt spending time practicing and\/or performing in ensembles, so why not improve your craft. A piece of advice: just know going in that they are going to be operatic lessons so if you have no interest at all learning to sing classically, you probably won't like them.",
    "Absolutely. Free lessons are worth it.",
    "Voice Lessons for free and a credit. What's not to love? Just beware 205 is required for the first semester and 210 for the second semester.",
    "ENGL 120 is an excellent class. Mr. Ball is a top-of-the-line professor who makes his instruction easy to understand, to remember, and to apply. He takes great care to return your work with plenty of feedback. He does have a high standard for writing, which makes the class both difficult and rewarding. I became very close with my English class, partially due to the intimate writing topics, but also due to the comfortable environment Mr. Ball cultivated. He also invited us over to his house for dinner at the end of a semester, which was the perfect ending to a highly-enriching, fun class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in singing at a higher level.",
    "First-term voice lessons for credit. Learn to sing for Yale credit =]."
