    "A GREAT language class! In one semester, I have gone from knowing NOTHING about Swahili (other than hakuna matata) to being able to make an 8-minute presentation. The workload is much less than other L1 courses, and the professor is a lot of fun. You also get to hear some of his interesting stories about East Africa. This course not only taught me about Swahili, but it piqued my interest in East Africa in general.",
    "Good intro. You have to do a ton of memorizing, much more so than learning grammatical concepts. Might be difficult for people who have trouble with rote memorization.",
    "For an intro language, Kiswahili is a pretty low workload and a lot of fun. The class gets pretty close, particularly given how many African Studies majors there are taking all the same classes. However, grades are a mystery, as is Mwalimu--he's always smiling, but you can never read him...",
    "If you are going to be an African Studies major, take Swahili over Yoruba and Zulu if you are interested in traveling in more than one country.",
    "I definitely recommend it if you want to use the language in East Africa. It's a fun language to get to know and since it's Bantu it will presumably make learning more localized languages just a bit easier.",
    "It's a very interesting language. L1 does not have a lot of difficult grammar to learn, it's mostly learning vocabulary and tenses which rarely have irregulars. There is about one or two homeworks per week and one quiz every two weeks, which makes the course very manageable.",
    "Elementary Kiswahili is a great way to learn a linguistically beautiful language. If you are interested in a relaxed (though early morning) language course, definitely look into this one. If you don't like uncertainty, however, be warned that the course can seem disorganized and you won't know where you stand grade-wise."
