   "comments": [
    "I found that this was a solid course in introductory calculus.",
    "Practice midterms were a lot easier compared to the actual test. It wasn't very engaging you kinda just copy down what the teacher writes.",
    "Topics were breezed through in class as if we were expected to already know them. To do a better job of teaching would make this class more beneficial.",
    "Given that most people taking this class are likely not prospective math majors, I wish the course had focused on teaching the intuition and skills that could be useful outside of just math problems. As an econ major, it would have been much more useful to get an understanding of the calculus fundamentals; instead, the exams would relentlessly cover pretty specific trig, natural log, and exponential function properties that became a bigger challenge to learn than the actual rules of differentiation, integration etc.",
    "I think the course was designed very well, but I think differential equations should be explained more indepthly",
    "The strengths are having 2 midterms and a final as it allows you to be weaker in certain areas than others. The professor I had was very good. The weaknesses were the length of the early homework and these proved to be very stressful as they were graded very strictly.",
    "I think the course rushed over many complicated calculus topics in an attempt to cover enough material. Spending more time on complicated, yet important, topics would ensure better learning."

   "comments": [
    "I would say that this is a solid introductory calculus course, essential for building the foundations to math at Yale. I would recommend that students take this course before taking higher level calculus courses.",
    "Only if they already had a well built foundation in calculus, otherwise this course is extremely difficult.",
    "Honestly, I've heard people say math 115 is actually easier because of the way they teach it. I'm not sure. If you place into 112, don't assume it'll be easy just because it is an intro course.",
    "If you need math as a requirement then yeah",
    "This was not a fun course. It wasn't meant to be. So the recommendation means nothing if you need the prerequisite.",
    "I would, it is a good introduction to calculus",
    "Yes if you need to take math this is a good place to start.",
    "Yes, but be prepared to spend time learning on your own if you've never taken calculus before."
