    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student. I had never done any sort of playwriting before, but I found it was very eye-opening and formative for me. The plays that you read are classics, but it is an incredibly diverse and interesting reading list. Do the reading, do your writing every week, and you'll get a lot out of the course.",
    "A seminar-workshop hybrid, in which you read ~2 plays each week, discuss their structure and themes, and go straight into workshopping excerpts from your own plays.",
    "Good workshop format and a great reading list. Prof Margulies, Jireh, and the class were fantastic resourcesif you luck out with a great workshop group this class will be wonderful.",
    "You get to take playwriting with Margulies a brilliant, experienced, wonderfully kind playwright so why wouldn't you take it? You also get to read a boatload of plays that are almost as great being read as I imagine they would be being seen. And at the end, you come out with 45 pages-worth of your own play. Fabulous.",
    "A hit or miss. If you want to write, take it. It gives you an excuse to write 45 pages of a play. However, you have to be self-motivated. It is easy to let all the work pile up at the end. The \"workshop\" aspect of it was pretty ineffective given that each person had like 5 mintues for their work. The plays we read were great. If you already have a writing practice, I don't know if it is worth your time. Debateable.",
    "This class is what you should take if you want to be a playwright, or if youre even remotely interested in playwriting. This class is for you if you want to devote a semester immersed in everything playwriting: reading, writing, analyzing, peer reviewing, etc. Class consists of a weekly discussion of the play(s) you read for the week, followed typically by peer reviewing 5 page snippets of your play-in-progress or weekly exercise. You have the ability to learn playwriting not only from someone who has truly engaged with the craft, and who will give you individualized attention, but also from your classmates, which is a really rewarding structure for a creative class. It's especially great towards the end of the semester when you start to know your peers' plays and characters, just as well as they know yours, which makes workshopping and discussion particularly helpful. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "An extremely workshop heavy class with an emphasis on structure and tension. More of an extended conversation with one's peers than a class proper.",
    "Incredible class. One of my favorites in four years at Yale. As someone who is going into professional theater next year, this was the most informative and fun class I could have taken in my last semester. It is a ton of work. Perhaps more work than in any class I've taken at Yale. In part because I'm an extremely slow reader. But it is so worth it. I find myself constantly thinking about the lessons I've learned in this class, not only in the context of theater but just in seeing the drama in life all around and what makes something intriguing. Drama is everywhere. Prof. Margulies is fun-loving and insightful. A bit intimidating at first because he's such an epic human being. But, as the class goes on, you feel more and more at ease. I definitely wish I had put more work into my writing samples each week because I think I would have learned even more. Where else do you get a chance to write and be critiqued openly and comfortably by your peers and by a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright? It's also amazing how much Margulies cared about our work. Reading Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and analyzing the two versions of Act III was the best discussion. I only wished we got to read one of Margulies' plays. That would have been the cherry on top of it all. Overall, this is an enormous opportunity and I'm so glad I had the chance to take it. Definitely make use of his office hours and also the TF's. Take it if you can get in."
