   "comments": [
    "This is one of the worst MB&B courses I have had in part because the professors are not good at teaching difficult material. Professor Miranker is by far one of the worst and I dreaded going to his lecture series, which lasted almost a month. The exams are impossible and the teaching assistants make no attempt at being helpful. I would recommend another MB&B elective since there are so many other well taught classes. I have no plans on taking the second half of the courss. In some ways this class made me hate biophysics.",
    "If it weren't for Miranker's section of the class, I'd rate this class a \"very good\". Unfortunately, Miranker's section on NMR is so bad that it really makes me wonder whether this class was worth taking. The other professors are great. Be prepared to learn a LOT of material each class (or in Miranker's case, not learn it).",
    "Do not expect enlightenment from this class. It is a required class for first-year grad students. It does a decent job of re-introducing protein and nucleic acid structures and some structure-elucidation techniques (NMR, Mass-spec, X-ray) at an advanced level. Yong Xiong's lectures are usually excellent; Andrew Miranker's could be better.",
    "Take it if you are very interested. If not, opt for something else.",
    "Yeah, although it is a tough class, but I learned a lot and is acutally appling some of it to my research",
    "Macromolecular Structure includes aspects of protein and nucleic acid structure, and it also covers Mass Spec, NMR and X-ray crystallography. You get a lot of information out of the class, but the problem sets and exams can be rough. Some problem sets require you to look up information outside of the material covered in class or, in cases of PyMol usage, to look up commands for the program (since they\u0092re not covered in class). This can get tedious or frustrating at times, but you do get some knowledge of how to navigate the program. The exams especially have questions ranging from lecture material regurgitation to really original thinking based on combining material from different parts of the course. It\u0092s difficult and you learn a lot, but if they don\u0092t streamline the course, I\u0092m not sure I can say I really recommend it."
