   "comments": [
    "I learned more about the language, literacy, and play components of child development in this course.",
    "I learned the tenants of Child Development in regards to the three concepts, and how they interact and depend on each other through early childhood. I then observed this directly at the daycare",
    "I learned so much about the importance of play in children and their language development. It was so fun and helpful to actually be able to observe in the day care setting!",
    "I developed a much deeper understanding of the way that a childhood development classroom should be set up, organized, and the curriculum that best enhances language and literacy development.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about childhood development and the manners in which play influences cognitive and social growth. I have a much clearer understanding of childhood literacy programs, and I have seen firsthand the importance of teaching strategies for childhood development.",
    "This course teachers students to engage with the readings through practical classroom observations. I learned how to be a conscious observer, trying not to engage too much in classroom interactions so I could understand how the theory of what we had been learning was applied.",
    "I learned so much about the importance of play in early childhood development. In addition, literacy is not just the act of reading. There are so many play activities that build literacy skills. Letting children come to reading through these activities will foster a love for it.",
    "I learned a lot about how children learn and how it goes beyond what you would expect. Play is essential!",
    "Observational Skills Memory and Interpretation of observations Opinions guided by theory and observation\/practice Thinking Critically about play and realizing its importance New ideas to raise my future children to promote wellbeing",
    "Conducting observations on kindergarten classrooms, and recognizing the complex ways in which children learn via play and language."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I cannot think of anything that could be improved. This course was great! I looked forward to this course and my observations in the preschool classroom every single week this semester.",
    "The strengths are the variety of guest lectures and that we were able to observe in the day care.",
    "The strengths of this class are the hands-on experience in the classroom and the professors. I have no real meaningful weaknesses for this class.",
    "This course neatly integrates the readings, lectures, class discussions, and observations so that we are witnessing firsthand evidence of the topics we are studying. The observations were a highlight of this class and of my semester in general; the children consistently surprised me and left me in a better mood! It might have been nice to have more discussions in class with others observing within the same classroom, but we were able to meet outside of class once to discuss our observations.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is the observation component and the quality of instruction from Professors Horwitz and Close. The guest speakers were also really wonderful.",
    "I think it was definitely a well-designed syllabus. A lot of guest lectures, which meant that people did not necessarily do the readings because there was no pressure to participate. The three year olds' teacher and the kindergarten teacher came in for their own lectures, and it might have been nice to have the preschool teacher come in as well.",
    "Strengths: Final presentations each about unique child - learn about different children and ages in the day care that I didn't see. Journal entries as a way of synthesizing info and observations Observing at Headstart Good guest lecturers Weaknesses: Readings could be more balanced in length throughout semester More time for Q\/A with guest lecturers More meetings with small groups before assignments before assignments. Maybe before journal entries also.",
    "The only weakness was the weekly trek up to Calvin Hill; aside from that this course was awesome!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely. This course was by far one of my favorites at Yale. I can tell that I will apply what I learned in this course to my life and potential career working with children in the future.",
    "Yes I would recommend this because it is so fun and interesting and I learned so much!",
    "Absolutely yes. But I would advise to take this class if you have a true passion to work with children and learn more about their development. The group of students in our class this year were very passionate about the course material and thus we were all able to get as much out of this class that it has to offer and enjoy the process.",
    "Absolutely!! Not only did I learn a ton about child development, but I truly enjoyed all aspects of the class. The readings are interesting, the guest lecturers were fascinating, the professors are brilliant, and the observations are incredibly rewarding.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in education or child development. Observing in the classrooms at Calvin Hill and our class discussions became the best parts of my week without a doubt.",
    "Definitely! There's really nothing better than taking some time each week out of the Yale bubble and playing with kids. I would say that is the main attraction of the class.",
    "Definitely take it if you get in! You'll learn a lot, and the workload isn't heavy as long as you don't procrastinate your journals.",
    "This class is amazing! It is a commitment - early morning hikes up to Calvin Hill (past Div school) at least once a week, and a fair amount of reading. However, it has been my happiest class at Yale - it is hard to be sad or in a bad mood after learning about child development, and observing at the day care. You will eventually follow one child and their progress, and get very attached to their language, literacy, and social development. Honestly, even waking up early enough to observe at an 8am slot is worth it, and you will always leave feeling better, more grounded, and inspired by the kids. Journal Entries and Final Presentation are as fun as assignments can be. Advice: write journal entries as early after observation as possible\/take really good notes on what child says.",
    "Yes! It's a great course taught by great professors!"
