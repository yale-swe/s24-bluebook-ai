    "Interesting content, lots of reading but definitely worth it! Will improve your Latin also. Good amount of tests and extra assignments to keep up your grade.",
    "If you are interested in reading a wide variety of authors and genres for a single theme, take this class! Its syllabus is well-chosen and class is engaging and collaborative.",
    "Ben was absolutely wonderful! I found the translations to be very heavy at the beginning and still quite a lot towards the end. It definitely was much more intensive than anticipated. However, I feel that the pace at which I am able to translate has rapidly picked up. Very fair course!",
    "Challenging but very doable course. It's as it's meant to be - a bridge course, between L4 and L5. I would definitely recommend it to another student - whether you're doing it as a language requirement and need to take it or whether you're majoring in classics and want to learn more about this particular subject."
