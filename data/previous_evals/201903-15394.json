   "comments": [
    "This course was amazing! I learned so much new vocabulary related to postcolonialism, but it was also really interdisciplinary. I learned how to analyze fictional works not only in a literary context but in the context of urban studies as well.",
    "I learned so much in this class! We read books from a variety of geographic regions and perspectives, and I learned how to understand the ways that colonial and postcolonial project operate differently in different areas.",
    "Critical thinking across disciplines, how to think of the city as an important site of knowledge production",
    "This class covered many broad themes using novels. Overall, I came in not knowing exactly what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised with what I ended with. Every class discussion was really great. People spoke about how colonialism affected both the colonizer and colonized city in a way that brought us to touch many different topics and all through novels (and some theoretical works) which was fun.",
    "I got to read a lot of interesting books",
    "I learned a lot about the nature of cities and how spatial organization can affect the political climate of a city.",
    "Through literature, I learned more about the different spaces of the postcolonial city and the nuanced subjectivities and possibilities within it. We read really great books every week that generated interesting discussions on more specific themes.",
    "I felt like I now think of literature as a critical way to understanding and experiencing the city. The class taught me how to develop new understandings of place that are rooted in the richness and complexity of human experience versus the sometimes distant and flattening eye of hard urban studies theory."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: I LOVE PROFESSOR HABCHI. She was such an amazing, caring professor, and she brought in such a unique perspective into class every single time while also stepping back and letting us discuss and bring in our ideas. I really loved the presentations that everyone had to give. Weaknesses: Nothing really. I wish this class met more often! I also wish we had been introduced to some urban studies vocabulary and theory earlier in the course, but I also feel like I got a good understanding by listening to everyone explain it.",
    "Strengths: syllabus, professor, conversations, workload Weaknesses: none!",
    "I would have liked some more theory to support my understanding of some of the more challenging novels",
    "Sometimes the discussions went on tangents that didn't really relate to the broad themes at hand. Still, everything was interesting. Perhaps more theoretical work to anchor the discussions, or a clearer roadmap of where the discussion should go - maybe through questions?",
    "Strengths, a lot of interesting books on the syllabus, weaknesses: I wish we had more chances to come to conclusions ourselves instead of being pushed towards specific conclusions",
    "Of course I liked some books more than others, but really each book is great and enjoyable, but the real gem of this course is Professor Habchi and her abilities to guide students through the work and great discussions every week. It was much more accessible and more interesting for me to discuss the city through fiction than just looking at real world case studies or dense theory.",
    "MORE CLASSES LIKE THIS!!! this is the urban studies energy we need in 2020 and beyond. Building theories of the city from literature and films was so powerful. Really made me rethink how I use theory to explain urban space, rather than looking closer at the medias\/arts of the city as a theory of its own. Would love to half a little more time to discuss the books, and perhaps establish a common ground of understanding, or at least present on our backgrounds. the minds in this class were all brilliant."

    "If you are interested in literature, urban studies, science, literally anything, you will love this course!",
    "YES! take this course! Prof. Habchi is absolutely amazing, and you learn so much! There is so much freedom to explore your interests in the papers as well.",
    "Yes!! Super fascinating and Fadila is wonderful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Habchi is a wonderful professor and this class is a great opportunity to read a diverse set of novels and look at postcolonialism through a different lense.",
    "YES! If Fadila is teaching.",
    "Totally! Whether you have a lot of background in postcolonial theory or not this class allows you to tackle different themes like identity and belonging in the city while reading amazing novels.",
    "Yes, if you want to read interesting novels",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who's interested urban studies and likes reading and talking about books.",
    "if you like critical urban studies and ethnic studies this is the place to be. makes you think flexibility and interdisciplinarily, if that is a word. Plus prof. Habchi is so wise and funny and smart. be ready to commit to the books though. They are fantastic crystallised experiences in and of place and reading them closely will teach you so much."
