    "AMST 435 is a seminar in which you study how inequality is institutionalized in American society--the different institutions that perpetuate inequality, the ideology that drives those institutions, and the experiences of people caught in their midst. It is a conceptually difficult class, but I think you learn concepts that are really important to try to grasp. I would 100% definitely recommend the class! You have the experience that I think every college student should--thinking through all your basic assumptions about American society--and you do it in a diverse class where people bring their own backgrounds and perspective to bare.",
    "Of my six semester at Yale and of all the social science courses I have taken at Yale, this class was by far the best, the most disturbing, and the most enlightening course. No matter what major you are, YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE. This really changes the way you look at the world and challenges you to rethink about everything you have taken for granted. I am just sad that not everyone at Yale take this course. Each week, you read one book, normally an ethnography. The workload is not that heavy because the reading is always very enlightening and fascinating and digestible. You have to write a reading response and upload it to classesv2 the night before. These reading responses become very helpful when you have to write papers. You have to write three papers throughout the semester after each unit. Each paper is about 6-7 pages long. Writing the papers for this class is actually quite easy because the seminar discussions themselves are so helpful that, by the time you write a paper for the given unit, you have a very firm grasp. You simply have to articulate it in written form. What really made this course special was the fellow students. Their comments were truly enriching, and I thank Prof.Dudley for making this combination and also guiding us through each book and discussion. The structure of the course was really reasonable and worked very well; going-around at the beginning of the class not only gave each student an opportunity to share her\/his view, but also to get the meat of the discussion out. Lastly, Prof.Dudely alone is a very good reason to take the class. She's become my new hero. Her insights and her ability to guide the discussion are truly amazing. She really enabled me to see the world a little differently every week. Please take this class.",
    "Fabulous course that offers students a survey of experiences of economic injustice in the United States. Left the course with knowledge of nuanced case studies of inequality and improved vocabulary on the subject. The course is particularly interested in how institutions produce logic that defends structures of inequality. Highly recommended if you want to sharpen your anthropological toolkit or see some eye-opening case studies of the lived experience of inequality since the 1970s.",
    "This class was equal parts despair and inspiration. On the one hand, I felt like I left each book with a sense of helplessness: each system under consideration whether it was the system of prisons, immigration, mortgages, welfare etc. -- was made possible by capitalism, and after a semester of rigorous structural analysis, it seemed like we couldnt overhaul any of these systems without replacing capitalism itself. But on the other hand, Professor Dudley stressed the importance of putting daylight between ourselves and the systems around us and questioned the impulse to say that taking action and making a difference would be inherently better than this kind of awareness. This class completely transformed the way that I notice and process inequality: the ethnographic approach to inequality helped us honor the integrity and uniqueness of each kind of suffering we discussed, but the scope and momentum of the course asked us to look at the ways in which each system of inequality reinforced the other. And yet, this still doesnt convey how much this class mattered to me. This class changed the way that I researched: our discussions on people getting trapped in liminal space made me research how the qualifications for food stamps in Connecticut put you out of the running for certain housing vouchers in my Childcare, Society and Public Policy seminar. This class changed the way that I look at fine print: Im now hyper-attentive to moments when felons and illegal aliens are excluded, moments I would have sped-read through before. And this class changed the hopes that I have for myself: contrary to what my Yale admissions officer told me, I no longer see myself as qualified to make a difference in whatever way I choose. Instead, Im starting to see myself as indelibly marked by my social position, capable of helping some people and not others, and in need of teammates who can compensate for the shortcomings and blindspots that I wont be able to improve away."
