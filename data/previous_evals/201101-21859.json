    "Biggest thing about this class is the constant rotation of teachers - know that going in, you will have a different teacher almost every other lecture. This can get hectic and somewhat disorganized because there is no continuity between lectures and actually a lot of (sometimes contradictory) overlap. Overall, not recommended for taking.",
    "Sort of so-so. None of the instructors speak to each other, apparently, so no one is coordinated and all the material overlaps. And as to be expected, some of the instructors are good and others are unclear and\/or boring. The tests are sheer memorization-based, so if you can make yourself study for twelve hours for each, you'll do excellently, but if you (like I) find it mind-numbing to memorize hormone acronyms, you might do embarrassingly badly on midterms.",
    "The class was very interesting and informative. It was nice that the lecturers who taught each portion of the class were actually conducting research in those fields, but that also made the class feel disjointed. There are 3 exams and no finals, so it was great to finish early. I would recommend this class if you are interested in the biology of reproduction. It was a fun class for me.",
    "averages are really high",
    "TAKE IT. A lot of people were frustrating with having a billion guest lecturers, but I thought that was the strongest part of the class. It's fascinating knowing you are being taught by experts in the field, who actually practice what they are teaching us everyday.",
    "easiest science class i have ever taken at yale. you dont have to do any reading, just study the day before each test. averages are pretty high though",
    "Great class! Super interesting! You learn a lot, and the course load is not bad!",
    "Take it if you are a science\/biology major. If you are trying to fulfill a science requirement, then reconsider it. Thework load is not bad at all, lectures (3 times\/week) and three midterms. BUT know that this class is full of premeds and they will ALWAYS do better than you, regardless of how much you study so why worry about getting a bad grade when you can fulfill your requirement with something easier.",
    "Really great course. One of the easier upper level bio courses.",
    "Take it, it's fun. But it's NOT an easy or gut course. You have to work. The curve is tough.",
    "Take it if you are really interested in the subject material, but know that you will have to work very hard to do well",
    "Repro Bio is a really interesting class with minimal work. Your whole grade is made up of 3 midterms (no final!), but if you go to all the lectures and keep up with the reading, the tests are not a big deal. The class is generally made up of guest lecturers from the med school (Klein and Taylor lectured a few times), most of whom are experts in their field and present some really good material. This is definitely a great elective for the bio major!",
    "This course gave a great overview of reproduction from start to finish. We began with the differentiation of the sexes in the embryo and fetus and progressed all the way through menopause. I would definitely recommend this course, especially to students interested in going into medicine.",
    "The first 1\/3 of this course is pretty boring, but the final 2\/3 are fascinating. The course suffers from having mediocre professors in charge of it, and the huge number of guest lecturers (over 15 this year) is a problem. The guest lecturers range from horrible to phenomenal (my favorites were Kliman and Minkin). MCDB 240 could be INCREDIBLE, but right now it's only average. Still, take it if you're interested because this is important stuff (for scientists, premeds, other people, etc.)",
    "If you are premed or bio, then take it, it is much better than most of the science classes out there. However, I wouldn't recommend it to a non-science major.",
    "Yes, great science class\/credit. Although exams can be tricky.",
    "As Credit\/D yes. The curve is beyond weird, the tests are basically based on trivia that you can miss if you do not take good notes.",
    "Yes!",
    "This was a really interesting class. It also was very little work. You really only have to go to lecture and study a lot right before the 3 tests. Also, no final. There is a lot of great material and most of the lecturers are good, but there can sometimes be overlap since they don't know exactly what we've already learned. This is a fun class to take with friends.",
    "yeah take it. you really learn a lot of useful information. I enjoyed it ( although some of the lecturers were awful- there are guest lecturers every day )",
    "I would definitely recommend Repro Bio to other students. It was my favorite biology class I have taken at Yale. We learned from experts in the field, mostly physicians and researchers at the Yale School of Medicine. The lectures are interesting and the format of the class (3 tests, no final) is great!",
    "A course on Repro Bio, from sex, through embryonic development, with some stuff about STDs, contraception, sexual disorders. But not in that order. I'd recommend it as a pre-med, but be ready to memorize all the words on all the slides. You don't have to read the book if you take great notes in lecture. But you have to go to lecture.",
    "interesting array of material regarding reproductive biology, recommend if you need it but it's a good course overall",
    "It's a very interesting class, and not difficult at all - don't take it if you want something academically rigorous, though!",
    "This is an awesome class - please take it! You will learn so much about repro bio, and most of the lectures are really interesting. Some of the introductory lectures can be a bit boring, but that is just because they cover material that you probably already learned in your intro bio classes. The second and third portions of the course have some really cool topics. The tests are manageable and easy to study for, and there is no final, so it's the perfect course to tack on to a heavy load if you still need a bio elective.",
    "I would recommend the course for science and non-science majors. It covers a broad spectrum of topics related to the reproductive sciences and includes topics of varying degrees of intensity.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for another student - be it a biology major or not. The workload is just right, the material is by far some of the best I have encountered in a biology course (except for the last five lectures which are a little bit fluffy when they get to sexual desire, contraception, STDs, etc). I loved having rotating teachers.",
    "Lecture style is different because it is always a guest lecturer",
    "Absolutely! This was a very interesting course! I loved the material, it was a great break from the more traditional molecular bio stuff that is taught at Yale. The teachers are all faculty at Yale Med, so it is always cool to hear the specialists and see how the academics relate to real life. Not hard at all! (Coming from a pre-med humanities major)",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. You just have to go to the lectures to do well on the exams but the class average is pretty high.",
    "MCDB 240, aka Repro, was a great class. Some may say it's a gut, I say it's not. The tests cover lecture material only. You should memorize everything on every slide (not really, but really). Instead of using the textbook, which is of no great use, I just went to both TA sections instead. That is why I did well (or at least I think I did...we'll see in a minute).As far as the material in the class, it covers a lot of amazing things. I can truly say that I learned A LOT during the course of the semester. You should definitely take it.",
    "definitely. esp if youre premed.. the lab was great.",
    "Good elective bio course; interesting lectures by med school faculty who are experts in their field. Actually useful information, especially for the women. I enjoyed it a lot. Beware of the tests though, they are quite tricky and you really do need to study hard. Good luck!",
    "Did you know that amniotic fluid is almost entirely fetal urine? Did you know that to ensure proper lung development the fetus will inhale this fluid to strengthen their diaphragm and expand their alveolar sacs? This means that when you were a fetus, you inhaled a lot of your own pee.If you like learning things like this, and about hormone feedback loops, I think you'd like this class. It is not a gut, THIS CLASS IS NOT PORN IN THE MORN, this is a real science, MCDB class, but if you're ok with that I think this class is awesome.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the subject. Make sure you study the right material. Not much work but you have to study hard for the tests because you never know what questions will be on them.",
    "A great overview course in reproductive biology. Touches on a lot of topics, and very interesting when taken in conjunction with another bio course, as there will be a lot of random overlap! You also learn a lot about the endocrine system too.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student. The topics covered are very interesting, and the guest lecturers are experts in their fields, which makes learning from them even more engaging.",
    "I would recommend this as a relatively easy biology course.",
    "Course syllabus seems a bit random and all over the place. Not the course where you learn the most, but it is interesting.",
    "NOT A GUT. This class is not easy by any means, even for a premed. You have to study a lot and even then, may not do well. The exam average is usually pretty high and the wording is often confusing.The bright side is that the lectures were actually really interesting. If not for the confusing and surprisingly difficult exams, I would have really enjoyed this class.",
    "Minimum work except for studying for the exams. You learn a lot about pregnancy, birth, etc. I would recommend this course even though there is a different teacher almost every day.",
    "Not a lot of work, but definitely not an easy class. The information is pretty interesting, and it's a pretty good class. The tests are pretty difficult, and the averages are usually really high. Most of the semester, the class is low stress, just make sure you go to lecture 'cause all of the information is given in the lectures. Don't bother in buying the book, I didn't get it, and the tests are based off of the lectures anyway.",
    "I really enjoyed this class because I liked learning about the topics presented in class. I would definitely recommend this class because it's pretty easy (no homework, no need to do the reading if you listen in lectures), and many of the lecturers are great. A few of the lecturers were incredibly boring, but overall, the lectures were good.",
    "MCDB 240 is an interesting class in which you learn pretty much everything you wanted to know about the biology behind reproduction. The class features an array of lecturers, some of whom are more engaging than others. While it allows you to really get a taste for the topics from the best people in the field, some of the lecturers speed by way too fast, while others seem to provide information that can simply be read off of the slides. The tests are not too difficult and the averages are high, so it is worth learning the material. It is also worth knowing that there are a few questions that are asked on every exam that are unfair minutae that you should be prepared to know.",
    "I LOVED this course.1. It's an easy science credit. Definitely not a gut because no sciences are guts. But it's much easier than, say, genetics. I mean, in some lectures we were given a list of common STDs and contraception.2. You get to hear from a new lecturer every class, who specializes in that field at Yale-New Haven. They are fascinating, just like the subject itself.",
    "I recommend MCDB 240 to any student interested in a fun and relatively relaxed biology course. The variety of lecturers and material keeps the course fresh throughout the semester, and the lectures are posted online in case you miss any. The workload is minimal as there are only 3 midterm exams and no final!",
    "If you need a bio class or want to learn about human reproduction, TAKE IT! It was fascinating and taught well.",
    "Don't take this unless you really want to or have to. The classes were boring and not coherent, which made studying less enjoyable.",
    "I took repro bio because I'm anon-science major who still wanted to take a legitimate science class. Overall, it fulfilled this purpose, and some of the guest lecturers were absolutely wonderful and engaging. At times, however, a lot of the material was repetitive of seemed like common sense, and the exams were purely memorization and required no critical thinking. However, it is a good fifth class in that it requires no work outside of taking good lecture notes and studying for the three, non-cumulative midterms.",
    "I would recommend Repro Bio as a really straightforward science class on a very interesting subject. Though it can be a bit dry at times, you will come away learning a great deal in a painless manner. Some outstanding lecturers in the bunch that make me want to take their class.",
    "I'm a lit major and took Repro for the science credit. The guts looked terrible and I had always enjoyed biology in high school, so I decided to brave the pre-med curve and take the class. It turned out to be my favorite class of the semester, and not because I showed up all the time\/did particularly well in it. In fact, I scored about 10 points below the curve on both of the first tests (~85% class mean) and doubt I did much better on the third exam. My studying consisted largely of cramming (from my notes, slideshows, and wikipedia--didn't buy or look at the textbook) in the days\/night before the tests, so all things considered I got what I deserved. My final grade was fine (B) so apparently the final curve isn't so bad. But, the truth is, I would've been OK with a significantly lower grade-- maybe I'm just disillusioned with the humanities, but I got more out of this class than I did any other this term. This stuff is super cool and 100% real. I enjoyed studying, I appreciate all that I learned, and I only wish I had taken it more seriously from the outset.Moral of the story for the non-science majors: if you know you like science deep down, take this class. Don't be a lazy bum; hike up Science \"Hill\" and give yourself a chance to learn a few facts about how we're made before you graduate and never take a real science class again.",
    "Repro bio is a fun and interesting course -- it's fun to learn about the reproductive systems, stem cells, IVF, etc. I'd definitely recommend it to someone who is looking for a good introductory biology course. However, the lecturers are somewhat spotty -- some are phenomenal, and some arejust so-so -- and they don't seem to coordinate much, and so occasionally someone will re-teach material that someone else has already taught this semester. (Hopefully this will change next year, though.) The workload is very manageable -- 3 non-cumulative exams -- but you do have to put real time and effort into studying for the tests.",
    "It is harder than you think. The class is big, the average is high. expect to study hard for each test. This is coming from someone who has already taken biochem and cell bio",
    "This class sucks. If you can, take the Reproductive Biology freshman seminar instead. If you are just looking for a bio credit, there are many better, easier, and more interesting options.",
    "The material is interesting, but the manner in which it is presented is inconsistent at best. There are no problem sets, mandatory section, or quizzes, and there is not a final. This means that your entire grade rests on 3 in-class exams which can (and do) cover \/anything\/ that was said in class.",
    "This is a great course for both biology and other majors. It's not too in-depth and involved the push away non-science majors, but pertinent enough to biology (and material covered in the MCAT) to be of significance for biology\/pre-medicine majors.",
    "Great class! The topics discussed are interesting and relevant. A different lecturer every week or so, and some were obviously better than others, but they were fairly cohesive. No final, but the 3 midterms (multiple choice + fill in the blank + true\/false) were tricky and the averages were always pretty high, probably because a lot of pre-meds are in there. My favorite bio class so far (compared to cell bio and molecular bio), although my grade probably won't be that great.",
    "Absolutely. It is very informative and distinct from other biology courses.",
    "The material in the beginning of the semester is very easy and basic. After the first midterm, things get more interesting. The main weakness of the class is that there are so many lecturers who, it seems, don't really pay attention to what all the others are covering. It's cool because they are all specialists in their fields, but they spend a lot of time overlapping with each other.The tests are very easy if you study for them. Mostly multiple choice and T\/F, and pretty regurgitative. Don't think you can go in without studying because the questions are sometimes quite specific.Also, DO NOT BUY THE BOOKS. The material covered in the exams is all you will be tested on, and the lecturers diverge so much from the books that it is literally counter-productive to do the reading. You'll be wasting your money if you do.Very little work, except around exam time. No final.",
    "Alright, here's the deal: it all depends on your learning style. This class features mostly guest lecturers at the top of their field coming in to teach about different aspects of reproductive biology in humans. There are three tests total (no final) and these three tests include a variety of question types, like multiple choice, fill in the blank, true or false, etc. To me, this was heaven. I did not care that some lecturers were better than others, or that the test was sortof random. I loved having people who actually practice in the hospital and teach at the med school addressing our class. If you are someone who needs consistency, this is not for you. The only weaknesses of the course are that since the guest lecturers are never sure of what you've already covered, sometimes they go over previously learned material. Also, the test questions can get tremendously specific, though I found that they are relatively easy to predict, which made studying for the tests easier. I'd recommend it to anyone, though a little knowledge of basic biology moved things along a lot quicker. Also, you do not need the textbook.",
    "This class only has 3 tests and no final which is really nice. The course doesn't involve too much work and the tests aren't too bad if you've kept up with the lectures",
    "An easier biology course but it's really important to go to class. The reading isn't as crucial because the material tested is discussed in the lectures. However, the reading does provide a helpful context and background info. Definitely take it if you need another biology course.",
    "Yes, not a walk in the park but interesting. taught by a crew of medical school faculty and kind of like a medical school course.",
    "Sure",
    "I think this class has potential to be really interesting (I'm really interested in reproductive health) but I think that the structure (different people teach different lectures) can make it really hit or miss. Some lecturers were great, others were quite boring. I also was stunned by how much harder the tests felt than I was expecting them to be, although the averages were relatively high so I might have been alone in that.",
    "Yes, most certainly."
