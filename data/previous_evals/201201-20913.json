    "Yes, I highly recommend this course. Even if one does not possess a strong background in mechanics, this course lays down an excellent foundation of knowledge and builds upon it in a clear and well organized manner.",
    "ENAS 554 01 is a wonderful introductory course in continuum mechanics with special focus on the aspects that find application in biomechanics. I would definitely recommend this class to all the students that want to deepen their knowledge of mechanics.",
    "Solid course for any BME student. Would highly recommend to any student. Provides a solid foundation for other mechanics or mechanobiological centered courses.",
    "This course was intended to provide an overview of the fundamental topics necessary for understanding and formulating problems in biomechanics. Throughout the course, lectures included tensor calculus, balance postulates, constitutive formulation, and special topics in growth and remodeling processes. I would recommend this course to students interested in biomechanics because the course outlines the necessary tools for understanding this field."

   "comments": [
    "The mechanical information that I learned will serve as a useful testing in any mechanics that I plan on using in my research. Jay often included useful and practical information on framing experiments and linking real data with theory.",
    "I think this course will prove to be incredibly helpful for my final dissertation. The principles I learned will guide me throughout my research activities",
    "Highly relevant to my dissertation, furthered my understanding of the subject.",
    "This course was very beneficial for my current dissertation research due to the fact that the course provides a basis for the fundamentals of biomechanics research, including mathematical preliminaries, balance relations, and constitutive modeling. Overall, the course will greatly contribute to my research."
