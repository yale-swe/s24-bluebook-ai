   "comments": [
    "This is the second course in a two part sequence on formal models with applications to political science. The course is very fast paced and covers a great deal of material, with a heavy emphasis on game theory and its application. I would recommend the course to graduate students who have taken the first formal modelling course. However, you can still take the course without taking the first modelling course if you are from a different department and many students said the first course was not necessary to succeed here.",
    "If you take this course, you, too, will be able to answer the question \"What would Mr. Miyagi do?\" If you study IR, you should probably* know game theory. So take it. *by probably, I mean really, really, really.",
    "Great course--would recommend.",
    "Best class in game theory I can recommend in t school",
    "518 helps you build the skills to solve basic problems involving game theory and become a better reader of game theoretic models. I felt like it left me pretty far from the goal of being able to construct models of my own, but it was still useful.",
    "A great graduate-level introduction to game theory that focuses on the most widely applied concepts in the literature (and probably the real world)."

    "definitely helpful for preparing me for being a legitimate IR scholar (not quite there yet but knowing game theory helps a lot!)",
    "While perhaps not directly applicable, the thought-process and application of logic will be very helpful in future classes and research.",
    "See above.",
    "I was able to identify thesis wuestion through this course paper",
    "I think it made me a better reader and it gave me a few structured ways of thinking about problems related to politics. In that sense, I hope that it helps with my dissertation, but I'm not sure yet.",
    "Much better understanding of game theory in papers",
    "It helped a lot by applying concepts to political problems while presenting new and interesting concepts and reviewing previously known material."
