   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class. The reading load is significant but most of it prepares you for \"future\" archaeology classes you might (or might not) take. Lecture is not very interesting because the Professor's powerpoints have a ton of text and you spend the whole time trying to frantically copy it all down. Most of the lectures teach to what will come up in the future and it is a little difficult to follow what is actually being taught that day.",
    "I liked the course and I feel like it had a lot of potential. The slides are not online which makes it a lot harder to study, but the exams aren't too bad.",
    "Take this class if you need a 5th or a low key 4th. Underhill is nice and the material isn't too bad. Just make sure you go to class.",
    "I would tell a fellow student to never take this class. It is not at all what you think it is going to be. The tests are bogus. The essays are not graded fairly, and you don't learn anything of value.",
    "It is an easy survey course for archaeology\/ anthropology - the only work was a midterm exam and a non cumulative final exam (1.5 hours)",
    "Take it! Very enjoyable class with an amazing professor!",
    "It's a pretty decent class, and even though Professor Underhill talks to you like you're a middle schooler sometimes, it's still worth it. It is just a survey, though, so don't get your hopes too high.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course! The readings are a bit lengthy but the subject material is very interesting. Lectures were very informative and directly related to reading assignments.You will learn a great deal about various world civilizations as well as the archaeological methods used to discover what life was like for the inhabitants of these civilizations.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, but only if you have a solid interest in archaeology. If you are just interested in the history portion, look elsewhere. This class will teach you how we learned what you read about in an ancient history textbook.",
    "Great intro class - easy and interesting. But lacked cohesion - Prof. Underhill tries to covers ALL human activity since the dawn of time, and in all world areas. It's impossible. Also, if you are looking to study the big civilizations like Egyptians\/Aztecs etc, then be prepared that this is only a small part of the course - it predominantly focuses on the emergence of agriculture and pottery etc, in earlier time periods. For example in the exams, we were asked to know about small sites in China, but not required to know anything about the Incas. Professor Underhill is so nice though - and you can't help but smile when she presents the information with such happiness.",
    "The class was a broad survey of ancient civilizations (mostly prehistoric). It's a very solid choice if you're interested in expanding your knowledge of ancient history beyond ancient Greece or Rome.Professor Underhill is a good instructor and very helpful with the content of the course.The class is well structured and balanced throughout the semester. You'll definitely want to keep up with the reading as a lot of material is covered. Assignments and exams were totally reasonable. Definitely worth taking!",
    "Anthropology 171 is an overview of the major archaeological sites known to man. If you would like to obtain a broad overview of archaeology, you should take this course. However, if you are more interested in understanding a few sites in great detail, I would probably take a more specialized course. Professor Underhill is very enthusiastic about her subject area.",
    "I would say that it was a good introduction to archaeology and many of the early world civilizations. I would recommend it to all students looking to see what archaeology is like.",
    "Yes- kind of boring at times and lectures we're a bit dry but it was alright overall",
    "Take this class if you are looking for an easy class. Do not take it if you are looking to get alot of out it.",
    "Professor Underhill is one of the nicest professors I have met at Yale. She is more than willing to talk outside of class or to help you if you are sick and have to miss class. She also definitely cares about her students and about archaeology and wants to make the class as effective as possible. I enjoyed getting to know the early history of man\u0097we started about million years ago and slowly worked our way up to actual civilizations. However, things began to drag a bit, especially once we hit the civilizations units. This is a survey class, and often we would zip through an entire civilization, or several civilizations, in a single class, which meant there was little time to really get to know the subject well. We would discuss a site and then move on to a site that seemed extremely similar\u0097sites and dates began to blur together. There was a fair amount of reading (not too bad)\u0097and I think the more you do of it, the clearer the classes become. Also, this was Prof. Underhill\u0092s first year teaching the class, and I\u0092d imagine she\u0092ll try to keep improving it in future years. I\u0092m not sure I\u0092d take it again knowing what I know now, but that said, I didn\u0092t do enough of the reading and I\u0092m confident Prof. Underhill will be trying to improve the class and make it more dynamic.",
    "It's about archaeology in reference to very early civilizations. Don't expect all the \"greats\".",
    "I would probably recommend this course to another student, especially if they have an interest in early human history. However, the class is heavy on reading and detail. This is an intro but not a gut. Do the readings, attend lectures, and you can do well. I felt as if I learned enough from the class to justify suggesting it to another student."
