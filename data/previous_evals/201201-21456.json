    "Here's my problem with this class: the course material is fascinating, but the class isn't very organized at all.I'm lucky because I had prior linguistics exposure, so it wasn't too confusing for me, but some of my classmates hadn't had any experience and I don't know how well they held up with all the terms being thrown at them (especially considering the fact that this is a freshman seminar, not an advanced course).Even now that the course is finished, I'm still not entirely clear on what was expected of me. The professor and TA didn't always do the best job of making it clear what they wanted before the assignments were due -- more than once, we got assignments back and only then were told what we could have done better.That said, I think you learn a lot. There just needs to be better organization and clearer expectations. The topics are interesting and varied. Oh, and you come away knowing how to do a great Southern accent.",
    "Ling 009 explores the different dialects amongst the American people of today and the way they are similar and different. It also teaches you to think like a linguist and about the basics of the field.",
    "This freshman seminar is a really good way to get to see what is going on today in linguistics research. In addition, it is generally a good introductory course to the study of linguistics on the whole. However, I would still recommend taking Introduction to Linguistics either before or alongside this course; there were times where it was presumed that we had more knowledge in the subject than we did. I would still recommend this course to a fellow student, however; I learned some valuable lessons about my cultural identity from the way I speak.",
    "The class studied characteristics of different varieties of U.S. English and gave me a new way to look at speech from other regions. As a prospective linguistics major, I thought it was a great class (especially in conjunction with Intro to Linguistics). It gave me the introduction to linguistic articles and research experience that a lecture course lacks. I would also recommend it to non-linguistics majors. I think the different perspective it gives about dialects of English would be interesting and useful to anyone.",
    "This is NOT an intro. linguistics class. Many students taking this class were also taking Intro Linguistics but those who didn't were pretty much screwed. A lot more work than you might think and strange assignments too. I would not recommend this class unless you have a genuine interest in linguistics and have had prior experience with it.",
    "For me, this course was incredibly interesting and makes me think about languages and the ways people speak English in a new light.",
    "This class is a good deal of work, but if you find the subject matter interesting, go for it. Raffaella's a fine instructor, and the linguistic awareness this course develops is an especially thought-provoking skill.",
    "If you've ever wondered why people in the South (or anywhere else in the U.S. for that matter) speak with a different accent than you, take this class. You will learn A LOT. The workload is very manageable, and readings are very interesting. Take this class.",
    "A wonderful class to introduce linguistics and have engaging discussions."
