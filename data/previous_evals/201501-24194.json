    "It was a pretty good class. Professor Weir is by far the highlight, she's a really cool person that brings a lot of knowledge regarding her work in Northern Ireland. Not a great section leader, she kind of lets discussion drift randomly into the abyss sometimes. It's too bad she was only visiting. Overall, the class itself glossed over a lot of the basics of what one would expect a seminar on Terrorism to. Definitely a great course, very little work other than keeping up with the weekly readings, and you will come away with a lot of knowledge regarding such an important topic in the world today.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Weir is amazing. The workload can be a lot, but if you are interested in this course take it. So worth it. You learn so much about terrorism (everything you think you know will be challenged). I walked away from this course feeling like I learned a lot. I loved it so much.",
    "Great class a lot of reading and long reading summaries but really interesting !",
    "If you are interested in Terrorism and want a general survey course in a small setting, yes.",
    "This was an enlightening course. The readings were insightful and informative, and the professor had a great grasp on the material she was teaching. I enjoyed her flexibility in terms of paper topics, and I appreciated her commentary inside and outside of class. At the same time, I found the weekly reading summaries a waste of time, and I did not think she was an effective seminar\/discussion leader. As a visiting professor, I think she would have benefitted immensely from some guidance on how Yale seminars are typically structured and taught.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It really takes political discourse to a whole new level of awareness and challenges some of the most deeply-seeded intuitions that we have about terrorism and terrorists. It is also very accommodating of individual interests."
