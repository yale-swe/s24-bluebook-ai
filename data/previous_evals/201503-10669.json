    "This course was immensely helpful. I hope to continue to work on America's global presence, and Professor Van Vleck not only helped me with my research, but also provided an excellent introduction to the rapidly changing historiography of transnationalism.",
    "This course encouraged me to find and pursue projects that mean something to me. Depending on how things go for me--i.e., whether I am admitted to a PhD program--I anticipate this course provided a foundation for much of the research I hope to do. Actually, whether or not a PhD happens, I look forward to doing more with the project I began in this class!"
