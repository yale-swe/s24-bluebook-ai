   "comments": [
    "I developed a greater understanding of the liberal-democratic public sphere (LDPS, in our seminar's parlance), as it exists in both theory and practice, as well as an understanding of the role that different institutions including the press, governments, and corporations play in that sphere. I also developed a way of thinking about communities that I believe has profoundly changed how I understand the mission of humans living and working together. We often discussed the difference between distinterest and self-interest, and where they intersect. The intersection is what proved to me to be the important part.",
    "The syllabus introduced us to a host of insightful modern thinkers on the topics of journalism, liberalism, and democracy. It forced me to be reflective on my reading and to consider the real-life applications of what is at stake when the press isn't as free as we think.",
    "Journalism, Liberalism, Democracy is a course that requires you to synthesize. Professor Sleeper provides interesting (albeit, very many) readings on certain topics throughout the semester that are meant to shape your understanding of a well-functioning democracy and democratic public, eventually understanding how journalism can come into play in the democratic sphere. The class is structured for you to begin considering what each of the texts argues, and Professor Sleeper does a good job and providing direction for you to draw out the main points within each text. What this class allows you to learn is how successful democracies function and the role of the media in adding to this. There was a sense of urgency to this class, considering that it was taken in the midst of a presidential election. We covered the role of the individual citizen in a liberal democracy, the way deliberation must occur to produce a legitimate decision, the roles of nationalism and civic virtue, and how journalism is an establishment, as well art, that must advance democracy within the public sphere. Upon understanding these themes, they become apparent everywhere in politicsand I found myself understanding the true power and severity of a fair, democratic political system. Professor Sleeper is also an amazing writer and taking his class has also helped strengthen my own writing.",
    "Loved the content of the class, so important and I wish more people understood what qualities of a public sphere are necessary to keep it functioning well. I learned a lot through the repetition and referring to authors throughout the course. Citing authors is not a skill that I have previously had, and I think its useful to keep those readings in your mind. I also learned to be more rigorous on my deliverables. We had to have a high level of editing done before turning in our posts. I never had a professor be so demanding in that way, and frankly I think it was good for all of us. I didn't quite get the exams, because in a lot of ways, I don't think they do an accurate job of measuring what we have learned. I had an off day for the final, and I definitely did learn stuff from the second half of the term. I think that skill could have been practiced more through timed writes throughout the semester, perhaps for the posts.",
    "In a lot of ways, one of the biggest things this class taught me was how to think. I don't know if I could summarize all the lessons I learned even if I tried. I just didn't want to leave this box blank.",
    "This course taught me a lot about how politics, political systems, and media sources interact in the public sphere. It brought a lot of information to light that I had never considered before, and changed the way I thought about the interaction between the public and those who inform it. I feel like I've developed a robust ability to look at and analyze situations that involve these topics.",
    "I gained an understanding of the problems facing journalism, democracy, and the public sphere, as well as a rich vocabulary with which to articulate and probe possible solutions. The fresh set of eyes provided by the course have changed how I view the world. The course does not simply hammer a single perspective or narrative, but rather, provides as food for thought a wide array of analyses and positions. If the course were poorly structured or the discussions were weak, this might simply be another opportunity for students to grab what elements might be useful to their existing judgments and viewpoints, and to feed the course to their confirmation bias. Given the strength of the seminar, which lay in a combination of breadth and depth, I came away from the class not only having adjusted my own conceptions and viewpoints, but also having had to probe the mechanisms underlying belief construction itself in a democratic society. Truly one of the most rewarding essential courses in my education."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the choice of course materials and seminar discussions were the best part of the class. I also greatly prefer writing a midterm and final exam to a final paper. But the course would benefit from a better course packet. We were given one with a lot of misprints and other mistakes.",
    "It sometimes felt like our sources were a little out of date with our world - it would have been cool to talk more formally about the rise of Donald Trump and of fake news. Some of the articles from even 3 or 4 years ago just don't align with what students as internet natives see there now.",
    "After a certain point, some of the topics touched on by the different writers becomes a little repetitive. Perhaps expanding the scope of the course to include specific current event topics like Snowden or Facebook accusations of bias against conservative views might better ground the subject material into concrete context.",
    "This course was great in allowing students to learn to think for themselves. These themes of successful democracy as easy to related and compare to the American political systemsetting the foundation for an analysis and deeper critical thinking of the consequences a democratic system (or a failing democratic system) can bring. It requires a lot of thinking and writing, and I think this is a definite strength of the course. The material is both relevant and important.",
    "Strengths are the content, the relevance, and the responsiveness of Professor Sleeper. I definitely found this class immensely helpful in understanding politics better but also in understanding how legitimacy in organizations work too. Its given me a different prospective on leadership. Weaknesses. I think that consistency in class structure could have helped facilitate more and better discussion. I didn't think all the posts did a good job summarizing the points-- I didn't always find them very useful, especially in reviewing. The presentations likewise could have been limited to 10 minutes without interruption. I think we could have enforced that more so that we could have more discussion. A lot of presentations sort of meandered and extended for a long time.",
    "I'll be honest - I don't think this course actually has any true weaknesses; the level of involvement was always universally strong, and the readings were well-sectioned and had a clear focus for each week. In-class discussion is always well-moderated, allowing plenty of individual contribution and nuance while keeping on topic. There is only one (very minor) thing that I would have enjoyed in the course: the syllabus contains a few optional readings each week; I'd love to see them potentially expanded with more (and more in-depth) articles.",
    "The strengths of the course lie in the incredible collection of readings and the directed structure of the syllabus, which guided the seminar through a series of enriching discussions. If the course were poorly structured or the discussions were weak, this might simply be another opportunity for students to grab what elements might be useful to their existing judgments and viewpoints, and to feed the course to their confirmation bias. Given the strength of the seminar, which lay in a combination of breadth and depth, I came away from the class not only having adjusted my own conceptions and viewpoints, but also having had to probe the mechanisms underlying belief construction itself in a democratic society. It is difficult to propose improvements in the form of additions to the material covered that would not require some existing part to be compromised or cut. Although current political conditions and events in the news were not prominently featured in the syllabus, I did not feel that they had to be, as the class organically discussed them, applying analytical frameworks from the readings to contemporary affairs. The only personal preference I had was that discussions in seminar might have included more forceful arguments or even combative discussion. I don't mean yelling, or doing away with civility, or even that students attach their views and positions to their egos. It only seems that the gravity and significance of the problems discussed would benefit from something more than academic distance--a greater urgency or drive to come to the right answers. Of course, the syllabus itself and the professor should not dogmatically a single set of \"correct\" conclusions. Rather, students should take ownership of their arguments--not to the point of inflexibility, but in the full belief that the consequences for democratic society are as important for those of us who graduate from Yale as they are for the population at large. This was present in some of the discussions, but less so in others, and although the forum posts featured in the class provided a good way for students to share their own analyses and positions, I wish that disagreements between members of the seminar were explored more dialectically and less serially. I am not sure how much this is feasible, however, in a course that covers such a breadth of material."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely I would recommend this course to a Yale student IF they are interested in the subject area and have a basic background in polisci. Some of the most profound, fascinating discussions I've had in my time at Yale happened during this class. I think the context of the 2016 election also made all of our discussions seem that more relevant and gave then a unique sense of urgency and grounding in the real world that normally, a class like this doesn't achieve. There's a lot of reading each week, but it's manageable and Professor Sleeper is really good at getting you to connect the readings to the broader themes and discussions of the class. Basically, it was my favorite class this semester. So go for it.",
    "This class is more of a full semester immersion experience into thinking about what it means to both be a good citizen and to have a responsive government. I'm involved with other political groups on campus, and doing all these readings and talking about who has what responsibility to do different things in society was refreshing in a world that often feels like everyone abdicating responsibility for everything.",
    "Few courses have the power to radically shape one's conception of the world, but this, fortunately, is one that does. Take it, and be thankful to, if you can.",
    "Yes, the course prompts you to think critically about the intersection of journalism, liberalism, and democracy. Professor Sleeper cares a lot about his students, and though he places a lot of emphasis on people writing posts, when it comes time to study for the final exam, the insights of your classmates become invaluable in summing up and enhancing all you've learned in the semester.",
    "YES. Great class, Professor Sleeper is very dedicated to the material and setting the stage for a good discussion. The work is not too hard, but extremely appealing. I found myself learning a lot about the material, but also developing analytical and critical thinking skills that gave me a much deeper insight to the real world consequences of the topics covered in this course with Journalism, Liberalism, and Democracy. Especially in a way that our democracy and journalism as coming to new turning points that must be viewed in a more serious light.",
    "Of course! This class was so important in understanding how to maintain a healthy democracy. I don't think any other class really asks students to understand the qualities of a healthy public sphere and the challenges-- globalization, digitalization, etc-- that face it. If you are to understand how the world is changing, take this course. Sleeper is very responsive and is committed to his students. Sometimes this class is depressing, but absolutely necessary. Now that we are entering four years of Trump administration, we must understand HOW Trump is undoing democracy. The unhinging of words and deeds, the manipulation of the press, the use of virality rather than quality-- all these things must be understood in order to counter them.",
    "Absolutely, yes. Don't be intimidated by the syllabus and the application to the course. Just take the course. At first I thought it might be too dry and abstract for me, but it was definitely NOT one of those boring theoretical classes I've taken before. Class discussion was always engaging and HIGHLY relevant.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in public policy, corporate ethics, journalism, or any related field: the course.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend the course to any Yale student, whatever your interests and persuasion may be. It is an opportunity to gain a new understanding of democratic society and the conditions that sustain it. The readings are powerful and essential--not a simple compilation of citations to support a single thesis, but rather a broad array of strong attempts to answer questions about liberal democracy. The discussion is both directed and open to any views, and I came away from each one with new insights and new questions. The problems that are discussed have never been more relevant than today. Although the course is titled Journalism, Liberalism, and Democracy, its focus is on liberal democracy, with journalism playing a central role--it is not \"merely\" a class for students interested in journalism, but a class for any student who believes that liberal democracy itself might be important to understand. This is one of the most rewarding and essential courses I have taken."
