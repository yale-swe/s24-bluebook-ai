    "The History of Art department organized three thesis workshops that are very helpful.",
    "The workshops to me were very helpful - more helpful and motivating than the due dates for written work. The feedback was always affirming and helpful. Knowing that we were in this journey together was helpful as well. Most of all, the presentations for the art history department at the end of the semester gave a sense of accomplishment to all the hard work we'd done (AND it was incredibly useful to make us synthesize our ideas into a 3-page talk). For the amount of time and thought we put into the work, I would love to have more feedback from the readers. Do we get that after the semester is over? The last I heard was from my advisor about a rough draft, but nothing on the (vastly different) final copy. It wasn't made clear how the annotated bibliography would be helpful to us or why we needed to do it - it felt like busy work. The outline assignment was very unclear too, not distinguishing between a written outline and a bullet point outline - did we need to make one or two? I think different people just decided to do different things, and it didn't seem to matter at all. That was why I think the workshops with our peers and presentations at the end were more effective at holding us accountable for producing work. The only other comment is about organizing the meetings and how much time they were supposed to have taken. As long as people know beforehand that the meeting will run for two hours instead of one, then it will be better than forcing people to stay later than they planned."

    "Yes.",
    "You have to take it for the major. It will make you feel like you've learned nothing at all and will break down your confidence. And then you will feel like you've created something to be proud of and have learned everything through a process of self-discovery. High highs and low lows."
