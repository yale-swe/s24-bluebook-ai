    "Zhou Laoshi does a really good job, and keeps it really engaging. It's work, but it's good work.",
    "more of the same pattern of learning new characters and grammar patterns as previous chinese classes, more emphasis on talking about current topics than learning new grammar, overall quite easy. I would recommend it to another student as a stress-free way to keep up with your Chinese, but not as a way to make any huge jumps forward in ability. In general, definitely worth it",
    "Typical standard Chinese course taken for second year L5 students. Keep in mind workload gets heavier as semester progresses.",
    "Definitely recommend this class to another student! It's not too much work and you get as much as you put into it.",
    "Great class, zhou laoshi is amazing !",
    "154 is a great class to take. If you are looking for a class that will help you maintain your conversational Chinese, this is definitely the class to take.",
    "Class only meets 3 times a week, with vocab quizzes at the beginning of each class. Essays are assigned sporadically throughout the semester but overall workload is pretty low. Def take it.",
    "Good class. I hear its easier than movie Chinese, so if you've just finished with 150 and 151 and aren't looking to kill yourself with work, its the way to go.",
    "Take it of you want to keep learning written Chinese and improve your reading and vocab. The text book is pretty interesting and well constructed, and Zhou Laoshi is rally nice. If you're coming off a Light, prepare to be disappointed by the lack of intensity and chances to practice speaking.",
    "It's a really good way to learn more characters and familiarize yourself with more aspects of Chinese culture. It probably won't improve your speaking skills very much."
