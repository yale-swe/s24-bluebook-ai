    "The material covered in this course is enormously helpful for people who are interested in and need to perform data analysis on longitudinal datasets. Were it taught well, it would be a terrific resource for students, but unfortunately it is so poorly taught it is hard to get much out of it. The recommended text books are very difficult to understand. The homework assignments could be more clearly explained as well and the Professor could do a better job preparing students for what the homework will entail. The absolute saving grace of this course was the TF Martha Skup and her lab sessions, which are the only reason I learned anything.",
    "This is absolutely the WORST class and WORST instructor I have ever come across, and I have 3 other degrees. The professor certainly was nice and was 'sensitive' to questions, but her ability to teach complicated subject matter is well below average. I would suggest that Yale find a different professor (for example the excellent Dr. Gueorguieva who unfortunately only taught one session) or PULL the class. It's a disgrace to the Yale name.The homework was written ambiguously- as evidenced by the fact that each assignment was accompanied by 'clarifications' provided by the TA (who is amazing). What kind of professor allows for this?(No hard feelings Dr. Lin - you are certainly very nice - but we don't all have the gift)",
    "The course is good but needs to be more theoretical. I would like to see a derivation of more results.",
    "Find a good textbook and follow it so we have a good resource outside of lectures.",
    "strength is great TA Matha.",
    "Strengths: (1) instructor was responsive to e-mail and questions, (2) \"lab\" lecture sessions well organized,(3) exposure to appropriate range of methods, (4) experimental data-sets were well organized, (5) grading was fairWeaknesses:(1) lectures were poorly organized, leaving most students disoriented, (2) while methods presented in each lecture corresponded with required readings, the actual material presented was not reinforced by or even found in required readings, (3) although students were exposed to various longitudinal modeling techniques, there was insufficient discussion about model selection until the final lectureBased on what I experienced and witnessed in the other students, I would be skeptical of the integrity of any statistical analysis produced by a student trained in this class. I view my own progress this semester as akin to a very basic primer to longitudinal analysis. I will have to re-learn much of the material and fill in gaps through independent study this summer. I have not had that experience in any of the other 4 intermediate statistics courses that I have taken in this School\/University. With that said, I do believe that Dr. Lin cares about my education and will invest time to help me in that endeavor.",

    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0She tried really hard to be accommodating to students and always was willing to talk to students to help them sort through the material. That being said, her answers were sometimes more confusing than helpful and her lectures tend to run long.In terms of improvement, I would suggest keeping the TA lab sections and maybe incorporating some more applied things into the main lecture. For some lectures, she pointed out what everyone needed to know and what biostats PhD students need to know; making such distinctions throughout all lectures would be more helpful!",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Dr. Lin is a kind, understanding and well-meaning instructor. She clearly cares a great deal about the course and students' understanding of the material. However, she is almost entirely incomprehensible. The material is obviously complicated, but she has great difficulty explaining it with any clarity. She spends a great deal of time explaining very simple concepts and speeds through much more difficult material. It is very hard to follow her lectures and I got almost nothing out of attending class.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0See above.Get a different professor, or drop the class. Bottom line.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0The instructor is more than willing to spend extra time with the students and is very helpful if you ask her a question. I felt that I could approach her and the extra channel of communication made it easier for me to learn the course in greater scope.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0strength is knowledge. Weakness is clear delivery and communication.",
    "Instructor: Haiqun Lin \u00a0Professor Lin was extremely attentive to students and seems to have a good grasp of the material. The lecture style, however, posed significant problems for the class. Many students found the lectures confusing and, at times, incoherent. While Prof. Lin tried to use examples of actual experimental situations to explain statistical procedures, these examples meandered away from the actual issue at hand and into some irrelevant aspect of the example study. Questions from students were answered in the same way. Powerpoint presentations had a logical flow, but the material on individual slides was often unclear. The transition from discussion of statistical concepts to formal notation was awkward and confusing.",

    "Martha Skup - SAS sessions were very helpful with both programming skills and with theory that was not covered completely in class. She was always accessible and willing to help as best she could. A+ performance.",
    "MARTHA WAS AMAZING!Her slides and office hours were incredibly helpful.",
    "Martha Skup was the teaching fellow for this course and was simply phenomenal. The only reason I learned anything in this class was because of Martha. She prepared fantastic one hour lab sessions to walk us through SAS code and conceptual material in preparation for our homework assignments. Having taken numerous biostats courses at the School of Public Health, I have never had a TF prepare such a comprehensive and easily understood set of notes to help us use the SAS code, but also to teach very difficult conceptual material for the course. Martha's ability to explain the material was extremely impressive and very rare to find among biostats instructors. She provided a great deal of help through office hours and was willing to go above and beyond her duties--meeting with me outside of office hours for additional help and responding to emails on the weekend. She has been by far one of the best teaching fellows I have encountered in the department and does a better job teaching the material than many professors!",
    "Martha is amazing. She is bright and completely dedicated. She prepared wonderful lab sessions with notes that could be published. She understood where the professor was lacking and focused on those areas. She spend numerous hours outside of class with me and other students. She should get Dr. Lin's paycheck in toto.",
    "The TA was very helpful. Her notes were very good and definitely helped with the homework.",
    "Marhta was amazing. She is a natural teacher Without her lab sessions, I don't know how I would have gotten through this course.",
    "Matha is greatest TA ever. Actually, she have done more than instructor to us. We hope she could be TA next year as well for this class since she is great. This class is challenge and it need a great TA as Matha for student to learn and digest all the materials.",
    "Martha Skup was extremely responsive and an all-star TA. Her lab sections were well-organized and comprehensive. She clearly committed in far more hours to this course than were expected of her and deserves departmental congratulations.",
    "outstanding",

Although the lectures were dry and often confusing, they present students with an overview of the material from a theoretical (e.g., formal mathematical) and applied (e.g., SAS) way.For someone who plans on becoming a researcher, I would definitely recommend this course. For someone who doe not plan to continue with research, I would not.",
    "I would recommend it to another student if they have to do longitudinal data analysis simply because there are no other options. They will learn from the teaching fellow and learn a great deal on their own by struggling through the homework assignments. However, I would warn them that they'll get nothing out of lectures and it will be a painful semester!",
    "Do not take this course unless Martha is the TA and they change the professor",
    "The course provides a good intro to longitudinal analysis though if you are looking for a rigorous development it will not be enough. I recommend students that need an introduction to longitudinal data to start with this course.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to.",
    "Yes. It is a great class.",
    "Longitudinal analysis is an absolutely critical part of our core curriculum. However, I might recommend that independent study would be more efficient than enrollment in this course.",
