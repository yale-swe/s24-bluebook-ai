    "If you are looking for an INTRODUCTION to music history. Stop. This course is more of a deep-inside look at music history of the Baroque and Classical than an introduction, intended for MUSIC MAJORS rather than your casual onlooker. Taking Listening to Music, instead. However, it is a shame to turn you away from this class, for the lectures are very well put together, and Professor Hepokoski an artist in his presentation of information. Music major or not, this course is EXTREMELY work heavy. There are three listening quizzes, each worth 10% of your grade, three factual exams (aka, \"midterms\"), that count for 40% of your grade, and a 10-page paper (based on comparative historiography rather than on actual music history,) each of which consumes a massive amount of time to prepare for. However, it is true that at the end of that last exam, one feels surprisingly accomplished, and can step back and appreciate the in-depth journey through music history on which Professor Hepokoski has led you.",
    "HAHA you have to take this and I'm done.",
    "Hepo is a god. Take this and 352 if you know what's good for you.",
    "Great readings and great lectures. The workload is very heavy so make some room in your class schedules. Otherwise, a very enjoyable course.",
    "If you're a music major, you have to take it. I don't know if that makes it seem like more work than it is, but this class is definitely a lot of work. The listening quizzes are substantial, and can be very difficult to study for. Prepare in advance. The music is not as distinguishable as in 352. And, of course, Hepokoski was as animated and effervescent as ever.",
    "Music history with a brilliant professor. How can you not want to take this?",
    "Music majors are obviously already required to take this course, but I would recommend this course to non-music majors who are interested in learning about a period of music history that is not very well-known to most people.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! 351 was one of my favorite classes so far at Yale. Hepokoski's lectures are incredible.",
    "Music 351 is a phenomenal course that everyone at all interested in music should take. It is hard, but essential to understanding the music that we play today, and also just seeing the significance of music and these composers in history.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. This and 352 are two of the best-kept secrets at Yale. James Hepokoski is a wonderful and charismatic lecturer, and it is a privilege to get to see music history through his eyes. My friends and I now have indelible kinesthetic associations with the great music of the baroque and classical eras. Even section is great! Also, Hepo knows Taruskin--ask about Taruskin's letter to him re an issue of the journal he used to edit.",
    "Music 351 is a survey of major musical developments and composers from roughly 1600 to 1800, with a little bleed-over at both ends. There's a lot to cover, so Professor Hepokoski just jumps right in, which can be a little discombobulating if you're taking this before 350. It's a lot of work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 especially the listening quizes \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0but if you put in a solid effort, you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "i would recommend it if you have a passion for history and music and are capable of handling a great deal of information, you must be on top of the information which means keeping up with the reading on your own because there are no assignments for you to gauge your grasp on the information until the first \"midterm\"",
    "Great class.",
    "Chances are you have to take it. None of the material is particularly difficult, but you definitely need to study for the factual and listening exams. Easy enough to get an A if you have a fair TA.",
    "If you're a music major, you have to take this. However, you should take this course anyway! You don't really need to read music to take it, but I suppose a basic understanding of musical notation definitely helps. Who wouldn't want to take a course that includes composers like Monteverdi, Bach, and Mozart? The composers of this period make the course worth it. The listening exams can be a doozy, but with proper studying (like a week), you can get through them just fine.",
    "I would emphatically recommend this class to a fellow student. MUSI 351 is a really comprehensive overview and I felt like all the work was worthwhile. I left the class with impressive products: I can write about a wealth of topics in Baroque music, I can identify titles, dates, and composers of selections with just short samples, and I can speak definitively about the problems associated with the scholarship of music history. This class is extremely representative of the kind of course I think Yale is all about: high input, high reward. Great class, better professor!"
