    "If you have any interest at all in Brazil or Portuguese, take this class. The readings are very interesting and you end up learning a fair amount of Brazilian history. Professor Jackson does a lot of talking, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but means that you can often get away with missing some of the readings. Two 5-6 page papers and a final 8-10 page paper so you're earning that WR credit.",
    "Took this class because I needed a writing credit, and it ended up being my favorite class this semester. Professor Jackson is awesome, and really makes you appreciate everything you read. The novels are all short and a ton of fun, and the poetry is extremely diverse. Loved this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Most of the readings are very interesting, the literary movements covered are things I haven't really been exposed to before, the workload isn't anything crazy, and the timeline of turning in a paper proposal, rough draft, final draft, was really helpful for me in scheduling my work. Professor Jackson respects his students as fellow academics, and just wants to help you to develop your own perspectives and critiques as well as you can.",
    "Take it! Whether you need a writing credit or simply wish to discover some quality literature, this class is well-worth your time. It's very low-stress and it really helped my writing."
