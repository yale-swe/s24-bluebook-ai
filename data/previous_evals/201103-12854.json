   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class if you really love Chinese. Personally, i was getting tired of the routine and would rather not continue after this class. However, I don't regret taking this class. It really expands your vocabulary so you can discuss more interesting subjects like gender equality and the Chinese government. There isn't much work, but this class does meet every day, which is a pain. You have to keep up in this class or it's very obvious because the class is so small.",
    "A lot of work, but that's sort of how languages are. If you don't plan to go back to China (get another Light, etc.), it's probably not worth it, but your reading and writing skills improve a lot.",
    "Take it as a good final course in the non-Native Chinese language set. You'll be prepared for it.",
    "Chinese 150 is a solid way to keep your Chinese up if you've just come back from doing the Light Fellowship for the summer. Teachers are helpful and clear.",
    "You likely know what to expect from this class. If you are returning from a summer language program, class will be slower and perhaps less coordinated than summer class.",
    "This was my favorite class of the semester. The teachers were great and they did a good job with creating a fun learning environment. However, this class is demanding and requires an hour or two of studying every night.",
    "This class is hard. It is a lot of work, and I'm sure it is rewarding if you have the time to put 1-2 hours towards it everyday.",
    "It's a great class with a lot of work\u0097 but still less work than I originally thought there was going to be. If you're willing to put the effort in, you'll do fine. But it really requires a commitment every day, including the weekends. Take it if Chinese is something you really love.",
    "Yes! This class was well-structured and definitely expanded my vocabulary and knowledge of Chinese grammar. The professors were wonderful and always very energetic. The weekly individual TA sections were also very helpful for speaking practice. The homework can be a bit time-consuming and a few of the topics in the textbook are a bit odd, but overall you will learn a lot in this course."
