    "If you're interested in re-reading the books on the syllabus, with the help of a great professor who's very familiar with the period and the context, The Victorian Political Novel is a great way to do that. There's a fairly heavy reading load, which is pretty normal for an English Senior Seminar, and if this is something you think you'd like to write a longer paper on, go for it!",
    "The Victorian Political novel was an absolutely wonderful class. I had taken a lot of Victorian literature classes before this, but I had never studied them from a political point of view. I honestly didn\u2019t think I would be super interested in the political side of novels, but it turned out to be a very interesting way to analyze the books. Also, Professor Markovits made sure that we covered the other aspects of the novel fully as well, so the class functions much like a normal Victorian literature class, simply with a stronger focus on politics. If you take this class for no other reason, take it because of Professor Markovits. She is truly a masterful discussion leader and a compassionate teacher. She will challenge you, and you will be a better thinker for it.",
    "A wonderful senior seminar, probably not too exciting if you're not interested in the Victorian novel, but if you are, you can't beat taking this course with Professor Markovits. If only a few people show up the first day, don't let that steer you away - it will be great discussion, every time.",
    "This was Professor Markovits's first year of teaching the course, and I think it had a very strong concept. The texts we read were all engaging--though often very long, and I think we developed some interesting arguments. I would hope, in the future, that the themes are tracked more closely over the length of the course so that it cohered more strongly. Also there is a lot of reading, but if you are interested in the Victorian novel you will enjoy it.",
    "GREAT class, especially if you like your classmates. Professor is wonderful. The first half of the reading list is definitely better. If you're a Victorianist and they offer this and Brisman's Victorian Poetry again, shop both - they have very different feels."
