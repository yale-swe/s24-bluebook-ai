   "comments": [
    "A lot of work. Too many course assignments. However, it is a good class. Insightful and enlightening.",
    "I think if you are interested in becoming an anthropologist I would recommend this course because it gives you a taste of what it is like to look at a culture (specifically Yale) critically and make an argument about it. It also gives a comprehensive look at many different anthropologists and their techniques.",
    "Great intro. but there is alot of reading (about 4 hours a week) and assignments, (reading responses, five ethnography papers, final paper)",
    "i would definitely recommend this class to another student! it's not too hard of a class primarily because its so enjoyable!",
    "I think this is a great course. The readings are really interesting--usually they are excerpts from books or articles, but they are manageable and fun to read. The books assigned are good too. The work is manageable, but sometimes it's annoying because there is a reading response every week even when we have a short paper due. But, it is a nice change from other types of writing assignments. I would recommend this!",
    "Definitely take this class. It is fun and engaging. There is a fair amount of reading each week but it is necessary to learn the fundamentals of anthropological theory. The short ethnographic assignments are fun and get you thinking critically about Yale.",
    "I'm glad I took it. It was a lot of reading, which I certainly got tired of, but down the stretch I'd say I learned to appreciate what it was offering much more. If you're looking for a class that will expand the way you think about the world and will teach you to look for relationships between people and things that you might have ignored previously, this is a good class to take. The assignments aren't really hard, and in some cases not even time consuming, but the reading is heavy for sure, so do watch out for that.",
    "I would recommend it if you are willing to have to make a lot generalizations as part of your writing assignments. This can be a good and a bad thing, depending on how you develop your view on the anthropological methods presented in class.",
    "I would recommend the course to a fellow student, because I think it was certainly interesting as well as a good introduction to the foundational concepts and authors of anthropology. I was not a big fan of the class at the end, because basically what I got out of it was that anthropology is a field based on people going to other places and writing about another group of people with the expectation that what they wrote was the truth and that other people would take it as such.",
    "It's a very interesting class. There are weekly reading responses and a total of 5 (I think) longer ethnographies that were pretty fun to research for and write. You end up learning a lot by doing a lot.",
    "Not particularly unless you're interested in pursuing it",
    "Generally a good course. Harms is excellent, and you cover a broad range of relevant topics. The political bent of the class can be a little strange - eg, there are a lot of attacks on \"neoliberalism.\" Professor Harms does a good job balancing this out in lectures, but it's sometimes taken for granted in section.",
    "It is very interesting and thought provoking and I would definitely recommend it",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. Very interesting and helps you think about things in a new way.",
    "If you aren't sure what you are doing, are interested in something interdisciplinary, or want to become more worldly and understand everyday life, I would highly recommend this course. The ethnography assignments we did were super helpful and relavent. I would definitely take this course. Also grading wasn't too bad, so I wouldn't take this Credit-D-Fail.",
    "While I don't think that I learned as much from the course as I'd hoped (much of the material seems to repeat itself, or say something very simple in a lot of words), the things that I did learn were incredibly interesting. It helped me to understand parts of my life and re-interpret them in ways that I never would have expected, as well as show me how to make the most of my time at Yale and when visiting new cultures.",
    "This class is fantastic, and I would definitely recommend it to another student. It's a perfect intro class if you know nothing about anthropology and want to learn more. At times, the class can get reading heavy, but overall, as long as you keep up with the work you will do fine.",
    "I could not recommend this class more heartily. If you like analysis, questioning, close examination and critical thinking, take this class. It was an amazing experience that provides an insightful and refreshing take on concepts such as culture, power and globalization. Prof. Harms will keep you on your toes. However, if you're close-minded (or if you just want to get a social science credit out of the way), don't bother.",
    "Yes you must take it! You will come out a new pair of eyes, it will develop your critical thinking, enable you to meet great professors, and on top it is so much fun!",
    "I can't recommend this class enough:it genuinely changed the way that I think, which isn't something you can say for many courses. Professor Harms was a good lecturer, and the reading was genuinely interesting. Be aware that there's a fair amount of reading though.",
    "this course is the world in a thimble. take it!",
    "A lot of reading.",
    "This course focuses on thinking anthropologically more than on specific topics or cultures. Professor Harms is great and the homework assignments can be fun if you get into them. Overall a great course. Be aware, however, that this course is not about objective, detached observations or explanations-- you will dive right into the politics inherent in sociocultural anthropology.",
    "I would recommend it if you feel that you can appreciate the field.",
    "Yes! Take this class! Get yourself a spyglass of anthropology \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0it will change the way you think, for the better. Also, take this class even if you've taken advanced anthro classes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it's a great foundation, even retroactively.",
    "Anthropology 110 is a great introductory course. It's really interesting no matter what your intended major\/field of study and not too difficult. Professor Harms is a great lecturer and the TAs are all really knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend the class, but students should be aware that the readings can be quite lengthy and the assignments, while few, can be time-consuming. I felt that the work that needed to go into the final paper was especially understated. Nevertheless, take this class if you want a good intro to anthropology (as in, what exactly is anthropology?) or if you want an interesting social science credit.",
    "It's an interesting class, but not to be taken, perhaps, if you're a science major who doesn't care too much for the humanities. Sociocultural anthropology is a social science, but it treats itself like a pure science, which is a little jarring.",
    "In the class you'll through a lot of basic concepts--oh how happy I was to finally get some distilled definitions of structuralism and functionalism!--and then start applying them all over the place. All those jargony social science theory buzzwords become understandable and USEFUL. Each new reading (typically a case study\/ethnography that centers around a certain theme like violence or kinship in a certain location) brings in new concepts and terms and you find yourself making constant connections (even outside of ANTH 110--I have talked about liminality in probably three of my papers for other classes this semester). Lecture uses the readings as a jumping off point; the readings might have been about structural violence in Haiti, but lecture might end up being about the electric chair and drawing connections between the two. I think this is a great class if you're new to the social sciences and\/or are looking to build up your theoretical vocabulary. Also, Prof. Harms is lovely. Really cares about the material, so engaging, funny dry sense of humor.Honestly, the workload is sizable (fair amount of reading each week [sometimes really interesting and sometimes really dry], weekly reading responses, five ethnography papers [not too hard to write, but 4-5 pages], ten page final paper, plus midterm and final). HOWEVER, despite the number of assignments, they never seemed anywhere near overwhelming at the time, and i think the payoff of the class is amazing if anthropology in any way interests you.But: it's a waste of your time to miss lecture. You'll miss out on important information (!) plus you really will get much less out of the course. So don't take this if skipping lecture is your jam.",
    "This course focuses on how to think like an anthropologist, using a variety of case studies from all over the world. Some key questions are: what's the relationship between an individual and his\/her environment? To what extent does one shape his or her future? What is culture? How is culture enacted and reproduced? And so on.",
    "An introduction to socio-cultural anthropology. Starts out with general ideas of what anthropology is and how anthropologists think. Then zooms in on more specific topics like marginalization and structural violence, neoliberalism, and modes of livelihood, and finally zooms back out. Some parts were a bit boring, but overall, it was a wonderful course. The readings were very interesting. Workload: weekly reading responses, 5 ethnographic assignments in which you get to engage with the Yale community (very interesting), midterm, final ethnographic paper (fun to write, but plan ahead), and final exam.",
    "It was a fun and interesting look into the study of humans and different cultures. I am really glad I took the class. Having said that it was a TON of work. If you are not passionate or extremely curious about Cultural Anthropology I would consider the workload before signing up.",
    "This class not only explores a variety of different cultures, but shows a different way of thinking about those differences in a productive way.",
    "Yes, just be ready to read a lot. If you don't read, this class won't have the punch you want from it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because I think it is essential for everyone to have an understanding of different groups of people, how societies form\/develop and why they live the way they do and uphold the ideas that they do. This class helps develop this understanding.",
    "I would say that the class is heavy in the amount of work required. The combination of the reading assignments, responses, and ethnographic assignments demanded a lot of time be devoted to the class. That being said, the ethnographic assignments were enjoyable to do. I advise a student to seriously consider whether he\/she is interested in anthropology as a discipline before taking the class.",
    "Absolutely, hands down, without a doubt the best class I have taken at Yale. The workload was not only manageable but interesting. The readings were always fascinating nd the assignments involved studying Yale. For the first assignment I got to go to a frat party and Toad's and write about it. I feel like I learned so much about how structures influence us and how we interact with these structures. When I watch TV, I make connections about people's actions that I never would have before. This is just a fun, engaging class that I looked forward to going to everyday. Professor Harms was easily the best professor I've ever had!! Take this class!!",
    "Most definitely. A class that everyone should take in order to call themselves informed global citizens."
