    "Myth and man. Expect hard work and open horizons.",
    "It's an experimental theater class for which you are expected to create usually 3-5 minutes of theater (which can be literally anything) every week. That's basically. I would recommend this class to literally anyone with a creative bone in their body. It was the best part of my week.",
    "Only take this class if you are prepared to spend a considerable amount of time on it each week. It is demanding, but definitely worth it.",
    "Necessary for theater makers and aspiring directors.",
    "Fun class. Pulling together the scenes was a logistical challenge that lent itself to adventures. Professor Woodruff is caring and gives constructive criticism. Gave me a new way to think about what makes good theater and what the effect is on the audience watching.",
    "It's an experience you truly cannot miss if you are at all interested in performance. It's intense, but only because you're inspired to push your limits every week. I feel like I see my work from a different perspective and I have generated new ideas that I know I'll use far in the future. This class is for creating drafts of work, you'll never have enough time to truly polish something. But you also keep making and making.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! You don't need to have any background in theater, you just need to be willing to really commit to doing the projects each week.",
