   "comments": [
    "This is an interesting course taught by a great professor. Professor Loewenberg is such a chill guy and he's happy to meet with students outside of class as well, so definitely take advantage of that!",
    "Process Dynamics and Control teaches concepts in process control that are crucial in the automation of chemical processes. The course requires a basic understanding of Laplace transforms, fundamentals in chemical engineering and math principles.",
    "Got to take it for the major, and it was a lot of fun to take it with Loewenberg. hes a great guy",
    "Process Control is wonderful course that teaches you how to basically control changes to steady state chemical engineering processes by utilizing feedback loops, models, and several integrated methods. The class is taught incredibly well by Professor Michael Loewenberg, who is very patient with everyone. Loewenberg spends several hours preparing the course material and uploads all of the material online so that it is easy to understand and follow. Often times I ran into difficulty on the homework, and would email him for help. His answer was always : yes, please stop by. One day I needed help deriving a complex IMC tuner equation and visited his office hours. He and I derived all 5 pages of the equations proof on the chalkboard. It's this kind of dedication that really makes a student grateful and thankful for such a wonderful experience.The midterms and finals are not too complex, although the homework\/PSETS are very involved and will require an understanding of Matlab Simulink.",
    "It's a good course, makes you feel like a real engineer. Simulink is a lot of fun, and hopefully loewenbro will be teaching it.",
    "If Professor Loewenberg is teaching, then congratulations: you have survived to senior year and will be awarded with a good a professor and a good class. Loewenbro is so incredibly dedicated he worked really hard on writing good and interesting problem sets, ensured that uploaded class notes were correct and clear, sometimes sent things like exam practice problems in the middle of the night, spent hours with me after class helping with problem sets, gave really fair exams, and took us out for beer after the exam. The course itself is also pretty good. Its different from other chemE classes, since its closer to applied math (diffEq, basic linear algebra) or electrical engineering than chemistry. Pretty useful stuff, feedback and feedforward control loops, lots of tanks and block diagrams. Book isnt bad, but Loewenbergs notes are also great."
