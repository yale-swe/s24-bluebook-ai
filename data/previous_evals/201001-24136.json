   "comments": [
    "Plenty of focusing on Africa, Transgenderism, and hair and so much more. Theres really just a lot of great reading and really enjoyable discussion on the anthropological subject of beauty fashion and self styling.",
    "Despite the name, one does not study \"Beauty,\" \"Fashion,\" or \"Self-Styling\" in the way that you probably think of when you hear or see those words. This is not a class on the fashion industry or what it means to be seen as beautiful in modern day Western society. In this class, you primarily study African societies and their transition into a Western-influenced world; you also take a look at transvestite societies in America and the Pacific Islands. Perhaps a better title for the class would be \"Concepts of Beauty and Fashion in Developing Africa and other non-Western Societies.\" Now think about that title, and see if you want to still take the class. Professor Reid is an excellent, wonderful teacher, but the material might be a bit different than what you were first expecting.",
    "Yes.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. it is wonderful, you learn a lot and have fun doing it, the reading is interesting and the professor is delightful, this is irrelevant but he is also very stylish.",
    "take it if you have space for it, it's not a life changer but definitely interesting and worth it if you can",
    "If you have any interest in gender, performance theory, the cultural politics of fashion, fashion and the politics of imperialism\/capitalism, or if you want to learn about bodily adornment practices in various cultures, take this class. Lots of discussion surrounding \"tradition\" vs. \"modernity\" in a globalized world, and how fashion and dress communicate these ideas.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for another student with the caveat that even though the course has a flashy title, it is very substantive, and the material is often very challenging. This course encourages people to change their perspective of clothing, fashion, and self-styling, which is omnipresent. This course is also great for developing an international viewpoint of common purchases or experiences, like hair styling. Don't take this course with the intention of talking about your favorite outfit. If you are genuinely interested in what motivates people's decisions in terms of self-styling, take this course. You won't regret it!",
    "This class covers some interesting material that you would not really find in any other class, in terms of studying aesthetics. It is a good anthropology seminar to take, especially for first-time seminar takers.",
    "TAKE IT. SO COOL. It seems like a joke but its totally eye opening.",
    "Yes, but I'm glad i took it CDF",
    "Very relaxed class.",
    "Graeme Reid is amazing, and this class is one of the best anthro classes I've taken at Yale. Not only do you look at a lot of interesting case studies, but you get a better understanding of theories of gender, performance, and culture. If you're an anthro major, you have to take a Graeme Reid class before graduating."
