   "comments": [
    "The homework was a little too ambitious - this was Professor Kontorovich's first time teaching it, so it'll probably get better. It's useful material though, especially for physics.",
    "Fantastic. This class is a LOT of work - I think on average people spent around 15 - 20 hours per week on problem sets, but it is incredibly rewarding. The exams are manageable to make up for the rather difficult homework and Professor Kontorovich is about the most competent and entertaining teacher you could ask for.",
    "Mind blowing class. It is work but manageable and more than worth it. I am very glad I took this class and I highly recommendit, especially if Professor Kontorovich is teaching it. Take this class.",
    "Math 310 is one of the best math courses that I have taken at Yale, and I would recommend it strongly to any math major (or anybody who can take it). The course generally follows Stein and Shakarchi (book 2) up to the proof of the prime number theorem, and covers many other consequential results on the way. Having this course under your belt makes it easier to begin studying properties of the zeta function, and provides some perspective on the far-reaching influences of complex analysis in other topics in mathematics.",
    "The course was very well taught and very well structured. The difficulty curve was gentle at first and then became very steep at the end. The material was fascinating and profound. Definitely provides a more than adequate introduction to complex analysis. Workload was relatively heavy, but nothing too much beyond a typical math course. Exams and quizzes were very fair, yet challenging.Professor Kontorovich was one of the best professors I've had at Yale. He cares a lot about his students and really wants them to understand the material and succeed in the class. He was the only professor I have ever had that really tried to read students' reactions to what he was teaching to gauge their understanding __in addition to__ persistently asking the class when he truly thought people were confused in order to pinpoint the concept that students were having trouble with.Take this class. It's really good. Problem sets are 10-15 hours a week, not too terrible.",
    "Take it.",
    "Take the class if you're game for all nighters and experiencing the beauty of the Prime Number Theorem.",
    "I would. It's fun and good for you. A healthy background in real analysis is useful.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course and I would strongly encourage them to take it with Professor Kontorovich.",
    "Stop for a moment and consider the following question - do you hope to leave Yale having taken your favorite course at Yale? Obviously this happens for everybody, because in retrospect, one of your courses must have been your favorite. So for most people, it's less a deliberate choice and more an accidental consequence of well ordering. BUT, if you want to guarantee that you will have taken your favorite course at Yale (not to mention the best course overall) on purpose - take Complex Analysis with Professor Kontorovich. Yes, it will be hard. Yes, homework will take a good amount of time each week (10 hours should do the trick, but some weeks took a fair bit more - plenty of the Problems in Stein and Shakarchi are formidable challenges). Yes, you might feel the slightest bit of whiplash in the neck of your mind as you blaze through the first seven chapters of the textbook. But no - you will never regret taking this course and following through with it. The material is simply too beautiful, and the professor too clear and phenomenal, to consider any other option. In a generally related note, it is my firm conviction that after a few more years, we will witness a popularization on campus of Professor Kontorovich jokes in the spirit of Chuck Norris jokes. He is simply that talented. In conclusion, I would like to offer up the first of these jokes. Professor Kontorovich can integrate directly over poles with his pinky finger. When Professor Kontorovich writes out infinite product expansions, every term diverges out of fear. Because he's at least twice as good as anybody else, Professor Kontorovich only needs to multiply his residues by at most \\pi * i. Professor Kontorovich can make the zeroes of a function accumulate just by staring at them. Professor Kontorovich's tears could prove the Riemann Hypothesis - too bad he never cries. I strongly encourage all future takers of this course to contribute to this collection.",
    "Absolutely. It's wonderful material and even though it's hard it's definitely something you should learn if you like math. If you can, take it with Kontorovich. He's a great professor and even though the problem sets are long, you'll learn a lot!",
    "It's a lot of work, but it's interesting."
