    "If you don't take this course before leaving Yale, you will not be prepared for the workforces of the future in anyway. This course gives you an incredible understanding and framework within which to think about the technology that pervades and effects all of our lives. Take this or agree to sit on the sidelines of your future.",
    "Maybe, if the student was really into the nerdy side of technology and online stuff, I'd recommend it, otherwise I'd tell them to avoid it.",
    "Applicable to many fields, important stuff to understand. Highly recommended.",
    "Take it if you're looking for a fun course.It's definitely not a gut, as grading on reading responses and such can be hard, but it's definitely a class that's focused on giving you insight into some of the things you do on a daily basis.",
    "If you are interested in the material and don't mind a disorganized class setting go for it. If not, don't take it.",
    "Absolutely - even if you aren't good at working with computers, this is a great class to get into policy of the internet and technological devices. Everything from privacy, security, piracy, copyrights and patents, hardware, software - it is really fantastic (and Brad makes it really worth it)",
    "Take this class! It allows you to be creative and clever in completing assignments, present arguments in a 21st century manner, and get personal interaction with the professor. In sum, it's a lot of fun, you learn a lot, and Brad is the Oprah of pastries.",
    "The first half of the course was way better than the second. A lot of working through case law, statutes and Constitutional Amendments was replaced by talking about what we as a society want \"next\" in terms of the culture we would like to see online. To be fair, though, Brad said he had tried to title the course \"Intro to Law, Technology& Culture.\"But overall, it's great! Great way to get exposed to a ton of complicated issues that are unfolding literally today.",
    "The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP\/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks, of local to global scope, that are linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents of the World Wide Web (WWW) and the infrastructure to support email.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Whether you are a CS student interested in the tech, or any other major (and I can't stress that enough) interested in anything from facebook to porn-law to law.The class is taught in a non-traditional model that is fresh and engaging. You will never be bored in class, and the readings are well chosen, topical, and fun. You get out of this what you put into it, but if you commit you will find a rewarding, low stress, and very enjoyable term.",
    "Yes, it was an amazing class to take. The readings were very interesting, and the class itself was awesome. Brad rocks!",
    "Shop it and find out. See how well you'll do with Brad's teaching style and the course structure. The material is good.",
    "Take this class. Don't worry too much about your grade. It'll be fine. This is a perfect credit\/d class. Fun to go to and not that stressful.",
    "Pros-really interesting material and readings. worthwhile to learn this stuff as it's super relevant-Brad is really cool and nice (though, at times, erratic and with overly strong\/biased viewpoints)-I feel like this class changed me for the better and made me think of things i hadn't considered before. re-read the pros after you read the cons as i highly recommend this course but had a few specific gripes (outlined in the cons) so only don't take this if you think any of the cons are gonna make you not be able to enjoy the course-you could probably take this Cr\/D and it would be pretty chill but make sure you do readings as you get a lot out of themCons-surpisingly a lot of work (but a lot of it is very interesting and you'll be happy you did it) (4 harshly graded reading responses, a pretty serious blog post, and a take home midterm and a final project) midterm is tough but interesting. final project is really cool and open-readings can be long and sometimes filled with legales (or be legal cases). Still, most of it is worthwhile and you can get a taste for it from wikipedia if you can't commit enough time to all of the texts)-grading is very obscure. you will likely have little idea where you stand throughout the class but i believe Brad will be reasonable and give out good grades",
    "Take it! I won't be writing another rave about Brad's class because there are already enough of them. Here's what you need to know: No.1 Don't be intimidated by the title. You don't need to have experience with either law or technology (some familiarity with internet memes might help you get some of the inside jokes, but those are on the side anyway). Sometimes the reading can be a bit boring and dense (e.g. court cases) but it leads to some of the most interesting discussions you'll ever have. The reading responses are easy enough to do if you don't leave them for the last moment. Midterm was actually more fun than difficult. And the final project is as fun as you make it: one kid looked through court cases to check how many times UrbanDictionary had been used as a reference for interpreting testimonies! Another group wrote a rap. So don't be afraid to try this course. Even if it has nothing to do with your major, you'll learn stuff that is definitely applicable to real-life, and have fun while doing it.",
    "CPSC 183 is a great introductory course to the relavent laws behind actions on computers and the internet. I would fully recommend it.",
    "Unique, relevant, relaxed, brilliant... Don't miss it!!OVER NINE THOUSAND LULZ!!!!",
    "Absolutely. Topics covered were very topical and interesting. As someone interested in technology, this class got me interested in law in a way I didn't at all expect. Brad is a fantastic professor, and class discussion is engaging and varied. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "It's pretty interesting and rather laid back. I learned some pretty cool stuff. But Brad very clearly has favorites and, if he doesn't know you already, you can expect him to ignore you completely. A lot of class time is filled by obnoxious banter between him and his crew.",
    "Fantastic Course. If you have the time and space in your schedule take it!",
    "Definitely take this course. It's one of the most engaging courses I've taken at Yale. A warning: it's easy to get away with not doing the readings, but you'll regret it later when you realize how much more you could have gotten out of this class.",
    "Super relevant class to all the legal and cultural implications of technology. It's a very accessible class and I definitely recommend taking it. Reading is less than an hour per class and often very fun reading. (even the legal cases are super interesting). You will get a lot out of this class that you can take out into the real-world. DO IT!"
