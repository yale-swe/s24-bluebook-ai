    "Take this class! You will look at Yale in a different perspective afterwards!",
    "Professor Gitlin is incredibly friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable. His energy is magnetic. The material is cool. It's fun to choose whatever you want for your paper.BUT. It was a bad seminar. Gitlin does not have discussion - he mostly lectures, and solicits ideas he wants. He is incredibly disorganized. We were weeks behind. No one really did reading. I learned nothing but a smattering of fun facts and his few chosen themes. I was disappointed.",
    "DEFINITELY. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Yes. Yes. Yes. Great course. Great material. Great Professor. Why wouldn't you?",
    "Sometimes at Yale you have the opportunity to take a class with a professor who teaches you far more than what is on the syllabus. This is such a course. I wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "Must take before you graduate. It will change the way you think about Yale in the best possible way. Amazing.",
    "Great course. As are all of Gitlin's courses. Take it if you can get in.",
    "This is an AMAZING class! Absolutely take it if you can. Gitlin is amazing. He's super laid back, but you still learn a lot. Our class took a trip to the Yale Club in NYC, went to dinner at Mory's, and buried a copy of Euclid. It was just generally a great time and very little stress. Super super fun class for a senior seminar.",
