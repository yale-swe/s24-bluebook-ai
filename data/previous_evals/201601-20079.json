    "Perhaps the most rewarding course I've taken at any level of my education. Professors Kronman and Kahn are brilliant and brought quite different approaches and perspectives to Nietzsche. Discussions were utterly engaging, and I often left class wishing they would continue for at least another hour. Readings were manageable allowing everyone to prepare carefully for class and the professors did an excellent job of balancing their ongoing dialogue\/debate with student comments. Unlikely to ever be taught again, but should Kahn and Kronman reunite for a future class, I cannot recommend enrolling strongly enough.",
    "The material is great and both professors were incredibly responsive and knowledgeable. But the course needed more structure. The discussions tended to not go anywhere coherent and the professors argued a lot. We should have split the class time between the two of them and focused on a few themes.",
    "This class was, overall, quite enjoyable. Upsides: Read Nietzsche's greatest works closely and learn nuanced interpretations of his texts from true philosophy scholars; engage in thought-provoking material that disrupts prevailing mores; balance an otherwise-law-heavy curriculum with compelling philosophy. Downsides: The professors' management of class discussion was lacking, and often devolved into a relatively inaccessible dialogue between the professors, with an occasional addition from students (this was fun to witness, at times, but adhering to some semblance of structure would be helpful for those interested in learning more of Nietzsche's fundamental philosophy); there seemed to be no attempt by the professors to weave a common thread between the texts and produce a holistic understanding of Nietzsche, which left the class anticlimactic. Overall, the class is worth taking if the abovementioned upsides are likely to outweigh the downsides in your decision-making calculus."
