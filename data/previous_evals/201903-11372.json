   "comments": [
    "I learned how to dive deep into a scientific paper; to catch every detail I don't understand and look into it. I learned how to present and lead a discussion on a scientific paper.",
    "I gained the ability to critically analyze cell biology papers, and I improved my verbal communication and presentation skills. Further, I learned a lot about cellular biology and about some of the important papers in the field.",
    "I learned how to better read scientific papers, especially focusing on the methods and materials.",
    "Professor Rosenbaum takes a bit to get used to. He's a bit harsh at first, and not very warm, especially when you get the wrong answer. But he really is the gem of this course and just wants students to be more specific and deliberate with their answers. There are so many small details you gloss over when you read a scientific paper at this level, and sometimes you don't realize how important these details are in making and breaking an experiment. He is really great at summarizing the big ideas while also pointing out the most important small details. He often says the class is really good at understanding the little small details - because students were inclined to look up every little word they didn't know. But the real importance of his class is figuring out which of those small details were important and which of those were not. Just make sure to speak up and speak slowly.",
    "I learned how to read and analyze scientific papers and got a deeper understanding of how research is actually conducted.",
    "Greater knowledge and comfort with experimental methods (theory). Greatly increased competency with regard to reading a scientific paper and understanding a scientific paper in detail",
    "The course really helps students comprehensively develop their analytical skills by going in depth into some of the most some of the most important scientific papers in molecular biology. It teaches you the necessary skill of honing in to the necessary information and makes you a better researcher going forward, all in a collaborative setting with with a great mentor."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The papers themselves were all very cool! I really enjoyed learning the variety of techniques used for landmark experiments. Weakness: Prof Rosenbaum wasn't afraid to call students out for bad ideas. It was quite intimidating but honestly made us more aware of our answers. There also wasn't any way to know how Prof Rosenbaum was grading- it seemed like it was purely based on his opinion of you.",
    "I really enjoyed the opportunity to dive into some key papers that have influenced the field of cell biology. Professor Rosenbaum does a good job of guiding discussion and leading us to consider questions and facets of the writing that we might not have thought about at first. I also like that we read one or two papers a week, which allowed me to spend a good amount of time with the papers instead of being overloaded with work. I think the main weakness of this class is that we don't receive much feedback about our performance until the end of the course, so we don't know if there are specific ways we can improve (although I do feel that I improved throughout the course of the semester).",
    "Strengths: I really liked the structure of the class, and I learned a lot from Prof Rosenbaum!",
    "I really enjoyed the way that the class is structured but the ability to get accurate feedback on how I was doing in the class is difficult given the discussion based nature of the class.",
    "Strength: interesting work, but never burdensome. No out of class assignments other than reading and prepping for presentations Weakness: 2 hours can be kind of a long time to discuss a paper"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It only meets once a week which is nice, even though it is two hours long. The papers are also really interesting and good to read, especially with the depth that this class requires.",
    "I would recommend this course to any MCDB student who wants to discuss some interesting papers very deeply. I found the class engaging, and I feel that I have learned a lot and gained a lot of skills. Plus, Professor Rosenbaum has some really interesting insights and anecdotes that keep class lively. It does require students to participate a lot in seminar, so if that makes someone uncomfortable, they should take a different class, but I found that committing more effort to the class led to a more valuable learning experience.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. We read papers every week and lead the discussion once or twice the entire semester. Prof Rosenbaum is great and I learned a lot from him!",
    "The best STEM class I've taken at Yale. Prof. Rosenbaum is a gem and extremely knowledgable. Definitely take if you can get in. The workload is really manageable with only one paper to read per week and the class is entirely discussion based. Difficult to know what your grade will be as there are no exams or quizzes but the discussions are always interesting and we really dive deep into some of the landmark papers of cell bio.",
    "For sure!"
