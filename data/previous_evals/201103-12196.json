    "It's cool, it's fun, and the reading list is incredible. Take it, especially if you like sci fi and philosophical theory as it applies to fiction.",
    "Lots of work fairly interesting",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you're interested in utopian thought. The reading load is a lot but if you read at least one book for every class meeting, you'll be able to participate in discussion",
    "The material was very interesting, with both philosophy and fiction readings. There was however an impossibly large amount of reading assigned every week. Professor Berger is a great enthusiast for the material and leads very free discussions, but sometimes I would have appreciated a more structured class given the sheer volume of reading assigned.",
    "A lot of reading. A lot of writing. But great syllabus, so if you're interested in the texts, then I would recommend the class.",
    "Too much work considering the payoff. Some of the ideas and themes will stick with me, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it.",
    "Dont take."
