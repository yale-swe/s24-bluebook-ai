   "comments": [
    "This class was very tedious, but Dr. G and the TA were extremely helpful during lab and in writing the lab reports. Whether you're taking this as a requirement or not, Dr. G is a good professor to have for 116L.",
    "It's a very time consuming class and not really worth the half credit unless it's for a major.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this lab course if you are taking Chem 114 at the same time. It would probably seem like to much of a chore otherwise. It goes by quickly because you get into each experiment.",
    "A good intro to lab chemistry, but a lot of work for half a credit. Depending on your TA, it can be a very enjoyable class or a tough time.",
    "I recommend this course if you are doing into a science field. I learned a lot of skills that will be needed in the future.",
    "CHEM 116L is a great first lab class. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",
    "The workload is not greater than other classes, but considering the class is only worth .5 credits, be wary of taking it. To receive good marks, you will need to put in at least 4 (sometimes up to 8) hours per week on your lab reports outside of class.",
    "I do not recommend this class, the materials alone cost a bit of money that can better be spent on other things.",
    "I would only take it if its necessary for your future degree\/endeavors.",
    "I would only recommend it if you're pre-med. It's not a lab course that you would take just for fun. Also, the lab reports and really long and tedious, so make sure to get them done beforehand and not cram the night before.",
    "A great introduction to working in a lab. The experiments are interesting, and the time in lab honestly flies by.",
    "If you don't have to take it honestly I wouldn't. It's pretty stressful and so much work for only half of a credit. Labs are also 4 hours long which isn't ideal. I hear that the gen chem labs are the worst and it only gets better however. It isn't hard to get a good grade if you do all of the work well so in that respect it might be worth it, but just be aware it is quite the time commitment.",
    "A lab that teaches proper lab conventions, skills, and note-taking.",
    "Yes, but be prepared for a lot of work.",
    "Half the credit and double the work. However, you will leave the lab with a much stronger set of laboratory skills. The lecture helped me understand certain concepts much more than lecture itself. The grading for quizzes and labs was too picky at times.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 116L to students taking CHEM 114.",
    "CHEM 116L does a really good job of reinforcing the concepts taught in CHEM 112\/CHEM 114. A lot of the experiments are centered around the material taught in the lecture courses so it does a good job of learning more about the topics through experimental discoveries. Many of the experiments also emphasize proper experimental technique which is important for future lab courses.",
    "Chem 116 is a laboratory course associated with introductory general chemistry. It follows the themes studied in general chemistry with experimental manifestations of the concepts. The reports provide an opportunity to think more deeply about the implications of the observations made in lab. I would recommend this course to someone in need of a laboratory course because it is a manageable work load.",
    "Dr.G was very helpful throughout the semester, especially to those who have never had lab experience. His lectures before each lab help clear up majority of questions or misunderstandings you have prior to conducting the lab. However, many of the lab reports were quite difficult and forced you to learn new material on your own. Some of the lab reports took 6-8 hours, where some could be finished in 2. It greatly varied each week. The quizzes weren't too bad, but make sure you know significant figures or you will get tedious points taken off.",
    "This is the lab course that accompanies CHEM 114 and teaches you lab techniques such as volumetric titrations and pipetting skills. It's a good course if you've never been in a lab before and the times are very flexible if scheduling is a concern (there are 6-10 pm sections). The workload is more than that of a half credit class, but as long as you don't put off the lab report until the day before it's due, it is manageable.",
    "If you do not need to take it, I would not recommend it. The lab is pretty interesting at some parts but it is mostly tedious work and should be worth more than just half a credit.",
    "Chem 116L was a great intro to actually doing chemistry in a lab. It was new and exciting. The course itself was tough at times because it was something I had never done before, but in the end it was enjoyable and very rewarding.",
    "CHEM 116L is a great overview of laboratory procedure. I recommend for anyone considering continuing with Chemistry.",
    "I would say that chem 116 is fairly interesting. It can be a lot of work but if you spend the time doing the work you will do well. The experiments vary from very interesting to pretty boring, depending on the day. But overall it was a good experience.",
    "I would only take this class if you have to for your major. However if you do have to take it is it not so terrible just a little long.",
    "Great course that really helps out a lot!",
    "I would recommend CHEM 116L for anyone who needs to take a chemistry lab to fulfill either major or premedical requirements. I would not suggest that anyone take it who doesn't need it, as it probably won't be very helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course for a student who has not had previous lab experience or one who wants to refresh their basic lab practical skills.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you need to take it for a requirement. The workload is far greater than just a half credit and you won't enjoy it unless you have a genuine interest in chemistry or need it for a major. If you are just looking for a half credit this isn't the best way to do it.",
    "Chem 116L is a lab class in which we do experiments to supplement our learning from our gen chem class (either 114 or 112). Chem 116 was somewhat helpful in expanding my understanding of the course material in my gen chem class, though I could probably have done fine without it. A lot of the focus is on calculating things (constants etc.) that we learned about in class.",
    "I would recommend Chem 116L to students that have to take it to fulfill premed requirements or requirements in their major. It's a great introduction to chemistry lab work, but came off as extremely tedious at times.",
    "While this class is a lot of work (lab reports, pre-lab, etc.), the course itself is enjoyable and very satisfying to complete. The T.F.s are really great, and if you take this class alongside your chemistry class, it really does help to further your understanding of the course (that goes both ways). Dr. G is very pleasant and helpful, and you will become better at writing labs and doing experiments as time progresses.",
    "It's a great introductory lab course that teaches you the basic skills you need to work in a lab. If you're taking CHEM 114, I would definitely recommend that you take the class.",
    "I recommend it for people who have a lot of time and need a lab credit",
    "Most people are taking this class to fulfill pre-med requirements. Although some experiments can be quite tedious, overall it's a good lab to help introduce you to laboratory basics.",
    "Overall experiments were pretty boring, especially at the beginning, but it picks up a little and the grading was very fair. Class was easy to succeed in if you were prepared and Dr. G added humor and made it more fun. My TF was great.",
    "I would recommend students to focus on the fun of the chemistry instead of focusing on their grade.",
    "Double the work, half the credit.",
    "Yea, take it it you are in Chem 114 because it will help you understand the material.",
    "Chemistry 116L was a useful introductory course in working in a lab. They teach you about every technique so if you, like me, have absolutely no experience in a lab, you aren't at a disadvantage. I'd definitely recommend anyone take the class. However, even though it's a half credit be prepared for the work and time commitment of a full credit course.",
    "Chem 116L was a very good experience. It gives you a better understanding of general chemistry as it is an extension of the introductory chem. classes. I would definitely recommend it for other students.",
    "CHEM 116 is a challenging course but one that you learn an incredible amount from. Leaving this class I feel comfortable working independently in a laboratory environment and confident in my ability to make precise and accurate measurements. It also complements CHEM 114 very well, and helped me learn material for the course.",
    "the class is very long and monotonous and can be difficult",
    "I would definitely recommend Chem 116L to another student because I thought it was fun and a good lab to take to learn the basis procedural steps to follow in any lab. The only reason why I wouldn't recommend the lab is because the lab reports take a lot of time to complete.",
    "Awful. But you have to take it if you are premed or thinking about certain majors. Make sure you schedule it at a time that will allow you to get into \"the zone\".",
    "Please do not take Chem 116 if it is not required. It consumes a large portion of time and while you learn the basics of a lab (which will be very helpful for stem majors), the class felt unnecessarily strict at times, especially the grading.",
    "I would recommend it, it's exactly what you would expect from a lab course",
    "Chem 116L wasn't my favorite class just because it's difficult being in a single area for four hours, but overall the lab isn't horrible. Some labs are more interesting than others and some reports are more tedious than others, but in the end, the lab is required as a prereq for many majors and can be fun.",
    "Chem 116L offers a great opportunity for one to become comfortable with the basics of a chemistry lab and gain lots of hands-on experience.",
    "If you want to fulfill pre-reqs and improve your lab technique then take this course. If not, then don't take it because it really is long and tedious and not very exciting.",
    "This is an intro lab course in order to familiarize students with basic lab techniques. I would recommend students interested in chemistry to take this course and learn how to carry out basic labs.",
    "Take it; it's good if you're taking CHEM 114 and want the lab experience.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to improve their lab skills.",
    "Chem 116L is definitely something you should take alongside chem 114. There were random little lab techniques that I had forgotten, so the lab was a helpful reminder. Doing well is very easy. There is a pre-lecture and quiz before lab each week. Lab report due every week, but they are super easy because Dr. G gives you a template (all you have to do is basically fill in the blanks). And there is one final practical. Kind of miserably long (around 3 hours usually), but low pressure and stress.",
    "Fairly interesting lab, lab write ups take a lot of time.",
    "Chem 116 enhanced my chemistry experience this semester. I gained valuable tools and information that put what I was learning in CHEM 114 into real life applications.",
    "Only take if you need to.",
    "Only take this course if you need to. It's long, tedious, and involves a large portion of time dedicated to lab reports. If you're interested in chemistry it can be satisfying and interesting at times, but I can't imagine how awful it would be for someone just dabbling in the sciences for a semester.",
    "For a course taken almost solely as a prerequisite for a major or med school. However, the course was not bad. There was a good bit of work, but not an exorbitant amount. The main purpose of this course was to teach the students how to work in a laboratory, so the grading was very lenient.",
    "It is a great course and a great way to be introduced to experimental chemistry.",
    "The only reason you should take this is to meet PreMed requirements. It is a fairly large time commitment (a 4 hour class & several hours on weekends for Writeups) for only half a credit. Overall, not fun but definitely could be worse. Not too difficult, but it is monotonous.",
    "Would generally recommend. It's a good course to teach lab basics... I just wish we'd done some cooler experiments.",
    "CHEM 116L is a laboratory course that is paired with the CHEM 114 or 112 lecture course. It provides students with first-hand experience of laboratory experiments, procedures, techniques, and equipment, indlucing an understandign of precision and accuracy. I would certainly recommend this class to another student planning to take CHEM 114 or 112.",
    "This class teaches basic laboratory skills and helps students become familiar with a laboratory. I would recommend this class to a fellow students.",
    "I would recommend the lab to anyone--it's easy to do well as long as you do the work.",
    "I would say this course is a bit tedious for a student who has already taken a lab section associated with AP Chemistry in high school. However, it is a great introduction into how a lab course is conducted at the college level. The content is mostly review from AP Chemistry, but it serves as a great review for anyone who plans on taking chemistry at college. It eases the student into the subject by dealing with familiar topics. I would recommend this course to another student, but I would let that student know that the classes are very long. Choosing the correct time slot is crucial, and lab reports can be stressful.",
    "Take it if you need to",
    "Dont take it if you dont have to, but you probably do. It is boring and not very informative.",
    "Chem 116 will seem like a lot of work, especially for the half-credit it awards, so unless you really want to pursue something in Bio\/Chem, there are probably better options to explore the sciences. With that said, I still enjoyed the course and will be coming back for 117 next semester.",
    "CHEM 116L is a useful lab component to accompany Chem 114. It is helpful in understanding material covered in lecture on a practical basis. The professor and teaching assistants were also excellent. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Put in the work before and after lab, as well as paying attention in lab itself and this class will come easily. Be sure to ask your TA questions if you have any and take your time in lab. Rarely ran out of time. Titrations are annoying."
