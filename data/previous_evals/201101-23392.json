    "I think the class was great but wish Professor Unger had done some more introductory lectures into eachsubject to set the stage. The subject matter and readings were very interesting but the course was too heavy on student presentations.",
    "See question 13 for my comments on the class.",
    "An excellent course on a crucially important topic. The lectures were so good, my main comment would be that slightly less emphasis on student-led work would be good for next year--but this course is essential to anyone working on climate issues.",
    "Question 8.The class has really exposed me to a number of key issues in today's climate and air pollution debates. That said, students can get more out of the class if they can go through more basic trainings in the beginning of the class, instead of jump quickly into presentations of advanced papers."

    "Class discussion",

    "I am now much more informed on the significance of non-CO2 emissions, regional and global impacts, how complicated it is to actually measure, and the uncertainty of it all.",
    "It is a great class for students interested in learning more about climate and air pollution.",
    "Highly applicable to climate change policy. Very helpful in explaining climate science and air pollution effects.",
    "Student presentations, very insightful and often good discussions afterwards."

   "comments": [
    "It was clear that this was the first time the professor had taught a course and she didn't do that much teaching. The class basically self-taught in that the students read the articles and then presented them. I would have learned a lot more if the professor had taught more - she's clearly an expert in the field and knows so much but I didn't really learn that much from her own knowledge base. It would also have been helpful if before each presentation she could have said why she chose the article, how it fits within the context of the class and also highlight points that the students may have missed. Having the lights off every class really killed the energy in the class - it was a true \"death by powerpoint\" experience.",
    "Perhaps more background\/introductory lectures on climate modeling and metrics earlier on in the course.",
    "I would have preferred for Professor Unger to occasionally lecture or be more involved in leading discussion. Having students responsible for presenting on papers each week, for the entire class, left much to be desired.",
    "The discussion needs to be a bit more lively.",
    "A more specific examination of modeling methods in the first few meetings would be very useful. It is not easy to give students with such diverse backgrounds a foundation in modeling methods\/issues, but it would significantly improve their future work. If you can find a way to provide more instruction that will allow the class to engage each of the papers with a greater depth of understanding\/critique, this course will become one of the most important in the School.",
    "sometimes the conversation was dominated by 2-3 students and focused on very specific details, which was not always helpful for understanding material.",
    "In the first few weeks of the class, it would be much more beneficial for students if Professor Unger can give a series of lectures cover the basic of climate science. Many students felt unprepared when we started to present findings from advanced scientific papers soon after the semester started."

    "I wish there had been more lecture and understanding of basic concepts before we delved into the really complex scientific literature. I realize this was a seminar but what other class could we have taken to get that background information before taking the seminar? I can't think of one. Maybe do first half of the semester on teaching the basics, then go into complex literature the second half.",

    "If you don't plan on doing the readings don't take the class.",
    "Talk to the professor if you don't understand something, and do reading - very helpful. Start the paper early.",
    "The first couple classes build the foundations for rest of the presentations and discussions. Try your best efforts to understand the basic science and connections between different mechanisms.Also, read the papers. Even though some were really long, it would be good to at least skim through it. That way you would have something to contribute to the discussion."
