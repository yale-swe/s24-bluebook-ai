    "Q7b: Dave did a great job as TA. However, I cannot say the same about the communication coaches that the professor hired to help teach the workshop portions of the class. It may have been that I happened to be in sessions with poor instructors, but they rarely gave any kind of feedback, and I had a hard time learning anything from them.Q10: This course offered good basic guidelines for communication, but the guidelines sometimes felt very constricting, as though the creativity of writing and speaking was slowly being eroded.",
    "It was helpful to have opportunity to practice, I wish I\u0092d had presentations that I was doing for other classes that I could practice. Perhaps one way to address this would be to have the class at the second half of the semester when students are closer to turning in final projects and presentations for other classes.I appreciate the tips and subject matter is great.The assignments were good. Lots of breadth in the class, but good checklist of ways to improve communication.At times the professor was a bit overbearing. His biases against the ability of some groups to communicate clearly came out frequently and were mildly offensive. Examples include: secretaries, women, F&ES students.That said, his lessons are very clear and lectures were mostly entertaining.",
    "This class should be offered every year. It is incredibly valuable in developing professional skills, and the professor is excellent. I only wish this could be a year-long course or better yet, a program that you opt into after MODS to improve one's communication skills over the course of 2 years.",
    "Question 7: Vance is a great instructor of the material but often made insensitive remarks in lecture which distracted from the material. If gender and cultural generalizations are going to be used as examples, they need better framing (i.e. \"Women are often seen as less effectives communicators beginning with their handshakes. Today I will teach you how to avoid that pitfall\" instead of \"Women are bad at presenting themselves starting with the handshake- so we're going to work on that today.\"",
    "It would have been really helpful to get feedback on the homework and our performance.",
    "I recommend every F&ES student take the course, ideally as a full-term, 3-credit course.",
    "Question 8. The course is great, but I wish it's a longer class. Many sessions seem very rushed due to the time limitation (we only have 12 hours for the entire class). It would be much more beneficial to students if the class sessions are doubled and we have more time to practice things we learned through lectures.",
    "Q10: I think this is a very valuable course, and everyone should have the opportunity to benefit from it in some way. I consciously used strategies from the course when designing presentations of my research, speaking in front of groups, and running meetings."

This allows you to see how you are projecting yourself and is very insightful.Additionally - The readings were short but great. The presentations that the instructor gave were also useful. I think practicing and getting feedback on our presentations was also useful.",

There were many opportunities to practice skills learned in class!Lectures were short, succinct and direct to the point, with the most important concepts highlighted throughout. This made a 6pm Monday night class not only quite digestible, but enjoyable.",

   "comments": [
    "the communications coaches. william gave helpful tips by letting us make mistakes first, but the coaches were unhelpful in my experience.",
    "I found the class a worthwhile venue for practicing my public speaking but wish that I would have gotten more guidance and feedback throughout the semester. The design of the class, lecture at the start and the last half of the class for presentations, complicated prepping for presentations because specific tips to incorporate were not given until the first half of the class. Perhaps breaking the class into two nights per week instead, one early in the week for the lecture and then one later in the week for presentation after students have time to prepare.",
    "I think and additional week or two would be useful, there is so much more to cover.",
    "not enough feedback on your assignments",
    "The length of the course is too short. We had a good rhythm going - we were learning a lot, getting settled in our work groups, and then it ended. It seemed like there was no shortage of material that Prof. Vance could have covered, and we certainly would have benefited from the extra time to practice on the issues we identified where we needed to improve.",
    "I would have appreciated feedback on homework and even more constructive criticism from instructors on things like the presentation and networking pitch.",
    "Wish that folks weren\u0092t always so positive in their criticism and could give more constructive, real feedback.",
    "More time and depth to do the material justice (a 2-3 credit class)",
    "It is too short.",
    "There is a lot of work for a 1-unit class; maybe it could be worth 1.5 or 2",
    "The professor made some highly inappropriate comments about different groups (women, international students, etc). It was very distracting - I chose to stay in the course despite his comments because I wanted to improve my communication skills. However, I'm pretty disappointed that FES allows him to say those kinds of things in class and that I had to hear those comments while taking a class on, of all things, effective communication.",
    "It would be great to receive feedback from each of the instructors or at least everytime and allow more time for feedback in each group.",
    "The instructions for the assignments were a bit unclear at times.",
    "The duration should be extended",
    "Make it a full semester in length instead of just a short course. We had to go through the material very quickly and I would have liked spending more time on each skill we covered. I also didn't feel like a lot of the professional folks he had come in to work with us actually did that much. I was expecting them to give us more feedback\/interact with us more.",
    "It would be great if this were made into a full-term course - I could use much more help than 1-credit's worth.",
    "It should be thought as a 3 credit class because being taught as 1 credit for a month forces the Professor to compress lecture materials. If taught for a 3 credit it will be very helpful to students because it is such a wonderful class.",
    "individual feedback on assignments.",
    "It was too short and the course must be extended to 10-12 lectures.",
    "Not much more you can improve upon in a six week course. It would be nice to have additional one on one sessions with professor Vance. (Although this may be difficult with such a large class).",
    "The assignments were quite difficult because we had to first create our own situation which made the assignments more time consuming than necessary for a 1 credit class.",
    "The course is too short! We need more practice and face-to-face time with the coaches.",
    "This course should be expanded into a semester long endeavor. The skills and lessons taught are invaluable, a basic necessity for a professional in any field, but especially for a professional seeking to communicate difficult and often unpalatable ideas, like the ideas of an environmentalist.The course highlights FES's current scant emphasis on the development of a professional demeanor tailored to public policy and other highly interactive fields.",
    "There was never enough time to practice and be critiqued, and occasionally Dr. Vance made bizarre jokes or showed video clips that while not crossing the line to be racist or sexist certainly distracted from his message about communicating."
