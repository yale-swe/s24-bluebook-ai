   "comments": [
    "a great syllabus with a great professor, and a well-structured class; providing the final weeks to discuss paper topics in class was a brilliant idea.",
    "Take it--if not for Woolf then for Professor Homans, who is a legend for a reason.",
    "I would recommend it--overall, this was a great class. The reading list was wonderful (although lengthy). Professor Homans is an encouraging and enthusiastic section leader, and was always willing to help tease out ideas in office hours. We spent a good amount of time in the last few weeks of class discussing our paper ideas with our classmates, which I found helpful--the format encouraged us to think about our paper ideas early and allow them to evolve\/respond to feedback. The reading is time-intensive but rewarding.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Homans is a meticulous and deep reader. This was clear in class as we all sat in silence and then marveled afterward at her memory. In guiding classes, Professor Homans struck the perfect balance between guiding the arc of discussion and the course while allowing for productive sidebars. This made not only the course, but each class feel whole and intellectually rewarding. Outside of class, Professor Homans made herself so available and friendly. The comments I received back on my papers was thorough and detailed. The quality of my ideas, thinking, and grammar all ascended to a new level! If you've even a passing interest in Woolf, you will likely emerge with a love. If you already love Woolf, this is a no brainer...",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Virginia Woolf, the modernist novel, or feminist fiction. If you have never read Woolf before but love modernist fiction, you will become fascinated by her. If you have read either a lot of or a little Woolf before, taking this class will give you an interesting and different perspective. I found it a very productive exercise to read all the major works of a single author. Professor Homans is a terrific discussion leader and will open your mind to a multiplicity of ways of interpreting Woolf. She is always available to talk to students and extremely helpful in the final paper writing process.",
    "If you are in love with Virginia Woolf, this is a must-take. You read through all of her works, supplemented by illuminating and fascinating critical readings, and see how politics, aesthetics, and history all interweave. I was never bored by a single class. Discussion was wonderful and genuine.",
    "Yes, but be warned - TONS of reading, intense discussion, and one big paper (plus a little 3 page one, but that hardly counts for anything). Make sure you GO TO OFFICE HOURS for Homans, because she's really helpful but you'll be lost if you don't go to her. All of the reading is good too, so it's worth putting the effort in.",
    "Highly recommended: A wonderful in-depth examination of Woolf's work. As a newcomer to Woolf studies, I loved it and felt I was given engaging exposure to her work, thought, and critical reception. Does a very good job of balancing English and WGSS aspects",
    "MUST-TAKE CLASS for any English major!",
    "This was a great, fast-paced reading\/discussion seminar on Virginia Woolf's fiction and a selection of her non-fiction. Weekly readings generally consisted of a novel and a few essays of criticism; discussions were sometimes frustrating because we didn't have time to move through everything we had read for that week. There isn't much writing, just the long final paper, which is open-ended. I would definitely recommend this course."
