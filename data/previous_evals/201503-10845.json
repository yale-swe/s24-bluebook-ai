   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend this course if you can take it with Prof. Crabtree. Hope he teaches it again so more students can both learn and enjoy the material.",
    "Yes, very important for most chemists",
    "Absolutely take this course",
    "Should take it if you are doing inorganic chemistry.",
    "It's a good overview of the basic principles of organometallic, and new discoveries in relevant fields. It's quite informative for students in preparative chemistry.",
    "I will definitely recommend this course. It gives us fundamental knowledge of chemistry.",
    "Organometallics is a very useful class for graduate students in both organic and inorganic chemistry. I would recommend it, but with a warning that you need to be prepared to put in a lot of work outside of class to actually learn the material.",
    "I am rather torn on this question. On one hand, I think that the material is fascinating and relevant to the current scientific field. Based on that, I would recommend the class to another student. However, I found the actual class time associated with this course to be a waste. Due to the teaching style used in this course, I did not retain anything and frankly found it to be a bit frustrating. I had high hopes that this class was going to be phenomenal, but it honestly wasn't.",
    "yes, difficult course if you have never taken inorganic, but Crabtree makes it manageable",
    "This course is obviously a classic, given that it is taught by Crabtree. The little stories about people and research are what made me come To class, but if you just want the info, just read the book. It's identical to lecture but much more processable.",
    "Id recommend it but it helps if you have inorganic background",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course covers an excellent history and expansive b=number of topics that influence all disciplines of chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student. It covers a lot of useful organometallic chemistry and is taught by one of the leaders of the field. You will definitely learn a lot. The only problem is that there are no problem sets assigned throughout the semester so you end up just learning everything right before the exams.",
    "It was challenging but highly informative. I would recommend this to another student because I learned a lot from this course.",
    "I strongly recommend this class to anyone in synthetic chemistry."

   "comments": [
    "This will be very helpful background in my research. Necessary since I will be working in an area similar to this\/the same as what we discussed.",
    "Helped me develop my organometallic background.",
    "Giving me the general idea of organometallic chemistry. Teaching me how to analyze and design novel reactions.",
    "I definitely learned a lot from the course that will help me in my future research. However, I was disappointed in the overall quality of the class. Although I attended all of the lectures, I felt that they did not enhance my understanding of the material. Rather, I had to spend many hours outside of class studying the textbook to teach myself the material.",
    "This class was definitely relevant for my discipline\/research. As an inorganic graduate student, my project directly relates to organometallic complexes, so in that regard, this class was exceptionally useful.",
    "excellent",
    "The textbook- of which I read in its entirety (yes, I know this is absurd, but Bob likes detail) was very useful. The course itself was not. More engagement, practice problems, etc would have been nice. I had to form a study group for this course to do the practice problems every week to stay engaged and for the course to be useful.",
    "Yes",
    "This was the first course that taught me how to approach problems in organometallics.",
    "Yes the course was both beneficial in my discipline and will contribute to my dissertation.",
    "I now have a better understanding of the mechanisms related to organometallic chemistry.",
    "I learned a lot about metals and the field of organometallic chemistry, which I have not had much previous encounter with in the lab. We were also taught useful ways to think like a scientist and lessons about research from past scientists, which was very great and important for me to learn as a first year graduate student."
