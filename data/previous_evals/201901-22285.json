    "In this course I learned the nuts and bolts of plant eco-physiology. This included learning and developing skills to measure various aspects of physiology such as turgor loss point and how to determine the type of photosynthesis used by a plant. Learning the details of fundamental topics like photosynthesis and water transport provides insights into the more complex phenomena that we often discuss like the evolution of photosynthesis, adaptation to new environments, etc.",
    "I learned so much about plant physiology and anatomy, and how plant-eco-evolutionary interactions can change plants' structure and function. I also greatly improved my ability to read and understand a scientific journal article, and walked through the entire process of designing, conducting, and presenting a research process. I gained an understanding of what the current landscape of botanical research looks like, what the big unanswered questions are, and how I could see myself continuing to pursue a career in this field."

   "comments": [
    "While writing responses to multiple papers was time consuming, it's a really useful exercise for learning how to read, digest, and critically evaluate primary literature. Personally, I'm a fan of having students post a few questions\/comments about what was challenging\/confusing\/interesting before the class to guide what aspects we should cover in lecture. I think this is can be a better way to take the pulse of the class rather than asking in class.",
    "Professor Edwards teaching was phenomenal. Her lectures were fascinating, sometimes amusing, and it was always easy to ask questions or go over confusing things again. Assignments were graded fairly and presented so as to be as painless and stress-free as possible. Because the class was small, we were able to delve deeper into the material and structure parts of the course around our research interests."

    "Yes, if you want to learn how plants work, you need this course!",
    "Yes, absolutely!! This was definitely the highlight of my semester, and probably the best STEM course I've taken at Yale. It really reinforced my commitment to stay in science and made me feel excited about the prospect of research at a graduate level."
