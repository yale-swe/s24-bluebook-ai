    "MB&B 300 is the best course that I have taken at Yale thus far. It integrates science courses that I've taken over the past three years, and really develops critical thinking skills. The information taught is both important and interesting. Highly recommended (especially over MCDB biochemistry)",
    "Great lectures, 2 quizzes and 2 midterms with 1 final. Curve is brutal as hell so make sure to study alot. Overall enjoyable.",
    "The course is extremely interesting and the course load is not too much. You will learn how to become a better scientist and biochemist as the course is not just a bunch of memorization.",
    "SOOOOOOOOOOO much better than the MCDB Biochem (which I did the first 1\/3 of the course, last semester). The class asks you to memorize, but not for the sake of memorizing. It's interesting, relevant, the professors go out of their way to provide fun supplements---take this biochem course and not the other!!",
    "for sure take it over the MCDB biochem. do not take it with other hard science classes because you will not do well. you need to put in a lot of work and if you do, you will get a lot out of it.",
    "Take it if you like biochem! It's interesting material, well-taught, and we use a good book. This course is divided into two halves, each half taught by a different professors. The lecturers are good - pretty engaging. Prof. Koelle is very energetic. There are two midterms and final, as well as two quizzes, and a pset every week. The psets are easy, but you should try to do them without looking at your lectures first - you need to know that material for the exam. The quizzes are easy too, as long as you study - it's memorization. The midterms are not too difficult. They try not to test rote memorization, but biochem inevitably involves some memorization, so go ahead and memorize those terms and formulas.",
    "Only take it if you are premed or you need it for your major. Otherwise it's too much work and not really as interesting as everyone says it will be.",
    "Its a rush through a variety of biochemical subjects, ending with metabolism. I would definitely recommend it over the MB&B course, since it covers topics in depth, the course is organized well, the workload is reasonable, and the exams are reasonable.",
    "MB&B is a wonderful course! It allows you to finally understand why all those terrible Chemistry classes are important! I felt as though I was learning about something very relevant to myself both as a human being and a future physician. Take this class, whether required or not, because it will truly open your eyes to the beautiful intricacies of science (while still being comprehensible and entertaining along the way!).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is challenging, but you learn a lot of interesting material. The course is very well organized and the professors are pretty good lecturers. Unfortunately, expect one of the most challenging group of students ever assembled (the overachieving Yale premeds), but if you can deal with that, it is a good course.",
    "I enjoyed the class overall. It was pretty painless to keep up with and understand the material, and the tests were very fair, albeit difficult.",
    "Yes. This is a great class, though a lot of work (and memorization) to do well on the midterm and finals. Overall I enjoyed the class.",
    "This course is a great introduction to biochemistry at a detailed level. Students end the semester with a general understanding of the molecules of life and deep knowledge of specific topics like metabolism. There are two professors, and both are good lecturers. The lecture slides and the TAs ensured that there was no confusion about what material was important to learn. There isn't that much reading, and most of the relevant material comes from the lectures. While the exams involve a huge amount of memorization, they also force students to think about principles and apply them to new situations.",
    "It's biochem. The metabolism material is fairly interesting but the average on the exams tends to be pretty high. They tell you they will just focus on concepts on the exams but you also have to focus on the specifics.",
    "this is a great course as long as you have time to keep up with the lectures. the material isnt too hard but it definitely builds on itself so its important to go to all the lectures or atleast read over the slides. if you do that you dont need to do any of the reading and the exams really arent too hard. it is interesting material.",
    "While this course is extremely interesting and very well taught, it is incredibly hard to beat the average since the majority of people in the course are die-hard pre-meds. It's still definitely worth taking unless you're terrified of the possibility of not getting an A or an A-.",
    "This course is both well-taught and well-organized. The material is decently interesting; my only complaint was that the focus was rather bio-heavy. I would have liked to see more of a chemistry approach to some things. Still, I would recommend this class if you're interested in the material.",
    "Overall I really enjoyed this class.Both of the professors were great and the lectures were clear and interesting. If you go to class and listen, it's not hard to do well on the tests. The weekly problem sets were also not too overwhelming and because they are composed of old test questions they are a good way to study the material as you go along as opposed to cramming right before a test. Over the course of this semester I've learned an amazing amount of material relatively painlessly. I don't know much about the MCDB biochem, but my understanding is that the MCDB course is more about memorization and this course requires you to understand concepts more than memorize facts. Don't be scared away by people who tell you that that MBB course is harder, it's really manageable and even enjoyable (this is coming from a non-science major, premed). Probably the best science course I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are pre-med and want to take biochem. I was deciding between this and the other biochem course and I am really glad I took this one. It supposedly has less memorization and is more conceptually based, which is what I like better. Both professors are engaging and interesting. Take this one if you need to take biochem!",
    "MBB 300 is a great class. It's quite a bit of work and the curve is very steep, but the material is wonderful and the lectures are great. Honestly, this is one of the best science classes I have taken here and it's unusual to have lecturers who seem to care about their students as much as Koelle and Biederer do.",
    "The course material is very interesting and well taught. I enjoyed it more than most of the biology courses I've taken at Yale. However, it's hard to get a great grade, as the curve is pretty tough.",
    "You would learn a lot. This class forces you to think. Just know that even if you studied very hard for this course you might not get the grade you want, because others would always be studying twice as hard. Go into it wanting to learn the material, and never fall behind in lectures.",
    "Its a very well taught course. I thought both Prof. Biederer and Koelle were excellent lecturers, and they presented the information very quickly. Its one of the best taught science courses at Yale, and you learn alot. This class would have been perfect except for the fact that everyone in it is super smart and this sort of ruined the curve.",
    "It's a great class, not a ton of work. Just make sure to know everything on the lecture slides, because even if they tell you that details aren't important they end up making a difference in your grade. The curve is VERY steep, almost to the point that the curve doesn't serve much of a function in changing your grade (often, in order to be in A- range, you need an 88 or above on the midterms). Just make sure to spend time learning all the details and the concepts and you'll be fine. The textbook is helpful but it's not necessary to do the reading to understand the material and do well in the class. The problem sets also don't take very long.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. I feel like I learned a lot in the end.",
    "You will easily learn a ton in this course if you want to. I really enjoyed the lectures - they were well delivered, and the slides were very clear. If you study the lectures thoroughly, you will do very well on the tests.",
    "It covered a lot of material and I learned so much. However, the curve was horrendous and I would only suggest that you take thisclass if you were pre-med or MB&B.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Its so totally wicked. If you are at all interested in life, biology, and how things work, take MBB 300. You'll love it.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, the professors are great, the curve in the class is very tight (if you want an A you probably need a numerical A, you won't get curved up much) but it is one of the better organized and better taught science classes here. The end of class supplements that you arent tested on are awesome, great idea by the professors",
    "This is a good course but it is fairly hard. I would not recommend taking it unless you have to.",
    "If you are thinking about majoring in MBB, if you are a chemistry student looking to expand your horizons, or if you are premed, you should take this class",
    "I would recommend it for general knowledge, but it is difficult. You have to be on top of everything.",
    "Take it if you want to be a doctor (M.D. or PhD). A very, very well-taught class. Drs. Thomas Biederer and Michael Koelle are absolutely fantastic. Don't, for a second, even think about taking the MCDB introductory biochemistry course. From what I've heard, it involves straight regurgitation of ridiculously complex and difficult-to-learn cycles, such as the urea cycle, the Calvin cycle, the Kreb's cycle, glycolysis, the electron transport chain, etc.This class does NOT make you randomly memorize these things!!!! The only things that you will have to memorize only once (only for a quiz and that's it) are: the amino acids (and side chain pKa's) and glycolysis. But after the respective quizzes for these topics, you absolutely do not to rote memorize these items for the rest of the class!Again, this class is amazing. Don't even think about taking the MCDB version. Or else you will regret it forever. I promise. Trust me.",
    "Would recommend, you pretty much have to take it for pre-med or the major. It's a ton of memorization so start early and never fall behind, much like any other hard science class.",
    "It's not an easy course, but it's interesting and--dare I say it?--fun at times. Both Biederer and Koelle are awesome.",
    "This class is wonderful. It's important to stay on top of the material because there's a lot to learn (memorization and comprehension) and it builds up fast, but it's also fascinating material and you leave feeling like you really have learned a lot, something I don't alwaysfeel in some of my lectures.This course convinced me to be an MB&B major -- if you have any interest in biochemistry, definitely shop it! It's a great course.",
    "MB&B 300 is a great course - it packs a lot of information into one semester but it is a pretty interesting lecture and fairly engaging. Koelle and Biederer are both fantastic instructors, are always willing to answer questions, and present material in an organized and accessible way. The exams test largely conceptual understanding and only some pure memorization, contrary to the standard opinion of biochemistry. However, the reading load can be heavy at times (you do have to stay on top of it), though you are only tested on material in the lecture slides. Also, the curve in the class can be quite unforgiving, as everyone in the class works very hard.",
    "This is a good class... I took it in place of MCDB 300 for the MCDB major, and ithink that was a good choice. It's interesting if you want to learn about different kinds of molecules in your body (proteins, enzymes, lipids, muscle fibers) and about metabolism. There's a lot of memorization required around exam time, but the problem sets are pretty easy and they help you learn some of the important concepts each week.There's very little chemistry, so you'll probably be disappointed if you're looking for a continuation of orgo.",
    "I would not recommend this course. Despite what anybody else might tell you, the curve in this course is pretty harsh. Everybody studies really hard, and as a result, you could grasp the material really well and still end up with less than a B+ (the average in the class). But if you're required to take this, make sure the rest of your classes are easy.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class, curve is fair (broken down into 20% for each grade subdivision) and material is well presented and truly fascinating. Professor Koelle is a particularly engaging professor that made me feel excited to be majoring in the MB&B major.",
    "You learn a lot about the basic molecules of life and how they interact. Initially, there is a huge emphasis on structure and conformational analysis, but towards the end the focus is mostly on metabolic systems. All in all, it was a terrific class. There was a lot of material, but it was well taught and very worth while.",
    "I would most definitely recommend MB&B 300. I loved the course so much- it was interesting and easy to follow. The material was well presented, and the professors were so committed to the class- both to the material and to the students.",
    "This class is a great introduction to biochemistry. The course covers macromolecular structure, metabolic pathways, and a few examples of broader signaling systems. The work load is more than manageable. Tests are interesting and fair. The professors are excellent. Absolutely take this course.",
    "MBB 300 is an introduction to proteins and enzymes followed by an introduction to metabolism. I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested biology. The course material was all extremely well organized and integrated, the lectures were almost always fascinating, and extremely helpful lecture notes are given at each lecture (which can be the sole source of studying for the exams). The course does not require too much week to week work, though exams are certainly a challenge to prepare for. They expect a solid grasp of details in addition to conceptual ideas for the exams, so pay attention during lecture. Taking this course really allowed me to appreciate the beauty and intricacy of proteins.",
    "I would definitely recommend MBB 300 if you're looking to take biochemistry. It is the best science class I have taken yet at Yale and from what I understand it is much better than the MCDB Biochemistry class.",
    "I liked this course. It was very fair. There's a lot of memorization, but it's reasonable.",
    "Highly recommend. One of the best taught courses I have taken here at Yale. A focus on concepts over memorization is key. Great Profs. Great TAs. Fair tests. All good things. Not easy, but extremely interesting.Less memorization than MCDB and if you take MCDB120 you don't need to take the second semester.Get old tests as all psets and many test questions come off of them.2 exams, a final, 2 easy memorization quizzes (only rote memorization required), and weekly problem sets that aren't bad and really help prepare for the exams.",
    "The material and professors for this course are very interesting - I really recommend taking this course over the other MCDB biochem class. I got a lot out of the course but be warned - it is difficult to get a high grade because of the competency of your classmates!",
    "There is some overlap between Biochemistry and other courses like Cell Biology, but after all these two fields overlap. More importantly, Biochemistry will present concepts from a biochemical approach, so there is not really a repetition of material. I chose this course over the MCDB Biochemistry because I wanted a deeper understanding of the topic.",
    "Sick nasty! Take it, take it take it! It's so interesting if you love both chemistry and biology. If you want a bio course in which you can understand things more rather than purely memorize, this course is great. The exams are also fair.",
    "The best bio class I've had here so far. Forget Cell Biology, forget Genetics, forget Molecular Biology, take THIS class. You will actually learn things. Lots of things.And it's FUN! The homework level is very low (you always have homework but it only takes about an hour each week), the information is interesting and important, the tests are very reasonable.",
    "One of the better science classes I have taken.",
    "This was a crazy class -- it feels like you're in a jeopardy section in this class, everyone is so smart! the avg on one of our two quizzes was 23.25\/25 - and mind you only 20% can get an A in the course. It felt like a typical premed class with 100ish students competing like no other. It felt like these kids just studies everyday of their lives - these are the students with a 3.9999 in MB&B that you see in the pre-med binder at UCS. This class will take over your life as well. And I'm actually a bio major, i took this course thinking that this biochemistry class is better taught and while it is, lets just say the MCDB biochem final had majority of students leaving after 1.5hrs while we MB&B biochem students left after 3.5hrs. CRAZINESS.",
    "Good introduction to biochem, probably one of the best premed classes. Good course overall, lectures were really dense though and exams tended to stress trivial details. Generous curve though.",
    "A survey class of biochemistry.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this class! MB&B 301 has definitely been the best science class I have taken at Yale. The lectures were entertaining and informative, the problem sets were not gratuitously difficult, but were effective in reinforcing important concepts, and the exams were fair. Biederer and Koelle teach the class with a flair of enthusiasm, and the lectures they present are very well-organized and well-paced. This is a great class every science major should take. You'll come away having learned so much, and will gain a greater appreciation of life on a molecular and mechanistic level. Be ready to put in many hours of work for this class, though the pay-off is well worth it!",
    "This is a very well-taught class. The lectures are enjoyable, and both Professors make the connection between Biochemistry and our everyday lives, from beer-making to using Penicillin to fight off infection.",
    "Well, if you're taking this class, you probably have to. So overall, this is a really well taught class-- probably the best taught class I've taken at Yale, which is awesome because usually you don't find people saying that about science at Yale. It's a pretty standard science class-10 psets, 2 midterms, 2 quizzes, and a final. Keep up with lectures and read if you really need to, and expect to devote a lot of time before midterms and the final. You'll really like Thomas and Koelle. Both of them are so nice and really know what they're talking about. They're both kind of funny too. At the end of their lectures, they give a supplement that is basically just fyi and for fun. So if you're trying to choose between the MBB (this one) and the MCDB version, take this one unless you want to memorize the shit out of cycles (molecules, enzymes, you name it). This one is much more conceptual\/analytical and there is less memorizing, though keep in mind there is a fair amount of it. With that in mind, be wary of the curve because everyone in this class knows what the hell is going on.",
    "Biochem is a great class, one thatI would suggest for most students. It's a little intensive, but if you are interested in the material or interested in learning something totally new, this is a good choice. The class is curved into quintiles per third of a grade (give or take), which the professors tell you on the first day, so students are always a little tense. Nonetheless, the course is interesting; this class was by far one of the better taught ones that I have had in five semesters, and Professor Koelle in particular was perhaps the best lecturer I have yet had.A few tips? Study early if you can (it's a lot to digest), go to class (which helps explain unclear material on the slides), and ask questions. ASK QUESTIONS. Section is optional, though.",
    "MBB300 is a good biochem course. Professors Biederer and Koelle are both very knowledgable and explain concepts clearly, though class can get a little boring. You have a textbook but are only tested on material that gets covered in class. Tests aren't terribly difficult, so the class tends to be pretty competitive grade-wise, but it is also graded fairly generously.",
    "Thisis a very difficult class, but the knowledge you leave with is very plentiful. You need to know the material in great detail for assessments, which are quite difficult. Overall, solid course.",
    "The class was the most competitive class I've taken at Yale. I was trying to decide between this and MCDB BIOCHEM....and I shopped both and initially went to the MCDB....but after shopping both..I stayed in this one. I'm not gonna say it was a mistake because I didn't go to other one, but after talking and going through slides from other lectures, things just seemed more organized...and the class seemed better...even though it met really early. That was probably one main reason for my MBB decision.In any regards, if you take this, just be prepared to really work. Go ahead and start reading ahead first week of school. Read and go through lecture before every class. It is very demanding if you want to do well.Good luck...",
    "It's VERY information heavy and MB&B kids make the curve REALLY high so it's hard to do well, but you do learn tons.",
    "If you are taking it for fun, just be aware that this is a big premed class and their focus on grades instead of actual learning can be a drag. Second half of the course was much better than the first half.",
    "I learned so much from this class, I'm almost still in shock. My understanding of the the biochemical pathways of the human body has increased so much and all my lingering questions from AP Biology about the creation of ATP and what NADH and FADH2 are have finally been answered. You need to put in the time to learn it, but super fulfilling once the learning's been done.",
    "Take this if you really want to learn biochemistry. It's the type of class where even if you're doing poorly, the class itself is still really enjoyable. Don't fall behind because it's really competitive.",
    "Anyone considering a career in life science research should be looking to take this course. Anyone considering doing an internship in research should take this course.Makes you look at your hands and think 'wow life's beautiful'",
    "Take it only if you have to. Its a difficult course, the kids in the class are all pre-meds but you learn a great deal of material in depth.",
    "Problem sets are easy. Class moves at a very fast pace. Go over lectures before and after class. More bio, less chemistry. Went over a few mechanisms. Go into a lot of depth regarding regulation, pathways, etc. Focuses on \"how\" instead of just \"what.\"",
    "MB&B Biochem was the best science class I've taken at Yale. It's difficult, a lot of material, and fast-paced, but the professors really did their best to teach the material well, and I think they did a great job of it."
