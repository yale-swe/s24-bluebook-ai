   "comments": [
    "I will definitely recommend this class. It strengthens my mathematical and physical background. The models the class described are also classic and fascinating.",
    "It is a very good course if you are interested in biophysics or neuroscience.",
    "The course introduces a lot of useful topics in biophysics and is fun to learn. I would definitely recommend to another student.",
    "I would recommend this class to another CBB student if their research is directly related to the material in this class. If not, I felt that this class was extremely time consuming and specific and not at all relevant to my research area and I did not find the class to be very useful.",
    "I would recommend this course provided that the student has taken coursework through differential equations and has access to material to support them. If you are not confident in this level of math, the course is probably better off as an audit, or at least understand that the assignments will be a struggle at times.",
    "It's a challenging course but you can learn a lot about computational biophysics. It's better to have some physics background before taking this course.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student - of course with the caveat that you do need a good deal of mathematical understanding to be successful in it. Ultimately, the class served as an excellent example of a \"big picture\" topic in biology - that the same mathematical rules can be applied to very many different systems, and that was a lot of fun to see.",
    "This course really opens up your mind to mathematical modeling in biology. It is really incredible what you can learn. I would definitely recommend it for someone who likes math and potentially wants to get into modeling.",
    "Not recommended as it's not useful to me",
    "This course covers many dynamical systems and methods of modeling them. students will get a broad overview but will not be able to model a full system. I would recommend this class to students with a strong mathematics and programming background. Students need to have taken calculus, physics and biology before taking this course.",
    "I would strongly recommend my classmates to take PHYS 562 01. It's a good introduction to dynamical systems with a relevant mathematical content supported with multiple biological examples.",
    "I would recommend fellow student to take the undergraduate introductory class first if not. Also, this class requires quite a bit of outside the class homework time so I would suggest to plan accordingly."

   "comments": [
    "I'm not a CBB student. I chose this class simply because I'm personally interested in modeling and system biology. I learned a lot from this class, especially ordinary differential equations.",
    "While this is a good course, it does not help with my research. I am not sure why this is a required course.",
    "I learnt detailed models in other physical systems in biology that are not directly related to my research, but complete my knowledge of the field of biological dynamical systems. The properties of the dynamics involved inspired me to compare them with my research to understand them better.",
    "I'll be able to think in ways in which I had never thought before. I can't say I'll use it in my research (yet), but it will definitely impact the way that I think about biology.",
    "I may want to do some modeling at some point and I think this has really helped me see how this is possible.",
    "Almost none",
    "I learned a few things about modeling in this course, but not in enough detail to be able to apply them outside of the course.",
    "The course gave me an introduction to dynamical systems and taught me its relevancy in biology. As to the extent of its contribution to my research, I expect that it will probably be very useful for my future research projects because I developed an interest for dynamical systems in biology."
