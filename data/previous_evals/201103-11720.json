    "Great Class. Really interesting material and Professor Nattrass is great. Would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested.",
    "Fantastic course. Covers conspiracy theories, political motivation, modeling, the dynamics of the disease, prevention versus treatment, and more. I recommend the course.",
    "A very good class for attaining an IN-DEPTH understanding of the AIDS epidemic in South Africa. You are required to critically think about prevention strategies in all of the papers, to which Nattrass provides useful and realistic critique. Readings are varied within different academic fields and often take on opposing arguments, which made the class interesting and more challenging. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning about the AIDS epidemic from an economic or social science perspective.",
    "Great course if you are interested in HIV\/AIDS, especially as it relates to Africa. Don't be deterred by the \"political economy\" title it is given, we discuss many others aspects of AIDS that does not relate to politics.",
    "Yup. I would recommend this for anyone interested in the the current state of Africa in terms of the AIDS epidemic.",
    "Definitely take this class. Professor Nattrass is great, cares a lot about her teaching, runs great discussions, and is really a leader in the field (it seems like everything about HIV\/AIDS that comes out of South Africa has her name on it). For the most part, the material is interesting and touches upon a number of aspects of the HIV\/AIDS pandemic in Africa, although the focus is primarily South Africa.",
    "An incredible class. I highly recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in HIV\/AIDS, Africa, medicine, anthropology, and\/or international development. Each week we approached HIV\/AIDS from an entirely different angle, and by the end of the semester I really felt that I had gained a very detailed understanding not just of HIV\/AIDS specifically but of many of the broader issues-- medical, anthropological, financial-- surrounding disease and medicine in the developing world.",
    "You MUST take this class. This class was easily one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. If you're interested in AIDS in South Africa, especially from a development and\/or political economy standpoint, this class is for you. Professor Nattrass is absolutely amazing. She's approachable, funny, talented, and insightful. She'll treat you as her colleague instead of as her student, and she'll allow your ideas to shape her own. She directs class discussion really well and is clearly invested in the AIDS cause. The class is a ton of reading, and paper grading was fairly harsh at times, but it's definitely worth it. Highly recommended.",
    "YES take it!"
