   "comments": [
    "It was great to complete a full project while learning specific laboratory techniques. Definitely take it.",
    "Of all biology lab courses, I suppose that this is the lesser of many evils.I actually came into the class with a lot of resentment against biology labs in general, but quickly Dr. Nelson's warm and caring manner won me over, and doing a project that had real relevance was great.On the other hand, it was annoying to have to spend a lot of time in lab and have less time to do my independent research project, my activities etc. It really is a big committment, 2x per week 1:30-4. But sometimes you get out early. And sometimes late. So it balances out.And no annoying lab reports or quizzes...just a final paper, 3 psets, sweet deal! And I enjoyed writing the final paper too, because it was very relevant, and I felt like I had accomplished something with my results!",
    "It's probably the most low-key environment of any science lab at Yale. You learn quite a lot, without the stress of possibly failing if you don't get the right data. I'd definitely recommend it if you need to fulfill bio or premed requirements. Most of the experiments are long, but you don't need to be fully engaged in them all the time. Also, it's great because it fosters a very collaborative lab environment; benchmates work together and help each other a lot.",
    "Great class, extension of the first semester. I highly recommend it.",
    "In MCDB 343L, you learn a molecular biology lab technique by working on a research project from a professor's lab; we worked on a sequencing project from Professor Dellaporta's lab. It's better than any lab I've taken at Yale! There are weekly problem sets that do not take too long, and a paper presentation at the end. Though lab meets twice per week, we rarely spent over 3 hours in lab. If you have to take a biology lab, I highly recommend this one.",
    "This class is just like the first one except you are working on a different project and have a final presentation instead of a final paper to do. I would recommend it because you again are doing something non-traditional in lab, and the lab overall is fun. However, there were some organization lapses that could be improved upon.",
    "Lab class that meets twice a week, plus three problem sets and a final presentation.",
    "Yes! Instead of just doing the same old experiments that students have been doing for years, you actually get to work on a real research project, from start to finish. Prof. Nelson is amazing -- he explains everything in-depth, and he is so dedicated to his course and his students. In this section we got to do 454 sequencing, which is really the future of genetics research. Very useful. This half of the semester, however, felt a bit more disorganized than the first half. Still, an easy bio lab credit and you learn a lot."
