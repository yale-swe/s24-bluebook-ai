    "DON'T TAKE IT. The German Language Program is so disorganized that I have been completely turned off from studying the language at Yale. It's a shame because I like the language and it's useful, but the Language Program Director did an awful job of putting it together and updating it and it's not worth the aggravation. Get involved with German at Yale another way. The German grad students and teachers are great though! Also, note that there IS a final in this class, during finals period, which we just found out about.",
    "Essentially a grammatical recap of everything you learned in 120. German 130 will improve your vocabulary and help you speak and understand the language with more ease, but it comes with a lot of tedious review.",
    "If you're ready to give it the effort, a great way to get conversationally comfortable with German. With the right attitude, a real treat.",
    "Yep."
