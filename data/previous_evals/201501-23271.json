    "ENGL 460 is a great course for poets of all styles and varying levels of experience who want to dive deeply and immerse themselves in the poetry world. It's a full experience; between blog posts, workshop, writing, reading and attending events, I spent a lot of time on this course, so I would only suggest it for people who a) have that time and b) care enough to invest so much. The reading list is great and really forces you to consider a new realm of poetry that is often overlooked in mainstream narratives\/criticism. Especially given the changing face of the poetry world, this class is at the cutting edge.",
    "Read and get inspired by some of the best poets out there--primarily black poets-- and write like you've never written before. Let Professor Alexander ask you hard questions, and don't seek easy answers. Get to know the cool minds in your class. Just do it.",
    "A poem a week. Mid term manuscript. Final manuscript.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to another student! You read a book of poetry a week, and write a poem, often on a theme (a poem about place, a poem without punctuation) ever week as well. You'll be workshopped 3 to 4 times, and at the end of the class a volume of your semi-cohesive work. The workload is pretty standard for a Yale poetry workshop, with the added bonus of a bunch of amazing guest poets, and a curriculum that skews towards historically underrepresented writers, mostly women, mostly black. Elizabeth Alexander is great! Very knowledgable, very generous. She's not great about responding to emails and sometimes there was confusion about deadlines or exact assignments, but everything was eventually sorted out."
