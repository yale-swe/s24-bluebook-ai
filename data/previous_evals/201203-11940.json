    "It was a wonderful and easy German L1 class.Yes, because it builds a good foundation for people who want to learn German.",
    "If you do want to study German, then don't worry. Unlike some language departments like our Arabic department, our German department is very strong and supportive.",
    "Yea, if you want to learn german",
    "The course is a basic introduction to German speech and comprehension.The course is fun, pleasant, and provides extremely basic skills. The course does not place as much emphasis on reading skills as one would hope, and the homework offers NO help whatsoever. Much busywork.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a pretty cool language to learn, and the class is fun!"
