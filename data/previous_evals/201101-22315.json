    "A great overview of modern american political communications.",
    "Professor Felzenberg is such an incredible personality. There really are not adequate words to describe this man. If you have a chance to take a class with him, do so. It's so rare to have professors outside of academia; Professor Felzenberg is just awesome.",
    "Take it if you're actually interested in learning a lot more about Congress. Otherwise, you might get a bit bored. I really liked it though.",
    "It was an okay class, but I don't think I'd take it again if I had to do it all over again. Good readings and great guests but class discussion was really painful.",
    "great seminar for people who are both highly knowledgeable about politics and new comers.",
    "The course is wonderful. The professor is an expert in the field, is well-connected and is an excellent communicator. It would be hard to find a better class to take at Yale.",
    "Sure. Professor Felzenberg is a good professor who really cares about his students.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in discussing current events and are interested in learning about what really goes on in Congress. The guest speakers are great and a good people to get to know, especially if you're looking to go into journalism.",
    "Do not take this class. The class is disorganized, boring, and overall a waste of time. The syllabus is never followed, and the papers are arbitrary and only loosely related to the course material.",
    "Yes. Especially if you are interested in the world of communications and the relationship between politics and communications.",
    "Very interesting."
