   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course serves as a fair summary of a lot of the principles discussed over the course of the Chemical Engineering curriculum. Students get to work with membranes, distillation columns, computer modeling software for distillation\/separations, heat transfer experiments and learn some interesting techniques like dynamic light scattering and how to measure zeta potential. The course administration was great - Professor Van Tassel provided great insight to each of the labs and thoroughly commented on each of the reports. Sarah, who helped facilitate the actual experiments, was also incredibly insightful and helpful. The course has a steady and predictable routine. The downsides are that a lot of the experiments are pretty slow and don't really require a group of three (often, I would find that one or two people could actively be working at a time and the third spent the majority of the 3 hour lab time sitting around a lot). There were often technical issues with the labs themselves (not having the right flow-meter or experimental set up) but these issues were usually pretty readily resolved. I also would recommend letting students select their own groups, where this would better accommodate student's working habits. Some labs are certainly more interesting than others, but none of them are annoyingly\/unnecessarily tedious as were some of the intro chemistry labs.",
    "Pros: only meets 1x\/week, relaxed atmosphere, only seniors in the class Cons: not much. pretty reasonable class overall but could get boring at times.",
    "Being able to choose groups would be an improvement as I believe that the people you work with over the semester really flavor your overall experience. Overall though the labs were set up well and spaced evenly and the workload and expectations were reasonable and manageable enough that I did learn things even though some of the lab reports were excessively time consuming or full of busy work. Clearer expectations on that front for some of the reports would be helpful but overall this was a good course. As an aside, I think this should cary a writing credit, 6 lab reports of 15-18 pages each is more writing than I have done for any of my actual writing credits and I know some other labs do cary writing credits."

   "comments": [
    "Only if you need this to graduate for your senior chem. eng. reqs.",
    "This is a required course but not too painful. The experiments are pretty cool and the lab reports are interesting, albeit lengthy.",
    "This is a fun lab and cool course overall, the professor is really chill and very nice, and although the lab reports took up about 2-3 whole days to do, they are only due once every other week",
    "Yes, it was a very interesting course that did a great job tying together everything from the chemE major! Lab reports could take some time but it was also a learning process and so they were easier as time went on."
