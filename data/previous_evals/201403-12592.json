    "Would recommend to a fellow student who is interested in immunology. This course prepares you for upper level immunology courses.",
    "It is a small class that will make you think more about how your body keeps you healthy. It is characterized by lectures and reading articles and books about various diseases or topics relevant to immunology. It is very interesting and enjoyable. The class is a bit long but only meets twice a week. The professor is fantastic.",
    "This is a science course that isn't just about life behind a microscope. You get to look at the people who've worked with viruses, and the people affected by disease and cures."
