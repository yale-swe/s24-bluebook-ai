   "comments": [
    "Apporva's a great professor. The class itself is good, make sure you have a very solid grasp of the stuff from abstract algebra for the greatest benefit though. I highly recommend.",
    "If you're considering the course, then you've taken 350, in which case, you should be able to decide for yourself. It's not excessively difficult, and the prof. is nice, and chances are, if you're considering 370, then you're a math major, in which case you probably need to take it.",
    "The material is good, but I'm not a big fan of Stewart's textbook and the way that the course was organized this semester. We spent half of the semester doing homework problems that were tedious and uninteresting: verifying that such and such satisfies all the conditions of an automorphism, factoring polynomials with integer roots, or, most tedious of all, using the Euclidean Algorithm to find the HCF of two polynomials. Consequently, the second half of the semester ended up with us moving through much more complicated material much more quickly. I think it would have been better to minimize the time spent on the concrete introduction that motivates the course and instead get into the more abstract results much morequickly. Still, Apoorva's a good professor, and I enjoyed his lectures. Office hours were always helpful and he was very interested in making sure that the students understood the material. Take it.",
    "very interesting material. hard work but doable with friends and office hours. good lectuer. fun and available",
    "This class is very interesting and extremely enjoyable. You will learn a lot of really cool results. The class starts out easy and then gets much more challenging, but it is always interesting.",
    "MATH 370 is an extremely intense course in Galois theory. If you got below a B in MATH 350, don't even think about taking it. Prof. Khare is a nice guy; not the best instructor in the world but willing to sit down and explain things to you. The problem sets and tests are very, very hard, and if you're doing badly on them, you need to drop the class - things won't get better.",
    "A careful treatment of the theory of fields and Galois Theory. A little over the first half of the class is spent building up the theory of fields, and the rest introduces the important theorems of Galois Theory, and implications and applications are discussed.An important thing to note that about half of what you will learn will be in the problem sets: Many important concepts, and results pertaining to them, are introduced via the problem sets. This may sound like a pain, and it does make the problem sets rather lengthy and time-consuming, there is no better way to learn the material, and you will grow to appreciate this mode of teaching.Most importantly. Professor Khare is an exceptional professor. His treatment of the subject matter is very careful and rigorous. He is not only an energetic lecturer, but he also effectively engages the students in the class by prompting the class to answer questions, or contribute to the proof of a Theorem.",
    "Math 370 is a lot of fun. You take a few of the concepts from 350 a dive deeper into them. Particularly you focus on fields (including doing a lot on finite fields) and field extensions. The first monthish of the class can be a little mundane as you factor a lot of polynomials and work on building up the tools for the end, but by the end when you get to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory and solvability, it's very cool.",
    "Material was very interesting, professor was great, but the course would have been better perhaps if we spent more time on the later material instead of spending so long on elementary things, eg factorizing polynomials, etc.",
    "Math 370 was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale so far, and also one of the hardest\/most challenging. That said, I am definitely happy I took it and I think I learned a whole lot from this course. If you enjoyed math 350, you should definitely take this course.",
    "This is a really cool way to apply algebra to stuff that you already know about, namely polynomials and geometry. Expect a lot of work.",
    "If you like abstract math, this will be a great course. However beware, a lot of time is spent doing elementary things until you finally get the machinery to do the fun stuff.",
    "This is a introduction to Galois Theory. The beginning covers field and ring theory in more detail then 350, and the latter half moves on to Galois Theory proper and its applications. I thoroughly enjoyed the material; many of the results were really neat,especially in the applications. Highly recommended."
