    "This class will put you out of your comfort zone and expand you as a person. There aren't many classes where you will dance in class and listen to physics lectures seated on the floor of a dance studio. This is a new course and the wrinkles haven't been ironed out yet. The physics and dance portions, when they align, are amazing together, but often it feels forced and like you are taking two separate classes. This class also has a lot of work because both portions of the class assign homework. Since you are assigned so much, it often seems worthless because you don't always discuss what you read\/watch for homework, and not always to much depth.",
    "Good class. I learned a lot about physics without breaking my back. Appropriate class for beginners to physics who want to get a solid foundation in the fundamentals. Also, we dance a lot in class, which is fun! Carefully taught. Be warned it is a very big time commitment! In addition to the class meetings and problem sets, you will need to meet with your choreography group for a couple hours every week outside of class and attend a few required lectures. The kind of class where, while I was in it, I wasn't always thrilled about doing the work. But looking back, I learned a lot about physics and had cool discussions about the history and politics of dance.",
    "PHYS 115 teaches the interdisciplinary aspects of physics and dance. Strengths of this class include a fantastic physics teacher who is able to easily convey the concepts to the students, and a wonderful dance teacher who gracefully puts us through dance motions and explains the humanities \"aspect\" behind it all. Strengths include inviting famous dancers and physicists to talk about their work in class, and dividing time between physics and dance. Weaknesses only include the imbalance towards the end of the school year between physics and dance teaching. I felt that the dance portion became more overpowering, and physics was kind of on the back burner. There were no more readings and less time for practice problems in class, but otherwise I don't have any problems with this class. IT WAS AMAZING! Definitely take this class, no matter whether you're a theater\/arts\/humanities major or a STEM major. This class is for everyone, and everyone should take it at some point in their Yale undergraduate career.",
    "After the online evaluation page decided to exit the page, I decided I would still go back and write out my really long evaluation. After all, this was singlehandedly one of the best courses I have taken during my four years at Yale. As an econ and math major simply interested in modern dance, I was able to take away a greater understanding of modern dance techniques and meaning in addition to a newfound interest in quantum physics. Every class requires you to dance and also come up with a new dance phrase to perform as a group. There is also a physics portion to the class that involves problem sets. As a result, the workload is not light at all - especially since the class requires group meetings every week. That being said, if you have taken AP Physics in high school (and remember it!), you should find the physics quite easy. Even if you have taken physics before like I have, I ended up learning about special relativity and gaining a deeper understanding of what friction is. For me, I came out of this class with 1) an appreciation for interdisciplinary approaches to learning things and 2) a greater confidence and control over your body. Professor Coates and Demers do a great job of fostering a safe space where every idea is worth researching about.",
    "This course will push you to think of application and synthesis of material in new ways. It is a thought provoking course that gets the creative wheels turning. The physics was easy for me, because I had taken algebra based physics in high school and was taking physics here. However it was also easy for other people in the course who hadn't taken much physics. That being said, if you have not seen physics very much or at all before, it would be a lot of new material. However Sarah and Mariel always offered office hours and the book is good at explaining things. The choreographic\/dance aspect may be intimidating to some, but Emily gave us many tools to generate material and taught us how to piece it together and both she and Sarah truly created a safe atmosphere where generating material and sharing was encouraged and appreciated.",
    "This is the most fun you will ever have for a SC or QR credit. You are insane not to do it.",
    "I think this is a great class that will only continue improving if taught again. I would say it is not a gut class and should not be treated as such. The class requires genuine interest and dedication on the part of the student and can be a wonderful way to explore inter-disciplinary conversations about Science and Art and Dance.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want a refreshing class that challenges you and allows you to experiment in a safe space. It will challenge you to think in new ways and do things which are unfamiliar. You get to work in teams with other students and create original dance choreography. You also get to grapple with some ideas in physics and get to meet famous physicists and choreographers who help to show how the two fields can go hand in hand. It's a lot of work and time but well worth it.",
    "This class was a great mix of physics and dance, and also interdisciplinary research learning methods and techniques. There was a wide range of students, from those with a dance background to those who have never dance before. There were weekly psets, reading responses, 2 midterms, a final, movement studies, and we even created our own choreographic piece as a group!",
    "Yes, definitely take this class! It's a transformative experience for physics\/non-physics dancers\/non-dancers alike, and it really integrates both topics together nicely. Also the professors are great to work with, and each class is a joy to go too (:",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone and everyone. Our class was full of students of all backgrounds with varying experience levels in both physics and dance. I have never experienced such a deep interdisciplinary learning experience as I did in this class, and the experience was incredible. The level of engagement with the material, instructors, and other students was unparalleled by any other class I have taken at Yale, and likely will remain so.",
    "This is an extraordinary course. The professors are amazing, highly dedicated professionals at the top of their respective fields. If you are the least bit interested in art, science, and the intersections between art and science, take this class! And you will get to dance! You will get to move! This course offers a learning environment otherwise lacking at Yale.",
    "Take this class! Sarah and Emily are an unparalleled team, you will have your brain and your body stretched and you will never leave a class without having laughed. It's a lot of work outside of class, but that should not be a deterrent. Interdisciplinary classes like this are the definition of the liberal arts education and yet so few are offered...take advantage of this, it will fundamentally change the way you approach knowledge, via 'science' and 'art,' as discretely formed."
