   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the topic material, you will not regret this course. It is challenging, thought-provoking, and applicable to a wide range of discussions outside of simply the question of IP in living organisms. The interdisciplinary approach also brought a range of perspectives into a seminar where everyone is interested and eager to contribute to discussion.",
    "A good class if you're interested in genetic engineering and an amazing class if you're into breeding. The course dealt significantly with pre-genetic engineering. While a background is certainly necessary for understanding the later material, I wonder if Professor Kevles might have focused on his area of expertise (breeding, etc.) at the expense of student interests. The seminar did have great student participation nonetheless and the workload was very reasonable. It was also nice to hear from students from so many disciplines as the course was cross listed across departments and schools.",
    "I would recommend the course. I think it started out pretty slow--I didn't find the early material (animal and plant breeding) to be particularly stimulating--but the course picked up momentum with the modern biological issues and overall provided a strong understanding of the trajectory of biomedical innovation over the last couple ofcenturies. The legal element is typically secondary to the historical element, but intellectual property is a fascinating lens through which to understand the history of biotechnology. I liked the mix of grad students, law students, and undergrads--everyone seemed to contribute substantively to the discussion, with a wide variety of approaches. In the last few weeks, everyone was highly engaged and even passionate about the topics of discussion."
