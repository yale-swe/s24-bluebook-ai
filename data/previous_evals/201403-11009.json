    "A class on movement (and materiality) in medieval art. I would recommend it highly. Informative and timely.",
    "Questions of movement in material art. Definitely recommend.",
    "Mostly this echoes my response to #1.",
    "This class looks at objects, in all sorts of mediums, in their proper context and considers the ways in which various types of movement (whether of the viewer or the object itself) might influence the affect or meaning of the object. I would definitely recommend this course and Dr. Jung to other students."

   "comments": [
    "It opened up a possible research topic for my dissertation. Don't know what will come of that. But it definitely deepened my knowledge of art history. Really useful overall, and really fun.",
    "Although this course was not exactly in my field of study, I've been interested in issues of movement & materiality for some time. This course allowed me to explore them with a new level of complexity & nuance. I'll definitely be able to translate the skills I learned in this seminar to my own work. It was a very rewarding and productive semester, and I feel like it pushed me beyond what I thought I could achieve. In other words, I'm proud of the work not only I accomplished in this seminar but also of the work we did as a course, each student learning from one another throughout the term. Thanks, Jackie!",
    "It gave me some very intriguing things to think about that may well shape my dissertation in some fashion."
