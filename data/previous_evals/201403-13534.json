   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course for anyone interested in studying Chinese in a serious way.",
    "Learning classical Chinese is almost like learning another language, so it can be tough but it's also super rewarding being able to read actual primary texts about \"Confucius said...\" and whatnot. Class can be a little boring sometimes--partially because there's just a lot more students than I feel this class and Lin-laoshi's teaching style can support--but it's worthwhile, I think, to spend several minutes to a couple hours every week translating and memorizing texts.",
    "Probably not. Not unless you REALLY are committed to learning classical Chinese while in college (like if you want to read ancient texts for a thesis or something). I took it because I was curious, and it felt like a wasted semester. I didn't learn that much, and would've been much better served taking business Chinese or something like that.",
    "Definitely take this class for an interesting and relatively chill elective, but don't expect it to significantly improve your Chinese--the class is taught in English.",
    "Take it if you want\/need to learn literary Chinese. Very painless, since it's conducted in English and we had several Japanologists in the class. If you make an effort to do so, it can improve your modern Chinese. Learning traditional characters in short (a few sentences or a paragraph) translations for each class is also helpful. Pauline Lin is very sweet and kind, she made time to go over very minute details if you seek her out. I've heard her class is significantly easier than Mick Hunter's class.",
    "Take it! CHNS 170 is a good introduction to classical Chinese literature. It's refreshingly different from the language-based Chinese classes, as it focuses more on translation work than on character memorization, etc. By the end of the course, you'll be reading some really interesting stories (the first part of the class focuses more on building up your understanding of classical Chinese grammar, so the readings are much shorter and are excerpts instead of completed stories). I've always heard good reviews for the professors who teach CHNS 170 -- Prof. Lin was great; she's really excited about the material and is very approachable \/ supportive throughout the entire course."
