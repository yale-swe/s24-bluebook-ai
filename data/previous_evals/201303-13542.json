    "The weeks spent on python were terrific. The weeks spend on Google and impromptu project presentationswere a bit of a waste and could have been better devoted to QGis. Pushing the Javascript to the rather poor Google Earth workshop meant we essentially learned no Javascript.",

    "I am not so much into advanced geospatial concepts, but the programming experience was incredibly valuable and is something that I think the school would do well to encourage more of. Data analysis is a huge part of science. The world is already swamped with medium-huge data and we need people who can deal with it effectively and make it available to the world.",
    "The pace of the course was slow for those with programming experience. Ideas like Object-oriented programming, data storage, etc. though advanced topics, could have been reached if pacing was faster, allowing us to an expanded toolset rather than relying on the built-in libraries or, worse, complicated work arounds."

    "the fact that it exists. The opportunity to learn coding -- new to FES, and very valuable, especially the application to GIS. So just having a formal introduction and support for our learning of python was awesome.",
    "The freedom to choose your own adventure.",
    "Dana: his lectures, his obvious love for teaching and his responsiveness to students online and emailed questions. Seriously Dana monitors the course website like my mother watches her online scrabble game.",
    "The assignments, the very clear and engaging lectures and the spirit the prof cultivated in the class.",
    "The best two aspects of the course were the work (the only way to get good at programming is practice, failure, and iteration), and the professor's conceptual explanations coupled with his own personal stories. The stories were key motivators when it came down to sitting at a computer and trying to write something.",
    "Python experience. The experience and personal component that our instructor brought to the class.",
    "The Teacher is mature and grants much freedom to the students to explore the course material at their own pace. Digital tools are well integrated.",
    "It is a very special opportunity for FES-ers to delve into the world of programming. I think environmental informatics is a fascinating - and very employable - career field. It is great that students were able to choose their own final projects and apply the GIS programming schools to applications that interest them or dovetail with their own research\/coursework."

   "comments": [
    "Dana knows this, but the course in some ways was a little rough, because it was the first time he has taught it. I think the final project could be tweaked. I wish it didn't feel so big. I don't really feel equipped to handle mine, and I wish it were less ambitious. Like most people, I chose to do project related to my work at Yale. But for a \"real\" project, you need good data. And that in and of itself can be very hard to find, and a big part of any project. So I wish that the final project was on python coding only - like, not about any larger problem except getting better at python itself, and building your skills in the code.I know it's my own fault for picking a topical project as opposed to a more code-centric project, but more guidance from Dana would have helped. Or maybe structuring the project as two smaller projects. I think in some ways it was taken for granted how little we know about Python, and how valuable it would be to get better at coding - as opposed to learning a little more about our on-going research - from the final project.",
    "Javascript and Google Earth.",
    "I would have benefited from more homework assignments. I think the final project is a good idea but because of the nature of the material it takes a very long time to produce something on that scale I thought that some more smaller homework would have been as useful to my learning. Also I think the final project could be improved if we actually found clients.I would have liked more q-gis, from what you showed us I think that it could be a very useful thing to know and it would be awesome to be able to run code without having make a tool in arcgis. I felt like a lot on my problems came from the arc gui rather than the python code.",
    "The content for lectures in the last 3rd.",
    "This course was great because it was ambitious in trying to both introduce programming while at the same time applying those skills to a very specific type of software. I feel that more of a crash course early on would have been useful to everyone - my suggestion would be mandatory completion of the tutorials on a site such as Codecademy. This would have reduced hurdles from not being familiar enough with programming that might have plagued people all the way up until the final project. With a greater familiarity with python early on, then homework time would be either reduced or spent more on tinkering with geospatial processing, rather than focusing on bugs arising from unfamiliarity with the language.",
    "More examples of pythons capabilities. More guided examples. I felt like I was struggling alone without a whole lot of direction or resources at certain points in time. But I would imagine that hand-holding in a programming class would be impossible\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?",
    "Pacing of the course, and greater nimbleness with programming could help the course. Course stayed in a 'scripting' mindset. Though more intense and perhaps off-track from the core focus of the class, greater discussion of programming could have given the students additional tools. Limitations of data management, etc. hurt later in the semester projects.",
    "Being the first year Geospatial Software Design was offered, I think this was a very good first pass at this course. Given the rate of change in the GIS field, this course will have to be updated often, probably every year. In the class, Dana often told us about ways he is thinking of changing the class in the next few years, which was helpful to give us a sense of how fast the technologies are changing (i.e. Google Earth Engine, Q GIS, etc). I personally would like to see more emphasis on open source software over ESRI products."

I plan to use programing for my research, but more importantly for my practical work after I graduate. I now feel like I have the ability to teach myself more of Python and other languages.",
    "This course was a crash course in both geospatial software (ArcGIS) and programming. I intend to use both much more often in figuring out new, commercially viable agroforestry models as part of a start up I came to school to work on.",
    "Fits well for me. I am interested in data handling skills and the communicative potential of GIS and mapping in general",
    "An arcGis\/geographic data course should be taught in the architecture school. The introduction course may be more appropriate, but it conflicts with studio. This class greatly increased my comfort with GIS data, which hopefully enhance my analysis abilities in studio. Further, concepts of raster\/shape processing is generic enough to be applied to any number of architectural techniques. Though this may not have been reflected in the coursework, it is highly related to my studies."
