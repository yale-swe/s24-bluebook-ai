   "comments": [
    "This class is for people who aren't looking to delve into anything too deep or philosophical in Spanish (take a lit class for that), but want to practice their speaking skills in a safe environment where they can learn about a variety of subjects and gain confidence in speaking.",
    "Yes I could not recommend it more strongly especially to those wishing to solidify their command of spoken and written Spanish before preceding to more advanced courses.",
    "Advanced Conversational Spanish is a great way of improving your proficiency with the Spanish language. From my standpoint, I came into the course with 4 terms of Spanish under my belt, as well as a summer's stay in a foreign country. I can honestly say that I felt somewhat fluent at semester's end, whereas at semester's beginning, I only felt mildly proficient. Not only will you improve -- the material here is engaging, interesting, and in Pilar's section, conducive to intellectually vibrant discussions. I definitely recommend this class as a capstone to one's Spanish language study at Yale.",
    "The name of the class is \"Advanced Conversational Spanish,\" but my biggest critic is that there really wasn't much \"normal, everyday\" conversation. Many times, I felt like I was memorizing vocabulary that I wouldn't normally use in everyday life. Second of all, despite the name, one could easily go through the entire class without speaking. If you won't push yourself to practice and speak, it's possible to just sit back and listen. If you're like me, and you want to take a class to practice actual, everyday conversational Spanish, then I wouldn't take it. Otherwise, it's a class with a light workload that has potential for good discussions, depending on the type of students in your particular section.",
    "I would tell another student to take this class if he or she were uncomfortable with speaking Spanish as a foreign language; this was my reason for taking the class, and I am much more comfortable with the language now.",
    "Spanish 150 provides practice in Spanish conversation centered around interesting articles and texts. I would recommend it for someone trying to solidify their Spanish speaking ability who already has a good grasp of the fundamentals. It would perhaps be slightly elementary for someone fluent\/almost fluent, and too challenging for someone without a strong foundation in the basics."
