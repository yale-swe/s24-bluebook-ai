   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend DS Philosophy to anyone who is curious about philosophy at all. The course exposes you to so many different ways of thinking and lets you realize whether you want to do something more in depth later. Professor Harte is great, but you should know she tends to dominate class discussions.",
    "DS Philosophy is a beautiful experience. This is where I learned to appreciate arguments. It's also where I learned to make effective arguments. Take it with Verity Harte, if you can.",
    "I would summarize DS Philosophy as an overview of philosophical thought from Plato and Aristotle through Augustine and Aquinas. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I found it very helpful as an introduction to philosophy. The DS structure of having a lecture, plus two section meetings really facilitated our understanding of the selected texts on a syllabus. Overall, the course was both very extensive and very detailed and taught me so much.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone looking to get a basic knowledge of a large number of early Western philosophers, and anyone wanting to learn how to approach philosophy and philosophical writing in general. I would not recommend this class to anyone looking to spend a large amount of time on any one philosopher.",
    "DS philosophy is a survey of Western and Abrahamic philosophy from Socrates to Aquinas, with an emphasis on Socrates\/Plato and Aristotle. Philosophy provides a great framework and starting point for deep thought about nature and the supernatural, as well as about humans and their purpose. Additionally, I feel that my logic and argumentation skills were enhanced by this course, and so I would recommend it to anyone.",
    "An intensive survey of ancient philosophy. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, definitely! It provides a great understanding of the western tradition which all humanities students should have. Do not take this class if you want exposure to Eastern texts or the works of minorities. The course truly is what it says on the can. This course can provide unparalleled advancement through engagement with the texts, with its combination of both breath and depth.",
    "Philosophy is definitely the most difficult of the three tracks. It often took me multiple readings before vaguely grasping the theme of the work, and even then, I went to seminar not having understood a single word of the Metaphysics. Yet considering that most DSers have never taken a philosophy course before, DS Philosophy is a good introduction to college-level philosophy, providing an excellent overview of the ancient philosophers. Even if you don't want to major in philosophy, the course teaches you how to think logically and write precisely--major assets for any field you're interested in.",
    "Verite Harte is one of the smartest philosophy professors you'll ever meet, and she spends a lot of time in section explaining concepts but won't necessarily focus on the most important ones for she likes to focus on analyzing one or two sentences from the reading. I also wish that she had more office hours available for students, especially during paper weeks."
