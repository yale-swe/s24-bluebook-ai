    "Was given a broader look at the cancer field and good practice reading papers outside of my research area",
    "I improved my knowledge of cancer biology, critical thinking and reasoning skills, and my reading skills through this course. I also developed my skills in giving presentations and thoughtfully discussing recent literature in fields diverse from my own.",
    "Gained an appreciation for the complexity of research studies in cancer biology and in depth knowledge of several key areas of cancer immunology, epigenetics, and targeted cancer therapies.",
    "Through this course, I was exposed to a range of current topics in cancer biology. After having completed the course, I feel that I have gained a deeper understanding of the current challenges and techniques being used to fight cancer progression and resistance.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I believe that the strength of the course comes from its wide breadth of topics that are covered. It does its best to introduce new topics and papers that represent those topics to the students. It allows us as the students to see how each aspect of cancer therapeutics and cancer biology is elucidated and determined. I also feel that the weakness of the course primarily arises from its timing as well as requirements. I feel that the course itself was poorly timed in that many of the students were qualifying throughout the course and were thus unable to participate or think as deeply about the topics as they might have in other semesters. Also, I feel that for students who do not have as strong of a cancer biology background that very much advocating or hard-requiring that they take the cancer biology course is necessary. It appeared that those students who did not take the course felt that they were \"left behind\" so to speak in terms of their gaps in knowledge.",
    "I enjoyed the topics we learned and reading the different papers I also liked it better when we had more time for discussion so we could hear from the different perspectives of the students in the class",
    "Although this was the first time the course was run, I thought it went quite smoothly. I enjoyed the organization in the second half of the course that left more time for discussion at the end of the presentations. I think the best discussions occurred when students and the faculty leading the course were engaged. For students to participate and contribute to discussions to the best of their ability, I think students should take this course in the second half of their second year or later. The course could be improved by providing more clear directions about how presentations should be organized and what they should contain, as well as what constitutes a successful discussion session. I would have also enjoyed including in a more concrete way some kind of clinical application of the work presented in each paper, how the findings from the paper might change or impact patient treatment. Another suggestion is to include 30-60 minutes in the last class as a \"wrap-up\" session to synthesize all that we learned in the course, to address the field of cancer biology in general and identify important questions to be answered or the ways that cancer treatment might change as a result of recent findings discussed throughout the class.",
    "Strengths were the level of engagement with the material facilitated by the instructors and student presenters.",
    "The course could be improved by helping the students to better foster discussion, perhaps through group exercises or by providing a general list of critical discussion questions at the beginning of the course that could be used by the students when analyzing each paper. A strength of the course lies in the organization, which allows the students to develop a more advanced understanding of three different approaches to cancer therapy (e.g. immunotherapy, targeted therapy, epigentic therapy).",
    "strengths: -great topics! -i think we really grew and had some great discussions in the middle\/end of the class the course could be improved by really ensuring that everyone contributes to discussions. a way to help this is by having discussion questions built into the paper presentations"

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "For students interested in cancer biology, I would definitely recommend this course. By taking an in-depth look at three topics in cancer biology that are not necessarily directly related to my own research, I feel that I have broadened my understanding of the current thinkings in the field of cancer biology. Although the workload is rigorous, I felt that my efforts were worth my while.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in an in depth study of cancer biology,",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to students seeking to gain a deeper understanding of clinically relevant literature in cancer biology.",
    "yes! it is an excellent class to gain a deeper understanding of important topics in cancer biology"
