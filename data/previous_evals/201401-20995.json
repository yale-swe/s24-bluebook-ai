    "yes, great course",
    "Decent work load, homework every day. If you don't take it with a right professor it will certainly get very tedious.",
    "I only take it to fulfill the requirement. I would not recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student--I feel like I have learned so much and I am excited to practice my new skills with native speakers.",
    "If you would like to learn spanish this is a great way to do it! It is work everyday, but worth it to get a basis.",
    "This class is obviously a class that depends highly on your professor. I had Lourdes and she is absolutely amazing. My only advice for taking this class is to sincerely try to improve your Spanish. If you walk into the class with the mindset that this is stupid and you're just doing it for the requirements, you're not going to enjoy it regardless of how good your professor is, but if you really try to learn the language for the sake of learning it, this class is godly amazing. Take opportunities to speak up in class, volunteer, and go to office hours every now and then. I soon found myself thinking in Spanish after I left class, and there a couple times I accidentally started speaking in Spanish to my friends after class because my brain was still in Spanish mode. Very much recommend this class."
