    "This class constantly made me feel dumb as rocks, so take everything I say with a grain of salt. I had a pretty hard time with this course. The first half of the semester is spent reading a bunch of classic papers in database system design, then you take a brutally hard midterm, and then the second half of the course is spent reading some newer papers, some of which were written by Prof. Abadi. Although there are 2 smallish (but still expect to spend a lot of time in the zoo on them) programming assignments in the first half of the course, and the final project will involve a lot of programming, the vast majority of the workload for this class is spent reading and understanding these papers, making this course a rather unusual CS elective. I can't say I really learned a lot, but that's probably because I'm dumb as rocks. Everyone else seemed to love it.",
    "Best computer science class I've taken to date. Class discussion (and there is discussion...wow!) is intelligent and fast-paced. One of the few classes where everyone cares about the material and wants to contribute in a meaningful way. The class structure is awesome, the lectures are engaging and Abadi is smart, cool and understanding of how undergrads learn best. Phenomenal.",
    "much learning to be done.",
    "DB was one of the hardest classes I have taken at Yale. However, I got to learn tonnes from it. You have to put in a lot of work for the class including a couple of coding problem sets, half-page paper reaction for each class in the second half of the semester and a final project. There is also a midterm that was insanely hard. It's definitely one of the hardest CS electives. The material is really enjoyable though if you are really passionate about database architecture and implementation. The papers assigned for the class cover topics about cutting edge technologies developed at Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Yahoo!.Abadi is a great lecturer, encourages class participation and is also extremely helpful and friendly both in and outside of class.",
    "100% recommend. Definitely take this class!",
    "Without doubt. Its a lot of work (allocate ~60 hrs for the final project), but I came out feeling like I really understand how DBMS's work. Very important field moving forward.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Database Systems. Many computer science majors regard it as their favorite computer science class at Yale. 437 is also not a prereq",
    "Yes, it is the best CS elective I've taken.",
    "I think this is the best CS class I've taken here. It teaches you a way of thinking. Highly recommended.",
    "Great Course. Take it if you are affiliated in any serious way to CS.",
    "Daniel Abadi is a phenomenal lecturer, and the first half of this course is excellent. Unfortunately, he rarely teaches after spring break, letting guest lecturers and students lead class instead. The problem sets and final project are pair\/group-based so you might want to avoid this class if you don't want to be working around other people's schedules all semester. Otherwise it's a challenging but rewarding course.",
    "Hard, but so great. Databases are so important to know about, and Abadi is not only one of the foremost in the field but also a good professor. Excellent, albeit unusual, class structure.",
    "Awesome class. For the first half of the semester, it's basically a survey lecture on traditional database systems. The second half of the semester it becomes basically a seminar discussing new developments shaping database technology today. This structure is pretty unique in the CS department and a welcome change. Also, Professor Abadi is incredible. It's rare to find a professor so knowledgable about his field of study and yet so open to be challenged and debated by undergrads just learning about this stuff for the first time. He really makes it fun.",
    "This is a great class that you should definitely take. There are two deceptively hard programming assignments and a final project (make sure you start on that early). But it's worth taking just for Professor Abadi and the content. Also, if you have any interest in commercialization of academic papers, definitely take this class.",
    "Best CS elective I've taken so far. Professor Abadi is an exacting, inspiring teacher. The course is rigorous, but free of busywork. TAKE IT.",
    "By far the best class I've taken at Yale. Abadi is great, and the format of the class keeps things interesting. The final project will take a lot of time but is incredibly rewarding. Must take.",
    "If you have the time and are interested in the material, go for it. Prof. Abadi is great, but the class is no cake walk.",
    "This is a great CS course that walks you through not just databases, but the design tradeoffs and why they were made. Professor Abadi's a great lecturer, and the final project is probably the closest thing to academic CS research I've done (without doing research over a summer), and might lead to a publishable paper! Take it if you're even remotely interested in systems or academic computer science. You won't go wrong.",
    "Probably the best computer science elective I've taken so far at Yale (out of Wireless with Yang, Robotics with Scas, Music with Hudak, and this). The Powerpoint slides are put online, but it helps to be in class quite a bit. The semester is split into two halves. ________________________________________________________________________ The first half involves lecturing on the basics of how databases are built. Major topics include storage layout, breakdown of components, join algorithms, locks and concurrency, and checkpointing and recovery. The second half of the class involves reading papers and then just writing short responses about them. ________________________________________________________________________ Abadi is an extremely clear lecturer (at least to me, who's had some background using databases). The lectures involve non-text Powerpoints that are great for enhancing understanding (with diagrams). He also has pretty good industry and research knowledge, and has his own startup Hadapt. As such, he sometimes injects his opinions about databases as a business and field of study, saying \"oh, I don't think this is very good\" or stuff like that in a way that I find somewhat amusing. ________________________________________________________________________ The class's work consists of two quite open-ended problem sets where you simply go and modify a database system (the first for caching, the second for locking). The problem sets are open-ended, not prescriptive, somewhat long, and a fairly good understanding of how to use C\/C++ without shooting yourself in the foot is quite useful. Then, there's a midterm (not too hard) on the concepts covered. After the midterm, there's a reading response of 1\/2 page or so single spaced each week on some papers we read, pointing out flaws and notable concerns. Finally, there's the final project, which is very open-ended and can be very little or a ton of work. ________________________________________________________________________ Take this class! There is a reason this has been the highest-rated QR at Yale in its past iterations. (see the YalePlus Bluebook). I really liked the structure, lecturer, and content of the class. I highly recommend this class if you're a CS major. Personally, I think the content in this class is among the most useful for industry work as well. You must have some decently strong C skills (get memory management down) to take this class. If you're a non-CS major with strong skills, this could be one of the most rewarding ways to get an insight into the CS major.",
    "Best CS elective I've taken by far. Abadi is great and I learned so much. It's especially applicable to future job knowledge which is useful. Final projects are legit and fun.",
    "Definitely take this class! It's not a terrible amount of work (the programming assignments are long, but the reading responses in the second half of the course are really not that bad), but you'll learn a lot about relevant technologies. Abadi is awesome."
