   "comments": [
    "A very in depth look at the foundations of German\/International art cinema. An excellent continuation of critical studies on film. Allows the student to continue their own investigation in this area, which I will definitely pursue.",
    "This course offers an in-depth look at a few films from Herzog, Fassbinder and Haneke, although it should not necessarily be regarded as a survey on German cinema. If you're interested in learning more about these directors and their works, then take it; otherwise you might find yourself seeking a more broad area of focus.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "This course provides a great exposure to the Germany's great, late-century auteurs. Having taken many of Peucker's classes before, I can say that this is the subject about which she is most excited. The discussions in class are therefore thorough and challenging. This is a very hard (conceptually), but rewarding course.",
    "Interested in German cinema? Well, in three of the figures of German cinema? Here's your class. Be prepared to be bored by Haneke and, to a lesser extent, Fassbinder. Not sure if this is the most fun way to get one of those national cinema course requirements, if you're a film studies major.",
    "An excellent introduction to Haneke, Herzog and Fassbinder."
