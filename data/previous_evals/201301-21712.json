    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in astrophysics. The class is so interesting and I learned a lot.",
    "A masterpiece of a course! I took this as a non-major. Problem sets are fun and easy; collaboration is allowed. In-class exams are like the problem sets, and are open-book. Topics like general relativity and cosmology are introduced in a friendly and elementary way, and you'll still manage to come out with something useful. To do well, you don't need to have taken any physics, but do make sure you have an intuitive grasp of calculus- the exams, in particular, will involve lots of differential-shunting. But most of all, astrophysics is a very soul-soothing topic to learn. Sort of like watching Cosmos.",
    "You should take this course! The material is fascinating.",
    "This was an incredibly interesting course, and I highly recommend it to anyone considering a physics or astronomy major. Professor Padmanabhan is the most dedicated and accessible professor I've had at Yale, and he cares a lot about his students. He's always willing to schedule extra office hours, look over your work before you turn it in, and answer late-night emails with helpful advice. I can't say enough good things about him.Also, this class is one of the few higher level physics classes that you can take without having taken an intro physics sequence - provided that you're willing to put in a little extra work. It works well for people who decide they want to do physics sometime after their freshman fall.With that in mind, I think this class could be even better if it had a textbook or course packet that went with it. It's really easy to fall behind the way it's set up now, and the class gets quite a bit harder towards the end.",
    "The course was split into three topics: exoplanets, GR\/black holes, and cosmology. Unfortunately the class therefore doesn't spend a lot of time on any of these topics. For exoplanets we worked almost exclusively on methods of finding them, which is mostly geometry. GR\/black holes was the most interesting part, but ultimately GR and cosmology was mostly playing around with equations we were given to study their behavior for different values. A good physics elective for the major. You learn a fair bit but nothing too in depth. Not too much work, I think we had 6 psets, 3 midterms, a 15min group presentation and a ~5 page paper on your presentation.",
    "Amazing class. Prof. Padmanabhan is great, the workload's very reasonable (problem sets ~once every two weeks, 3 non-cumulative tests, a 10-min presentation, and a 5-page paper on the same topic as the presentation), and the material is really interesting\/relevant to active areas of research in astronomy.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. You'll learn a lot and the professor is great. Take it!",
    "Great elective to take if you're a physics major or are interested in astronomy. It's math heavy at some points, especially on the midterms, but the group presentations and individual papers got me interested in the topic and I plan to continue learning.",
    "Yes, absolutely if you want to learn more about the topic!",
    "If you are a physics major or are interested in a survey of exoplanets, black holes and GR, and cosmology, then this is a class for you. Beware that, though the material covered is interesting, breadth and not depth is the focus of the class. If you are looking for rigorous coverage of any of these subjects, then look elsewhere.",
    "Great course to gain a qualitative understanding of astrophysics. The technical aspect is still solid, though we can only derive so many equations and have to take some for granted - you will of course understand why they qualitatively make sense.The course makes an excellent job at teaching about reading and interpreting data; and contemporary theories in modern cosmology and their reception amongst the scientific community. The course also requires you to make an oral presentation on a topic of your choice, and write an in-depth scientific article about it, two very useful skills to work on.",
    "A great class for those interested in cool astrophysics topics. The material is relatively straight-forward, and most of it is fun to learn. Professor Padmanabhan is excellent and extremely helpful. I highly recommend this class to all physics lovers, especially those who like astronomy topics or don't even know what specific type of physics they like. The math is very doable (nothing more than simple integrals), so the material never gets too challenging. Definitely one of my favorite classes taken at Yale.",
    "This class is great. You will learn so many cool things about the universe you live in by taking this class. Consider taking this class even if you don't have a physics background. If you know basic mechanics and are good at math, you can still do well in this class.",
    "This class was a great introduction to astrophysics and cosmology. Not a lot of work for a physics class, but you learn so much.",
    "Amazing class! It isn't too hard, and it's very interesting. If you want to learn more about the current frontiers of astronomy, definitely take it (the math\/science prereqs aren't restrictive, either).",
    "I recommend this course to anyone interested in Astrophysics and Cosmology. It is a great intro course which is not too much work but provides a great foundation for many subjects in these fields. The work is very interesting and gets students thinking about areas of science they may not have considered before. In addition, Professor Padmanabhan is one of the best teachers I have had at Yale. If you have an opportunity to take a class with him, I fully recommend it.",
    "Definitely take it, even if you're not a physics major. As a physics major, I thought this would be a boring, shallow survey course, but quite the opposite. It gives you a quite-in-depth view of exoplanets, black-holes\/GR and cosmology in one semester. The lectures were all very interesting (especially the cosmology section where Prof. Padmanabhan is currently doing research), and the coursework was not very hard. There were 6 easy problem sets (3-4 hours max), one test at the end of each section (somewhat harder than the psets, but the curve is generous) and one 10 minute group presentation which you write into a final paper at the end of the semester.",
    "One of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale. The class is divided into three sections - exoplanets, black holes, and cosmology. Each consists of 2 psets and an exam (no final). In addition, you have to do a presentation in one of those areas (plus a 5 page summary of the presentation). Professor Padmanabhan was an excellent instructor, very knowledgeable and willing to help. I would recommend this class to those who are interested in astrophysics but have not taken an astrophysics class before. Make sure you have the appropriate math background (the class gets pretty equation heavy during general relativity), though I will say this class wasn't terribly difficult. TAKE IT! (I'm an appliedmath major)",
    "Interesting and fairly easy physics class.",
    "My only regret with PHYS 343 is taking it in my junior year. If I had taken it as a freshman\/sophomore, I would have been much more motivated to pursue physics\/astrophysics as a major. Dr. Padmanabhan is a great lecturer: kindhearted and always accessible for his students. The course is split into three units, which both cover a vast swath of astrophysics and emphasize a variety of skills (exoplanets -> data analysis; black holes -> theory; cosmology -> a medley of both). If you have a basic understanding of mechanics (high school level) and a solid grasp of single variable calculus, I highly recommend this course. By the end of the semester, you are literally playing God, solving the equations of the universe. Be warned that grading is strict and this class is by no means an easy A. But that shouldn't stop you from having a very enriching experience.",
    "Phenomenal class -- my favorite in the physics department by far. Professor Padmanabhan clearly cares a lot about his students and that makes the class so much more enjoyable. The material is very interesting and Professor Padmanabhan's clear enthusiasm for the subject makes it that much more fun to learn from him."
