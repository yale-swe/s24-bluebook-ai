   "comments": [
    "It's a decent introduction to calculus and the pace is not bad at all.",
    "It is basically a review of many of the things taught in AP Calculus, but assessed in a much more difficult manner. I would not recommend taking it if you don\u0092t have to.",
    "It's a year's worth of high school calculus condensed into one semester. The course isn't hard, but watch out for the midterms and final. It ended up killing so many.",
    "Take this class only if you have taken calculus before. Sure, the description of the class says that no previous experience with calculus or computing is required, but the class is full of people who have already done calculus before, and who are in to get their QR requirements out of the way with an easy \"A\". You don't want to compete with them if you're new at calculus. You'll end up teaching yourself out of the textbook, because while the lectures are pretty good at explaining the general concepts, the midterms and final attempted to go beyond the standard problems, and thus were always MUCH MORE DIFFICULT than what we had actually been taught. If you think you can handle that, take this course.",
    "This is supposed to be a basic course with solid material. However, the exams were ridiculously difficult, and it seemed the professors had extended the material to create exam questions that simply were disproportional to the level of the class!",
    "Take it if you have to. If not stay away.",
    "Don't take Math 112. I don't care how bad you are at math; I can't do exponents or fractions and I know that I would have been much happier just struggling through one semester of Math 115 and getting it over with. I took Math 112 because I'm a pre-med. Previously, I'd taken IB SL math. I thought Math 112 would prepare me for Math 115, since I've never taken any APs.Was I wrong? Yes. Math 112's exams are impossible, because they don't cover the material you learned in class, so no matter how much you study, you will not do well on them. Although the TAs are sympathetic and try really hard to help you, especially on homework, the course head insists on making the exams too difficult for the class. My TA, Igor Rapinchuk, was fabulous and if you somehow wind up taking this class I highly recommend him. Oh, speaking of homework, you'll be using Mathematica, the most frustrating computer program on the planet. I highly recommend seeking out the tutor.",
    "I would summarize it as an in-depth application of the fundamentals of calculus. I would recommend the class to a student who wishes to pursue mathematics of science."
