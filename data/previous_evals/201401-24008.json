    "I was very pleased with the overall content and readings for the course, although I think changing the syllabus midway caused more help than hurt. I think having the class once per week for longer would be better for maximizing discussion and workshops.",
    "The class is very interesting, but might need some tweaks on planning, to be of best use to students. Syllabus was changed 4 times over the semester, and the final version differ significantly from the original one, which proves that the class is in a constant redesign.",
    "The material covered in this course is fascinating and important, especially for students interested inthe intersection of urban design and ecological systems. Prof. Felson is engaging and passionate; however, the course was disorganized, constantly in flux (i.e. the syllabus changed frequently and the scope of assignments was not explained clearly, making it very hard to plan in advance and engage fully in the projects), and wandering (i.e. the trajectory of the course was never fully clear - we jumped around a lot).",
    "I think it would be better if you made people do an occasional reading response or something on the readings because I think the class would have been better if more students had done the reading. I also think it would have been good to read a few more papers that were from urban ecology experiments - for example taking a class and looking at pollinator studies, or urban to rural gradients etc - but a few classes looking at the real ecology behind the concepts - paired black and white bar graphs every once and a while would be good.",

    "The course content is extremely interesting and the course has potential to be great, it just is in desperate need of streamlining and better organization.",
    "This is a brand new field, so getting exposure to this exciting, new, interdisciplinary field was incredible. Dr. Felson is an astonishing wealth of knowledge, and it was a privilege to be taught by him. I really enjoyed the field trips, especially to the art museum. I also appreciated Dr. Felson's responsiveness to concerns raised in the middle of the course. His openness to feedback from students is great, and made the course feel like a more iterative process. I have been turned on to a whole new realm of potential engagement through my coursework, and feel that taking this class has very positively impacted by life and education.",
    "The applied work in the Bridgeport case, and final presentation proved to be a very interesting way to link the class discussions (mostly theoretical, and up in the air) back to real case application.",

    "Real world problem solving and consulting-like work.",

   "comments": [
    "Organization was somewhat lacking in terms of when and what was required of students. Weekly clarity as to what readings were required, who would be presenting, and what each class would be dedicated to would have been much appreciated.",
    "There seemed to be a blatant disregard or unawareness for students' time, and class consistently ran over. The class was supposed to end at 11:50, but went until noon regularly. Students were also asked to come in early or stay late on occasion, in order to cover things that we ran out of time on in previous lectures. This would have been okay once or twice, but because this happened so consistently, it felt like an imposition on students whose time is booked down to the minute! Oftentimes there are lectures scheduled for noon, so having class end at 11:50 is imperative in order to get to these lectures\/special guest speakers on time (particularly if they are in a different building).Furthermore, we regularly received notification of information about readings and assignments the day before they were expected to be completed, and often at the eleventh hour (literally at 11 p.m. the night before in some cases). This made the entire course feel extremely disorganized, and in fact, the syllabus changed at least half a dozen times. Again, a change or two is to be expected, but the regularity with which this happened was egregious! It made any kind of advance planning or preparation (in terms of personal student scheduling) impossible, and made it difficult to stay motivated or have ample opportunity to really engage with the material (which of course I would have liked to do, but not when I receive the material at midnight the night before a 10:30 a.m. class).This last-minute notification reached its peak when, the day before our final presentations we were informed that a panel of prestigious local individuals was going to be in attendance. Receiving critical feedback from a panel of experts is absolutely valuable, and I have nothing negative to say about that. However, when an assignment has been framed in a certain way to the students(this presentation was intended to be a continuation of a previous assignment, and presented to us as something low-key and not too intensive), and this framing gets changed less than 24 hours before the deliverable is due, it is extremely frustrating and disheartening. Furthermore, the panel clearly had not been briefed on what our assignment was (a 12-minute presentation with very specific parameters). It was again, extremely frustrating when the panelists praised people who did not actually do the assignment as requested (some students' presentations went over much more than 12 minutes, which the panelists loved because it was so thorough) and harshly critiqued those that did because they did not cover certain things. If I had 25 minutes, I would have covered those things!Finally, the actual content of the course just felt a bit all over the place, and is in need of streamlining.",
    "Dr. Felson is brilliant, but not everyone operates on his level. Better organization of the course, with a slightly slower pace, would have been better. Also, he could better outline expectations at the beginning of the term. For example, our experience with Rebuild by Design was great, but we had an \"introductory\" lecture to the project only after a few months of working on the project. Instead of throwing us into the deep end it would have been nice to have better preparedness\/introductions to projects and topics.",
    "Besides organization in the syllabus, assignment feedback will be a valuable plus to the class development",
    "perhaps more direct instruction",
    "It needs to be better organized, respecting students' time and diverse backgrounds - people come to the course with a lot of different experiences and objectives, and the first few weeks should be used to help compensate for gaps and help get everyone up to speed. This might require narrowing the scope of the course, prioritizing depth over breadth.",
    "The syllabus should set in stone in January.",
    "1.) be more clear on the assignment requirement; 2.) be more organized especially for project class; 3.) give more background information for the final project.",
    "Lecture& discussion planning\/moderating",
    "More structure to allow students to plan ahead"

    "The lab, if RBD counts as the lab, was very effective. I think it played a valuable role in engaging the students in the course, although I was somewhat unaware of how quickly intensely the work would ramp up and then decline as a result of the project. Better advertising the engagement with a real-client design competition as well as a middle-semester work heavy schedule could make the class more appealing.",
