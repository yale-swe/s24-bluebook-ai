   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Crossover was mentioned in non-studio classes, like Visualization and Structures, but not in studio. The syllabus for Visualization demonstrated a clear attempt to relate topics to projects in studio, but in reality there was little to no time to implement lessons from Visualization in studio. Studio crits on the whole were fairly unreceptive to exploring alternative ways to visualize information- a topic which didn't even come up into the final presentation was days away. I think it is good, for first year especially, that studio is geared toward design process versus presentation and visualization. If Visualization assignments could be geared more toward design strategies, or be generative somehow, this may augment studio projects.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Sometimes this was eerily coordinated. I think that it was pretty neat, and perhaps even useful. Visualization missed some opportunities here, though I think the visualization course had more pressing problems to fix.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Generally, not a whole lot of direct correspondence, although some precedents for studio (Barcelona Pavilion, Neue Staatsgalerie, etc) were discussed in history.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I don't think that studio crossed over as well as it could have with other classes, mainly visualization. However, I don't believe that is as much of an err on the side of the studio professors as much as it was the visualization professors. I think that a strong first semester visualization and studio collaboration is an incredibly integral and important necessity for first year students as it will have a great influence on the way we will represent our work throughout the next 3 years and our careers after school. I believe that could be improved greatly.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Except the visualization course (but only in few instances), there was no crossover between studio and the rest of the classes.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Studio provided the opportunity to apply many of the issues I was learning in my other classes. The only class that directly tried to make a connection with studio was visualization. This link had little impact on studio but hurt the overall sequence of the visualization course.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0There was a valid attempt to crossover with visualization where representation in that class was another means of exploring studio issues. It wasn't always successful, and at times, felt more like a chore to complete. This could be in the fact that the material is presented separately. What would happen if we could be exploring our actual studio design in visualization?",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I feel that the themes, issues and material from my other classes were very helpful in informing my studio work. However, I think that the visualization curriculum could have better suited to our studio projects.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0The crossover between classes was tangential at points. Modern Architecture had several places where what we were studying related to building types being focused on in studio--so a good research value in the overlap. Visualization was ostensibly set up to overlap but the connections were superficial with no truly substantive benefit.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0There was no crossover. Visualizations said that they wanted to crossover but failed miserably.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0There was some correlation between the visualization course and studio, but often our visualization projects trailed what we were doing in studio, and the relationship could only be appreciated in hindsight. The relationship between my work in formal analysis and studio was tangential. I do not think themes from other classes translated directly into studio.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0There was some \"crossover\" between studio and other classes, but synthetic unity among all first semester classes did not seems to be a priority emphasized by any instructor (nor do I think it should be).",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0There was excellent crossover.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0There should have been more of a crossover with visualization, but what crossover there was was not fruitful.There was one lecture on performance spaces that was amazingly inspirational for our final project.There was not much cross-over otherwise.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0There was little crossover. This felt like a semester that lacked pedagogical direction.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0The studio projects\/process for each project was not even relevant unto itself, much less our other classes.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0One of the strengths of all of the courses in this semester was the freedom they allowed for exploration of personal interests within a structured framework. Several of the themes introduced in Formal Analysis and Architectural History provided me with ideas that I was then able to explore in my studio work which, in turn, enriched my understanding of the original course material. However, I felt as though this overlap was largely coincidental (I sensed almost no planned sharing of themes or theory) and perhaps a result of a personal approach to design. Furthermore, the framework in which each studio project was introduced (which privileged specific methods of designing over theory or themes) limited the extent to which I was able to explore the interests fostered by my other courses. I would have no issue with this (I'm certainly not at a point in my education where I feel I should be pursuing independent research) were it not for my distrust of the specific methodologies encouraged.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0The courses seemed to work well together throughout the semester. Visualizations seemed to try the hardest to link up, and the times when it was successful, it was quite productive for me. The second set of assignments were the most useful. Using drawing conventions to describe surface conditions and contours helped me understand different ways to represent different aspects of my second studio project. I could see how the final series tried to inform the final studio project, in learning how to develop conventional orthographic drawings to communicate information. However, the visualizations project was too abstract and arbitrary to really force us to be critical of what we were drawing, in the same way we would need to be in our studio projects. In terms of technique, I forced myself to use a variety of techniques in visualizations, from drafting hardline perspectives to computer modeling. Which inevitably broadened the types of representation I had available during my studio projects.The crossover between studio and formal analysis was often talked about but only came into fruition late in the semester. Peter often complained about the lack of an analytic eye in our studio projects, and how we should be able to carry over the type of work that we do in his class to studio. I got the opportunity to do so when I used the final drawing (which was a free drawing) in Peters classto draw an analytical drawing of my final studio project. It forced me to understand more specifically the language of the moves I was making and what worked and what was not as consistent. Of course Peter hated the drawing, but it was still a productive exercise for me. It isn't to say, that I couldn't have done this on my own, but it is hard to take the time to step back and execute a productive analytical drawing when the focus of studio is meant to continually to develop your project further.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0I did not find a great deal of crossover between studio and other classes. In the visualization course there was some overlap of thematic content, but only in the most general sense. In the structures course there was some overlap in that we presented our first studio project in order to analyze its structural potentials. Overall, though, it felt that the studio was quite a separate and distinct entity in terms of content and pedagogical interests.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Would be interesting to have a more direct and deliberate connection to the analytical approach used in Peter Eisenman's Formal Analysis class in studio project pedagogy.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Good crossover - its implementation in studio is another story altogether - it depends on the student.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0I felt that there was very little useful crossover of themes and material between classes. If anything, comparing the instructors' approaches only emphasized how different they all were. I think perhaps in the last week of studio I finally was able to draw some connections between Structures and Studio. I think when crossover was attempted, for example in Visualization with our cut\/fill drawing, it was just a superficial similarity that did not help me in studio or in Visualization. Probably the integrated curriculum was most useful in its organization of the semester's schedule, so that we did not have any major conflicts for deadlines.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0It was not as present as it could have been. Especially with visualization the opportunities for crossover in terms of skill exploration vis-a-vis design exploration are great - it is a shame it did not happen in a stronger way.As for other courses, there wasn't much crossover.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0With the exception of \"Formal Analysis,\" which, by definition, 'crosses over,' there was not much crossover between studio and other courses.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0I found that the issues\/themes discussed in my lecture classes were a great source of inspiration for my studio projects. My lecture classes exposed me to design theories and strategies that were often directly applicable to my daily design explorations. These lecture classes helped me gain perspective on my own work in the context of the larger architectural discourse beyond the limitations of studio. For me, a combination of \u0093seeing and doing\u0094 has generated faster improvement and a more enjoyable development. The crossover of theme\/issues\/material was more intentional between studio and our visualization course; however, this connection sometimes felt a bit forced.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0MORE crossover needed between theory, analysis and STUDIO",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0I think there was less crossover with studio than with any other classes. It seems as though studio stood on its own within the curriculum.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Overall, I felt that the crossover of themes between studio and other classes was fairly weak.There should have been a stronger correlation between the studio and visualization course. The visualization course could be a productive supplement to what the students are producing in the studio. Visualization should be more instructional based and should introduce students to software programs and technology that would be beneficial during the introductory\/experimental phases of the first semester design studio. It should also be a tool to expose the students to different graphic representation techniques.Studio should also draw from the Modern History course through precedent research. Along with the \"mini warm-up exercises\" prior to each project the students should simultaneously be investigating historical precedents through formal analysis.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0I saw strong crossover between studio and visualization and structures, maybe with formal analysis and modern architecture. It was most stimulating with structures and seemed unnecessary with visualization. crossover between the other classes was only incidental - whether each individual found something of interest or not.I do not think crossover between classes is necessary - each can and should stand on its own value. Structures has the most reason for overlap and that is important."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0The juries provided the most valuable feedback and eye-opening conversations by far. Every jury I saw this semester was fantastic at listening to students, evaluating their work and articulating a response that fit into the context of the discussion. The least valuable aspect of studio was class discussion, because we had none. There were no opportunities to discuss thoughts about a project as a group and with our critic, which I think would have been very valuable in helping inform our efforts.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I am glad we did not have very many pin-ups. I find desk crits much more valuable, and a better use of time. The final juries were very good, especially on the third project.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I found desk crits to be the most valuable aspect of studio. The one-on-one format was an important opportunity to delve into specifics that might otherwise be less relevant in a larger group.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I felt like Ben was extremely well balanced and had a great feel for knowing when to do pin-ups vs. desk-crits. Great job.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Pin-ups: Pell studio had almost no pin-ups, and I was very pleased with that. I did not consider the pin-ups to be particularly valuable, and felt that it was a waste of our time that we could be using on either desk-crits or production.Desk-crits: In general, I found the desk-crits quite valuable, especially at the beginning of a project. This is the time when one is trying to explore and distill his\/her ideas, and a one-on-one meeting with the instructor can be very valuable and productive.Lectures: They were quite informative and it was good to see what each instructor is interested in; however, I do not believe that the timing of the lectures was right. It would have been better to have them at the beginning of a project (first, second, or third), where students do not feel as much pressure from studio as they do towards the end.Juries: In my opinion, juries are one of the most valuable aspects of the whole course. They not only provide outside perspective and evaluation of one's project from a different point of view, but they also teach us students how to present, how to formulate our ideas clearly - to the point, and how to interact with the critics and respond to comments and criticism.Class discussion: Always valuable.Outside expert: It is always helpful to have a second opinion, especially from someone who is very knowledgeable about a topic that is of interest to the students, and is pertinent to the project.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0The most valuable aspects were the desk crits and juries. These were two different forums to get feedback and were often very helpful. The least valuable aspect was the pin-ups through the semester. The groups of students were too large for most people to stay focused and gain anything. Furthermore, we lost an entire day of work for 15 minutes of feedback. If the pin-ups were broken into smaller group they would have been more effective.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0A general focus on desk crits, with a few strategically planned pin-ups for each project seems to be the most beneficial organizational strategy for first year studio. Overall, I found studio to be a well-balanced, cohesive experience. If forced to pinpoint the least valuable aspect of the studio, however, I would have to say that it was the landscape lecture series. Although the lectures were valuable because they exposed us to the history and trends in landscape architecture, they were almost always out of step with our studio projects and too removed from our studio discourse to have immediate impact on our considerations. Our one-on-one work with Kate John-Adler was much more helpful for developing an understanding of how to engage ideas about landscape in our studio work. Yet the lectures served a dual function: they also obviated the charge for students to engage with ideas of landscape. If the lectures were not a part of the curriculum, it is doubtful whether much attention would be paid to the opportunity to speak with Kate John Adler on an individual basis.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Pinups and deskcrits were most valuable. By the time we get to juries, the projects have realized a form of their own and it becomes a passive dialog. During our section pinups (few) and desk crits, communication was two-way - an exchange of ideas.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I thought desk-crits and juries were the most valuable components of my first semester studio experience. It was during desk-crits and final juries that I received the most valuable input. I was impressed by the quality of my studio critic and feel that my projects benefited from his criticism. However, I don\u0092t think the other components of the studio curriculum were nearly as helpful. I especially think that our landscape consultant could have been better integrated into the studio. I feel that because we always met with her at the end of each project, her input was never really incorporated into our designs.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0The best part about studio was having pinups or reviews with other critics and outside jury members. Within our section, individual pin-ups, desk crits, and discussions were often futile and drawn out. Jennifer was scattered and unfocused during desk crits, often not letting a student introduce a new concept or process to her without her interrupting. Students were heavily discouraged from exploring new ideas, and we were told that other critics often made fun of us when they left studio. I was often told by Jennifer that I had embarrassed myself during reviews for reasons that were unseen by myself. This is not the sort of environment in which to encourage students to produce interesting or meaningful work, and the fact that Yale hires such unprofessional and passive aggressive critics is really a disservice to the institution and its students.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0The amount of projects we were asked to do this semester seemed overwhelming at first. After completing the semester and looking back at each project, I can now understand why each was not only necessary, but also helpful.The main thing I would change in the studio course would be the small initial project at the beginning of each larger project. With the average of 3 weeks to complete each semester project, these initial studies were not only time consumers, but they were not helpful either. Most of the students agreed that it was these initial projects, and the long \"final\" pin-up or review they required, that added unnecessary stress to the semester.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Pin-ups of the entire class during a project are pointless. No one pays attention and it just wastes our time. Desk crits and 3-person pin-ups are great. The 3-person pin-ups are new to me and I found them to be very valuable. I like to get the opinion of my peers, and that format forces us to critique other projects which also helps us evaluate our own projects. I appreciated the faculty lectures. We are asked to show our work and put ourselves out there to be critique and it is nice to see the faculty do the same. Coming from an \"authority figure\" it is nice to see that you are willing to put yourself out there to be critique by us. It breaks down the uncomfortable\"authority figure\" barrier and allows us to view the critics as more experienced peers that we are working with and learning from. The people brought in for the juries were amazing and all brought a different outlook on the projects.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0My studio section was asked to pin up every week during project development, which I found unproductive. This ate up time (e.g. prepping for the pin-up, listening to other crits, etc.) which could have been spent working and provided no feedback beyond what I already knew about my project. Desk-crits were always more helpful and efficient. There is no reason this could not be done more often, as there are only 10 people in the section. The \"rehearsal\" pin-ups leading up to the final jury were definitely most effectiallowed me to refine my presentation and edit the content of my drawings.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0There were by far too many mandatory pinups for the number of projects assigned during the semester. There was never any time to reflect upon the work that we were doing as we always had to be producing.The guest juries, as a whole, were very helpful and insightful. They really engaged the ideas of the students and seemed genuinely concerned about the future development of the projects and larger architectural issues raised during mid and final reviews.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Most valuable were desk crits and juries. Desk crits were valuable for advancing new ideas, juries were valuable for mastering the communication of a scheme.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0most valuable:final reviews- I probably learned the most seeing everyone else's projects.section pin-ups - small enough to allow for an in-depth discussion and understanding on each projectprecedent research - The amount of time spent on researching has been so helpful to our thinking and design. However, the pressure to decide and produce makes it difficult to spend much time on research.least valuable:the one week exercises - not enough time to develop these ideas into full concepts, resulting in a waste of a week's time, energy, and work.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Small group pin-ups were the most valuable. It was a time when atmosphere was laid back enough to not be intimidating but conversation was interesting because it was amongst peers.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Juries and outside experts including KJA were the most valuable. As were Ben, Martin, and Sunil. The least valuable were desk-crits.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0The studio was structured primarily around desk-crits and pin-ups (which I think was appropriate). The very few lectures we were given (only at the beginning of each project) seemed cursory and served as little more than introductions to eachnew site. The exceptions to this were the faculty presentations given by each critic towards the end of the semester. Some of these presentations introduced interesting theoretical concerns, however, the subjects were rarely germane to our projects. I think it would be helpful for the introductory lectures to be split into two sessions: one before the site visit and one after. The first lecture could introduce the specific history and function of the site and the second could offer an introduction to the theoretical issues around which the projects are structured.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0The most valuable parts of studio were desk crits and pin-ups. Although, things worked best when our critic was flexible enough in planning how to organize a studio session. Sometimes group (or small group) pin-ups were helpful when we were developing ideas, but at other times they were tedious. It is important that the scheduling remains a little flexible as to use our time as effectively as possible.There were times in the middle of the semester where we had too many studio-wide pin-ups. We already had so little time to develop a project, but then we were given an additional pressure of having to develop 'presentation' material for a pin-up. It forced me to develop ideas that I was not confident about just to have something to present and I inevitably wasted time when I had to back track to something that I was happy with.The least valuable part of studio were my desk crits with Kate John Alder. My conversations with her always seemed to be focused on very specific details when i was still trying to deal with larger conceptual issues. I often got frustrated because she was asking me practical questions about things that I knew were completely unresolved.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0The most valuable aspect of the studio was the projects themselves, which were well-defined, well-organized, challenging, and built logically from one to the next. The third project in particular provided a stimulating design prompt that really motivated me to push myself. In general, I felt that desk crits were the most valuable way of interacting with the critics. Having one-on-one, open-ended discussions was the best mode for me to get my ideas across, and often resulted in the most constructive and wide-ranging advice from my critic. Pinups were good to see what other classmates were doing, but were not always as constructive in terms of my own personal process. The least valuable aspect of the studio was the one-week exercises that opened each project. They often felt too constraining, and many times they had no direct bearing on the design process that followed, resulting in a loss of time to develop design ideas. If they were restructured to allow for slightly greater freedom of exploration, they would potentially feel more integrated into the projects.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0The most valuable aspect of Martin's studio is definitely the desk crits. The more one-on-one time you get with him, the more valuable the discussion turns out to be. The pin-ups in small groups of 2-3 students are extremely effective as well. The lectures are organized somewhat as a showcase for the critics current work, which offers an interesting window to the otherwise enigmatic practice, but it is unclear how much the students benefit from these talks. The juries invited display an astonishing spectrum of experience level, expertise, personality and sensibility, but in general the mid and final reviews are disappointingly underwhelming.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Most valuable - desk crits. They were informal, constructive and about design.Least - frequency of pin-ups not necessarily pin-ups themselves.Student emphasis was misguided - on production and presentation not design ideas necessarily. Question of quality or quantity needs to be addressed clearly at pinups.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0The most valuable aspect of studio was being able to get direct feedback from critics on my work, whether in a deskcrit, a pinup, or a review. It was often insightful and interesting to see other students' reviews and discuss their work, as well, although these discussions in Martin's studio tended to become very long and drawn-out, to the point where we might stay 2.5 hours late in class to finish discussing everyone's project. I think it's difficult to determine what was the least valuable aspect of class, because sometimes what seemed unhelpful at the time (the introductory exercises for each project,for example) ended up resonating in the end.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0While pin-ups were helpful for me to gauge my progress and to see the work of my peers, one or two pin-ups would have been adequate. Typically, I found that we had four or five pin-up between the entire studio and our section alone. Desk crits offer the same focused feedback, and allow students to continue working and making progress during class time. From a practical standpoint, it becomes very costly to plot large sketches or drawings which are discarded soon after.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Small pin-ups with Martin and a few other students was great and very valuable - it really helped push the conceptual aspect of the project. Students got varied feedback as well as got the opportunity to provide feedback and think critically about other student's projects.Less valuable the mid-term pin-ups with other critics tended to be. A lot of times the projects were criticized as if they were final presentations - it focused on issues and things that went wrong rather than recognize how far the student had gotten and try and find interesting and fruitful avenues to take it from there.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0It can be difficult to find value in pin-ups and juries, especially when one's own project is pressing. Staying invested in these discussions often requires solicited participation. I personally found desk crits to be the most helpful, and class discussions the least (since it seems a great many people talk to express themselves rather than to contribute).",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0PowerPoint presentations were an effective format for generating class discussions at the start of each project. These presentations helped to bring out the relevant issues and keep everyone engaged and excited about a new project. Desk-crits were often more productive than formal pin-ups. Informal pin-ups were very useful at the beginning of design development. At this stage, students were curious to review each others\u0092 work and receptive to constructive criticism. Class lectures by our studio professors provided a great opportunity for opening up the discussion to larger issues related to practice. I value and welcome more discussions along this vein. At the same time, I felt that our landscape lectures could include more challenging content.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0group critsexternal criticsI would have liked to get more input from the other section critics.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0I think the least valuable aspects of the studio were the analysis projects that we did at the beginning of each project. I think they were a fine point of departure for the project, but we generally spent too much time on them when the projects were so short.I think the most valuable aspect for me were the mini-pinups. I think these were most effective because we were able to really engage in each other\u0092s work.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Most valuable: individual and three student group pin-ups. Quick, effective, and broad criticism from people that understand a project and can further develop a common conception.Least valuable: midterm or large pin-up reviews that aren't a final review. They are the least helpful reviews and waste a massive amount of usable time for the the student body.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Small group pin-ups are extremely beneficial - especially when the critic encourages student participation within this setting. This is where I have learned the most in my architectural education. Through this exercise, students must understand and evaluate another student's verbal and graphic project proposal and then quickly synthesize their own thoughts into productive criticism. The ability to read and analyze a project other than their own and then verbally critique the project as well as propagate new ideas as a group is extremely beneficial in the studio setting.Another exercise that is invaluable is when the students are asked to write about their individual projects. This exercise should be done several times throughout the design process. Writing about their projects forces students to organize and articulate their design concepts into a cohesive argument. This is useful for conceptual development and criticism. Writing helps clarify design issues and makes students more aware of their design decisions. Similar to Kate's role as a landscape consultant, perhaps there could be an in-house literary critic. This exercise should be taken seriously, as students of architecture should be developing their skills in analyzing architecture both verbally and through writing.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Intra-section pin-ups and desk-crits were the most valuable part of studio. Sunil usually ran our pin-ups in groups of three which was very helpful. Hearing my peers' ideas about my work was always interesting and I could also see how they were tackling their projects. However, reserving at least one studio meeting per week for desk-crits was also very valuable. It provided a chance to have my own concerns addressed and my efforts focused by my instructor without the potential distraction of someone else's interests. Weekly pin-ups also provided important presentation practice, which for me at least helped make final reviews more comfortable.Juries were helpful in that they exposed us to a broad range of ideas about architecture and ways of reading aproject, but they often felt too divorced from the student's work. Many jury members are more interested in talking to each other than to us (which can be interesting, but is not the most helpful way to teach)."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Related to the question above, there needs to be a better balance between doing and thinking. We produced so much this semester. At times people found themselves building the exact same model they had built days ago, because they had to make another and had no idea or time to consider what should be different.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0The nature and sequence of the projects were successful at addressing essential spatial\/organizational\/programmatic issues. The production work was a good mix of freehand diagramming\/sketching, CAD, and physical modeling.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I think that the main issue I had with studio was the 1 week assignments that we were given at the beginning of each project. I have no problem with doing prescribed site analysis techniques, however I felt like these 1 week assignments were too independent of the main project and were alien and difficult to integrate into the next steps of the assignment. This could be improved by shortening them a little bit andtweaking them slightly.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0In my opinion, studio is absolutely indispensable in an architectural education. It teaches one how to approach a problem (usually a design one, but many times it is a problem that encompasses other issues as well), how to develop a strategy of solving that problem and finding a solution, and how to present that solution to others.The program of the studio was well organized, starting from a relatively simple project and progressing to a more complex one with program and site. However, I felt that the last project was perhaps a little bit too complex, considering the time that was allotted for it and the complexity of the program, and at the end it became very frustrating.Perhaps it would have been more valuable to have two projects during the semester, ranging in complexity, or three simpler projects. Also, the initial exercises were more detrimental than helpful in the development of each project (maybe with the exception of the first one.)",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Like stated above, the main strength of studio is that it is a testing ground for all the ideas found in other more focused classes. One of the largest problems with the studio was the lack of conceptual development in many of the projects. With projects that only last three to four weeks, more of an emphasis should be placed on developing a strong concept rather than a working building. If a high level of development were desired than maybe smaller, tighter programs for the projects would have been more effective. Another issue was the schedule ofthe studio. Many of the midterm reviews were too early in the design process. Furthermore, studio would have benefited from being on Friday instead of Thursday to avoid an overlap with Peter Eisenman\u0092s Formal Analysis class.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I would look carefully at the amount of production we need to do. At times, it felt relentless, when combined with other classes, and it was producing deliverables on top of deliverables; this leads to stagnant, underdeveloped and uninteresting projects. It felt at times, too rushed.Thanksgiving schedule was awful as well. Having two weeks of studio, before a week break, and then only one following, before final reviews had created an uneven development environment.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I think that the studio projects were interesting in that each was designed to address a specific architectural concern. I also appreciated that the projects increased in scale and programmatic complexity as the semester progressed. However, I feel that it would have been more useful had we started with a project that was even smaller in scale than our first project \u0096 perhaps an object that we could design and fabricate at 1:1 scale. I feel that designing and fabricating an object that we could immediately understand would allow us to better comprehend our architectural designs.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0The introductory exercises seemed to exist on their own and didn't really contribute the projects being worked on. They were ineffective in engaging the projects. Essentially, these exercises seem good in theory and bad in practice.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0The studio certainly pushed students to constantly be producing work, which pushed students positively, at least in terms of technique. The schedule seemed fair, though the introductory assignments that started off each project were completely useless anda waste of time. Those several weeks would have been better served studying program, programmatic requirements, site history, scale, and other architectural ideas that go beyond producing colorful graphs that mean nothing in terms of progressing the idea of the project further.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0The studio ended up being more about teaching us how to produce quickly rather than developing complex conceptual ideas. I feel that learning how to come up with an idea quickly and producing a project is a valuable skill. I would imagine that competitions would be at this same pace and these skills would be useful for that. I think that later studios will deal with teaching us to develop complex conceptual ideas.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0This studio was the most important course of the semester. I was impressed by the organization of the course. I felt the shift in scale from 1. \"building block\" to 2. landscape to 3. a small building with program was appropriate and introduced the class to several key themes in architecture. In terms of schedule, I think we should have had more time to complete the final project, as it was the most complex. We were given the most time for the middle project.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0I am not quite sure how to respond to this question. I think studio, when given a clear agenda and good individual critics, is a fantastic way to learn. I can understand that this particular semester was somewhat of a leveling, skill-building semester geared towards bringing everyone up to at least some basic, but I still feel that it could accomplish more with less. With only two projects and more time devoted to each one, the students can still maintain the high productivity level emphasized in first semester, but there would also be more time to reflect on the work done and actually develop architecture that deals more with ideas than simple formal manipulation.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0In general I found this to be a stellar semester, productive engaging and well thought out. It is clear that quantity took precedence over quality this semester as evinced by the enormously long list of requirements. This is just production and almost the only way to complete it all is to build a rhino model and take drawings from it in a documentary fashion. There was very little encouragement to do something out of the ordinary. I understand the pedagogical goal to get the class to a uniform level but I lament the lack of truly original work, of which I know the student body is capable.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0The focus on production was detrimental to our learning. I believe that we were not developing tools to express our ideas because we had to fulfill certain production requirements at every review.The fast paced schedule did not allow us time to developour ideas. There was a lack of coherence between our \"one week exercises\" and our eventual conceptual development, therefore, that one week of work often just goes to waste.I believe a studio should engage us to think about the greater issues of architecture and allow us a medium to express them specifically through a project. This studio was not successful in doing either of those.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Although I enjoyed the entry exercises to each project, they were unhelpful in their generating a building, and the time alloted for each project was also ridiculous. If a certain level of development and thought is expected, an adequate amount of time should be given. Pedagogically, the first project taught us nothing, the second project could have been useful had we not been kept in the dark, and the third project was finally useful and interesting. However it was the shortest, so it wasn't as effective as it could have been.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0My understanding is that each of the three projects in this course was introduced within the framework of a specific pedagogical trope (tectonics, site, and perspective). Although I can understand the concept behind structuring the course this way, I think it makes for a neater package on paper than it did in practice. I felt that the first project pushed a particularly unsuccessful approach. As a student without a design background, I found the first project's emphasis on tectonics both confusing and, in many ways, unproductive. My studio critic repeatedly suggested that we \"use the tectonic to generate an overall form\" but, when asked, was unable to clarify an approach beyond that statement. I recognize that this could be a weakness specific to my critic (Joyce Hsiang) but, in general, I feel that this project would have been better situated at the end of semester after we had developed a broader cache of tools with which to approach a design problem. In addition, I personally felt that the relative sitelessness of that first project was a hindrance rather than a helpful simplifying element (as I assume it was intended to be). In general, I felt that the design approaches fostered by the studio curriculum lacked clarity (particularly in regards to the first and third projects).My feelings regarding schedule and production are mixed. On one hand I appreciate that we were pushed to produce such a huge amount of work. Again, as a student without an architecture background, this was helpful in that it forced me to familiarize myself with representational standards and software. However, the number of deliverables expected for each project were met at the expense of intellectual and design exploration and at the expense of work produced for other classes. Had the pace been a bit slower and theoretical discussion encouraged over sheer volume of production, I feel that the educational rewards would have been greater. In addition, there is an overwhelming attitude at YSOA that studio is the most important class to a degree that denies the value of other courses. I expect the curriculum to be structured in a way that allows me to dedicate enough time to ALL of my classes in order to feel successful and as though I've come away having thoroughly learned the course material. The amount of work assigned in studio prohibited this result. We were forced to choose between producing work for studio and meeting the expectations of our other courses. When I raised this issue with my critic she told me (and I paraphrase fairly accurately) that \"no one will ever look at your structures tests, but they will look at your portfolio.\" Again, though her statement may be true, this casual dismissal of a legitimate concern betrays an attitude that I found both disrespectful and unsettling considering the amount of time and money I am dedicating to my education.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0The nature of the introductory projects would benefitfrom a slight shift in focus. I appreciated that the one-week introductory exercises provided entree into our work, and gave us lens through which to work. However, it was never explicit how we were supposed to use these explorations as generative of the next stage of our work. It seemed as though the precedent or early studies were so far removed that there was a lot of arbitrary decision making about how to convert something that was not ours to something that resounded with our own reactions to the program. Specifically, I found the first project extremely problematic. I had airspace tokyo as a jumping off point, which could not really be understood in terms of a part-to-whole relationship. Therefore I struggled with first how to understand the 'tectonics' of this precedent and how that could inform a way to move forward with the project. Also, the pressure to develop a fully developed set of reactions to the initial assignment, set up unnecessary obstacles as I tried to define the project for myself. The whole process might benefit from a better understanding exactly how we are supposed to engage with these assignments, which might include a loosening up of the requirements so we can start exploring our own ideas through these assignments from the outset (instead of first trying to solve the problems of the assignment and then are left to translate them into our own project)The schedule and the rate of production have been a point of great pride and of great frustration for me throughout the entire semester. More so than in my undergraduate studio work, there is a standard of materials that is acceptable. Everything has to meet a certain level of quality at every stage of the design process. This has caused frustration for me, because I have always like to explore ideas through various modeling and drawing techniques that might help me understand and start to communicate ideas but might not be the easiest to understand from the standpoint of a critic. Often, I need a period of time to find the right way to visualize my project, so I myself can understand the implications of my work before I can present it in a way that is understandable to others. Thus, the pressure to consistently produce work that clearly represents my ideas AND that was crafted to suitable level of quality, was often overwhelming and unproductive. At some points, I would sit for hours not able to produce anything because I knew that it would not meet the standard that was expected of me. On the other hand, once I gained hold of my project, this pressure to present materials with an extra level of refinement really encouraged me to take my work to the next level of detail and development. Hopefully, in the future, the requirements will be more tailored to the stage of the project we are in. For some, the study model stage is a crucial one, and should not be limited to the first couple days of a project.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0The main problem I felt throughout the semester was that there was not enough time to devote to studio work. The demands of other classes, including lengthy time spent in class and major assignments due every week, often limited the amount of time that could be spent on studio. The weekends became devoted almost solely to studio, while during the week very little progress was made. This limited the productivity of our time with the critics. The hectic pace of three design projects also contributed to the problem, as constant progress was necessary to complete the projects to an adequate degree of resolution. While having three projects was a strength in the sense that it allowed for a wide variety of design exploration, it often felt that one unproductive desk crit or design misstep could set back progress to an inordinate degree. It seems like having two projects instead of three might be a more productive way to deal with the intensive demands of the overall schedule in the first semester.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Three projects is too much for students to effectively engage in each project w\/ consideration of all the supporting course load.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Students find themselves benefiting from their peers as much as from their critics. The set up of the studio allows a very open and friendly environment for students, even from different classes, to interact and learn from each other. The experience of the studio varies according to the studio critic, but it's great that the school is overall a very friendly place for students to learn from each other.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0I think the studio was reasonably organized and themed. It's difficult to teach a first-semester studio class, and I thought our professors were mostly on target, in that most of what we worked on seemed relevant, and I was fairly happy with what I produced in the end. A lot of the criticism I've heard about first-semester studio is that we're so busy producing that we have no time to think about what we're learning. While we are kept very busy producing, I think it is the only way to allow us to explore our instincts as designers rather than copying the styles of other architects.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0In this course, there were three main projects and several related research assignments and presentations throughout. Given the relatively short time frame, and allowing for the students to adjust to a new program and routine of the school, the schedule is spread too thin to give any one of the projects the time and dedication they deserve. The pace at which we are asked to move is not consistent with the level of inquiry we are asked to show each project. I felt that I was constantly being told to move forward, but towards what? As soon as we began a project, it seemed that we were already preparing for the final review. I don't know that I came away with as much as I could have, had there been two projects that we were able to really focus on.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0It is tempting to complain about the work load of studio as a hindrance to its effectiveness as a teaching tool. However, it seems that the work load is typically more a function of the studio culture than the studio requirements. Having studio twice a week is a very good schedule - more or less would not be a productive change. That said, having studio on the same day that students are expected to produce work to present to the school's premier critic (Mr. Eisenman) is not such a good schedule...",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Each studio project was designed to follow an incredibly fast schedule. Under this circumstance, while our one-week exercises were great for initial exploration, I wish that these exercises were conducted with more focused intensity. Some of these initial projects could generate more insightful studies if more time were allowed for background research before site visits.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0We had too much work overall, in all our subjects, and so could not focus on studio. Thus the projects were not refined to the point that they could have been, in terms of design and analytical refinement.I mean this genuinely:We need time as students to think and learn, to read and reflect, to assimilate and then to produce.This semester, there was no time to think or learn, only time to PRODUCE - and it WAS often thoughtless production, from what I saw around me.The program was well laid out, however, the projects were too even in terms of what was required, I would propose that first semester is eitherONE extended projectorTHREE projects of varying durations(1 week, 3 week, 10 week, for example)to explore the full range of design(the broad stroke\/gesture, the diagram, and the resolved proposal).",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Having three quick projects was one weakness of the studio. The length of the projects was too short because we were never able to really develop our work and have time to step back after a crit and really evaluate what we were making.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Studio by its own nature is a pedagogical tool because it allows a student to investigate within a realm a question that may interest the student, instructor, or the concept question overall. You gain what you want to gain and ignore what you want to in the studio setting, which can be much attributed to the open atmosphere in my studio section.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0It was clear that studio was structured in a specific way to expose us to various methods of working and introduce multiple angles of architectural inquiry. Personally, I found this very frustrating. The use of 1 week + at the start of each project for an exercise that seemed designed purely as a pedagogical tool was immensely disappointing and felt like a waste of time, the instructors even seemed to acknowledge that it would have no real bearing on the development of our projects. Furthermore, the clear division of themes between the three projects created a situation in which lack of interest in one of those themes seriously weakened the interest in the studio project. I was thoroughly dis-interested in the second project's goals, and whether my own failure or not, this definitely led to my worst project.It also seemed clear that while we were always encouraged to develop strong ideas and focus the project around them, the true focus of the studio was on our production - making sure that we could produce the necessary representation. While important, I think the balance could be corrected slightly. This is more a reflection of the studio as a whole than my critic."

However, my expectations for Pell's availability were met and surpassed- I had plenty of time to desk crit with him although I would not call this two-way discussion.I expected more latitude in the syllabus to allow for exploration and time to develop fabrication techniques. I felt that this was discouraged and our job instead of testing and learning was to produce.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I expected to develop competence in conceptualizing an architectural idea, to expand my vocabulary of representational techniques, and to gain more confidence in general with expressing myself through architecture. Of course, these are ongoing challenges, but I would say that first semester studio has put me on the right trajectory.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Studio was more or less everything I expected. Although I wish we had more time to devote to it. Many times I felt as if I had to do so many things rushed, fast and quick just to get them done, studio included, instead of being able to do a few things very very well. Actually, I felt that way about everything which is surprising coming from an institution like Yale. One would expect that quality has precedence over quantity, but this was ABSOLUTELY not the case this semester.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0The course fulfilled all my expectations. Although, I must admit, I did not expect the amount of work that was required from us during the semester (considering that we had all the other classes as well.)",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I didn\u0092t have many expectations for the studio but I have to say that I was pretty pleased with how things went. I just wish I were pushed more to develop the concept behind my project rather than just pushing forward and developing a working building.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Met as expected. Is this a good thing? No surprises\u0085",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Coming into the semester, I was expecting to be able to investigate my own architectural interests with the guidance of a well-informed critic. I didn\u0092t really have much opportunity to explore my own interests this semester because of the crazy schedule and production requirements, but I don\u0092t really know that that was necessarily a bad thing.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0My expectations for this studio were very high at first, but quickly fell after the first project. Again, it was very hard to receive any sort of constructive criticism throughout the entire semester, and my work suffered severely because of this lack of dialogue.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0I expected a slower pace in which I would be developing more complex ideas. However, as explained above, I believe that structure of the studio was valuable in a different way.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0I expected to be bored and frustrated with this studio since it was introductory and I completed eight studios in undergrad. Luckily, I was encouraged to challenge myself and look at things differently, and I ended up gaining some important insights into my own working method and design in general.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0I had very high expectations for this studio, and unfortunately, they were not met. Since I came into this school with some architecture background (both academic and professional), this studio seemed a little remedial in the terms of the architectural issues it addressed. I was impressed by the amount of objects (models, drawing, etc.) I produced over the course of the semester, but they lacked the any larger architectural ideas or agendas I was hoping to develop as a graduate student. Frankly, I feel that exploration was almost discouraged in favor of sheer production.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0I hoped to begin to formulate some sense of a greater design direction, and to think more deeply about issues that would inform my trajectory over the next two years. Both of these goals were not met, as this semester was filled with too many projects that do not allow one to think or even really engage in design issues. Instead, we are caught in a whirlwind of production, making spur-of-the-moment design decisions final,and not necessarily developing conceptually as a result.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0I expected an extraordinary experience, where I would learn a great deal. I would place this studio below any undergraduate studio experience I had at my previousinstitution. I look forward to future studios here because they seem to be more of the caliber I expect from Yale.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0I was hoping to refine my design process through this first semester studio and to learn how to develop architectural ideas. For the most part, this did not happen. Instead of developing my own previously understood techniques and ways of working, I felt like I was given a whole new way of working. In some ways this was beneficial and it forced me to think about and approach my work in a new way. But because the pace was so quick I constantly felt like I was struggling to keep up with the demands I had of my own work and the demands of the studio. The result of having such specific and extensive demands, was that it biased particular types of work. It often seemed like having a conceptually rich project, either one that was well researched or one that responded critically to the program, were overlooked in favor of projects that looked like \"architecture.\"",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0I expected the studio to introduce me to new ways of thinking about design, and to help me consider alternate methods of working than those which I am used to. The studio met my expectations. I was exposed to many new ideas and considerations which I feel have broadened my perspective of the design process. The first project in particular, while very abstract, introduced a part-to-whole approach which was very new to me. Coming in, I was unsure how having such a variety of backgrounds and experience levels within the program would affect the studio. However, the projects never felt too basic, and I was quite challenged by the studio as a whole.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0My expectations for the studio was very low at the beginning - partially due to the summer course we all had to put up with for 2 months. At the beginning students were worried about the fact that most of the critics are too young. But once the semester started, things got much better and overall the outcome of the semester exceeds my expectations.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Expectations were met - both for myself and studio.I have been consistently producing work that I have learned from and would deem portfolio-material - I'm amazed to see how far I've come in a semester and have made a great deal of personal progress.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0I had no expectations for this studio other than that it might be similar to my undergraduate studio experience. It was much, much more difficult than undergrad in both workload and expectations.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0From this course, more than any other, I expected to produce work that demanded the most time and energy of me, but that I would be happy to include in my portfolio, ultimately. These projects did require the most time and energy, but I was not able to derive any satisfaction from the end product. The blinding speed of the course does a disservice to the work and to the level of resolution I felt I was able to achieve.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0With this studio, I expected to improve my design skills and challenge my design thinking. Through an arduous working process, I was pushed hard toward improvement. I have not only improved on technical skills, on the clarity of expression, but more importantly I value the results I have achieved through a conscious course of self-discovery.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0I have the ability to produce.I cam to grad school to get CRITICAL insight into my PROCESS, for some fine-tuning. And I don't think I got this enough, or that we spent enough time on HISTORY or THEORY, both of which should be an integral part of grad architecture programs. In this sense, I find myself wondering if I should have gone to Princeton.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0This was my first studio experience, so I was not entirely sure what to expect, so I can\u0092t really say one way or the other if my expectations were met.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Didn't have any expectations other than to have a equal chance to prove myself. I did get that chance and that was all I could ask for.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0I was hoping that I would learn how to design. It was frustrating to feel that I was neither being taught technical skills nor how to work through a project, but rather bombarded with requirements and \"possibilities\". However, I understand that the intent is for us to figure it out ourselves, and I appreciate that. Ideally, the master studio critic would recognize the steps necessary to fully maximize our potential.Overall, in terms of production I am amazed at my progression and the capabilities I gained during the semester. I still feel like I do not know how to work through a project on my own."

    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Ben was available, approachable and explicit with his instructions. His weakness as a section crit is that he often issued the same provocations and suggestions amongst all his students during desk crits, and only late into the semester did he pick up on issues of personal development. He seemed more interested in us executing the body of work that he envisioned as a studio coordinator than seeing us develop our own working ways.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Sometimes Ben failed to see the ideas that I was trying to express, though when he did understand what I wanted, he was very good at helping me get there. More than anything, I think Ben is very good at permitting his students to pursue their own projects, processes, etc. This made us more likely to get excited about our projects, which helped us make better work.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Ben is everything I could have asked for in a first year critic - he's always positive and encouraging, and is extremely clear in the way he conveys information and his expectations for his students.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Ben was EXCELLENT at motivating us to work. He really was positive and seemed to care a lot about each project. He was really good at knowing what was a reasonable amount of work to assign\/expect for next class. He was exceptional at maintaining an open mind about all types of design and able to give extremely applicable and spot-on critiques in a positive way no matter what type of project.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Overall, I was very pleases with my critic - Ben Pell. I believe he is anexcellent instructor for the first year studio. His comments were almost always very constructive and helpful, encouraging exploration of ideas and production processes.My only criticism would span from the fact that as a studio coordinator, perhaps he has a more defined idea and certain expectations of the final product than the other critics might have. That is not necessarily a negative thing, and one can probably not avoid it (being a course coordinator). So this is more of an observation than a criticism.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Ben Pell was able to motive the studio while making sure not to panic us. This helped the studio to produce better and more consistent work. Furthermore, he was always well prepared and clear about his desires. He was willing to adjust to the needs of the studio. But, Ben could work on identifying a student\u0092s goals for the project and figuring out how to push and challenge those goals.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I really enjoyed working with Ben Pell this semester. His uninhibited style of discussion and criticism had a positive effect on our studio. We had the benefit of knowing the motivation behind our studio assignments thanks in large part to Ben\u0092s clarifications during our weekly studio-wide discussions. Secondly, I cannot understate the role that Ben\u0092s clarity and directness played in generating genuine dialogue about the projects, and the value of such discussion in the studio environment.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Ben was a good prof. Easily one of the more mature profs on board for first years. This is valuable as other studios lacked some of this stability. Perhaps could push for more exploratory work.At times, his desk crits were highly valuable: leading to new ideas, thoughts and discussion. There were times, though very few, when the crits were less successful.Also, the way the studio was run, I would have liked to have more inner studio presentations: pinups and reviews with our section could be valuable as a tool for presentation skills, but also to get the section talking about studio design problems.Alejandro didn\u0092t show up as much as other TAs had. Although he was reliable for the first two projects, his participation dropped off by the third project.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0My critic was overall very good. He was typically able to hone in on the problems with my project and offer helpful input.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Jennifer's main strength was the management of the production of work in our section. She balanced well the daily need to produce work while not providing rigid requirements that might otherwise be an ineffective use of one's time. I feel this is a tremendous asset for Jennifer moving forward. However, overall I was disappointed with Jennifer as a critic and with the YSOA for presenting me with someone so inexperienced. To begin, Jennifer had problems working with many of her students, myself included, and seemed unaware of these problems and\/or lacked the interpersonal vocabulary to engage them. Frequently it was unclear why she was pushing a certain direction in my work and when questioned was unable to articulate her reasoning for doing so and often responded in combative and passive aggressive terms. Additionally, Jennifer's desk crits were scattered and unfocused. Her approach was a stream ofconsciousness flow of ideas that were unrelated to each other and to the material being presented to her which often resulted in a directionless conclusion to the day. Overall I was disappointed with the quality of my instructor and surprised that she was teaching at this institution.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Jennifer's strength was in approaching each project realistically in terms of production and time. She often didn't require students to make drawings or models for the sake of production, and encouraged us to think conceptually. Unfortunately, as I have already stated, she lacks the ability to provide any sort of constructive criticism and approaches each student with a passive aggression that is completely unproductive. She was extremely unprofessional, unfriendly, and unfocused, and has a highly ineffective pedagogy.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Jennifer is a smart and knowledgeable woman. Her strength on the jury panel has been proven many times over. She offers helpful advice and is often one of the most incisive critics to review a project.However, when Jennifer holds a desk crit, she often forgets to listen to each student and his\/her individual ideas. She has a harder time acknowledging where each student is along his\/her design process and helping to move on from that spot. While she offers great advice and is wonderful at introducing new ideas, this is usually not helpful once the project hits the second or third week of design. It is then that each student needs help on pushing the existing idea, rather than help coming up with a new idea that complicates the project unnecessarily.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0She prevented the development of ideas. Any kind of resolution was practically impossible because she would always spin you in a pointless direction. It is ok to take a good idea and try to run with it. You don't have to always try random things. 10 random approaches still ends up equaling an unresolved project. I know how to try lots of different things but I need to work on taking an idea and developing it to a high resolution. Also, not every comment has to be a theoretical ambiguous thought. Sometimes it is ok to say \"that wall doesn't work there, move it five feet to the left.\" I'm not asking you to design the project for me but be willing to give tangible advice every once in a while.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Jennifer is very intelligent, knowledgeable and hard-working. She was always available \"online\" and came into studio outside of class time to help us with our work. I appreciated her attention to my progress and suggestions for improvement. I felt she was a little too demanding of time at the beginning of the term; she expected too much given our workload from other courses. Occasionally she would make snide remarks which I found unprofessional. She also would sometimes give conflicting advice which had to be parsed for useful information. Overall, I feel Jennifer was a valuable section critic and helped me improve as a designer.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Jennifer is very knowledgeable in architectural theory but I do not think she is the right type of instructor for a first semester studio.She never really seemed interested in developing the ideas of her students and often suggested seemingly random or very tangential projects to look at, which, more often than not, threw students of course and created more confusion than clarity.Also she has a hard time communicating or working through ideas visually. I have never had a studio critic who drew and sketched less during desk crits. She can certainly talk about and discuss architectural ideas, but I find that she could never really apply them to the actual design of something. Everything she talked about was always up in the air and never materialized itself in any tangible for. At desk crits, it was always \"think about this...\" and then listing a few architects instead of \"maybe if you tried doing this...\" and drawing a sketch. I know this is a fine line to walk as you don't want to design a student's project for him\/her, but as an instructor teaching in a studio with such heavy emphasis on production, helping the student realize ideas on paper is vital.Jennifer is also not very personable and never seemed to share anything of herself with her students. The perfect example was the faculty presentations in which everyone except her showed their own personal work or research (good or bad). She simple rehearsed a guest lecture she had to give later that week on a topic which she admitted did not really interest her all that much. If I am expected to open myself up and explore new architectural ideas (which I think is the point of graduate school), it helps to have instructs who will be receptive and open to this. If an instructor treats me as just another student and not as a person who, like everyone, has fears of failure and moments of doubt, how can I feel confident pushing myself and exploring uncharted creative paths (which may or may not fail in the end).",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Joyce has an excellent repertoire of architectural knowledge, but she fails at times to relate to students.In particular, her tendency to threaten students with failure (or low-pass) alienates students and breeds resentment toward her and the project. We are all aware that failure is a possibility, we do not need to be threatened.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0My Section Critic, Joyce Hsiang, was not effective as an educator. Her input was often unfocused and hard to understand.Many of us felt more confused and frustrated after design crits with her than before. Furthermore, an expression of confusion or uncertainty was always construed as a sign of weakness or inadequate ability. Therefore, it was difficult to be open to her or to really discuss one's issues.She constantly demands more than the possible requirements. As a result, quantity is valued over quality, and rather than an in-depth development, similar representations of the same ideas are generated under the time pressure.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Joyce overall was an ineffective critic. Interactions during crits varied greatly, with days of valuable advice being few and far between, the majority of crits serving only to confuse or derail a project. Interactions with Joyce were always tense at best. I feel a critic\u0092s role should be in the form of a mentor, helping one through a design process and assisting a student in struggles or roadblocks along the way\u0097the critic using his or her experience to help the student solve the problem at hand. This type of relationship was never made with Joyce. Students were always frightened to show any sign of struggle or difficulty because this was interpreted by Joyce as incompetence. While explaining one\u0092s project to Joyce, any confusion or lack of development (even at early stages) was also interpreted as a fundamental lack of ability on the student\u0092s part, which quickly led to degradation in the interaction with Joyce. A student should never be afraid to relay their difficulties to their studio critic; likewise, it should not be the priority of a critic to use each crit to decide whether a student is competent in lieu of actual design help and advice. I saw the majority of my fellow students in the studio section have similar experiences to my own; conversations quickly turning into awkward stand-offish sequences and tense, degrading sessions. I saw fellow students\u0092 projects completely changed or negated by Joyce only days before a final review. The daily multi-page e-mails and a laundry list of deliverables for every studio were unnecessary and led to less thought-out projects. This led to a completely demoralizing semester during which the spirits in our studio were always much lower than the rest of the class. Although the difficulties mentioned may be due to Joyce\u0092s lack of experience as a critic or educator, I do not feel that Yale is the place to train inexperienced critics. There are plenty of other institutions for that task. Especially with New Haven\u0092s proximity to New York, some of the best architects in the country are at arm\u0092s length. Yale, in my opinion, should be employing only the best and most experienced critics even at the first-year level. If schools like Columbia or even Pratt can have good first-year critics, Yale should be able to do the same. Yale does have an impressive faculty; it is a shame these individuals are either not teaching studio, or are not involved in first year. In short, I believe my first design studio semester represented neither the prestige of \u0093Yale\u0094 nor the price tag of my tuition.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Overall, I was quite disappointed with Joyce. I think that she's very intelligent and dedicated but that she lacks the proper experience to be teaching at this level. She has difficulty communicating her expectations and, even in attempts to clarify, often contradicts herself and uses language that is both vague and heavily reliant on architectural jargon. I believe that Joyce is aware of this shortcoming and that she has attempted to rectify it, but with limited success. Even at the end of the semester, by which point a shared working vocabulary (as well as an understanding of individual work patterns and design methodologies) should have long-since been established, I found desk crits to be largely unhelpful as a result of miscommunication and inconsistency on Joyce's part. I should stress that this was not due entirely to language. I often left desk crits and pin-ups feeling as though I understood the direction in which Joyce wanted my work to proceed only to be given entirely conflicting feedback in subsequent meetings. In addition, she seemed unable or unwilling to address my work on the terms in which I conceived and presented it. During the third project I presented Joyce with a conceptual model, spoke exclusively about the idea I was exploring, and stressed that the model was a diagram rather than a literal, formal suggestion. At the conclusion of my presentation, she told me that she wasn't interested in my concept, but that she liked the formal aspects of my model and advised me to pursue the project within that formal framework. I took her advice and produced a project that, according to Joyce, did not display \"clarity of design intent.\" In retrospect, I feel that I would have gained more from the semester and produced stronger projects had I continued to address my work in terms that I understood, rather than following Joyce's vague recommendations. This is, obviously, a fairly major issue as any student (and particularly a student at the beginning of their education and without a background in architecture) is entitled to expect a critic whose advice need not be questioned at every turn. I am disappointed in YSOA for providing me witha critic whose abilities fell so short of that mark.I realize that this evaluation is harsh but I believe that it is required, particularly because (after a semester in which I dedicated a tremendous amount of time and energy) I low-passed Joyce's studio. I believe that the effort I put into this class would have resulted in projects that merited better than a low-pass had I been working with a critic who gave clear feedback.In addition, I have a serious complaint concerning the procedure with which Joyce undertook the evaluation and grading of my work. It was not until my exit interview that I was given any idea that I was low-passing. This is inappropriate. A student whose work is unsatisfactory is entitled to a warning that they are in danger of not meeting requirements for a passing grade. Furthermore, they are entitled to a chance to improve their work in order to achieve good standing. I was provided with neither warning nor suggestions for improvement beyond a list of recommendations given to me at mid-semester that I believed I was meeting. This, once again, reveals a lack of communication surrounding an issue that should have been accorded serious attention.I don't mean to suggest that Joyce is entirely without merit as a teacher, however, I'm wary of mitigating an overwhelmingly negative impression with platitudes. I am confident that she, and the administration, are aware of her skills (again, she is very intelligent, occasionally instigated extremely engaging conversations, and I believe that she tried to recognize and overcome weaknesses) but, ultimately, I feel that her inability to provide students with clear feedback and guidance makes her an ineffective critic, particularly for the first semester of this program.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0At times, Joyce was a very intelligent and insightful critic. When I was comfortable with my project and I had confidence in the direction I was headed, Joyce was able to give me very provocative criticism that questioned my work in way that helped me reinforce and strengthen my ideas.However, throughout the semester, there were times when desk crits with Joyce were frustrating and confusing. Once deciphered, her criticism was still smart and relevant, but there was so much difficulty communicating that made progress very hard. First, she often had a hard time understanding my work, unless I had a very clear and concise visual and verbal presentation. Without specific material to react to, these conversations would become overloaded with large theoretical questions and architectural jargon, which were relevant but also extremely overwhelming. Instead of helping me clarify my ideas, Joyce would further complicate all of the issues. It often seemed as though she was questioning the entire premise of my project, instead of criticisms about particular aspects of my work. These conversations would set me back immensely, and it would take me days to regain confidence in the ideas I was pursuing in order to continue making progress. In the end, I would come to realize that the problems were more an issue of language than anything else. Joyce would benefit from understanding when her students need to be asked difficult conceptual questions about their work and when students need more focused criticism, help interpreting what they have done, advise about their process\/techniques, and lastly a little encouragement!",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0Joyce Hsiang was a knowledgeable and encouraging section critic. Her greatest strength was in analyzing our design process and methods of working, and helping us to broaden our ways of thinking and challenging us to break out of our comfort zones. She was great in providing helpful precedent material for both design concepts and graphic\/drawing conventions. Joyce did not enforce any ideological viewpoint about architecture, and instead encouraged us to explore our own ideas and beliefs, which was a real strength. However, communication was not always easy. She sometimes struggled to fully understand our design ideas, injecting her own interpretations and ideas instead of listening fully. Also, if we were struggling or not moving in the right direction with our projects, she had difficulty in helping us forge a productive path forward. She also had a tendency to be discouraging and negative in these situations, which only made the situation less productive.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0TA, Jerome Haferd, was extremely helpful and available almost all the time. Joyce is a very effective critic, capable of challenging how students approach a project and guiding him\/her through developing a coherent set of ideas and visualizing them. I would suggest alongside an exit interview, to have an entrance interview, to gauge what student's hope to gain through the course - what their weaknesses and strengths are. This might help guide the critic in what and how they challenge the student's work and thinking processes, and would provide targeted direction that is valuable to students.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0The main strength of Martin is his honesty with his criticism and ability to get his points understood. He is always completely and utterly supportive of his students throughout their creative process. He is patient and extremely knowledgeable to give valuable comments on students from all backgrounds. A great mentor and friend. A definite, invaluable asset of the school.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0StrengthsReceptive, responsive, approachable, personable, organized, available, confident, direct and clear, motivating, constructive.Weaknesses - not really a weakness but more of a suggestionIt is sometimes easier to learn things by doing and other times by seeing it being done. There are two ways to prevent mistakes from happening. First : explain it before it happens and Second: wait for it to happen in order to have someone learn something from it.The second method can be slow and tedious though effective.But the difficulty some students encounter is that time (in terms of how short the projects are) does not allow for many mistakes to be made. This results in a fear of failure and so the student focuses on production for production's sake - and in my case fooling myself of complexity as a substitute for rigor.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Martin was objectively the best studio critic out of the group. I frequently heard other students comment on how useful his feedback was in reviews, and how they wished they had him as their critic. Being in his studio group, I certainly appreciated his insight and expertise, and I felt as though he helped me push my ideas to get a stronger conceptual understanding of my design. If I could offer some criticism it would be that throughout most of the semester, Martin's high standards, tough demands, and unsentimental criticism made everyone in my group fairly intimidated by him. This approach very likely achieved the aim of getting us all to work very hard and push our projects to the next level, but there were times when the extraordinary stresslevel felt unreasonable, especially when weekly deadlines seemed impossible to meet. We joked in my group that we were in a constant catch-22, when we would work hard over the weekend to produce something for Monday's studio, and Martin would be pleased and would ask for a new model and drawings for Thursday, but then we would have to do the work for all the other classes between Monday and Thursday and wouldn't have time to make a new model for studio--so then Thursday's review would be a disappointment, and we'd go back to working really hard for Monday, and so on. There were also times during the semester when it seemed clear that Martin had an idea in mind of how he imagined our projects, and when we veered away from that idea, he was unhappy. (His ideas were usually better and conceptually stronger than what we were coming up with.) It would have been useful to have more open conversations in that regard, so that we wouldn't just be guessing what he was thinking. I think that this approach, rather than keeping us from developing our own ideas, would encourage us to think about the project on a deeper level. Overall, however, I was impressed by the quality of work in our studio and I felt as though each of us had considered what was \"at stake\" our work, which in the end is a testiment to Martin's teaching.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0With each discussion and review I had with Martin, I felt thathe had a wealth of knowledge and experience to share with us, but was not always completely forthcoming. He is quick to point out what elements are not working in a project, but is less quick to explain why or how to change them. I would have been receptive to more concrete, clear guidance. Although he is very encouraging of exploring further, at times, I felt discouraged by his critical approach.Being as objective as possible, it seemed that Martin worked his section more than other critics. Finding our entire section in the studio at all hours of the night and day, when all other students had left was not unusual. Rather than working by positive reinforcement, I felt that I was constantly operating under pressure.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Martin has been a very, very good critic. His main strength is without a doubt his perceptibility and ability to pick up on where the student is going with their project, and critiquing it from that point of view.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Martin Cox is arguably the best critic in terms of his ability to give feedback which positively progresses a student's project. Though he is often slow to express his ideas, they are almost always well thought out and to-the-point. His ideas are cogent and accessible, which is perhaps one of his greatest assets as a critic. The references or projects that he suggests are typically meaningful and very helpful to the development of the work.There were several occasions in which it might have been interesting were Mr. Cox's feedback to be slightly less pragmatic. It may very well be a function of the requirements of the first year design studio, but sometimes his criticism felt restrained. Similarly, there were instances in which a slightly heavier hand (so-to-speak) would have helped the motivation of the class or certain individuals.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Martin is a mind reader. He is not only great at discussions of projects in their own terms, he also knows how to work with each student\u0092s strengths and weaknesses. He is quick at pointing out the essence of any design strategy \/ problem, and knows how to guide the students through focused explorations. He is extremely inspirational and encouraging. My improvements throughout this semester were critically linked with his teaching. I truly appreciate the consistently high standards he sets out for each one of us. He really cares for every student\u0092s projects and personal growth.One suggestion is that sometimes more explicit communication is necessary depending on the individual in order to avoid any misunderstanding.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0SUNIL is a wonderful critic, who believes in his students enough to allow them the space to explore and learn and grow and test THEIR ideas (not his). This was empowering.However, I feel that he should give a little more resistance, because we come to grad school to be challenged. If we leave grad school producing architecture in the same way we did when we arrived, then what was the point?Aside from this,I feel that Sunil is a good critic.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0I think that Sunil\u0092s main strength was also at times a weakness. Because he does not want to get in the way of ones ideas, I think at times he can allow things to go too far down the wrong track. I know there were times during the semester when he did not agree with a direction a project was taking, but did not voice that opinion. I appreciate the ability to pursue my own course, but every once in a while it would have been nice to have him say \u0093I don\u0092t think this is a good idea.\u0094 But again, I think this was also his strength at times, as he was always incredibly supportive and encouraging.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Main strenght: ability to grapple with a multiplicity of ideas and re-network those ideas to illuminate further possibilities for a project. That was an incredible resource.Greatest weakness: it is not a true weakness in that it provided room for further possibilities, but the ambiguity provided in direction and instructions made for many confused crits. It did lead to some hamstringing of ideas, however this did incourage individuals to think for themselves clearly and in a strong way.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Overall, Sunil was an excellent design critic. He encouraged students to think for themselves and to develop their own design interests and methodologies. My biggest criticism of Sunil's teaching strategy would be that he is too elusive when giving feedback. Working with Sunil would have been more advantageous if he gave clearer, more succinct criticism.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0Sunil was absolutely the best critic at not imposing himself on students' projects. He is excellent at reading your interests, strengths, and weaknesses. He also is confident in himself so that he limits his comments to what he knows will be helpful, rather than spewing all his thoughts and hoping something sticks as some of the other critics tended to do. He seemed genuinely interested in helping us develop our ideas and design methods rather than molding us in his own image.Sunil could however be too receptive, and it sometimes would have been comforting to hear his opinions expressed more forcefully: whether we had sufficient work, whether we were doing something wrong, etc. A little more tough-love would have been nice, but not too much, because we loved that Sunil was approachable, supportive, and critical without being judgmental."

    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I felt that a greater adherence to precedents (especially in the second and third projects) would help to reduce tabula-rasa anxiety and yield more focused, productive work.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0More emphasis on studio.Move studio to a day that does NOT fall on the same day as Eisenman's class, even if it means moving it to Friday.Tweaking and adjusting the 1 week assignments by making them shorter and more relevant.Coordinating with visualization more.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Please see my response to question 5.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0Studio could benefit from a little more focus on concepts. The programs could be refined to help focus the projects and clarify many of the questions that ate into the short project schedules. Also the scheduling of the studio could be reworked to maximize the limited amount of meetings with the studio critics.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I think the studio is run properly for a first year first semester class. It explores large architectural themes, compatible for those with and without backgrounds in the field.I did feel the jump from the second to third project a little overwhelming, given the fact the amount of time we had was pretty much the same (including Thanksgiving). Consequently the work felt rushed.Deliverables for each project were a little rough, but the openness of those requirements were flexible and adjusted as we went on. This is an important aspect to keep \u0096 to know that even the studio is a working model is valuable.Juries were good, but uneven. Some review groups were stronger than others.The week intro projects are interesting and should be worked on for next year. They feel like ways to jumpstart a project, but sometimes they felt misguided. Tuning up the transitions from the week project into the work needs realignment since often, it felt unresolved.",
    "Instructor: Benjamin Pell \u00a0I think that studio was pretty good overall, but would suggest a couple changes. First, as previously mentioned, I would start the sequence with a smaller project. Second, I would have studio and Eisenman\u0092s Formal Analysis class on different days, because I felt my studio production really suffered on Thursdays.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0limit intro exercises to 1.Note: I appologize if these responses are brief but the computer timed out my previous session and I have had to regenerate them a second time from memory. This was very, very frustrating in that I had really taken a long time to put forth thoughtful responses which were essentially just erased. If it is possible please remove the time out feature from the eval software. Thank you.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0It would be great if the 5 studio critics could switch studios for one or two desk crits each semester. It is often helpful to get another person to look at the project before presenting it at the final review. Often ideas that other critics give at the final review are enticing or would have been a great direction to explore, but unfortunately the student didn't get to hear it until the very end. Also each critic offers different expertise and having one or two look at a project before the final would bring a great level of resolution to each student's project.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0Eliminate the one week exercises. They waste more time than they do good. Just keep it simple. Give us good examples to look at on our own, take us to the site and have us document and think about ideas, then ask us based off of the precedent study and site visit in what direction we what to take our project. The chosen sites were amazing and I wouldn't change them. They proposed unique challenges thatforced us to really think about the site and how to deal with it.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0My suggestion is to have critics \"rotate\" through the studio rather than just stick to their own section. In terms of my own education, I feel this would be both more informative (exposed to multiple viewpoints) as well as more fair (evaluation would be determined by several people, not just one). This is how my undergraduate studios worked, and I found it very effective. We had a chance to hear from several critics instead of just one, and by the end of the semester, all of the critics were all familiar with everyone's work.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Wei Leung \u00a0There is simply too much emphasis on production, and while I understand that it is sometimes helpful to \"think by making,\" the short amount of time given to each deign project (only a few of weeks after the obligatory precedent studies and program analysis) is not enough to truly develop ideas, which should be the emphasis in graduate school.Try to double check the numbers (square footage requirements, drawing scale requirements, etc.) that are on the project handouts. Sometimes these were grossly off. If the instructors do not take the time to double check their figures, it makes the entire project seem ill-conceived and undercuts confidence in the project as a whole.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0The scheduling is not conducive to good designwork. Having so much time pressure makes it difficult to resolve anything.I believe the experience of the teaching staff is inadequate, and we should be taught by people with more experience in nurturing beginning designers.Assignments and scheduling needs to be better organized. Giving out assignments without first contemplating whether or not the given scale requirements are practical is not respectful of our time and energy.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0If it is necessary to have \"introductory\" project such as the first tectonic project, it needs to be more architectural and have more substance. Without program or meaning, there is no reason to do anything, which allows anything to be done, which we were then scolded for. The second project as a landscape project presents a much more complex project than it was given credit for. Neither the time or the approach was appropriate. The site was too large for the program, leading to superfluous design moves. The third project as an addition is also much too complicated for the scheme of things and the time we were given. An addition is harder than a stand-alone building, and this consideration did not seem to be acknowledged. However, I enjoyed the program and the limitations.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0This semester would be greatly improved by having more experienced critics. Joyce seemed to only be able to give one specific type of criticism. If we wanted to have a productive desk crit, it was up to us to present material in a way thatshe would be able to respond. Especially in first semester, it is important that a critic be able to engage each student in their individual way of working and at the level of the development of their project. Had we had a more versatile and open-minded critic, our section would have spent less time trying to figure out what Joyce wanted and more time developing projects in a way that was productive for ourselves.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0In general, the structure of the studio was productive and challenging. The only weakness was the one-week introductory exercises, which could be improved to allow for greater freedom and integration with the entire project. Additionally, due to the intense workload and hectic pace of the studio, it is imperative to have critics with extensive teaching experience who can help us maximize our development and productivity. It often seemed that some of the critics were not able to help us maximize our potential.",
    "Instructor: Joyce Chua Hsiang \u00a0I would suggest alongside an exit interview, to have an entrance interview, to gauge what student's hope to gain through the course - what their weaknesses and strengths are. This might help guide the critic in what and how they challenge the student's work and thinking processes, and would provide more targeted direction that is valuable to students.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0It's an intense semester, and at times students find themselves under extreme pressure and unable to perform at their best. Honestly, I don't think this is due to the quantity of work or the speed of which the three projects are carried out, but rather the detailed organization and the instructions of these projects. The timeline of these projects could be improved, so that there is more time and emphasis is available towards the end. The short exercises at the beginning should be even shorter and more to the point. No more misleading requirements such as scales of the study models, as students AND their critics could better use their time and energy to more productive work.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0The more opportunity we had for programmatic requirements, the easier it was to form some \u0093resistance\u0094 to our design exploration. I would suggest more concrete program, not less, since students will always ignore whatever aspects they want in their final design.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Two projects rather than three.",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0The hand-drafting requirement for the first project was unhelpful. In a limited time-span of production, churning out hand-drawings simply took time we did not have.If the reason is to align the visuals of the presentation between students of a variety of backgrounds, I would argue that students should instead start pushing their digital skills so as to be able to produce good presentations at an earlier stage. Why waste one cycle of drawing production in hand-drafting? Why not learn what they will use throughout their education as soon as possible?",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Either remove the introductory component of each project, or cut down the number of projects from three to two. Perhaps it is my own architectural immaturity, but it never seemed that there was more than one or two weeks invested in a 'final product,' and the course was longer than six weeks... I would love to have the first project be a one-to-one scale object, which would have been very different, but would be very accessible to everyone and would situate the designer's (student's) accountability.Any of the other improvements I would suggest would be predicated upon the separation of those WITHOUT architectural experience from those WITH architectural experience. It seems unfortunate to me that so much energy is expelled in designing the curriculum to straddle between these two groups while truly accommodating neither.-k. schmeck",
    "Instructor: Martin Cox \u00a0Since learning should be the first and foremost goal in this and any studio course, driving students to extreme exhaustion may not be the ultimate teaching strategy. What we gain through clear-headed participation in lectures and proactive approach to design work can be much more productive and enjoyable. It would be beneficial to place balanced emphasis on both production and critical thinking.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0More time for projects and related to this, more theory, more history (precedent) integrated.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0As I said above, I think we spent too much time on analysis for such short projects.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Bald \u00a0The TA's tutorial sessions should not drop-off at the end just as they are beginning to reach the new and helpful material - lack of attendance at the beginning was not due to lack of interest in the sessions but rather lack of novel information.The level of coordination between sections was perfect - not too different, but not too restricted by the coordinator.Studio instructors should be architects who know what they are doing, not ones who are still figuring themselves out and using us as exploratory tools and sounding-boards. We should be learning architecture straight from the first semester, notfumbling until second or third."
