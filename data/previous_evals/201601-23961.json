    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I felt I learned quite a lot about other African contexts and had the space to intellectually engage with new ideas concerning what constitutes a city. Even students who came in with little to no knowledge about African cities, I felt their particular disciplinary perspective enriched our discussion and allowed each one of us to consider other questions and perspectives in a meaningful way.",
    "This is a literature seminar looking at urban theory and city life in Africa.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. There is a very heavy work load but it is very interesting and worthwhile."

   "comments": [
    "I could not have asked for a more perfect course to be offered in relation to my dissertation topic and research. Though this course was offered outside my department, no other department has a course that has the perfect cross-section of a topic that covers the topic of cities and my particular geographical area of study through an atypical but interdisciplinary approach that very much draws from both the social sciences and the humanities. It is a rare combination to find, but one that was perfect for what I plan to do with my own dissertation.",
    "This course gave me an interdisciplinary opportunity to look at life on the continent through fictional literature and non-fiction theory, which is informative and helpful for getting out of my discipline's bubble.",
    "This course was crucial in finding useful information for my research. The course provided two helpful workshops on newspaper research and interview methods. Because of the course (and Steph, of course!) I got the opportunity to meet with two fantastic scholars who will be extremely helpful in my future research.",
    "I learned so much about urban Africa and was introduced to various genres within African literature"
