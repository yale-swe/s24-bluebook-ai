    "What more could you ask from a course? You learn about human origins and how all forms of life came to be.",
    "This was one of my favorite courses at Yale. I learnt all about how life evolved on earth through a sequence of major changes in its environments, geographic boundaries, climate, biomes etc. I learnt how to interpret fossil evidence and use evolutionary theory, stratigraphy, biology etc. to examine hypotheses in paleontology. I finally learnt with humility where we as homo sapiens sapiens fit into the very tiniest last portion of the history of life, and how we are affecting its entire future",
    "I learned a lot about the history of life on earth that I'd mostly touched on in previous classes and during my \"Paleontology phase\" as a child, but had never really acquired a full understanding of, and I'm glad I took this course because I finally understand the basic relationships that tie together all living things. I'm not sure how much of what I learned in this course I will actually remember, because a lot of it I sort of just stuffed into my head to prepare for the exams, but I was interested enough in the topic that I think some of it will certainly stay with me. This is a topic regarding which I think it is important for us all to have some basic level of understanding, and I feel like more people should take it.",
    "I think I learned a lot of random information about the species of the past and how geologists use the fossil record to investigate past life. The climate history was the most interesting part for me, and it followed a narrative and the information can actually be used in other parts of my study.",
    "This course provides a thorough introduction to the history of geologic time. It focuses on the evolutionary, biological, and mineralogical processes that have worked in tandem across time to create the world we live in today, and the scientific evidence that fossils hold within them.",
    "How to think about the development of life on earth.",
    "I learned a lot about evolution and paleontological methods, as well as some aspects of global climate and hypothesis testing.",
    "I did not gain any knowledge. I did not understand anything that went on in this class.",
    "Gives a really interesting and comprehensive overview of the development of life on Earth and its different stages. I really enjoyed this class, even though I wasn't a STEM major. Midterm is very tough, but grading on the paper is more lenient and final is somewhat easier than midterm. That being said, definitely not an easy A.",
    "I learned a lot of knowledge about paleontology and the tree of life.",
    "A greater understanding of the development of life throughout known history from simple to complex organisms. Knowledge of the tools we used to deduce the information we have about extinct ancient organisms. A better understanding of the tree of life and the relatedness of all extinct and extant organisms.",
    "This class is a very interesting survey course for those interested in paleontology. I came into the class with absolutely no background knowledge and had never been exposed to the discipline before. The lectures were not very engaging unfortunately but once I studied for the midterm exam and again for the final, I felt that I had actually learned quite a lot about paleontology. The professors are extremely knowledgeable and experienced in the field but this does not always translate in their lectures. I spent every class frantically scribbling notes for 75 minutes but, even so, still missed a lot of the content and needed to work with a large group in order to study for the exams.",
    "We covered general knowledge of the evolution of life on earth and gained an appreciation for the multidisciplinary nature of piecing together an accurate picture of life. We also learned about different warring theories about several extinctions and were encouraged to think critically about these and about scientific papers."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Poorly organized, exams were too detail-oriented for the massive breadth of the course material, and the teaching styles of the three professors clashed wildly",
    "This class had three of the best lecturers I've ever had at Yale. Great at showing how life came to be what it is today and helps put humans in perspective of the world's history.",
    "Strengths: -Amazing cast of professors and TAs in terms of knowledge, ability to teach, caring and patience. They all went out of their way to answer several questions after class, show us the labs etc. -A great breadth of topics compressed into a short time frame Weaknesses: -The material is fantastic, but I wish it was rearranged a bit; while keeping in mind the more detailed Vertebrate Paleontology course offered in the fall. -Too much time spent on the pre-cambrian\/cambrian period of life and invertebrates which made the pace quite slow before spring break -Wish first 3 lessons on fossils should be compressed into 1 -lessons 5-8 on pre-cambrian\/cambrian life compressed to 2 -lessons 9-10 on paleozoic life compressed into 1 -lessons 11 & 19 on extinctions compressed to 1 -the remaining lessons dedicated to deeper look at the larger invertebrates and all vertebrate biota (dinosaurs, mammals, fishes etc.)",
    "Given that it's impossible to really cover the history of life in a representative fashion in a single semester, the course did a good job in terms of what it chose to focus on. However, I was a little surprised at the omission of several key topics, such as the land arthropods (insects, arachnids, etc.) and the amphibians. Furthermore, some of the lectures were less organized than I would have liked -- lectures sometimes jumped forward and backwards in time without warning, there weren't always logical connections between different parts of each lecture and sometimes lectures felt too much like a \"laundry list\" of different fossilized organisms with no overarching theme discussed to really tie it all together. To some extent, though, this may just be the nature of the field - there isn't always a clear, concise story to tell.",
    "Has a lot of interesting course material. I thought the final and midterm were very challenging. There is a ton of info for the tests, and it's easy to get behind during the year and have to devote a lot of time studying over reading period.",
    "There is not enough guidance or support or information given in this course. Some of the lecturers are more clear than others, and there are no Office Hours. It would be helpful to have set office hours with the TAs so that we could ask the questions we have regarding unclear lectures and the research paper. I didn't even know who my TA was or if I had a TA.",
    "I saw no strengths in this course. The lectures were not only very boring but left the students more confused than when they came into class. No materials were posted about how to prepare for the examinations etc...",
    "What I loved about this course was how it was tied to present day phenomena, and how we can use past paleoclimates and trends in the fossil record to predict the future. The professors also tied in the story to Yale's in-depth involvement in creating the fossil record that we know today through archaeological digs and the discoveries of the Peabody Museum.",
    "Very interesting lectures, lots of cool material but sometimes hard to distill what the important information fro each meeting is.",
    "It'd be better if there were more assignments spread out over the course of the semester, rather than having grades weighted so heavily on the midterm (worth 25 percent) and final (worth 46 percent). Also, it feels like it'd be fair for the midterm to be moved up at least a week this year, we took it the day before the drop deadline",
    "The lectures, especially of the second half of the course, were extremely interesting, and all professors of this course were engaging and super passionate about the material they were teaching. There could be more ways to engage with the material and truly understand it throughout the semester, perhaps with group exercises within lecture itself or more engaging sections.",
    "Very poor organization. Lectures have no information and I don't learn from looking at pictures so bad experience with this.",
    "The teaching by all three professors was extremely well done. Bhullar is a rising star, Briggs is already a legend. I don't have any major suggestions for how it should be changed, except perhaps giving more of an indication of what to study for the midterm, because I know that freaked a lot of people out.",
    "Very confusing lectures for people with no background",
    "I think the weaknesses is that it is SUPER memorization heavy. I would have liked to see more trends and concepts unifying the factoids that we learned, I felt this way especially around exam time. But the strengths are that it is really interesting and all three lecturers are really stellar.",
    "This course offers a rich and fascinating look at the many different environments that have characterized this Earth since its creation. It's at times unbelievable and at times tedious and at times moving, and so is the class. I am very glad that I took it. The strengths lie in the professors themselves, who are wonderful lecturers and deeply passionate about their fields. I found my one frustration with the class was the PowerPoints themselves. The class covers a huge, huge volume of information, but the slides only contain a bare-bones sketch of the major themes of each lecture, and even though I attended almost every single lecture (apart from when I was ill), I found the slides incredibly hard to study from or understand, really. Around exam time, that's crucial, and it was frustrating to have to look so many things up online. I wanted to conceptualize this life history as a big story and could not piece it together in that way. I imagine the slides were made like this to discourage people from skipping lectures, but for the many of us who did attend, I felt a bit overwhelmed by the gaps in my understanding. I also didn't feel like there had been sufficient opportunities to do group reviews to prepare for the very heavily weighted exams.",
    "This course is great because of the content. For people interested in evolution and biology more generally, this course is unique because it is such a specific field and teaches you to look differently at the world around you. Unfortunately, the class was not taught very well - the professors had to get through so much content and as a result the lectures always felt rushed. I would leave class not having digested any of the information given to me - all I could do was write it down and then learn it by myself before the tests. The professors did make themselves available to students for the most part, but the class itself often felt disorganized and not always engaging.",
    "I think the course's strength is that the material is very interesting and fun to learn about, but it is daunting that there was just so much to learn. The style of grading also made it difficult because you basically had to just memorize half a semester for each exam, with not much other feedback during the rest of the semester besides the paper. I think having occasional problem sets or reading responses would have helped solidify material as we went along instead of cramming at the last moment, as well as give us another form of grade input."

   "comments": [
    "Everyone should take this course! Science majors to have a foundational knowledge of evolutionary biology and how information is derived from the fossil record. Social science and humanities majors to show the scale of humans compared to the history of the world. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The invertebrate information, can be a little dry as time goes on, but stick with it. It's all worth it in the end!",
    "Absolutely! It was so much fun!",
    "Take it if you're interested in the topic, otherwise you may regret it. Lectures can be a little disorganized and scatterbrained; some are pretty good, others not so much. No real regular work such as problem sets or reading responses, and there's actually hardly any reading, but there are two exams and they are not a walk in the park, so you really do need to make sure to study. There's also a fairly low-commitment research paper, which adds a bit to the workload. Take-home message is proceed with caution - I personally enjoyed the class, but if you're taking it just for the Science credit or you think that it will be a gut class, then you should probably look elsewhere.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in these types of classes and if you can devote the time to staying on top of all the readings and studying for the exams.",
    "This was a great geology course that makes the processes of fossilization, mineralogical deposition, evolutionary biology, and scientific history very accessible and fun to explore.",
    "This class... rocks.",
    "If you're interested in the material, take it! The first half is a little less engaging than the second, just due to the nature of the material of the very early history of life, but the second half is so interesting.",
    "Gives a really interesting and comprehensive overview of the development of life on Earth and its different stages. I really enjoyed this class, even though I wasn't a STEM major. Midterm is very tough, but grading on the paper is more lenient and final is somewhat easier than midterm. That being said, definitely not an easy A. Take this if you want to destroy your creationist friends in future arguments, or you just want to learn more about evolution\/the dinosaurs\/etc.",
    "This course has three professors who are all really cool and friendly. The lectures were often difficult to follow though, and I took this because I had to for EVST. I definitely didn't like the class, but it was good for what it was I guess.",
    "I would recommend this course the exams are kind of scary because there is so much information but I get the feeling that there is a curve and it all works out. But you leran a ton and it's very interesting. It's a good science course for someone who doesn't necessarily love stem since it's very descriptive (not concept-heavy) but also you learn a lot and the lecturers are all SUPER engaging, there lectures were really great.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student with the caveat that there is an extraordinary amount of memorization for the exams, and though the professors stress that they won't get too specific and will emphasize general themes and concepts, the level of specificity is daunting. Having said that, take it for a well-taught and eye-opening look at the very long and rich natural history of this planet. It's so much more than just the dinosaurs.",
    "I am a non stem-major who LOVED this course, because I genuinely learned so much that is somehow relevant, despite being beyond my area of expertise. Did I enjoy the midterm and final? Not at all. That being said, it was my favorite lecture all semester, and I wouldn't miss it for the world. If learning is still something you put first: be bold, but you can safely Credit\/D this wonderful introduction to the History of Life! The profs are great and love what they teach!",
    "Yes. Though difficult, the content of this class was extremely interesting, and was delivered in some of the best lectures I've experienced at Yale to date.",
    "I probably would not recommend this class to anyone who does not have a serious interest in paleontology. I took this class to fulfill a major requirement and without a passion for the subject it is very hard to find motivation to work and engage with the content. If you love geology or evolutionary history, this is surely the class for you because we learn so much about both invertebrates and vertebrates!",
    "Yes, but it is not really a gut science, and it is easy to get blind-sided by the exams if you do not keep up with reading. If you are interested in the subject, take it."
