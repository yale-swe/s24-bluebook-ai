    "I recommend spanish 132 to anyone who is around spanish at home, but has grammar issues, or problems speaking it formally. It's a great class! Professor Sybil is awesome.",
    "Please take this class. You will get a decent grasp of Spanish grammar and you will be taught by one of the most passionate and helpful professors at Yale. The work and comments are individualized so you'll get an experience catered to helping you!",
    "An excellent course for students wishing to gain better reading, writing, and grammar abilities. The whole class is conducted in Spanish, which really helps for speaking and understanding. Also, the workload is manageable but helpful and the instructor is fantastic.",
    "If you are a heritage student, take this class! The speed of my speaking ability has improved, as well as my comprehension and vocab. I am sure that this class is better for heritage students than the other language classes, because the professor really works to cater to our needs. So glad there is another semester of this class!",
    "This is a must take for heritage speakers!",
    "Yes, this class is perfect for heritage speakers. If you had exposure to Spanish in the past (whether through relatives or lots of traveling) but haven't studied it much academically, this class will probably be a good fit for you."
