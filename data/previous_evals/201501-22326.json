   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this course, and for anyone interested in photography or digital media, this is a great look into the development of photography and its early pioneers.",
    "I would recommend the content but I would suggest a student evaluate whether the organization of this course would work for him or her.",
    "No, not until they figure out a better structure for the class, and the professors actually take time to help prepare the students for the exams.",
    "History of Photography is a very interesting class if you have any interest in photography or early photography. The class covered both history and more conceptual aspects of the art form as well as its philosophical implications through incredibly interesting readings and lectures.",
    "This class exposes you to great photos and interesting readings. It assumes you are comfortable with art history analysis and while this can be learned, as a non-art history major I wasn't quite sure what was expected of me at first.",
    "19th Century Photography shares a wealth of information about the history of photography and the people who played a role in its development. The class examines how the subject matter of photography changed as well as how styles and thinking evolved. The class is easily understandable by non-majors."
