    "Only take it if you need to or if you are a total masochist",
    "Easy class if you have taken AP Bio recently, much more difficult if you have not. Don't take if you are looking for a true introductory biology course as this class is much more geared towards bio majors and premeds.",
    "It is a very basic intro biochem and biophysics course that likes to teach through example.",
    "I would definitely recommend Biology 101 to another student. It is a fantastic intro course the the biological sciences with a manageable course load and multiple ways to learn your material (whether by book, lecture, Piazza, section, or just student groups). It helps students brush up on AP Biology before they move onto to other Biology sections.",
    "The only part of concern is the grading structure of the quizzes. I feel like they were very key phrase based instead of looking for holistic understanding in responses. Also the sentence limit was unnecessary. Perhaps just do space limiting because the use of semicoplons voids it's effectiveness",
    "Biology 101 is a big lecture course, so you have to keep that in mind. Obviously, it is essential for those who are Pre-Med or science majors and it gets the job done. The lectures are pretty boring, but the information presented is clear. Take the class if you have to for a requirement but otherwise I would skip it.",
    "Do NOT take it!! They claim that it is an into course but it isn't!! I had not taken AP Bio in high school and was completely lost in this class.",
    "Take it since you have to.",
    "Nope. Find alternative pre-reqs if possible and don't even think of taking this as a science credit. Stay away!",
    "Yes I would recommend it because you learn the material well. It is a good intro course. Although I took IB biology in high school and felt very confident in my knowledge, I am so glad that I took Bio 101 because you learn more in depth than in high school. I think it prepared me well for other science classes.",
    "Biology 101 01 is too big of a class made of students who have taken and done well on the AP exam and others who have only taken intro bio in high school. I would NOT recommend this course (as someone who has taken ap bio) if you are expecting to learn anything new. Unfortunately, most people have to take this b\/c of major requirements. Getting a decent grade is not difficult (esp if you have taken AP bio). Unfortunately (again), grading is REALLY nitpicky and seems sometimes arbitrary.... The class is too big; TA wouldn't even meet me for office hours, instead referring me to the piazza for any questions I had.",
    "It was a fairly quick paced class. Hopefully, with some changes it will be better paced. I feel like they tried to squeeze a lot of information into just half a semester. I would recommend the class if the student was trying to learn a lot in a small amount of time, but that also might hinder the student since there is a lot to swallow in a small amount of time.",
    "It's a science course that requires a lot of work, and though it is not necessarily difficult to understand, expect a lot of confusion ESPECIALLY if you have never taken AP Biology before.",
    "This course was a good overview of biology. I took AP Biology senior year of high school and got a 5 on the exam, so this course seemed partly a review of the year's worth of material. However, this course also goes more in-depth with the material and taught me about new research methods. The lectures were engaging, interesting, well-organized, straight-forward, and informative. It might benefit from making more course tutors available for students with less of a background in biology.",
    "No. This class should only be taken by those you need it for a major\/premed. If you are interested in taking a biology class for fun and have ever done biology in high school, take a higher level class. This class doesn't really teach you anything new andis extremely boring.",
    "Only take Biology 101 if you have to. The most plausible reason you're looking at this course is because you're an intended biology major with the hopes of being pre-med. Go for it for that reason and that reason only. It's a terribly boring class that moves very quickly with little help at all. Professor Koelle (should he be teaching this section again) is an atrocious professor who merely reads off of the slides. Save yourself from suffering and only take this if you absolutely have to.",
    "Good way to be introduced to bio, however not fully an introductory level course. Students came in with a wide variety of backgrounds and I would have liked if it had been more organized to start with the basics of biology.",
    "I would recommend it because it is very organized.",
    "I would summarize it as an in depth biology class that covers a lot of different material. However, if I was talking to someone who is starting the sciences i would not recommend the course because it is not so much an intro course but rather an extremely detailed and challenging class if you are not already familiar with the class.",
    "BIOL 101 is definitely a do-able intro level course. I would recommend it if you have to take it. I wouldn't say this is a fun course by any means, but if have to take it, take it.",
    "You'll probably have to take this class for any science related major and though annoying, the quizzes are a good incentive to study so that you're not overwhelmed by the final.",
    "Take this class under the following conditions:1)If you're pre-med2) You're (seriously) considering a Biology majoror 3) Biology is what you absolutely love.If you're just taking it for some kind of science credit, other classes in the sciences offer credit and are already refined. This class still needs some kinks to be worked out before it can be well integrated into the larger community.Or shop it, of course. You'll know if it's right for you at that point.",
    "I would recommend it if you're thinking of majoring in biology, but only because it is a requirement. If you're not going to major in biology, it is not an extremely interesting class and isn't worth the work you'll have to put into it.",
    "Don't listen to the whiners! Take the bio series, its fun and not that hard.",
    "Yes only if theyre ready to do a lot of studying with it though because it is really rewarding.",
    "Please do not take BIOL 101 if you are not required to do so. If it is a prerequisite, then you are stuck with it, so take it. If you have taken high school Bio, this course will be rather redundant. However, the course comes with its own set of challenges. Paying attention in class can be difficult. Sections were not that helpful as well.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who's interested in biology, but doesn't know whether he or she wants to be a bio major. For those interested in majoring in biology, this class is probably too simple and might deter them from getting into more advanced,interesting, relevant topics.",
    "I would recommend Biology 101 to other students. I think Professor Koelle was an engaging lecturer and he made the topics very understandable. If you were disenchanted with bio (as I was) take this course! It'll remind you and show you how cool it is that we're existing right now and raise an appreciation for our bodies and biological processes. Weekly quizzes weren't too hard and kept you on top of the material. Definitely shop it at least!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It was not difficult, and was great for someone who hasn't taken biology in a long time.",
    "Unless you feel like you really are prepared for the work load and fast pace of the course, don't take this class.",
    "yes definitely. you learn a lot and must stay organized.",
    "Really boring. Not necessary to go to class and do well.",
    "Biology 101 is an essential part of a Biology curriculum. It embodies the core material you need to know to develop a greater understanding of Cellular Biology and upwards. I will and have recommended the course to my fellow students.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a good intro bio course that to get basic knowledge however, it may be overwhelming with the huge number of people that are in the class.",
    "Overall, I have to be honest and say that I did not enjoy this class and would not recommend it to other students. First of all, the class size was too large, even for a lecture, so it was often hard to pay attention. The material was well-organized but not engaging and it moved pretty fast. I felt that as an introductory biology sequence designed for students who do not necessarily have any biology background, it was too difficult since the average was skewed high by those who had strong backgrounds already (AP Biology 5, research experience, etc) so it was pretty hard to perform well if you lacked that background. However, this class was for the most part pretty fair, even if not terribly engaging, so if you do the work and pay the effort, it will not be too bad.",
    "The class should be taken for a student pursuing a science major related to biology, but is not an introductory class. Background in AP Biology is really helpful for the class, and I would recommend the class to a biology major.",
    "Biology 101 is a solid introductory biology course, and if you've had some introduction to biology before, you shouldn't find it too difficult. The work isn't too intense, and in my opinion, the tests aren't outstandingly difficult either, so long as you take time to understand the material. I think that it is a class designed to help students succeed. That being said, lectures are sometimes dry, and discussion sections aren't always that informative, but overall, you'll get a good foundation for biology.",
    "I would definitely recommend BIOL101. It is very organized and the usage of an online website for anonymous questions related to the course along with the resources on classesV2 AND the postdocs made it almost impossible to not know the information. This was a great class.",
    "I would recommend this class, as both an introduction to science at Yale and biology. A course easy enough to act as a stepping-stone into biological studies but hard enough to challenge and maintain interest.",
    "This class is a requirement for bio majors. That aside, yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys learning about life up close.",
    "I would say that it was a pretty standard Biology intro course -- very comprehensive, but not particularly challenging. I would recommend it to them if they had not really taken any Biology in the past, and if they needed to take it as a per-requisite for other classes, but not really otherwise, because the material is interesting, but I didn't find the class itself to be so.",
    "I would say its Biology and its Section class which almost feels like another class. I would recommend it; I learned a ton of a lot.",
    "BIOL 101 was definitely interesting. I found it incredibly stressful being in a class full of students who had recently gotten 5's on their AP exams, meanwhile I haven't taken a biology course since sophomore year of highschool - and even that was a joke. It took tremendous work to catch up, and even at the end it was tough to compete with those students who were simply just taking this course for an easy A - a review of material they had already learned. There were tears, stress, and anxiety over the weekly quizzes because it was stressful staying on top and preparing for a quiz on biology material every week as well as staying on top of the material in the rest of my classes. Professor Koelle went slowly to explain concepts thoroughly, and provided demonstrations to supplement the material, which was very helpful. However, the high enrollment (most of the time of students who should have been placed in higher level courses) made this class a more stressful, and worse experience than it needed to be. The placement exam for this class made it nearly impossible to place out, which is unacceptable. In the chemistry department, if students are eligible for a higher level received a 5 on AP) they move on to higher levels of chemistry. It doesn't make sense to have a whole range of levels in one class because neither is benefiting.",
    "It's necessary to take it for many majors, but don't think of it as \"just a prerequisite.\" It's hard and a lot of work.",
    "I would not recommend the class to another student because it's a difficult review class, but I suppose they will have to take it anyway because you can't place out of it.",
    "I recommend Biology 101, but I would advise that they not take it for another year or two so that the directors may improve the course, since its relatively new and still vastly unorganized.",
    "If you took AP Biology, you will probably find Biology 101 easy and boring. If you don't have to take this class as a prerequisite for another class, your major, or graduate\/medical school I would not recommend taking it. There are much more interesting classes you could take instead.",
    "If you've never taken bio before or if you have limited high school experience, try your best to avoid this class. To advertise it as an intro bio course is absurd. It was nearly impossible to keep up with the lectures and weekly quizzes if you'd never had serious biology experience before. This should have been the class that the students that passed the placement exam were put in. By far the most stressful class I've ever taken.",
    "If you want to major in Bio at Yale you don't really have a choice. However, do know there are a lot of flaws in the way this course is set up. If you have a subset of students for whom the entire course is one extended review session, you have a problem. If you're one of those students for whom this course is not one extended review session, then you're going to feel intimidated right from the beginning. Just know that you have to work harder, but you can do it! Hopefully in the future this course will be reorganized to be more fair to all the students involved. Professor Koelle knows his stuff and is very organized.",
    "I would recommend it only because it is prerequisite for more interesting biology classes, which is why I took it. I didn't find it that great of a class on its own, but as a stepping stone necessary to take other things, it wasn't that bad.",
    "Biology 101 is hard, or so I've been told. That said, I found that as long as you are willing to do research into the terms you don't know, and are willing to put some effort into understanding the problems, that the class is entirely manageable. If you didn't take the recommended science credits in high school, it'll be harder for you, but if you did, this class will work for you.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you need to take it as a prereq. I recommend against taking it for fun.",
    "It is an extremely challenging introductory Biology course. You really have to study hard and understand the material to do well in the course. But, you will learn a lot in the class and may be extremely helpful later on in life.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course, but most people have to take it for their majors. If you took AP bio or really any recent biology class, you will already know 90% of the concepts taught. Although Prof. Koelle is very intelligent and put a lot of work into the course, I did not find his lectures engaging since he simply reads the slides.",
    "Yes, it is interesting material and required for some programs of study. If you want a foundation in bio and you want to be able to take the next course(s) in the sequence, then you should take it. It is a bit of a challenge though, which some people may like and others may not.",
    "Biology 101 was crazy in the beginning with 400 students and weekly quizzes and homework. However, it got better later one. Most of the topics were covered in AP Biology except for PCR, DNA cloning and basically the biotechnology unit. I would definitely recommend this class to everyone who has taken AP Biology, but it might be quite difficult for someone who has minimal Biology knowledge. The good thing about this class was that it discouraged memorizing and focused more on understand (I definitely had to memorize more in AP Bio). The homework and the quizzes were kind of challenging, especially with the sentence limit.",
    "It is a VERY hard intro class, but take it as you prereq.",
    "I would recommend the course as long as a few adjustments were made to make it a little less overwhelming. It is not the best course for the absolute beginner in biology. There are a few thing you need to know before you can actually take this course. However, it is not impossible to go into with little knowledge.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in biology.",
    "Bio 101 was an extremely easy and boring course in terms of the knowledge that was presented. The quizzes helped relieve some of the stress of having a cumulative final. I would not recommend it to a fellow student unless they absolutely have to take it for their major\/premed because it was not very informative or engaging.",
    "I enjoyed this module. About half of the material was a review of high school bio concepts; but the material presented in this course was more applicable, interactive, and taught in depth!",
    "Be prepared to work! Quizzes every Monday mean that you'll have to basically study every single day every week, and they are graded very harshly. No answers over 3-5 sentences, and the questions can sometimes be complex,so what most students do is end up writing grammatically incorrect run-on sentences. What I hated was that sometimes even if an answer is right and it makes sense, they still take off points, and if you ask the TA why points were taken off, they usually don't know what to tell you.It is also super easy to fall asleep in this class. There's a lot of material presented in a short time, but definitely take advantage of Piazza!I'd recommend this class for people who want to think about biology on a whole new upper level. This is not your regular AP biology, guys. In fact, it doesn't help if you have had AP biology, you'll be starting at ground zero.",
    "I would not recommend Biology 101 to another student unless they needed it to fulfill a requirement. Although Professor Koelle provided clear information, it was not the most interesting class.",
    "I would recommend bio 101 to another student strongly. i think I really learned a lot. though it was a bit difficult at first, i felt really proud of the material i later mastered. i also liked the format of discussions that was problem solving. i think that added value to my education.",
    "There is no other alternative! I would perhaps have preferred a class where I was not competing with other people who had taken intensive bio before, but that was not possible here.",
    "Yes because it helps to strengthen your basic biology knowledge and to be ready for a higher level course in the future.",
    "BIOL 101 is great if you've taken AP or IB Bio; it will probably be challenging and involve some hard work, but it is doable. If you have not taken AP or IB (or even if you have), it might be useful to get a tutor at the start of the semester, because a lot of material is assumed to be previous knowledge.",
    "The material in BIO 101 is very easy, which can work to your disadvantage. Grading of the final is very strict based on a rubric. If you provide a correct answer that was not explicitly on the answer key, then you will receive few if any points. I would recommend it, but keep in mind that it's a 4 course sequence. The second module is entirely different from the first.",
    "I only took Biology 101 to fulfill a major requirement. If you do not need to take it, don't! I took AP Biology in high school, and I honestly felt more confused coming out of Biol 101 than entering it. The course essentially requires memorization and a long attention span. It may be more worthwhile to read the textbook than to attend the lectures.",
    "If you've taken AP Bio, and manage to exempt 101, I don't think that it's worth taking.",
    "Don't take it just for a science credit. Otherwise, not that bad. It was weekly psets and quizzes. The final makes a difference though, so if your grade is on the border, hard work will pay off.",
    "If you have to take it as a prerequisite, you have to take it. I think most of the people in it were in that position. I think the into bio sequence should be different as the level of prior knowledge in the class varied incredibly. I think how the chemistry does the intro chemistry classes is much better.",
    "Great refresher course of those with a background in biology, but contrary to what the course guide says a background in bio is almost definitely required",
    "Take it as a major requirement. The sections make it bearable.",
    "It's a tough course with a nice curve. You'll learn a lot, and you won't get a bad grade if you put some effort in. I would definitely recommend it to another student interested in science.",
    "Review of basic biology, essentially the AP Bio curriculum. Pretty easy",
    "I would recommend it - I think it's a useful course that is just the right amount of work.",
    "It was all right. It's not a must take class; rather, it's a class you have to take for a requirement. It wasn't super engaging, but not super terrible either. If you don't have to take it, I wouldn't recommend taking it because you should love all the elective classes you're taking at Yale.",
    "This class jumped in head first, with all engines running so to speak. There was very minimal introduction to biology as an area of study and we often lost the big picture because of thefocus on the details. (Though I will admit that Koelle's key points in each lecture were useful.) For this reason, I think the class did a disservice to those with no previous biology coursework. I also thought that the quizzes were unfair in their time restriction. Overall, I am not at all a fan of the new module structure for intro biology--it is trying way way way too hard to cram a lot of new information into far too little time. I also think that those who have taken biology in the past should be separated from those with absolutely no experience.",
    "Biology 101 was very difficult despite the fact that I took AP biology and got a 5 on the AP test. Professor Koelle did not seem to make an effort to make sure that the students knew what was going on and there was no way for students to understand the material if they couldn't get it from their own reading.",
    "I would not recommend Biology 101 to a fellow student unless you have to take it, or if you have much prior knowledge to the subject matter (more so than even getting a 5 on the AP test) so as lab experience and for some reason find the material intriguing. Just know that this class is the furthest thing from an introduction to biology.",
    "It is slightly more difficult than an introductory Biology course, but if you put in the time commitment and work with other students, it is doable.I would recommend it only if it is a required course or pre-requisite.",
    "I would not recommend Bio 101. The class was fairly easy and straightforward, but it one of the most challenging classes just to sit through, simply because it was not engaging or dynamic. Biology is an absolutely amazing subject that everybody should learn about, but taught like this, nobody will want to.",
    "Biology 101 is a fast-paced, comprehensive overview of biochemistry and biophysics (but I would say without much emphasis on the physical aspects). It will be difficult for the student who has had a limited biology background, but still manageable if he\/she uses the many resources available to him\/her. But I would recommend this course who plan on majoring in biology orare considering it. It may help the student decide.",
    "Biology 101 is a challenging introduction to Biochemistry and Biophysics and it allows students to improve their scientific thinking and analyzing skills, especially by understanding the experimentation that was used to prove facts that we accept today. This course requires a moderate amount of reading.",
    "Biology 101 is a good introductory course that covers many of the important topics in biology. Background biology knowledge is preferred, but Professor Koelle and sections as well as the various enrichment resources provide ways for students to understand the material.",
    "It's challenging class but if you spent a lot of time studying and going over the slides, it is doable. For someone who has not taken AP or IB bio, this class may be a bit too confusing.",
    "BIOL 101 is a pretty good class to take no matter your background in biology. I took AP Bio in high school and found that I was already familiar with a majority of the lecture material. I learned a lot, however, by doing the required reading for section each week. You'll be given a research paper to read in advance, and you go around explaining it in small parts whenever you eventually meet for section. In general, Professor Koelle goes into more detail than AP Bio and throws in information from all the relevant ongoing research, which is very important. He also covers some interesting topics like the HIV life cycle in depth. The workload is pretty light but you end up learning a good deal no matter what you've been previously taught.",
    "This class covers basically high school AP Biology course material with a little more intensity in the topics and applications of the processes. Overall a good class to take. The teacher is engaging and helpful in lecture.",
    "I would not wholeheartedly recommend Biology 101 to anyone other than a person needing to fulfill prerequisites (i.e. for pre-medical requirements). However, if you have taken AP Biology and are decently versed with the material, then you will probably find the material interesting and manageable. I personally felt very overwhelmed in the course, particularly by the sheer size. The grading was often nit-picky, and explanations of difficult material were often rushed.",
    "This is a pretty fast-paced course. It covers a lot of material that gets addressed in high school, but Biology 101 does it faster AND in more depth. I would recommend this course, particularly if Professor Koelle teaches it, based on the fact that pushing yourself to do well in a relatively difficult class is rewarding and that the material is interesting -- especially the AIDS unit we did at the end.",
    "This class was incredibly difficult from the perspective of someone who had little to no background in biology. Ddon't take it unless you absolutely have to--and if you have to, make sure to study with people who know what they're doing.",
    "Essentially, BIOL 101 is a very doable introductory biology course that sets you up with a solid foundation for upper level classes (or at least, I feel that it will). I would recommend it; the workload isn't too bad, and I learned a lot from the class.",
    "Relatively painless intro to bio class. Everything you'll be tested on is hypothetically in the lecture slide handouts, so you don't have to do the readings. The material's pretty dry, but Koelle is a good lecturer. But I should mention that people of different levels of exposure to biology had extremely different experiences with this course. There were students with basically no background in biology who really struggled, and students who clearly had a very advanced understanding of the subject who probably shouldn't have been placed in an intro class in the first place. This course didn't necessarily cater to such drastically varying needs.",
    "Biology 101 is a new half-semester, half-credit introductory bio course, part of a four-part, year-long series which introduces students to the topic. I found Biology 101 to be logically organized and executed, with clear materials and expectations. Lecture printouts were provided and power-point slides posted online, making it much easier to both relax during the lectures but also not to attend them (not sure whether this was an ultimate win or not). Problem sets and exams were at fair in content and grading. Professor Koelle was not intimidating and instead very welcoming, although sometimes a bit dry.",
    "Biology 101 is a good class to take for all who are interested in general biology. I would recommend it to any potential science or pre-med major.",
    "If you've taken AP Bio, 101 essentially covers all the same biochem material in slightly more depth. It may be a bit slow for you. If you haven't taken AP Bio, it might be a bit fast for you as the class assumes a good amount of prior knowledge in biology. Unfortunately, practically every science major now has to take it as the placement exam was designed to be almost impossible to pass.",
    "I would recommend the class to those who need to take it. It's not a class you take for the fun of it, although I did learn a lot. I really enjoyed the class and felt like I came out of it with a newfound interest in biochemistry. The lectures were long and boring, but the study guides have everything you need to know.",
    "Bio 101 is a great course to gain a basic understanding of many principles important in biology, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the field.",
    "Biology 101 is a perfect introduction to Biology at Yale. Whether you have taken AP biology or not, this course is great--the professor is awesome, the material is challenging but doable, and you learn so much through out the course of the semester. If you think you are at all interesting in biology at Yale you should take this course!",
    "I would definitely recommend it! This is for students who perhaps have a general interest in biology they'd like to explore without delving too much into the details. Some of the more serious students could be frustrated with how basic the course seems, as much of it is a review of high school biology, but as an intro course this is completely appropriate.",
    "It's demanding but never overwhelming. You learn a ton and it's mostly very important and useful material. Take it if you're willing to work and want to learn, but don't take it if you're expecting a repeat of AP Biology.",
    "Biology 101 is a good course in that it not only builds upon familiar concepts but it relates those familiar concepts to more complex mechanisms of biological function that students would not understand without a strong basic foundation. Keeping up with course material and ensuring that one has a strong understanding of previous information is an imperative part of this course.I would recommend this course to another student. Firstly, it is a mandatory credit for the biology major, and secondly it is not difficult for the average student to understand the material if he or she diligently keeps up with the lectures and supplements the lecture material with the reading material.",
    "Only take it if you have to for a prereq. You learn much more by not going to the lectures and reviewing the slides on your own.",
    "Yes i would recommend this class and I would say it is an overview of some biological systems with an emphasis on homework, quizzes, and an exam.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. You will learn more or less what you covered in high school biology, but with a little more emphasis on chemical processes. The lectures are very clear and the grading is fair. Be sure to listen in section--reading the scientific papers is rewarding but can be tricky, so it helps when the TFs explain the details.",
    "No I would not recommend this course unless you need it as a prerequisite for your major. It is not an easy class and the lectures are boring.",
    "Biology 101 is not the most riveting course I have taken at Yale thus far. It presents itself as a course students need to take, not want to take, and I did not leave class feeling particularly inspired to major in the sciences.",
    "An intro to biochemistry. Do the work. Don't expect a grading curve. A decent class, nothing special. 400 person lecture.",
    "I would recommend Bio 101 for a student who was a Pre-Med or Biology major, but not for someone who doesn't plan on being a science major.",
    "I would recommend this course because it teaches a lot of basic biology that is important for more complicated courses that can be taken later on.",
    "no matter what you do at yale, no matter what your goals are in life, NEVER TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "I think it's a good way to transition into science\/pre-med here at Yale",
    "Biology 101 would be great for any student who has never taken an advanced biology course before and wants to learn the basics. For anyone who has taken AP Biology in high school, this class will be extremely easy.",
    "BIOL101 is an introductory biochemistry class with material that is not too difficult to jump into. However, the only thing holding me back from recommending BIOL101 is the large class size. Otherwise, I would.",
    "Yes - it's a solid introductory course, wish it had been all semester!",
    "Yes. It's a class that you need to put the time into in order to do well. But it's also a class that if you do put the time into it, there is no reason why you shouldn't succeed.",
    "Rule 1 of bio: you complain more about bio than you actually do bio.That being said, the class wasn't that bad if you were willing to sit in a 400-person lecture and put in the effort to actually learn. The workload wasn't heavy at all, and the professor and section leaders were helpful.I wouldn't recommend it, though, unless it's absolutely necessary for your major or they somehow make the class size way smaller. Because huge lectures are awful.",
    "If you took ap bio you will already know a fair amount of the material. Weekly quizzes can e a pain but they ensure that you've learned the material.",
    "This course was basically a review of the topics covered in high school AP Biology--very easy and straightforward, conducted at a very manageable (albeit sometimes sluggish) pace. This is a great class for prospective biology majors who want to review basic bio before entering higher level classes. However, anyone who has had exposure to advanced biology in high school (4\/5 on the AP test, 700+ on the SAT subject) will find this class way too easy, and should place into a higher level course.",
    "Yes, the information was very basic and you don't really have to take notes because all of the information you need is on the lecture slides.",
    "Bio 101 was a good intro course although at times it was difficult because it was assumed you had learned certain bio concepts in the past in high school. It was a fun class to take overall but quite challenging at times.",
    "A lot of the people who take BIOL 101 need it for prereqs, so I guess there's no way around that. And as a prereq class, I would say BIOL 101 is a decent course to take. The class is incredibly straightforward so, as long as you put the time into it it should be fine. Problem sets were relatively easy. The only problem was the incredibly difficult curve and high cutoffs for certain grades.",
    "It's a great intro course to Biochemistry and Biophysics. Though the curve may be a little challenging for somebody who did not take AP Biology, if you do the readings, attend the lectures, and study for the quizzes and the final, you will do well and learn a LOT! I definitely recommend this course for anybody considering a Biology major, or just anyone who like Biology and wants a science credit.",
    "I would recommend it if you are really interested in the sciences. A lot of information comes your way from the beginning of the course and it is hard to catch up once you've fallen behind. It is definitely an intense course but it is not overbearing and as long as you stay on top of the material, you will learn a lot and do fine.",
    "If you're premed or want to go into science you need to take it. If you don't need to take it, make sure you're passionate about the course and don't take it as a filler.",
    "I would recommend it - decent intro to biology",
    "Yes. I would recommend it particularly if you are pre-med or a prospective bio major, but less so if you are just trying to satisfy a science credit because it is still fairly rigorous.",
    "I would say that Biology 101 01 was a boring, yet necessary course. It is a course that you should take to prepare you for the next step, and you are simply going to have to sit through it, if you have not placed out already.",
    "This class is not very much fun and should really only be taken if it is needed for your major\/premed. The weekly quizzes can be annoying because that means every sunday you have to be studying as opposed to just studying for one midterm.",
    "If interested in biology, then definitely take it.",
    "Professor Koelle is extremely well organized and the semester played out to be exactly what was written out in the syllabus. I'm a sophomore whose last experience with biology was freshman year of high school with a bad teacher (not AP), and Professor Koelle was able to explain concepts well enough for someone like me to do well in the class. That said, there are weekly quizzes and a good amount of reading (like in any bio class), which were definitely needed for me to do well. I would definitely recommend the class, but don't underestimate the work you'll have to do. (That's also just generally good advice about any science class around here...)",
    "If you can test out, try to test out. It is not a bad class at all, it just will not be very exciting-- which is in part because of the material and part because of the huge lecture. This classis totally reasonable\/doable though.",
    "This course is a super fast paced overview of topics covered in AP Biology. Topics are not covered in any appreciable depth; I feel like I should have placed out of this course all together (which was impossible due to the hard placement exam). Lectures consist of the professor reading off slides that are posted online, prompting many to simply skip lecture or do other work during the lecture. I can't imagine how this is even an introductory course-- if I had not taken AP Biology, it would have been a great struggle to keep up with the material.",
    "I recommend this class. Bio 101 provides a foundation for all of biology and this class is very good.",
    "Nothing very cool or flashy or special here, but it certainly gives you a good foundation for the rest of biology. It is very useful and not that difficult, so why not?",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to student interested in biology, but the class is not for the faint of heart.",
    "This is a normal bio class. I think the subject matter is pretty easy to understand for people in non-science majors. The only issue was that there seemed to be a lot of people who had taken AP Bio or advanced chem classes, but overall it was really an interesting introduction to Biology.",
    "A pretty comprehensive introduction to biology. Considerably more difficult if you haven't taken AP Bio, but still very manageable. The professors and TFs are helpful and enthusiastic. I would recommend it to students who are at least considering majoring in the sciences\/biology.",
    "Simplest intro Biology course. I didn't take AP Bio in high school and felt comfortable in this class. Professor Koelle did a great job bringing the information into a intro level.",
    "Very manageable class. Study the lecture notes and be prepared to put in a good amount of time on problem sets and preparing for section. Take it if you are interested in biochemisty or biophysics (MB&B) or if you have to as a pre req.",
    "This class is thoroughly unenjoyable. I came out of 101 knowing more or less the same information as I did coming into it - oftentimes the class didn't even cover topics to the depth of my high school AP Biology course. Quizzes and exams were still graded unnaturally strictly, and frequently I got questions wrong for reasons I couldn't understand. Overall, the class is quite easy, but be prepared to be frustrated a couple of times by seemingly arbitrary grading.",
    "It's a good introduction to all the chemistry you'll need for pursuing further more advanced bio classes. Biophysics however felt almost nonexistent.",
    "BIOL 101 is difficult to transition into if it stays the same as it was this year. The slide handouts are very useful to study from, but it is necessary to keep up with the reading assignments to understand everything gone over in lecture. I would recommend BIOL 101 to another student going into the sciences or pre-med, but not necessarily for someone who does not need to take the course.",
    "Just wait five or so years until this course gains some experience. Until then be weary. You wont get much out of it other than a feeling of hopelessness.",
    "Frankly, this is an intro course. It is a pretty monotonous class and it is not a lot of work. If yo have taken AP biology before it will be a breeze. If you do not absolutely need to take this course, I would not recommend it for fun. It is a big lecture course of 400 students were the material is not very interesting.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend the course. It will most likely be different than anything you've taken because it's goal is to get you to think like a scientist more than it is to have you memorize facts.",
    "If you are interested in learning biology from a very rudimentary level, this is a great course. As long as you pay attention to the lectures and do the regularly assigned readings, this class will be very beneficial towards one's biology knowledge.",
    "Biology 101 is a course that covers the structure and function of biological molecules. As an AP Biology student, I was able to comprehend the materials, however I know many students expecting an intro course to biology were unpleasantly surprised. I would recommend this course only because you have to take it to get to the more interesting biology courses.",
    "I would recommend it if the student were truly interested in biology from the start. otherwise i would recommend against taking this course. it was too fast paced and the material on the quizzes were not predictable.",
    "A challenging course for entry, but worth it. I would recommend it because it is important for anyone who wants to take further courses in Biology.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you absolutely have to take it and want to be a biology\/pre-med major. Otherwise, take something else to fulfill the science requirement. However, this class was much better than BIOL 102.",
    "Bio 101 is a huge lecture that is probably more challenging than what I would consider intro-level.",
    "Summary: A review of AP biology that would be too fast for a beginner, and a waste of time for someone who is already familiar with these topics.I would recommend it only to someone trying to fulfill pre-reqs",
    "This was the first year of the class, so I expect it will go a lot smoother next year. Take it if you know you are interested in the sciences. This is a very intense, non-traditional science class that is a really good intro for upper level science classes. If you, like me, are more interested in bio because you like animals and nature, but have never taken AP bio, only take this class if you can fit a hard class in your schedule. I am glad I took the class, but it was almost not worth the time and trouble. Otherwise, consider \"from microbes to molecules\" if it is run again next year...",
    "Even after taking AP BIO I found this class to be useful and challenging. The grading is tough, and in many ways it does not feel like an intro level science class. Be prepared to work hard.",
    "Biology 101 was an excellent introduction to the principles of Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Professor Koelle is an excellent teacher. The course assumes that you are a novice at biology(though having some background is definitely an advantage), and it does an excellent job of providing a background that is necessary for 102 and beyond. The discussion sections were superb in that they really helped to cement concepts learned during the lectures. This course helps the student to develop an intuition about biology, something that is critical for future courses and research. I would recommend this class.",
    "Recommend with reservations. Course material was very interesting. Class size was inhibiting but this and other organization wrinkles will most likely be ironed out after this first year.",
    "Biology 101 01 is just a typical biology introductory course. I would recommend the course to any student who wishes to pursue an area of interest in the sciences or any student who honestly appreciates biology.",
    "Pretty much a repeat of AP Bio. It's your straight forward basic bio review- but pretty easy if you've taken Bio before.",
    "Biology 101 01 discusses all of the basics that you need to know in biology. It also connects these basic principles to modern and current topics like AIDS. I would recommend this course to another student because you definitely need to understand the material in this course in order to do well in any other science class.",
    "Biology 101 is an intro to biochemistry and biophysics that you have to take if you are premed and\/or a science major. It's a pretty straightforward course that can seem a little overwhelming sometimes but is well taught overall. Chances are you're taking it because you have to take it.",
    "This class has only served to turn me off of sciences at Yale. I would recommend it in a few years when the teaching is a little better and the details of the class are ironed out.",
    "I would summarize Biology 101 as AP bio as they are very similar. I probably would not recommend Biol 101 to another student because it felt frustrating to have to relearn AP material at an even less in-depth level. However I think the course would be very helpful to students who haven't taken an AP bio course or something similar to AP bio.",
    "I would not take this class. I feel sorry for anyone who is required to take it for their major.",
    "Great, yes",
    "Basic intro course. Not too difficult. A lot of kids do well so don't expect a curve. Lecture notes are printed out beforehand which contain all the \"key concepts\" you need to know.Quizes and psets every week, so there is a fair amount of work.",
    "Some parts were interesting, though it didn't really feel like an introductory biology course. We went into lots of detail for some obscure topics, then what I thought were important topics, we simply glazed over them.",
    "I would not recommend BIOL 101 to another student. In fact, I wouldn't recommend the entire BIOL sequence to another student until the kinks were worked out. It's a novel idea, but in practice, just ends up too confusing and unsatisfying",
    "Pretty good course and not too difficult if you have taken AP biology. It moves fairly quickly. I found the weekly quizzes to be a little stressful. There isn't a lot of time to do the quizzes. Workload is average or less than average. I would recommend this course.",
    "I would say it's a class that you really don't need to go to if you've already taken advanced Bio in high school.",
    "I would recommend it to another student who is interested in science because there aren't really any other choices for starting in biology (as far as I know).",
    "It's an intro course that I needed to take, but if you don't have to take it, I don't recommend taking it. It was harder than I thought it would be.",
    "This is a fairly light work-load course, especially if you've taken AP Bio before in high school. It might frustrate you with how shallowly concepts are touched upon. If you can place out, you don't take this course. You'll learn a minimal amount at best and it isn't even very good for review. Your time taken up by twice a week lectures and a minimally helpful weekly section could be spent much more productively.",
    "Biology 101 was a great course for learning introductory biochemistry principles. It was a bit boring, but I would recommend it if you're interested in Biology.",
    "Take the course if you'd like to learn the physical and chemical basis of general biology. It's not terribly in depth, but it's interesting enough. This is not a must-take course by any means, however",
    "Professor Koelle is great. The homework is hard, but overall the course is very manageable, especially with an AP Biology background.",
    "Bio 101 is an \"intro\" biology course that is a huge lecture class with a great deal of variation in previous biology experience. Some people in the class have worked in labs, while some have taken AP Biology, while others have only taken regular high school biology. I feel that this difference in backgrounds makes it difficult for the course to fulfill the needs of all the students. For me, the course moved very quickly, while for others I feel that it was mainly review. I felt like I was constantly trying to catch up to the overall understanding that the class had of the material, and I feel that to truly understand You'd have to read the book carefully and internalize at least some of the material through there if You came in at my background level (only basic high school bio).",
    "I would not recommend this as a fun way to get a science credit (which is what I thought it was). If you love biology but don't need to take it, don't take this course! Go read Nature or something instead.And if you're a pre-med or a bio major, you probably don't have a choice in taking this anyway.",
    "If you don't have to take Bio 101, don't do it. However, if you're considering it it's most likely because you have to take it for your major. You're competing against a multitude of premed freshman that make the mean for each quiz ridiculously high. Also the psets and the quizzes tended to be on the difficult side.",
    "Biol 101 is hard for any student, with or without previous study in Biology. The lectures are big and hard to concentrate in. Handouts are very helpful, but limited as quizzes often ask the student to apply certain knowledge to experiment situations. This class is challenging and difficult. Take it only if you are sure you are prepared.",
    "It's a basic introduction to the fields of biochemistry and biophysics. A lot of the material is a retread of AP Biology if you took it in high school, but there is some new material as well. I would recommend it, for two reasons. One is that there isn't really another way to introduce yourself to the field at Yale. The other is that it is a valuable introduction - recovering material isn't always a bad thing.",
    "VERY difficult, not an intro level course.",
    "Yes, take the course if you want a good introduction to experimentally based biology",
    "fascinating material, lecture can get boring, but lecturer overall shows passion and signs of life. Tremendously dorky man.",
    "If you're going to take it, you probably have to. So study the lecture slides closely, most of the material you need to know is on those slides. The life textbook is great and helps supplement the material very well.",
    "Biology 101 was an introductory course on crack. If you don't know anything about biology you can still do well if you ask people for extra help. It wasn't too difficult and you could definitely take it and get an A if you put enough time into it throughout the course.",
    "WARNING STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT.IF THERE'S ANY OTHER OPTION OF TAKING A DIFFERENT CLASS, TAKE IT.1) This is NOT an introduction course. I was fooled to believe that it was. Most of the people in the class have taken AP biology, or some other biology class, like Issues and Approaches, before taking Biology 101. I had not taken biology since five years ago and so I felt like I was already behind everyone after the first few classes. This shouldn't be the case in an introduction to biology course should it? I'm fairly good at sciences and just because I haven't had an prior experience in biology, I feel like I was punished because I didn't have the same opportunities that my other classmates had.2) Why is it a half semester???? THERE IS NO POINT. Keep the class structure the same, but do not divide it up into half semesters. No one in the class is going to take just one half semester. I did because I dropped the class! And I was punished because it was a half semester: the drop period was like a week after the class started. How was I to know that the class would be not an introduction? How was I to know my grades? As a result, I have a W in the class because of poor planning on the biology department.",
    "The size of the class and the nature of it, mostly for pre-med students, was not what I was looking for in a biology class, as someone who is not a bio major\/pre-med. I would recommend this class only to those who A) are passionate about biology and B) are willing to put in a lot of effort relative to an intro level class",
    "yes",
    "It was basically a review of all of AP Biology plus some in only a couple weeks. The class was taught in a very comprehensive way and was pretty easy as long as you paid attention and reviewed the notes.",
    "Yea, it's great if you need it. It's not the most interesting subject matter in the world, but if you need an intro bio class of whatever reason, take it. It's also not that difficult",
    "I would not recommend this course unless it is required. It does not give you a greater understanding of biology.",
    "I was able to take an upper level bio and definitely should have... This is a good introductory course but very repetitive\/basic if you have a stronger chem\/bio foundation.",
    "This is a very basic overview of biology. However, the course was not designed well. There were people, who had taken AP Bio, received a 5 and knew everything already, in the same class as people with no biology experience. This was just not going to work well. Some people didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to show up and could get 100% on every assignment while others would study hours and never receive an A. If you took AP biology\/an equivalent course and learned the material, this class will be an easy A. If you have little\/no biology experience, you will spend a lot of time learning new material and will struggle through.",
    "Bio 101 is a broccoli class. It's not fun, but you have to take it.",
    "Take this class if you have to. Don't be intimidated by all of the pre-meds; I took this class as a sophomore who hadn't taken biology for four years so it was fine. Be sure to do the readings before class because you'll get so much more out of lectures. Take it with Koelle if possible because he's a great teacher and you'll learn a lot. I did feel that I had a solid background in biochemistry after this class.",
    "I would recommend this course, although it is a borderline recommendation. I felt that this course was challenging for an introduction course, seeing as most people have taken AP Biology and have to take these modules.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it! It is not stressful, but you still learn a lot. A great introduction to biology at Yale!",
    "Biology 101 is a very good introductory to biology course. It covers material that is sometimes quite detailed, but only when it needed to be (and not necessarily that much more in-depth than some high school biology classes). It's pace and progression is nothing to complain about, though it is somewhat unusual compared to other introductory biology classes in that it begins outright with the physical and chemical foundations of certain biological processes before covering more macroscopic topics. It definitely helps if you've taken previous courses in biology, but it is not necessary - however, you will have to be studying the material a lot more in order to really understand the concepts (rather than simply memorizing details). Overall, it's a class I would recommend to a fellow student.",
    "I took this course because it was necessary for me to take. It was frustrating most of the time due to the fact that I had a minimal biology background, but overall, the material was not that hard and focused mostly on rote memorization. Professor Koelle is very enthusiastic about the class and the work is not unreasonable.",
    "I would recommend this to another student because it's a great introductory look at Biology, it is reasonable in terms of work, tests, and expectations. An informative, fair class.",
    "If you want to learn some of the basics of MB&B (large focus on proteins), then this is the class for you. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a biological science major and\/or are pre-med, then you kind of have to take this course anyway. Approach it with an open mind and a thirst for learning, otherwise, yea, this course might be hell for you. BIOL 101 had weekly quizzes, weekly psets, and a weekly scientific paper to read and discuss during weekly discussion section.I personally enjoyed taking BIOL 101 and feel like I learned a lot. It was fairly organized for its first time being taught, but this does take into account the ~400 enrolled students. Professor Koelle was very enthusiastic and organized. He pinpointed exactly what he wanted us to understand from each lecture. Having an enthusiastic postdoc for your discussion section was also nice: Sierra was awesome.",
    "Biology 101 provides an introduction to the fundamental principles and applications of biochemistry and biophysics. Beginning with a survey of the forces and macromolecules of biochemistry, this course gradually progresses to more complex topics, including metabolism, the central dogma of molecular biology, and gene regulation.If you are considering this course, you probably have to take it to fulfill premed requirements or prerequisites for your intended major. I recommend beginning the year-long biology sequence as early as possible because completing the modules unlocks a number of more advanced and specialized classes within the biosciences.",
    "Good for pre-med route. teacher was good. weekly quizzes that make it easier to study for final",
    "Bio 101 is a really good class! Koelle is an interesting, organized lecturer, and I left the class feeling like I'd really learned something about biochemistry and biophysics.",
    "Strength: Excellent PowerPoints that cover all of the material that you need to know for the class. These PowerPoints come in handy when studying independently and they make it very clear what information needs to be known. The course is also structured so that your grade does not depend on two tests that are worth a majority of the grade. Instead, there are weekly quizzes, which allow you to make sure that you're consistently on top of the material and not just cramming, and which allow grading distribution to be spread out and more fair. Additionally, one quiz and one homework grade is dropped so if you mess up on one, you know it won't hurt your grade if you are able to make up for it on the rest of yourquizzes and homework\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.Weakness: Unfortunately, Dr. Koelle is a very dry lecturer. He is not at all engaging, does not seem very enthusiastic and was often not able to hold my attention (or my peers') throughout all of class. It is inherently challenging for students to sit through a 75-minute lecture packed with information, but it is even more difficult when the professor is not engaging. Nevertheless, Mr. Koelle did do his job and teach the material and that's, of course, the most important thing. If there were to be a point of improvement though, this would definitely be it.Also, sometimes the quiz graders were looking for very specific answers and did not accept answers that were right if they did not fit what they were looking for. Thus, the grading sometimes seemed narrow-minded and unfair.Side Note: This is course is definitely fast-paced and dense but if you consistently give it the amount of study time necessary, you can do well.",
    "This course needs a lot of work before I would recommend it. The weekly quizzes were a nightmare-- they seemed to be a good chance to review each week's lectures, but even when I felt like I knew the materially solidly, the quizzes managed to hold unpleasant surprises.",
    "If you are a biology major or pre-med , you will have to take this course. It's very straightforward and fair, but not particularly interesting. It does, however, emphasize how biochemistry is used in life-saving drugs and treatments, and i thought that was cool.Professor Koelle was a good lecturer but he mostly just read off his powerpoint slides. sometimes it felt like it wan't necessary to be there (all slides are posted on classes v2).If you are an incoming freshman, make sure you study a lot for the weekly quizzes. There is not much room for error!",
    "Absolutely would recommend it- it's a great overview of biochemistry and biophysics both in theory and in practice",
    "Bio 101 01 was well organized and the assignments were helpful. If you are planning on taking this course in the future, I would suggest getting used to the weekly quizzes and the types of material they cover before it's too late.",
    "The problem with this course was that everyone was that almost no one was able to place out of it. As a result, some people found the course very easy, and others found it difficult. If you have taken A.P. Biology, it is a very goodrefresher on the material. You will learn more pieces to the puzzle than you knew before. The slides and the lectures were very clear and the class pretty fair. However if you have seen the information before then you may find the class dull.",
    "Biology 101 is not like a regular introductory course. Compared to other courses lectures tend to move quickly. Even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken biology before it will be difficult to understand any of the material unless you attend all the lectures and sections. I would recommend this class to any student who is not taking more than one other science course.",
    "I would only recommend this class if he or she needs it for their major. The material is not too difficult.",
    "Only take if you need to. Tough work load. Expect to be playing catch up if you are not right up on your AP Biology.",
    "Overall, BIOL 101 is a solid introductory biology course. Having had AP Bio background, it was especially doable. But even for a student without AP Bio or a similar course, the highly organized format of 101 was very approachable. The weekly quizzes helped break down the material into less-daunting chunks and made sure students had a decent grasp of the information before the mid-semester final. The lectures could possibly be more interesting, but given the material to be covered, they were engaging enough. The problem sets are manageable and graded generously. I would recommend 101 to a fellow student, but students don't have much of a choice anyway since it's a prerequisite for any other biology course.",
    "I would recommend the class with the condition that the student must understand that many other students who have taken similar biology classes in high school are also taking the class and can therefore distort the grading curve. A fellow student must recognize that there are other students who should be placed into higher level biology courses but choose to take Biology 101, which actually makes this class a lot more difficult for newbies.",
    "Biology 101 is a lecture course goes over biochemistry and biophysics. HIV virus is the recurring theme through which the course was taught. I recommend this course if your goal for taking a class is not to receive the best grade, but tolearn.",
    "The material taught in 101 was useful, and Professor Koelle has a clear lecture style that allows students to easily follow what he is teaching, and have a good understanding of the overarching themes of the course.However, the material presented will definitely seem very difficult to some, and too easy to others. Try to get a helpful TA.",
    "An introduction to biochemistry and biophysics- what you would expect from an intro bio course. A significant amount of content, but not overly challenging. I would recommend this class if you're interested in getting a foundation in Bio and know very little.",
    "Biology 101 class is a true into class for people who are serious about majoring in a field that includes aspects of biology. The course is not the most in-depth or exciting course, but you do learn a lot of need-to-know information.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. Make sure you work hard on every quiz though because a point or two could be the difference between two grades and this class is so large and relatively easy that a curve will never push you up.",
    "I would not recommend it to a student who has not done Biology before. They said it is helpful for us but I found it difficult to grasp all the new material and I felt like most of it wasn't explained. Most of the students had done AP Biology before and they thought it was a breeze. So if you've done biology before it's a good class, if not you know you'll have to put in a lot of work.",
    "Bio 101 was rapid review of AP Bio material, with an examination of the HIV\/AIDS epidemic as a real-life example of the general concepts we discussed in the first two thirds of the course. I would recommend this class to another student who either has had AP Bio and would like a refresher course before tackling other bio classes, or to students who haven't had AP Bio but are ready to do the reading, take good notes during lecture, review the work afterwards and take advantage of the great TFs.",
    "Don't take this if you have minimal biology background, you will not do well. If you have to take it for a requirement, then good luck.",
    "It is very different from your typical course. It definitely requires a general familiarity with the biological sciences but nothing in depth.",
    "Bio 101 is a huge lecture class (although I believe this year was a bit of an anomaly because of the changes made in the bio\/premed requirements). Because of the size, it's easy to not go to class or go and not be engaged, but just remember that you get what you put into the class. I would recommend it as a pretty good science class as far as Yale science classes go.",
    "Take 101! It will inspire you to be a MB&B major. It is well taught, well structured, and very interesting. 102 is incredibly disappointing by comparison.",
    "I had not taken AP Biology or AP Chemistry and I still ended up doing really well, so don't be worried about having to compete with hardcore pre-Med kids. As long as you study, you'll bejust fine.It is a straightforward, introductory biology course. The grading is fair, the quizzes are fair (they come straight from the study guides). The key is to memorize all of the info on the study guides, and you'll be just fine. The lectures just rehash the reading, so you can pretty much pick whether to go to lecture or do the reading. I prefer the lecture just because I find it easier to keep focused when someone else is delivering the information, but do as you wish.Well organized course. It really opened my eyes to possibly going down the pre-Med track. The way life works is just really cool!",
    "You pretty much have to take it to do anything in science later. Dont take it just for fun.",
    "Great course that helps students of all levels grasp concepts in biology. I would definitely recommend it to anyone remotely interested in biology.",
    "Obviously, some students have to take this class for premed or for their prospective major. If you are a nonmajor or nonpremed looking to take this course, just don't. Professor Koelle puts everything that he says on his powerpoints, completely destroying the need for students to attend lecture, and making lecture boring when students do attend.There were many students who regularly did not go to lecture or would sit on the balcony so they could fall asleep. The class is way too big, and sections are not fulfilling.",
    "A great introductory course to the cellular mechanisms behind living organism. Please only take it if you plan to enter a biology based science since the class is really large.",
    "Unless the student is for sure that they are wanting to go into the biology field or want to be Pre-Med, I would not recommend the course to other students. It is made in a way so students with extensive biology backgrounds do very well and those that do not, do not.",
    "Great course. Great professor.",
    "It was a necessary evil.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. At first it was very difficult and did not feel like an introductory course but as long as you put in effort, it yields very nice results.",
    "Take 101 as a prerequisite and not if you're looking for an introductory science class. 101 is unnecessarily large, has a difficult curve because of its demographic of premeds and engineers, and is rather impersonally instructed. The curriculum feels like a hastilydone AP Bio review, in that it is neither inspiring nor really that innovative. That being said, keep on top of your readings and understandings of lecture because the quizzes do end up factoring in the final grade.",
    "Lectures are really easy to follow, as Prof. Koelle is always very well prepared. The class might be a bit too easy, making the curve pretty tough; a 93.8% wasn't enough to earn a solid A, as the cutoff was somewhere around 94.5%.",
    "It was pretty much a review of AP Biology. Lectures were relatively easy to follow and the Powerpoint handouts helped a lot. Not really worth half a semester, so definitely try to place out.",
    "I would NOT recommend this class to another student if it's taught by Professor Koelle. It is in no way an intro class, and Professor Koelle is in no way willing to help students without any experience. I would also not take this class as a freshman, as many upperclassmen have said that this class was more difficult than many of their previous classes at Yale. It is very fast paced and taught to the highest level of students in the class (i.e. those who have been doing research in labs since early high school). If you are looking for an actual introductory class to biology, this is not it. Don't waste your time in this class, but rather take it somewhere else, or over the summer.",
    "Biology 101 is pretty straightforward. The quizzes every week are good for solidifying knowledge right away, and they're not very hard. Its a pretty easy way to begin the year-long intro bio course.",
    "A review of AP bio but more interesting and with greater in depth understanding. Recommended for anyone interested in the sciences.",
    "An introductory biology course on steroids. Usually catered towards students who have had prior biology knowledge. The students I've asked who haven't taken biology before struggled in the class. I would recommend it for people who need it for their major, but it definitely is not a gut class.",
    "Yes! loved 101 but HATED 102. 102 was not a bio class, it was learning about microscopes and stupid experiments and I honestly can't tell you anything but SDS PAGE.",
    "Biology 101 was easy to understand if you did the reading and kept up with the reading. The lecture outlines and slides were helpful for review. The large class size made learning in the lecture difficult, but reviewing the material presented in lecture afterwards was helpful in fixing this. I would recommend this class because it is a prerequisite for the bio majors and helpful with other science classes.",
    "it's nothing special, not too interesting. the workload is manageable but some stuff seemed unnecessary. i wouldn't take it unless i had to.",
    "This class was okay--not terrible. The lecture slides are printed out for you and Professor Koelle just reads off of the slides, so it's pretty boring. It moves faster than you expect though and you really need to study to do well, because most of the kids in the class work really hard. Also, this was the first year it was offered so it could change a lot next year--hopefully it will improve.",
    "Useful and interesting. I would recommend.",
    "Biology 101 was a new introductory course this past semester, and as such it is still in development and has a number of very present flaws. It is a huge lecture class--this semester it was approximately 400 students--and in my experience had some struggles equalizing the needs of students at very different places academically to allow for a level playing field. Professor Koelle was at times very boring, but he as also clearly very knowledgable. All of this being said, a number of resources were provided to allow for students' success and the class was very much manageable--just be certain to use such resources as Piazza, section, office hours, etc. as you need them. In light of this, I'd recommend this class if you have to take it as a prerequisite for something or if you are very much interested in the topics being discussed. It's neither a gut nor worth taking really \"just for fun,\" probably, unless youre very interested.",
    "Bio 101 is your typical huge lecture-- but though you won't know the teacher or your classmates, the material isn't too difficult and it's certainly very important stuff. There's some overlap with AP Bio at first, but make no mistake-- this class eventually goes into significantly greater depth. Recommended for anyone intending to use biology; for anything in that field, this is really a foundational class.",
    "I would summarize it as a necessary foundation for biology that you have to grit your teeth and bear. Much easier with prior biology knowledge, particularly AP knowledge. I would not recommend it to someone who does not need it as a prerequisite because it is not exploratory nor revelatory. Just lots of basic biology.",
    "This class is a good introduction to biochemistry, although it is difficult if you do not have a background in AP Bio or AP Chem. The material is manageable, but challenging.",
    "I recommend it as a good intro to biology, though it went well beyond AP Bio and a normal intro level.",
    "You will learn a lot, but expect some hair pulling lectures",
    "It's a good, though not entirely comprehensive, intro to the topic. I would definitely recommend it to any student who wants to pursue medicine or natural sciences, but I would caution any student without a strong high school biology background as a lot of prior knowledge is assumed.",
    "I had high hopes for this class. In the beginning, Koelle said that he wanted Biology to be an exciting topic, not just memorizing facts.When it came to execution of this, Koelle did nothing but reinforce the idea that biology should be pure memorization. In grading exams, he only looked for buzzwords that are not prompted by the question. Thus the exams serve to test your ability to read the professor's mind when he created the exam and your ability to spew forth words rather than show that you actually understand the topic. In doing this, Koelle did the opposite of his goal, making Biology nothing more than memorizing words and putting them in places.Koelle's lectures are extremely dry, consisting of powerpoints that he reads directly off of. He is not very approachable and neither is the module coordinator. Both of them show no care for their students and generally treat them like nuisances. The fact that this module system is new does not excuse the indignance of the professor and coordinator.This class has certainly helped me decide on a major, one that steers clear of biology. I strongly do not recommend this course.",
    "Biology 101 was a fairly easy introductory Biology course, though the focus was too narrow. Seeing as the course is hard to place out of, I would recommend the course as a way to get back on the science and biology mindset.",
    "Awful. Weekly quizzes that got progressively worse. Homework assignments are fairly easy to get As on and you can drop the lowest score. The class overall was not an intro class. Much better to take if you'd taken AP Bio. Not as bad as BIOL 102, which was what caused me to drop my dream of being a surgeon, but not a class you should take unless you must.",
    "Biol 101 is not too bad if you have had a background in Biology prior to the class, like AP Bio. The lectures are not extremely entertaining, but the overall class isn't terrible. The work load was not terrible and neither were the tests. If you do not know much about bio, you will need to put in some effort as the course moves fairly quickly.",
    "It's a good course overall- harder than the \"intro, no AP Bio necessary\" label suggests. But a good course to take anyway.",
    "It's a requirement for SO many things, so if you're looking at this class you probably have to take it. It's definitely not a horrible class so you have nothing to dread.",
    "This course basically covers the same material as AP Bio, and all of the information you need to know in the class is provided to you on the handouts. All the concepts are also clearly explained on the handouts. That said I would probably not recommend people who had not been exposed to any kind of biology before to take it, because the class does contain many people who have taken AP Bio and the percentage\/ grade needed to get an A might be really high.",
    "I would describe it as a more detailed, less straightforward summary of AP bio.",
    "Yes. Good way to be introduced into biology at yale and what is expected from teachers",
    "Yes, I would recommend Biology 101 to a fellow student. It may seem a bit difficult initially, especially if you have limited previous knowledge of biology, but if you pay attention in lecture and study the material it shouldn't be hard to do well.",
    "Absolutely take it -- with Prof. Koelle, if you can. He's a confident, precise lecturer, exceptionally good at explaining terms and concepts in simple language, and he's designed a course with easy p-sets and frequent quizzes meant to take away a lot of the stress heretofore associated with large bio lectures at Yale. The material itself is a smooth continuation of topics and themes from AP -- I imagine the course would be more difficult if you hadn't had AP, but for those who did take it, and who enjoyed it, BIOL 101 makes a wonderful, logical first step into college-level science. Bonus: it's highly accessible for interested non-science majors and is an absolutely great, interesting, non-gutty way to earn half a science credit.",
    "Biol 101 is an appropriate introduction to biochemistry. If you have a solid foundation in AP Chemistry and AP Biology, you might be a bit bored, but it was well taught and well organized. I would go for it!",
    "i would recommend this course to another student and say it is a fair amount of work but provides one with a better base to really delve into biology",
    "Biology 101 discusses the basic macromolecules of life, their structure, and how they function. It also covers thermochemistry and the way information is stored and copied through DNA.I would recommend this class to anyone interested in a science major, because if it is not required, it would at least be very useful. The information I was exposed to in this course lent a different perspective to what I was learning in Chemistry 114 and even my writing course. If a student is interested in biology but necessarily in a science major, I would recommend this class only if he is willing to invest much time and effort, or if his high school classes prepared him well in biology.",
    "Yes, would recommend. May be a bit of a review if you have taken a lot of biology in high school but it also reinforces areas you may be weak in. The end lectures about AIDS are very interesting.",
    "Sadly, this class was a bit too basic for people who have already taken AP Biology in high school. It was just another overview of basic concepts like photosynthesis and cell respiration, or how proteins are made, or how viruses operate. It is not a difficult class though, and the weekly quizzes and problem sets are straightforward. This is a required class though for people interested in most of the sciences, so unless you place out, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take it. Hopefully, it will be better in the future, since this is the first year that they have implemented this 101-104 4-module intro class.",
    "General course overviewing the basics of Biology.",
    "This course is a great refresher course for those students who have taken AP\/IB\/A-level biology courses in high school. While the material can be a bit repetitive at times, Prof Koelle makes it interesting by talking about a lot of the applications. The exams and quizes are easy if you know the material well; they are not designed to surprise you.",
    "Biology 101 is a pretty standard set up for an intro-bio class. It solidly covers the basics of the four macromolecules in a very large lecture, though the size will probably decrease in future years. The class is really designed to be much more bare and bones foundational biology than enjoyable and fulfilling by itself, so I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really recommend it if you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t planning on taking further biology classes.",
    "I would summarize the course as a decent intro Bio course. I would recommend it if you really want to learn introductory biology. However, if they offer new intro biology classes in the future, I would consider them.",
    "Biology 101 was overall a good course. It did not, however, feel like an introductory course. Despite having taken a couple years of biology in high school and scoring a 5 on the AP test, the material was difficult to keep up with and the homework was confusing. Although I did feel swamped for essentially all of the course, I felt that the immersion taught me much about the subject material, and I walked away with a much newfound knowledge and a decent grade.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you absolutely have to take it because it is a poorly taught and structured course. You need to be prepared to learn a lot of the material on your own, but compared to Biol 102, the material is a lot more accessible because the powerpoints for Biol 101 are well made."
