    "This class acted as a great support while finishing the art thesis - definitely helped to get feedback from peers and the DUS.",
    "Nice thought to have it year long but I wish we had our advisors in the fall. It was hard to really get much done until the spring, especially since the class is made up of a bunch of students studying different media. Class feedback was never super helpful to me.",
    "This course largely caters to established paths within the art major. Getting as much out of overall critique is difficult to navigate within some categories of the major which has an overall impact in the work made for the project and success with finding ways to connect periferal categories with cetralized flows of thought within the faculty of the school of art. Further development of these periferal areas would strengthen the art major for those categories and the work produced would be better served and understood."

That said, in some categories it is very useful. I did benefit from the model regardless of unfairly waited interest in fully developed categories"
