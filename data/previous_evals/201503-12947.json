   "comments": [
    "Great course for learning about music fundamentals\/history\/terminology. Large focus on Western music. Not a gut but super doable if you just put in some time to study and do readings.",
    "MUSI 112 is a nice overview of Western music. After taking it, I feel much more musically literate, able to look at the program for a performance and have some idea of what to expect and whether or not I'll enjoy it. Spending a couple weeks on opera was sort of a drag, but the payoff is finding a few new pieces or styles of music you enjoy. Definitely worth it!",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Take it.",
    "There's not an overwhelming amount of work in this course, but it will be rather difficult if you have no musical training. The greatest stress in this course comes from how difficult the course material is to use. Also, prepare to learn a lot of music history. Not a bad course, but the online textbook SUCKS.",
    "Nice HU credit, not too work intensive",
    "Music 112 is a great class for anyone with little or no music experience, or even with music experience but without knowledge of music history. The class is as much about analyzing music as it is with music history and how it has evolved since the Middle Ages. I would recommend it to any other student; I found it extremely interesting, a manageable workload, and I am now able to appreciate classical music far more than I did previously.",
    "I would recommend this class. Its not too difficult, and is a great way to learn about and appreciate music.",
    "I absolutely, absolutely recommend taking this course!! Whether you are a musician or you don't know anything about music, this class is super interesting and a lot of fun. Although Professor Wright goes over a couple of music reading and music theory basics, the bulk of the class is spent learning about the different styles of music from the Middle Ages to Postmodernism. I have gained such an appreciation for types of music that I only understood on a surface level before this class, and it legitimately has changed the way I listen to music. Lecture is super interesting and many times involved live (beautiful) performances. Although you definitely do have to put in work if you want to get an A, the work is extremely manageable I was never stressed out by this class.",
    "It's not a gut, don't be fooled. The exams are actually quite challenging, and the material you're responsible for is pretty extensive.",
    "This is a must take course",
    "I would absolutely recommend Music 112 to another student. I think this is a must take for everyone before they leave Yale!",
    "Fun and interesting but actually fairly challenging to get a good grade eeven with a background in music.",
    "Don't take this class. Attendance at boring lectures is mandatory, mandatory section is an even bigger waste of time, and the assignments test seemingly random details.",
    "This class sounds like a gut, and for the most part it's not too bad. The exams are kind of ridiculous though, with the final study guide being around 25 pages of stuff to memorize. Take with caution.",
    "I would recommend it, it's a fair amount of work, but you end up getting a lot out of course and finish with a better understanding of music.",
    "I would recommend this course. You'll get the most out of it if you have little to no experience with music. However, I took the course having played the trumpet since 4th grade and still learned a ton about music history. This is a good, enjoyable course and an easy Humanities credit.",
    "I really enjoyed this class because it was such a nice change of pace to all the other classes I was taking. It was marketed as a 5th class for someone who had never had any music training, and as that, it was abysmal. I would only recommend you take this class credit D. There were many students taking the class who already had backgrounds in music and so that definitely didn't help. I repeat again, unless you have a stronger background in music (at which point you shouldn't be taking this class), only take this class credit-d.",
    "Workload - very gutty. You just have to do listening exercises, 2 exams, and a 5 page final paper. But the exams are pretty difficult, actually. So it's not totally a gut. Still a really fun course. I learned a lot. Kinda wished we talked more about non-Western music, but whatever.",
    "A fun class to learn more about music, but prepared to do a lot more work for this class than an average intro class.",
    "It is a wonderful class for anyone interested in music. Professor Wright is wonderful and his love and respect for all types of music transfers to the class. I always looked forward to coming to that class. It was never boring and I really enjoyed just listening to music. We had a number of live performances in class, mostly on the piano, but on a few other instruments too. I do understand some forms of music better, and like them more now. I have nothing bad to sasy about this class. I encourage everyone to take it and actually take interest in it, because it introduces you to and enables you to enjoy a much more broad spectrum of music, and I think most of the things I learned in this class will stick with me.",
    "A great class for people of all musical backgrounds. As someone with a lot of prior knowledge of classical music, I found the course very engaging and interesting. Craig is an awesome person, and you can tell he puts a lot of effort into this course. There were quite a few guest performers all of which were incredibly talented and entertaining. The midterms are extensive, but you get study guides that make the exams manageable. Also, try to get Craig as your section teacher.",
    "A very interesting course that goes over the history of music analyzing it.",
    "Not a gut. Hard HU class. Not just a \"chill\"'class where you listen to music. With that being said, what you put in is what you get out.",
    "Challenging but rewarding for those without music background. Not as much for those that have experience",
    "Great class to learn about music, its history, and its theory.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you have any range of background in music (even none). It's really interesting, well taught and not too difficult if you study well for the exams. At times it was more busy work than I expected, though.",
    "This course was a combination of music appreciation, music theory for beginners, and a history of classical music. It all comes together very nicely, largely due to the incredible depth of Professor Wright's knowledge of the subject. I definitely recommend this course. It opened up the world of classical music to me, and allowed me to share in Professor Wright's passion for the material. It's also very manageable and accessible, even if you know nothing about music. If you like music and would like to learn more about how it works, or what makes great music, or about the historical contexts of classical genres, composers, and pieces (I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this aspect of the course), definitely take this class.",
    "I would take this class with caution. I was expecting it to be really fun and manageable, and I learned a lot but the class feels a little bit like high school.. Attendance is taken at lectures, we have to fill out worksheets about badly written science articles, Professor Wright would ask dumb rhetorical questions in lecture and then wait for answers, and in general I sometimes felt like he doesn't see college students as adults. If you like hand-holding, then this is the class for you. If not.. then you might get a little bit irritated with the structure of the lecture. In terms of content, it's really interesting! Definitely can be challenging at times, but also easy at times.",
    "Absolutely take this course!! I recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about music and has no background in music theory. The lectures were great and Professor Wright really cares about his students!",
    "Highly recommend. Not hard and super interesting.",
    "You will leave this class learning a great deal about music, no matter how little you knew before. However, do NOT take this class as your \"easy\" fourth or fifth course. It may be advertised as relatively easy, but this is false advertising.",
    "This is a fun class to take but you will only get as much out of it as you put into it; don't expect to learn much unless you take the time and effort to do so yourself. Also, don't expect an easy A. While it's not too much work, the tests are tricky and it's hard to do well on the essays unless you have prior musical experience. In general I would recommend it as a fun and easy class.",
    "I would recommend MUSI 112 01 to other students.",
    "Oh yeah would super recommend. Take it. Though it is online if you don't want to spend $140 on the textbook.",
    "I recommend this class if you need an easy humanities. Two tests, a concert review, a final paper, and listening exercises are what constitutes your grade. Pretty easy 5th class, but you actually have to attend in order to get participation points. The tests are easy if you memorize the study guides that Professor Wright provides you with a week beforehand. Section is useless and annoying but attendance is taken.",
    "I had no experience in music, whereas many of the people who took this class were in YSO or were professional musicians. However, Craig did a great job of leveling the field as we had a study guide for the tests. I love Craig. I loved coming to class everyday. It was so therapeutic and relaxing to listen to music and I learned a lot. Before, I thought classical music was too elite and sophisticated for me. Taking this class allowed me to talk to some of my musical friends about favorite compositions and I was so grateful to connect with them on that level. Music had been missing from my life, and now I study with Tchaikovsky in the background. Cons: Ebook and submitting quizzes online was a gigantic pain. I couldn't read the bottom of the textbook, so I missed a paragraph each page. It was hard to navigate around. Thank god the pdf was found otherwise it was literally so agitating I wouldn't have read anything. TAs graded unfairly harsh on the tests-- like it was actually ridiculous the things they took points off for. Things like spelling, word choice, etc. Pros: Craig Wright and field trips and professional guests. Wright is an amazing professor, so obviously passionate about teaching Music to us that it inspired me to listen intently everyday. He was also very supportive about grading: the TAs graded harshly, but he would listen to students' complaints and readjust grading. It was great to hear professional musicians come and play live in class and meeting all these incredibly talented people.",
    "Definitely a great course for who want to know someting about classical music as well as other genres. Make sure you learn all the music terms, it will help you a lot.",
    "Listening to Music will give you a much higher appreciation for music. Took it credit\/d, though it definitely is a manageable class you could take for a grade.",
    "Definitely recommend, but take Credit\/D, because it is deceptively hard.",
    "MUSI 112 is basically a 'History of Classical Music' class, starting with the Middle Ages. Even though the title is deceptive, the material is easy enough to keep you going along. Also, it's addressed to both people with a musical background and people without one, so to make things fair, the majority of the work is reading a textbook and doing quizzes, which will become really boring as the semester progresses. The upside is that it's not hard to do well on the homeworks\/exams, but it won't be fun. I took it as a 5th class, and ended up putting in much more work than expected.",
    "I would strongly recommend the course to any student who love music.",
    "Good class and you leave having learned a lot more than you originally expected. It was definitely not \"clapping for credit\" as it was called by so many professors and upperclassmen. There are weekly listening exercises that take about 5-10mins, two tests, a concert review, and a 8-page final paper. The tests are harder than you'd expect. At the same time they are fair based on the prep sheets that Professor Wright gives you, however, you will only do well if you answer the questions and define the words in exactly the way he wants them, the slightest differentiation and you'll be marked off. In his attempt to embrace so much new technology, Professor Wright didn't spend as much time on the quality of his lectures. The textbook was only offered online as a rental, and it's expensive, so don't buy it unless you are absolutely certain that you will be taking the course. It was a shame that we didn't get to keep the textbook (it was written by Professor Wright himself) and was very well written. I believe that having the textbook solely online was a mistake, it made doing the reading assignments more time consuming than they would have been had we had a hard-copy instead.",
    "This class is an interesting one. For people looking either to dabble in different areas of music or expand their horizons, this is a great one. However, the exams make this class miserable, at times. To get credit on vocabulary or short-answer questions, we needed to have 100%, word-for-word correct answers. This is completely ridiculous. Even people with excellent musical background were struggling here for that reason. Otherwise, Craig makes the class engaging and it's a fun time for the most part: a good 5th class."
