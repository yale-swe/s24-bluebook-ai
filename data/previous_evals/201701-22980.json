    "The strengths of the course were that it was very efficient, conveying core details without \"fluff.\" The discussion-based classes were really helpful in making the material engaging.",
    "I really liked the format of this course in its present form and I strongly support keeping it like this in future years.",
    "The workload of the course was perfect (not too much but just enough so that we could come prepared to discuss the topics\/papers we had been assigned). I liked the reading response posts because they allowed us to formulate our thinking about readings. The readings (mix of popular articles and academic journal articles) prompted us to think about how these issues apply to the broader world outside of psychology. I also like that the faculty was rotating! Jutta's week was especially excellent."
