    "Take this class with Joan if you can! She is a great professor, and the work load is pretty minimal. You definitely won't regret taking it.",
    "Take it! It's so much better than 110! They aren't all boring, I promise!",
    "An acting class that goes over a lot of helpful introductory exercises. I would recommend it to another theater studies major. It was amazing.",
    "I mean you have to take it as the theater major. If you are not one, this is not the class to take. Try to get into upper level stuff as this is really just a review of basics.",
    "Joan's class was just a lot of fun. We didn't get too much in terms of methods or styles, but there was a lot of ensemble work and fun assignments. The fact that there was no reading as well was excellent.",
    "So much fun. Take it. Prof MacIntosh is a blast. You'll have a great time. It's an awesome reward after getting through Theater History.",
    "I don't believe that I have really learned anything as a performer from this course, and (I hate to say this) I feel like it's a waste of a Yale credit. It's necessary for the major, so you have to take it if you're Theater Studies, but it's a very unsatisfying class for someone who has performed before. You have to go back to the basics, which really sucks. I simply felt like I got nothing out of this course.",
    "It's the intro acting class. Enjoy it for what it is, but make sure you hold your professor (especially Joan) accountable for exactly what she's teaching you."
