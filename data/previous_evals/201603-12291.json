   "comments": [
    "inherently, this course is very disconnected since it is a methods course. That said, by continuing to focus on the stellar application, some general coherence was obtained.",
    "Strengths: Some of the problem sets and exam questions were innovative and fun to work on. Weakness: The course tries to cover a lot of material from different fields in a relatively short period of time. In my opinion this course could be broken down into at least 3 courses covering Fundamentals of Radiative Transfer and Astrophysical Applications, Fluid Dynamics, General Relativity with Applications to different Astrophysical Settings (Black holes, Cosmology) which could then explore each topic in much more detail.",
    "The course is very broad, but I think it could use more depth of coverage",
    "Very necessary. Very fast paced.",
    "I liked that this class covered a wide variety of material, and I thought the content that was covered was helpful. I think the concept of an introductory, lightning speed course is beneficial in order to review old concepts and get briefly introduced to new ones that we will revisit later. The class did move quite quickly, however, and it would have been nice to maybe cover a few less topics in order to spend more time on the ones that do get covered."

    "Yes I would, I would also recommend trying to follow along in an introductory-style textbook. This helps emphasize the main ideas while not getting bogged down in too many details."
