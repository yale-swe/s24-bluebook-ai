   "comments": [
    "Lots of background knowledge on what goes into climate science, what effects are important in the climate system, what makes it a difficult thing to study. Learned a little bit of how to think about PDEs.",
    "This class is half conceptual and half quantitative. It is also split by content, with the first half of the course focused on cosmogony and inner-earth physics, and the second half of the class focused on environmental physics\/earth surface processes.",
    "Learned concepts of planetary orbit, Stefan's number, atmospheric balance, and Rossby waves among others.",
    "I learned a lot about the physics behind Earths natural processes and learned how relatively simple models can be used to derive fairly accurate estimates.",
    "This course is a good introduction to atmospheric and ocean dynamics; a precursor for advanced courses.",
    "How planets are formed an maintained, and what we know about how the atmosphere operated.",
    "Earth physics, weather\/climate processes"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Breadth and depth were both very good, learned a lot and a lot about a few topics. Experimental demonstrations in class Weaknesses: The math was often done very fast and was hard to follow due to some math being skated over. It was definitely ok to not understand the math and still get the concepts of what was happening, but would have been nice to have both. I understand that this is difficult given the range of math backgrounds in the class.",
    "This course is quantitatively very difficult and sometimes it is hard to see the big picture when the lectures are lost in the weeds of tough math\/physics. On the other hand I found it quite interesting, and Professor Wettlauffer keeps the class interesting with his own lecturing style and with experiments or examples.",
    "This course was very strong. However, because it was not taught from a textbook, if some material was not clear from class notes, it was hard to learn it elsewhere.",
    "The course layout is well designed and easy-to-follow. Transitions between the concepts are also well connected.",
    "Really interesting lectures, but there could be more organization to make it clear what kids are responsible for knowing.",
    "Needs a textbook! If you dont understand something when Prof Wettlaufer explains it in class, youre out of luck (since most derivations arent online or otherwise easily accessible)."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, this class took me from somewhat interested in climate science to very interested. You can get a good and accurate sense of what the rest of the class will be like from shopping period. Psets varied in difficulty Cool experimental demonstrations during class.",
    "This was an elective for the BS 12 mech e major. Professor Wettlaufer is an amazing lecturer--he walks through massive derivations and so many historical facts without notes--low key legend. Problem sets were challenging but doable, but you have to attend lecture; the class notes are crucial to finishing the problems, and his slides are not uploaded, nor useful. Midterm 1 was frightening to take, but the class average was quite low, so hopefully that'll work out. Midterm 2 seemed easier but who knows? The final presentation in the syllabus was cancelled, so it ended up a being a bit of a chill semester. And now I know a bit more about the weather!",
    "If you have experience with applied science courses (not pure math or physics but things like astro or geophysics) this is a great class. Don't underestimate the quantitative requirements of the course.",
    "I would; it is a course that engages you with solving partial differential equations to answer some questions of how the world works. Wettlaufer is a good instructor that explains these concepts and derivations well and the homework facilitates deeper learning.",
    "Yes absolutely. I learned a lot and found that the material was presented in a very engaging manner.",
    "Yes. It was incredibly interesting material that colors a lot of world thinking about a lot of climate change.",
    "Probably not. It has potential but tries to do too much"
