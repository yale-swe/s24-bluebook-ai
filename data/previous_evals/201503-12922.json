    "If you speak Vietnamese at all, you should take this class. It allows for a loving family-feel among the students and Thay Quang, and you learn a lot.",
    "Awesome class. It is extremely beneficial for heritage speakers who don't know how to read or write. On top of that, Thay Quang is one of the most genuine, kind professors on campus and is incredibly supportive. Take it!",
    "VIET 132 was a pretty great for learning Vietnamese! As a native speaker who was completely illiterate going into this class, I can definitely say that I improved so much over the span of a semester. I was surprised by the array of different incoming skill levels of the students and I think my class was just larger than usual, but Professor Quang did a good job of ensuring that we all progressed from our initial levels going in, and made sure that we all had a chance to speak in class. My only thing would be that I would prefer to have more review of the material in the chapters, because I felt like teaching an entire chapter to myself in a day when I could barely read or write made it difficult for me to internalize the correct thing, especially if I was pronouncing things incorrectly without guidance. Sometimes it felt like the homework was piled on for us (lots of presentation\/video-making for homework), and we had to do a lot of self-teaching if we didn't already know it, but class was overall quite relaxed. He's a super nice man who likes to joke around, and we had fun field trips."
