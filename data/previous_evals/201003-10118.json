   "comments": [
    "This class is interesting; it's a lot of work but the assignments are interesting and at times rewarding. If you push yourself to think differently, or get in with talented people in your class, you'll learn a lot, but the structure of the class itself doesn't really aid in production skills.",
    "If you want to get your feet wet making movies, this class is for you.",
    "you learn about incredible film directors and their technical processes. Then you take their techniques and make them your own in your own film projects.",
    "You make a movie in the style of an influential director every other week and learn about production approaches in class. I would recommend it.",
    "If it is offered again, TAKE IT. Even if you don't have much experience, as long as you are interested in filmmaking, you will find the class immensely enjoyable and rewarding. Professor Carey is amazing to work with and will provide very insightful feedback. The college seminar program exists so that we can take classes like this. Take advantage of it!",
    "I would recommend this to another student who has the time to put in toward making a film every other week and who is seriously interested in filmmaking. Unlike Intro to Film Studies, this course deals concretely with filmmaking, and students complete assignments that reflect the discussion and the techniques that the director of the week uses. From the description, it may not be clear if this is a production course or not. It is a production course, with four short films and one final project. There is one paper but no other typical academic work. Be prepared to spend a lot of time each week casting, looking for actors, and either writing or finding the script. It's tough to come up with an idea for a film every two weeks and then pull it together so quickly.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in film directing, and specifically learning new ways to tell stories in the medium. Learning about how great directors worked effectively encourages students to consider new ways of envisioning and shooting.",
    "Take it if you can!! You will learn alternative ways of filmmaking, that creation is in the making as much as thinking. The workload is nicely spread out - I don't know if it will be offered again but I hope it will be.",
    "SOOOO GOOD!!! My favorite class this semester. It was my first time taking any type of film class and I learned a lot about the various directors we studied, as well as a good deal about production (even though that wasn't the focus of the class). Professor Carey is the best--she's super understanding, knowledgeable, and accessible. She asks thoughtful questions during discussion and is a great seminar leader! TAKE IT IF YOU CAN."
