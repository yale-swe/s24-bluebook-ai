   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend GLBL 369! Take it for Professor Howorth, even if you're only mildly interested in the material.",
    "Take it! I went in knowing close to nothing about the Transatlantic Relationship. The class isn't what you would expect it to be but precisely because of that it is so interesting and enlightening. Howorth is great! Extremely passionate, knowledgeable and down to earth. Definitely recommend this class!",
    "I enjoyed this course. Workload was two papers, an in-class presentation, and notes on the readings for 4 of the class sessions. The subject matter is generally interesting, but some of the readings can get a bit dry at times. Professor Howorth is kind, very knowledgeable, and has many anecdotes that are humorous in a very British way; these serve as nice diversions from the readings but they were always relevant to the material! My only real complaint would be that class discussion was sometimes derailed by a few people, but I suppose this is a danger inherent to any seminar...",
    "This is a very engaging seminar about one international relationship, but it teaches much more than just about the US-EU alliance. It is very applicable to any foreign relations issue, and the course explores many facets of the relationship, including economic, political, social, and cultural. I would recommend this course to another student because it is a thought-provoking and thorough study with a very insightful professor.",
    "Great class. A hidden gem because people generally overlook transatlantic relations. But this course will allow u to think again about the notion of 'The West'. Sam Huntington wrote about the clash over civilization. This class will explore why an intra-clash for the West is even more troubling",
    "A great course on transatlantic relations! Take it!",
    "Take it! Great professor, interesting (and reasonable) readings and topics, 1 short presentation (not stressful), and 2 papers (fairly graded).",
    "I highly recommend Transatlantic Relations because it is a fun, interesting, and engaging course. Students have the opportunity to learn from a professor who is highly knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, and who is organized in his structure of the class."
