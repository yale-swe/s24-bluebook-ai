    "Question 4 - - The workload for this course was extremely heavy. In one weekend, we had a lab that took most of us 25+ hours, a paper critique, a project proposal, and the regular readings. It felt like we were being weeded out by work. I probably spent as much time on my other three classes combined as a did for this class, but it was either that or drop out, as many people did. I have never taken a class with this much work - - it brought me to tears on more than one occasion, but I wanted to stay in the class. The professor did not seem to understand how much work the class was, despite the TA and other instructor mentioning it to her. I think she saw it as a way to weed us out.Question 7b - - I found the TA helpful but at times unprofessional and even rude. It could be that she was annoyed at how much I emailed her with questions, but it didn't make me feel great.Question 9b - - The labs did not run smoothly. I found them to be poorly written, unplanned, and in need of major editing and reworking. I felt that there was a huge disparity between the quality of the labs we were given versus the quality of the work we were expected to do. We wasted hours and hours deciphering our assignments from the labs, dealing with old questions that hadn't been updated and poorly written labs, and trouble shooting software issues that turned out to be due to bad planning rather than lack of understanding on our part. It was incredibly frustrating. I would suggest taking a really good look at the labs and doing a lot of work on them before teaching this class again.",
    "1. great readings - prof. seto assigns seminal papers for each technique, which is so valuable. 2. explanations - prof. seto is great at answering questions and explaining difficult concepts and techniques. 3. assignments - very helpful working through all the different techniques. 4. the workload for this class is HUGE, at least twice as much as other classes. 5. prof seto was great about soliciting feedback from students on what we wanted incorporated into the lectures. 6. pace was good. 7. the thing that detracts from me rating prof. seto and the TA as \"excellent\" is the long time that it took to return our labs - this detracted from the usefulness of each lab as a teaching tool for subsequent labs, because we didn't get feedback on the labs we turned in until about a month later. also, the TA was very very busy and it was difficult to find time when she was available to meet. 8. the long time to return assignments detracts from \"excellent\" on this question as well - and also the degree to which the labs were at times unclearly worded. 9a. this class had 9 labs, two paper reviews, a presentation, a project, and 2 or 3 journal articles that needed to be read for each lecture - i.e., way more work than any other class - but on the other hand, i can't think of anything i would have cut out. it was all really interesting and instructive. just a lot to get through. 9b. again, certain of the labs had errors in them that made them very hard to follow, and the difficulties with software versions were very frustrating. 9c. but that said, i learned a ton. 10. this class has been extremely valuable and i'm verrry glad i took it.",
    "Lab work was extremely time consuming, often because we were never taught how to complete many of the components and because assignments did not seem to be tested beforehand. If the lectures related more to the hands-on aspects of remote sensing, perhaps the labs would have been more doable."

   "comments": [
    "While it was made clear that this class was \"advanced,\" I don't think it was clear what \"advanced\" actually meant. I think the professor wants this class to be a seminar for PhD students or 2nd year masters students with research projects underway. Because there are so few remote sensing courses at FES, a lot of other people are interested in taking it. I am a first year Masters student with a background in remote sensing, and I found myself in way over my head in terms of the amount of work required. If this was the only class I was taking, it might work, but I was also taking three other classes and remembering how to \"do\" school. I think first year Masters students should be discouraged from taking this class, as it stands now, or the class needs to change to meet the needs of a broader student composition. It is only offered every other year, and I really wanted to take it, so I didn't really know what to do other than stick it out.In addition, for the first half of the course, the atmosphere felt very cold, like the professor was trying to get us to drop the course. This was in stark contrast to her demeanor in office hours or in the second half of the course. It was a very uncomfortable environment.",
    "editing and updating the labs. if they could be returned to students the week after they turn them in, that would be fantastic.",
    "I would have preferred to have a TA that had regular office hours. The labs are extremely long and at times very tricky. I wasn't sure who I could contact with questions, and many times it was difficult to demonstrate the difficulties with the labs via email.I also think that the grading of the labs was very erratic. We did not receive our lab grades in a timely fashion, so it was difficult to understand what was expected on the labs. There were also times when myself and others were marked down for analysis that was not asked for in the laboratories.",
    "Its a wonderful tool to learn but you have a lot of questions and it is nice to have someone designated to answer them. A TA with more office hours, who is there in the lab to answer your questions will be helpful.",
    "The lab classes should use satellite images from a different region.",
    "Communication. Labs needed to be shortened and edited so that they were doable without multiple years of RS training. Expectations for the final project were unclear."

But you will learn many useful techniques for looking at land use\/land cover change and gain practical skills that you couldn't get from the intro class."
