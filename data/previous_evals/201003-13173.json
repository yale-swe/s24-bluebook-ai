   "comments": [
    "A quick survey of everything from Homer to Dante. I highly recommend it to the student who is looking for a survey of the major works of our world.",
    "DS Lit is an amazing course that provides you with a grand survey of the major works of the Western Canon. I would definitely recommend this course: The small sections, the great professors, the interesting books and the interdisciplinarity of DS in general make DS an extremely valuable experience.Professor Freudenburg is a fantastic teacher: approchable and funny, always providing you with many new insights and interesting questions to think about.",
    "Directed Studies is worth it if the idea of a classical education appeals to you and you're okay with doing a fair bit of writing. I highly recommend it if you fit that bill.",
    "Definitely recommend it. A great experience.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. I really enjoyed the readings assigned, and the class discussions. The DS Literature lectures were also fantastic.",
    "DS Literature is a great course which provides a broad overview of the early western cannon. If you are interested in learning about Greco-Roman culture, ideas, and thoughts, I would definitely recommend taking the course. Professor Freudenburg was a great section leader who steered class discussions without dominating them, and I would definitely recommend taking it with him if you have the opportunity.",
    "Freudenburg is one of the best professors I have ever had. His enthusiasm about the books, good sense of humor, and a lot of insight into the Ancient Greek and Roman culture he had really made this class enjoyable and fun, especially compared to other DS sections. I would absolutely recommend Freudenburg's section.",
    "If you're considering taking Directed Studies, my advice is to weigh carefully the pros and cons, sit in on a couple of sections, shop some other humanities classes to compare, and don't be ashamed to drop it, because it's not good for everybody and some people would argue that it's not good for anybody.That being said, I have no complaints about Literature. The texts were well selected, relevant, and interconnected in a meaningful manner. Professor Freudenburg's section was what these sections should be. About one-third of the time was him lecturing us, and two-thirds of the time was us discussing the text. Although Professor Freudenburg is very knowledgeable, especially about all things Roman (which makes Vergil and Ovid very entertaining, and gives some context to the Hebrew Bible and Dante), you often get the sense that he has questions, or is constantly thinking of new ones, that provoke his own curiosity and, sometimes, confusion. That's an exciting feeling. He's also one of the less staid personalities associated with DS, which keeps his section fresh. If you have section with him, that's something to look forward to.",
    "Directed Studies Literature is a survey course of the literature of the Western Canon. The course moves quickly, and there will be a lot of reading to cover throughout the course. Luckily, the literature is great and the discussions are engaging.",
    "This course was a moderate to high amount of work. It was very rewarding and my essay writing and literatary analysis improved a lot. I would recommend it to a student only if they were willing to complete all of the Directed Studies readings.",
    "This DS section was a highlight of my DS experience fall semester. DS sections make or break the DS experience, and Prof. F's class was definitely a positive in my semester.",
    "I would recommend the Directed Studies Literature course to a fellow student, but largely because it is part of the Directed Studies program as a whole. The pace of the class is challenging at times, not because all of the reading cannot be done, but because all of the reading cannot be done as well as one may like. It can be frustrating to begin study on a new work when you feel as if you've only just begun to grasp what you were previously studying. Nonetheless, the lectures nicely complement what at times can be very engaging section discussions. Being able to talk openly about such incredible material with so many of your peers is an academic experience difficult to turn down.",
    "Absolutely. It's not as extraordinarily difficult as it's made out to be, the professors are outstanding for the most part, and it gives a foundation that no other program can offer. I don't regret doing it at all.",
    "The literature section of Directed Studies is probably the most engaging one. It exposes us to very interesting and unexpected interpretations of books that are generally taken for granted, such as the Bible. I would recommend this course for anyone who wants to have a better appreciation of what \"Western literature\" is about, why the so-called masterpieces are considered as such and how they relate to each other.",
    "I would recommend directed studies to another student because of the amount that you are able to learn in a short period of time when given the quality instructors that DS provides.",
    "Lots and lots of reading. Then more reading. Then you read a little. Then reading. But really, it's not nearly as difficult as they say. If you simply manage your time well, you will find yourself with more than enough time to get your work done, participate in extracurriculars, and have a social life. I am very happy that I chose to take this course and got the instructor I did, and would gladly recommend it to all."
