    "This class is rough but incredibly rewarding. It was by far my favorite class this year. It is so useful and relevant, and Professor Tartari was great. She really cares about the material and is willing to slow down if there are questions. She keeps you on your feet at 9am, but also is sure to include lots of examples and real-life applications to show how to use the class. Even if you're not Econ&Math, I would definitely recommend this track if you're at all interested in doing your own research.",
    "This is a very good and useful class. It is way more useful and practical than a basic statistic class, where you learn and then quickly forget all kinds of distributions. This class actually shows students how the field of statistics is applied in order to interpret and understand questions of economic importance.",
    "You're not going to take this class unless you're an econ-math major and you have to. The only real advice I have is take it with someone else.",
    "If you really like math, are willing to work and need to learn a lot about econometrics.",
    "not the most interesting course but tartari is very willing to work with the class and if you keep up with the class week by week it is good. the teacher isn't that organized so you have to work to keep up. take it only if you have to",
    "Econometrics has the potential to be a very interesting subject, but it also has the potential to be very painful. Unfortunately this course was painful. Tartari clearly cared very much about teaching the course, but she had a strange way of showing it - namely with problem sets that were absolutely miserable. If the problem sets were changed to weekly exercises that looked like the exams then the course would actually have been decent. Instead the problem sets offered little real prep for the exams which meant you had to learn everything a few days before the exam. That said the grading was fairly generous.",
    "Economics 136 (Econometrics) definitely at least ties with many of the other undergraduate economics courses at Yale as being terrible and dreadful. The lectures tended to be boring: students would often zone out, peruse the Internet on their laptop computers, and\/or fall asleep during class. One student even snorted while sleeping causing everyone to laugh; this provided the only comic relief in this 75 minute lecture in which each minute would sometimes feel like an hour. During lecture, Professor Tartari would ramble on and on about the same thing for a very long time and then wonder why we only got through ten slides in the 75 minute class. The introductory lecture for the class had a large number of slides and, in reality, took about three or four entire lectures to cover. During these introductory slides all of the studentssitting in class would scratch their head and have no idea what was going on. By the midterm exam, we had only covered four chapters (granted these four chapters comprise the bulk of introductory econometrics), but then after the midterm we covered a lot of different, challenging topics, at greater speed and ran out of time before we could properly cover the most interesting topics, while other important topics weren\u0092t covered at all. The breadth and depth of material covered in this class and the methods by which they were taught greatly perplexed me. The problem sets tended to be painstakingly tedious when we actually had one. In total, the class had seven problem sets which varied greatly in terms of difficulty; some assignments took 20 hours to complete, while others took a much shorter amount of time. One thing is for sure: none of these assignments could be considered pleasurable or enlightening. Even though the exams in this class were pretty fair, overall the class was simply insufferable and miserable, especially during weeks when an assignment would be due or a \u0093random, unannounced\u0094 quiz would be given. Quizzes comprised a total of 5% of the final grade (just enough to force students to study for them due to the perception that they were important, but not enough to force students to really care about them) and were supposed to be unannounced; however, it turned out that Professor Tartari would announce all quizzes in advance. Quizzes would be administered during the first ten minutes of the lecture and would often be nearly impossible to finish in this designated time frame. While I do not regret taking this class since it is required and I did learn a lot, I do wish that the class would be made more enjoyable in the future so that students don\u0092t loath taking the econometrics portion of the Economics or Economics& Mathematics major. Since econometrics is so important in any field of economics, it is important that the Yale Economics Department makes sure to improve the student experience in all of its econometrics classes and that the econometrics portion of the major becomes something students look forward to and realize is an important part of their academic experience at Yale. Overall, I would recommend this course exclusively to Economics& Mathematics majors as well as Economics majors with a particularly strong background in mathematics and\/or statistics since this is the only econometrics undergraduate class where one actually learns a significant amount of econometrics. Econometrics is a very important class for any undergraduate majoring in economics and is a class that must be taken; this, however, does not mean that students should be forced to suffer through a terrible semester. Ultimately, even though I did not enjoy this class, I did learn a lot and feel that my ability to analyze economic data and journal articles has greatly improved.",
    "After taking Econ 136 you will surprise yourself by being actually able to read all the stats and econometric analysis on an article which you usually skip before. It definitely helps you to understand the foundation of the argument in a profound way.",
    "Yes, if you want to be able to read econ papers or any papers with regressions."
