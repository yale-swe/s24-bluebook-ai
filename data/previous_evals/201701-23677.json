    "Speaking, listening, writing in Spanish all much better from this course",
    "I learned A LOT of Spanish grammar, learned how to articulate my thoughts better in Spanish, improved my speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills.",
    "My speaking and writing as well as grammatical skills greatly improved!",
    "The two areas in which my Spanish improved the most were my spoken Spanish and my reliance on dictionaries for written Spanish. My fluency in speaking improved incredibly - I went from barely being able to string sentences together to giving a 15 minute unmemorized oral presentation without major gaps. Similarly, I went from needing a dictionary for every 4th word in compositions to writing a short essay having looked up approximately 5 words the night before.",
    "I improved my speaking and reading comprehension skill sin this class.",
    "I learned new tenses, how to communicate with more fluidity, improved my writing and verbal skills, expanded my vocabulary, and continued my love for studying Spanish.",
    "Spanish 4 was much less about learning new Spanish and more about applying it and improving fluency. I definitely felt I became a better Spanish speaker from this class, and I also learned a lot about Hispanic culture."

   "comments": [
    "Professor covidanes is amazing. The course has an immense amount of work",
    "I think that we should watch more short films.",
    "Strengths: although there was a lot of work I felt like in the end it did help me become better at Spanish, Profesora Cividanes was fantastic, good integration of cortometrajes and lesson materials other than just readings or lecture (juicio, presentations), consistency with grading and level of difficulty of assignments. Weaknesses: mistakes in the planning of the syllabus, grammatical and spelling mistakes in the syllabus, I know it is up to the students to plan ahead but there were some weeks that were jam-packed full of work.",
    "The strengths were the fun partner activities and oral exams. While some were annoying and quite contrived at the time, they definitely helped in making me a better speaker. Another big plus were the movies and cultural stories. I learned a ton from those! I think the course could be improved by making the Supersite a little more comprehensive, maybe with more tries before you're marked wrong. Oftentimes, the mistake being made is purely due to wrong formatting. Also, the \"telenovela\" was completely unhelpful. Another worry of mine is that after this course, if I don't find a fun L5 course I want to take, my Spanish will become considerably worse over time.",
    "Vhl central was annoying to use and their grading practices were sometimes unfair but overall was a great class."

   "comments": [
    "If you need Spanish l4 take with cividanes!",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course. It was rigorous, but I could also see myself improving\/ becoming a more confident speaker.",
    "Take this course if you have a good understanding of most of Spanish grammar but lack fluency in speech and writing. Do not take this course if you are already fluent in speech or if you do not know most Spanish grammar.",
    "By the end of the course you will be almost fluent in Spanish.",
    "Yes, it was a good way to improve my Spanish, my professor was fantastic, and the class was pretty active and attentive.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! I mean chances are it's required anyway, but I really enjoyed this class and look forward to taking more Spanish classes at Yale!",
    "Yes I would! The class makes students far more fluent than they were previously and exposes them to many aspects of Spanish culture."
