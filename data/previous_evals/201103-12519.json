    "You don't have to take a course in statistics to learn it. Just read any introductory statistics textbook and you're going to get out of it as much as out of this class. Don't waste your Yale credit on it: there are amazing professors out there who are going to teach you meaningful things, and be aware that by taking this class you're depriving yourself of that opportunity.",
    "You probably have to take this course for your major. Good luck.",
    "For all the ragging on JDRS' sense of humor \u0096 I found it grating for the first 7 weeks, but lecture got SO much better during the last 5 weeks, and was pretty enjoyable. Problem sets eventually become a simple series of regressions and deciding whether or not your think that matrix plot looks good or not or whether you should maybe get rid of that variable (throw it out the window!) or not. Not sure what the final is going to be like, but the problem sets were fine, the first midterm was chill, the second midterm was not, but whatevs. It's worth it for the life skills.Also, BOXPLOT OF DEATH. That comes up.",
    "Chances are you have to take this class if you are in it. If not required for your major, take Stats 100. It basically covers the same topics but seems easier. JDRS is deceiving--because he is so enthusiastic and \"funny,\" he really seems like a great professor. In reality, he goes way too fast without thoroughly explaining many concepts and is actually not as nice when you meet with him during office hours. The recommended books are optional, but you kind of need one (or good google skills) to be successful in the class. Exams are hard and tricky, no matter how much you prepared for them. If you are a psych major, I would suggest trying REALLY hard to just take Psych 200 and avoid this class.",
    "Only if its required",
    "This class is awesome. Like most people, I took this as a requirement but I was pleasantly surprised by how ridiculously entertaining stats can be with JDRS as your professor. This is essentially a biweekly comedy hour where you learn a lot about math while listening to your professor talk in silly voices and crack math jokes. Professor JDRS makes this as pain-free as possible, supplying you with handouts to take notes on, as well as offering regular homework help sessions. He wants you to succeed and puts in admirable effort to make his class enjoyable. I highly recommend this class, and not just as a QR.",
    "Statistics is great! Take it! Even if you are not interested in studying statistics further, it is a good class because it provides useful information that you will actually use in life, in and out of a classroom.",
    "Lots of notes. Pretty easy.",
    "Recommended if you want a brief, non-math-based stat overview. JDRS is excellent in a huge lecture setting (although the humor is often game show-esque, it helps concepts hit home). The social science section was perhaps (noted among my peers who took SS\/Poli-Sci) more useful for learning more statistical tools.",
    "YES. If you need to take a QR, listen up: JRS is the best professor ever. Stats is boring, but he makes it fun. Go to every class and try to keep up. This information is really useful, and it's actually fun to do the problems when you feel like you get it. It is miserable if you aren't caught up.",
    "Sure, take it and get the QR credit. The course is easy in the beginning, class is interesting, but I took AP Stat in high school and still struggled on every test.",
    "Yes, fulfill a QR. And class isn't too bad if you took statistics before.",
    "If you can handle JRS's corny jokes, you'll discover that the class is taught brilliantly - he's clearly perfected it over the years. From content emphasis to little gimmicks to make sure things stick, the whole semester is obviously constructed with the student very much in mind. Everything will seem much more relevant, and your retention will be much better, if you take it alongside another course in which it's applicable (e.g., a sociology course in which you're reading articles that make use of multiple regression). Very glad I stuck with JRS in 103.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to learn how to analyze data. It's a bit hard in terms of the exams, but its not a bad stats class. You learn how to use statistical softwares and how to analyze data sets, and all these are good skills to have. The problem sets can be a bit tricky at times but office hours are extremely helpful.",
    "It's a fair amount of work but JDRS is very lively and makes stats interesting even though it's sort of a dull subject. Take social science if you can because you get JDRS for the whole semester.",
    "If you ever want to understand statistics, then this is the class you have to take!",
    "This class is a very, very general introduction to statistics. Don't expect a lot of math or calculations - instead there will be a lot of running data through a computer program (MINITAB) and interpreting the results. With one or two exceptions, the problem sets are pretty easy and the exams are not horrible. There's definitely a bigger stress on broad concepts than specific equations or bits of math. It's not a gut, but not very satisfying or engaging either. If you've had AP Stats, or are inclined to challenge yourself, I'd definitely take a higher level class. I took AP Stats in high school, and I wish I'd taken a more challenging, thorough course.",
    "Intro Stats",
    "I have mixed feeling about this course, mostly negative. On one hand, I fell behind early in the semester and never caught up, so that's largely my fault. On the other hand, I started meeting with a QR tutor, and I found the concepts to be MUCH more understandable under his instruction. Jonathan David Reuning-Scherer is nice, but I think he doesn't understands just how dense his hand-outs are.",
    "Yes. Honestly, stats is really useful and you will need to take an intro course at some point, so you might as well take 103 with Prof. Reuning-Scherer because a) it's practically no work, b) the material itself is easy, c) Prof. Reuning-Scherer will kind of remind you of Will Ferrell, and d) from what I understand it's the best among the intro stats classes. Psets take all of 30 minutes (except the one on probability which will take ~1 or 2 hrs), the exams are straightforward and easy, and you can get away with skipping lecture whenever you want. Go for it.",
    "If you're in this class because you want a QR and don't need to take Stats for your major... Stop and Think. There are much, much easier, more entertaining classes you can take to fulfill the requirement. If you want to take a \"useful\" QR, stop and think. Will multiple regression, Analysis of Variance, and Chi Squared Tests really do anything for you in the long-run, even intellectually?That said, JDRS is FANTASTIC. Take the course with him if you're able to. He seems very happy doing what he's doing, and the happiness might just rub off on you, through his jokes (which I, I'll admit, enjoyed wholeheartedly).There is plenty of help available for students like me who just cannot do math (so do yourself a service and take advantage of them; I cannot stress enouygh how it will transform your grade), but as the course goes on, the homework assignments get easier. The midterms are OK, but the exam very difficult.",
    "Taking this class with JDRS is probably the best way to learn statistics. The material is often dry and the problem sets can be tedious and annoying, but he always comes the lecture with plenty of enthusiasm and corny jokes. His lectures are also very clear and easy to follow, but I wouldn't recommend skipping class and just downloading the powerpoints - I think his instruction is really helpful to understanding the concepts. Definitely take advantage of JDRS's office hours to get help with the problem sets - if you get stuck, he'll often lead you step-by-step through the problem, just short of giving you the answer (but you do have to work out some of it for yourself). This class doesn't emphasize the math involved at all, but rather it focuses on memorizing when to apply the statistical methods that you learn. There's probably an easier section to take than STAT 103, but it's a good way to fulfill the requirements for certain majors.",
    "The course was a good introduction, however, the second half (103) got old. Not too difficult, the problem sets were relatively easy and the exams were reasonable. I'd imagine this is the hardest track.",
    "Don't take it unless you need it. Not an extremely hard class but somewhat painful.",
    "I would recommend it for a QR credit if you prefer the application to the theory of math. Based on what I heard about the material covered in the other sections this one requires a little bit more effort, but it's definitely worth it to take it with JDRS.",
    "The professor is pretty engaging and funny. Weekly problem sets, 2 midterms, and a final. The final was a surprise since it very descriptive and not quantitative. The curve was very strange since midterms were adjusted so that some people could be bumped up 10+ points, while others were pushed down a point. Not sure how there's a final curve in the end. Very heavy on Minitab use, and not much working with equations and complicated math. If you're looking for an intro stats class, I would recommend this course.",
    "It is just very very boring. Don't take it during your freshman year.",
    "Fine if you're trying to get a requirement out of the way, but, if you actually want to feel like you've learned something, this probably won't satisfy you -- there's too much Minitab and not enough focus on the math. Try STAT238 instead.",
    "If you can manage to stay awake during lecture, it's worth taking, at least for QR. Not very difficult at all.",
    "For sure. Prof. RS makes stats the most interesting and funny subject in the world! His sense of humor is really what gets me going in this relatively dry field of statistics. He somehow just have the magic power to make all those dead and dense concepts come alive, by using all this hilarious stories and metaphors.The class, though, goes very fast. So sometimes it is a bit difficult to keep up. but overall, what a class!",
    "i had to take it. if you dont have to i would not recommend this one",
    "Yes, if you've taken AP Stats. Yes, if you're good with math. Maybe not if you're just looking for a QR.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially if this student needs a QR credit. Statistics is important for pretty much every field so I definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it if they need to take statistics for a major requirement, or if they are interested in statistics. The tests were fair, and the work load was not that bad.",
    "I hate all forms of stats, so I only took this class because I needed it for my major. Not surprisingly, the material was extremely dry and annoying, but that's probably just me. Prof. JDRS is a good lecturer, and does his best to make the class entertaining, but his homework and exam questions are also pretty unconventional sometimes and you don't know what he's asking for. Also, you don't need a textbook at all. I got one of the books JDRS recommended to us and it was absolutely useless.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. And get a tutor at the beginning of the semester to do all your work with- they run out quickly. Use minitab not spss, even if that means going to the computer lab (minitab doesn't work on macs). He only gives directions for how to do things in minitab, not spss. Although this class is the only time you'll ever use minitab- the rest of the world uses spss.",
    "Take it with JRS, even if it is a section that doesn't seem like it applies",
    "This class is definitely not a gut, but a good QR for social science\/humanities students. It moves quickly, so definitely go to class and start the psets as early as possible. If you go to Professor Reuning-Scherer's office hours he will explain the homework assignments to you so there's no reason not to go to office hours.",
    "If you're reading this, chances are you have to take it for your major. Setting that aside, I actually loved this stats course. JDRS really teaches you exactly what is important, and you don't bother with any stats that is too theoretical or anything that you don't actually need to know. It's great. No homework aside from a pretty easy problem set. Lectures are very engaging; his humor is super cheesy but in an endearing way. GREAT stats class",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend the course.",
    "Stats sucks. This class is super boring although Reuning-Scherer tries to make it as enjoyable as possible. I wouldn't recommend taking this class unless it is absolutely, 100% necessary for you. Total waste of time.",
    "harder than you think. if u want it to be hard, take a section with JDRS. If you don't, take it with anyone else.",
    "JDRS is great at lecturing and pretty funny. Just make sure to actually go to class, pay attention, and understand the homework. The tests can get tricky because some questions are about understanding and interpreting the concepts rather than just using a formula."
