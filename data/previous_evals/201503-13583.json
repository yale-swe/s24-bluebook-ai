    "Take this class as a fifth course or if you're looking for something somewhat related to food.",
    "Italian Food and Culture is an exceptionally enjoyable course, concerned with dissecting the various themes and portrayals of Italian food culture as well as its social, political, and global ramifications. The course material includes Italian film and literature as well as a study of relevant current events and movements. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with a passion for food, especially when paired with a love of Italian culture.",
    "Overall a good class. I read and watched some of my new favorite books and movies in this class. The discussions were enjoyable, but the class time will only be as fruitful as the group makes it. I would recommend this to a fellow student interested in food and literature.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend. Discussions and readings got a little dull sometimes. We read about themes and analyzed how they use food as symbols of the themes or other connections between characters and food.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! It was very culturally enriching in general but with a fun twist of learning more about food. I would recommend to anyone with an interest in Italian Literature (taught in English) as well as anyone who loves to talk or write about food!"
