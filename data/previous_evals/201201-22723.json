    "If you are looking at this, you probably don't have a choice but to write the senior essay. That being said, it is a great experience. The department is incredibly supportive and I would highly recommend it!",
    "All in all, you get what you put into it. I had a strong relationship and schedule set up with my advisor, so I knew where I was going. It's up to you at this point as a senior writer to get yourself on track and figure out how to plan with your advisor. In short, I would suggest getting all of your benchmarks and plans set out early on with your advisor with plenty of meetings, because the official structure of the class will not be planning your writing for you.",
    "start writing early -- its important. remember to stay focused and narrow on your topic. ask your adviser to give you a deadline to submit a draft --- its soooo helpful."
