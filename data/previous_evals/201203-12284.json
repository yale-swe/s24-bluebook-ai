   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. If you take the time to read carefully and engage in the material, you will walk away armed with new theories about literature and a good basis in Russian fiction. This class helped me hone my analysis of works and taught me how to distinguish Russian writers from those of other nationalities. Additionally, I learned a great deal about Russian history\/culture and religious and political philosophy. Take this class if you want to learn from the best, but not if you are looking to expound on your own theories or have a pressing need to be \"original\" in your analyses. For me, this class was about reading great books and listening to an expert talk about them.",
    "Definitely recommend it - one of my favorite classes during first semester. Gives you a different perspective on the books you read.",
    "If you're interested in Russian fiction, or improving your writing skills, take this class. If you're looking for a low-stress writing course...maybe not. You write papers every other week, and have to at least be familiar with the writing. The novels are great, and Prof. Alexandrov's tangents on Russian history are really interesting, but make sure to put in the work if you're going to take this class.",
    "A very enjoyable seminar which exposes you to great works of Russian literature. I recommend this course to the voracious reader. Alexandrov makes constant references to Anna Karenina, The Brothers Karamazov and War and Peace, but they aren't covered by the class. So, it might be instructive to read one of those first, even if only to get an idea of what a Russian novel really feels like.",
    "Take this freshman seminar now (if you can get in)!!!!!! I was so lucky to get into this class: Professor Alexandrov is a magnanimous genius, the texts are fantastic (with perhaps the exception of the ridiculously confusing Petersburg), and we had some great discussions. There are 6 papers (5 short), so you'll be writing a lot, but it's worth it. And make sure to talk to Professor Alexandrov about his writing outside of Yale and his life generally -- he's a fascinating person. Do everything you can to get in!",
    "I would recommend Russian 022 to any student interested in Russian fiction because that is the foremost concern of the class. It covers really great books, especially when entering the more modern era, and doesn't overwhelm with too much writing either. Because of the relative lack of writing, however, class time is really the time to think about and share ideas about the book since the papers are so focused. You'll regret taking it if you don't really want to contribute, as it will be more than an hour of your day wasted twice a week.",
    "Recommended, but don't slack off or it will be impossible to catch up.",
    "This is an amazing class with an amazing professor. Take it if you can get in. It helped me think about literature differently and we read a lot of really great books, and Professor Alexandrov is the best. So take it."
