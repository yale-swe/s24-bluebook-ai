    "A+++ class. I took this course instead of one required for my major (the lab times conflicted) and I don't regret my decision at all. I had a lot of fun building random things. I come from a STEM background, so the homework never felt like that much, but I could see it taking much longer if you aren't used to psets. The lecture itself is a bit forgettable, but you will absolutely love getting to build stuff. The labs throughout the semester will prepare you well for the final project, when you get to make anything you want. The instructors are dedicated beyond belief (who else arrives at the CEID at 9 and stays until 8??) and make the class a lot of fun. If you can get in- take this class! Be prepared though- at the end of the semester, you WILL spend like 80+ hours on your final project. Be wary of taking this class with others that have big end-of-semester projects.",
    "Learn about how instruments work and build your own. The teaching staff is amazing, and building instruments is tons of fun. Lecture will be very easy to understand if you come from a STEM background.",
    "If you love physics and music and want to dabble in creating instruments, this course is made for you.",
    "By far the best part of this class are the midterm and final projects. Those are when you learn the most and also have the most fun. Lectures tend toward boring and uninspired and the psets generally were poorly written and felt like a waste of time. I suppose it's a weakness of having to cater toward a really unique mix of students; engineering majors AND music majors, so the math can't be *too* hard. But in the end it feels kind of lame; you don't really learn that much during class time that you couldn't learn in about 30 minutes of googling (or that anyone who is interested in sound\/acoustics doesn't already know). Shoppers should be aware that there is a 3 HOUR LAB every week in addition to lecture time. Half of these labs are kinda cool (circuit building comes to mind) but a lot of them are limited by the fact that the CEID only has so many tools. But man, the projects are so fun and you DO learn a lot from those.",
    "This class is amazing!! Fair warning that it's also a lot of work, 2 lectures, lab, and a problem set each week, and prepare to spend a lot of time on the final project. Lecture covers basics of physics and acoustics as well as an introduction to how electronic instruments work. Labs involve building prototype instruments that relate to concepts discussed during lecture. Larry and Konrad are both great and getting to build your own instrument is awesome! Just make sure you have time for it in your schedule.",
    "I would of course recommend but only for those who are ready to dedicate time to it. It should be taken in a semester with 4 courses not 5. It is more math\/sciencey than expected but for the final project musical skill end up helping you out more.",
    "Take it.",
    "If you have the chance, take this class. It's the most exceptional course at Yale, no prior experience at the CEID required. It will take up a good amount of your time toward the end of the semester, so account for that - but it's all worth it.",
    "A crazy, awesome, and uber difficult experience. It will take over your semester AND be very stressful. But you will learn a ton.",
    "A really intense investigation into musical acoustics and instrument design. Absolutely incredible-- one of the best classes I've ever taken. Would recommend to any student interested in music, acoustics, and electronic\/acoustic instrument design. Very large workload but it's the kind of work you want to be doing. So glad I took this class-- one of the best.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are willing to put a lot of time into the final project. You won't learn much from the class or labs, but the chance to make an instrument with all the support of the TAs, professors, and CEID staff is unique. Beware the work load of the final project. If you aren't willing to put 20-30 hours a week into the project for the last 3 weeks of the semester don't take this class."
