    "I would absolutely recommend Chinese 150 to any Yale student. I learned more vocabulary in this class than in the past two years combined, and my grammar improved dramatically. The professors are generous and kind, and I'm looking forward to taking more classes with them in the future.",
    "Take this course because you want to continue studying Chinese, and this is your only option. It is bearable, but not fantastic. It is better than the average Yale class but worse than the average Chinese class. This was a bit of a disappointment after spending the summer in Beijing, but that was to be expected. That being said, the quality of the course was still worse than in L1 and L2. The textbook is outdated, the readings are weird, and the vocab and grammar is also not solidified well. This course helps your reading skill substantially, your writing and listening skills to some degree, and does almost nothing to help your speaking fluency. Li Laoshi is a good instructor, Mu laoshi is not. The only reason I am still taking this course next semester is because I love Chinese.",
    "Definitely would recommend. Alot of work but entirely worth it.",
    "Definitely a great continuation of Chinese at the L5 level. Sometimes it's a little unclear what grammar will be tested on the exams, but the classroom environment is a great one.",
    "If you really want your Chinese to improve, this class is for you. The hard work feels heavy at first, but I quickly became used to the memorization and reading each night. The teachers are great, and they make sure our topics are stimulating, so you won't be bored and you'll feel like you're learning how to converse in Chinese about important topics.",
    "Chinese 150 is a rather advanced class that furthers your understanding of Chinese grammar, characters, reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills greatly.",
    "A continuation of Chinese 130-140 but with more work and writing but with less memorization in class. However, you have to prepare more for each class.",
    "Chinese 150 is a character and grammar heavy Chinese course that works to expand the array of ways in which one can express a given idea or sentiment. Absolutely would recommend to another student. Though there is a good amount of work, none of it ever feels as if it is in vain. It feels like progress gets made every day both in and out of class.",
    "Course has a weekly pattern of assignments. Once you get into it, it goes very smoothly. As long as you are willing to put a considerable amount of time into preparation, the course is not hard. CHNS 150 was by far my most fun class, since you get to know your classmates through classroom discussion."
