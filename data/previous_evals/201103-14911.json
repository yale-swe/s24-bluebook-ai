   "comments": [
    "Yes!",
    "I think it's a pretty self-explanatory class. You talk about bad things that people do within the realm of research science. I would recommend it if it was not mandatory.",
    "Yes. Its a good introductory course for introducing new graduate students to the expectations and etiquette of the scientific community. It highlights scenarios where this etiquette is broken and seeks to understand the reasons why, as well as the consequences of this behaviour. This course also teaches the expectations of one who accepts fellowship or grant funding for scientific research, as well as how that money is appropriately handled.",
    "Chem 590 investigates ethical dilemmas which we are most likely to experience at some point in our scientific careers. Yes, I would recommend this class to another student, because it brought up several ethical scenarios which I had not even considered. I enjoyed this class a lot.",
    "Ethics class which will make you aware of unethical habits that you may be confronted with. Yes, it is good to be exposed to knowing that certain things are unethical and also helpful to be provided with how to deal with certain actions you may observe in the future that you may be shy to address.",
    "You have to take it. It's short, it's sweet, it's at the end of the day when you can't think about anything besides dinner.",
    "I would recommend the class--it's not much work, but if you're paying any attention at all it will make you think.",
    "Chem 590 was a survey of ethics in the scientific field.I suppose I'd recommend it. I'm pretty sure it's mandatory now, but it's a painless and, I think, necessary exercise in ethics, so there is no reason not to take it.",
    "I would recommend it. For a required course it was more fun than I had expected."

   "comments": [
    "I had not considered many of the ethical issues from class before. I learned a lot in a short period of time.",
    "It has helped prepare me to interact with other scientists. This course taught what is expected from funding agencies or entities when one accepts a grant or fellowship money. It has helped identify areas of common mal-behaviour and how to identify such behaviour.",
    "This course made me think about some of the gray areas in scientific research and the difficulty in making ethical decisions. I will obviously try my best to follow the ethical standards that I have set for myself, which will hopefully be reflected in my dissertation and future research.",
    "Will aid in the future if unethical actions are noticed within the lab or if you're faced with one yourself you'll know how to handle the situtation to the best of your ability.",
    "I won't cheat, I promise!",
    "While a lot of the material covered in class seems really obvious, this class was a good reminder for what we should and should not do. It was definitely worth the time.",
    "It definitely gets us thinking about situations that we might not have considered. I think it's worthwhile to have some guidance in terms of what is and isn't ethical and how to avoid tripping into those situations. I think that that will end up being a valuable lesson as we go out and begin our doctoral research projects.",
    "Knowledge of ethics is essential to any discipline, and this course definitely raised the key questions even if there are no readily available answers."
