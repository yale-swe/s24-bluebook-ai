   "comments": [
    "In some places an interesting course, and one where we touch on a lot of subjects not discussed anywhere else at Yale. However, I felt the class was often so anecdotal that I did not really learn anything expect personal stories.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend Issues in Special Education to another student. From a Teacher Prep perspective, this type of learning is invaluable. From a psychological perspective, it was nice to have a chance and examine some of the ways in which the more theoretical concepts and facts you learn in other classes can actually be employed in the real world. The class doesn't entail an overload of excessive reading or work, but if you put effort into the four major assignments not only will you develop a firm understanding of current issues in the field of special education, but you will also learn about yourself as a uniquely special learner. I really looked forward to this seminar each week. The two-hour sessions, all of which were filled with a lot of laughter, flew by every week, and I left the semester with a store of truly useful information.",
    "I would say, if you have any interest in the topic, TAKE THE CLASS. It is not only fun, but Professor Shiller has some great advice.",
    "This course is relatively easy and interesting, but some class time is wasted and lacking in direction.",
    "an eye opening experience",
    "The work is easy but the course may not be worth your time.",
    "Good fifth class. The course is better if you are a self motivated student. If not, you may feel that you are not learning anything. Good to take if you are thinking about teaching in the future.",
    "yes..especially if youre in TP!",
    "yes"
