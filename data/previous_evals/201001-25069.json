   "comments": [
    "Be prepared. You read and talk and think about lots of really interesting topics (e.g. counterfactuals, time travel, color, modality, naming, causation), but you have to be prepared to struggle with readings and lectures. The workload actually wasn't that heavy (~40-80 pages a week, a 10-page paper, midterm and final) but the material is pretty darn esoteric. We had a great study group at the end of the class but I wish we had established one earlier. I would definitely recommend befriending a few kids in the class and going over things together throughout the semester. Professor Whittle is fun to listen to but most of the class is spent trying to understand what a given author is saying about something, then looking at objections, and then questioning the view and the objections until your head is spinning and you're not sure you understand how anyone can hold any of the positions that came up. A classmate crudely described the class as a mindf***. In a great way! I have mixed feelings. I'm really glad I took the class and want to continue to study metaphysics, but the class was really a trip. Hard to warn you exactly what you're getting yourself into. If you go along for the ride just put your head down and do it and enjoy thinking about everything as much as you can, but you'll have to just throw your hands up every now and then and just say, \"WHAT are we talking about?\"",
    "I would certainly recommend the class. The material is so interesting from four-dimensionalism all the way through interpretation of color. The class also tends to be quite small so it feels more like a seminar.",
    "Take this course if you want a course in which it is never necessary to attend class (you can learn everything through the readings or online), or you want an easy A- without working too strenuously, or you're a philosophy student and want the metaphysical requirement.",
    "A reasonably good course. I couldn't possibly summarize it for you, but if you shop it you'll quickly know if it's something you can handle."
