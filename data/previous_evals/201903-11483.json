    "I developed intermediary knowledge of Egyptian hieroglyphics. The many texts we read from also furthered my understanding of Egyptian culture and literary practices.",
    "I learned how to transliterate and translate existing texts. I also learned how to discuss the different options of translations with other students. We also talked about some Egyptian history as well and different kinds of texts and artifacts which was really interesting.",

   "comments": [
    "The instructor did not always provide clear instruction on how to prepare for each week's class.",
    "Syllabus could be improved to more closely align with what we did in class and what our assignments were. The small class size is nice for learning in-depth.",
    "I don't really have complaints about this class. Sometimes we'd get off topic, but it didn't really affect my learning. It's just good old Egyptian hieroglyphs.",
    "The small class size was a great strength. It ensured that everyone prepared for class and that we all had an opportunity to share our translations. A weakness of the course was the lack of structure with which we learned new grammar constructs. The grammar lessons were always contingent on what we encountered in the texts, which was great for practical knowledge but unhelpful since we could not practice the grammar if it did not come up again in another text.",
    "I think the strengths were that it was really nice to be able to talk about the different options for translations. For most of the texts we were translating, scholars are still debating what the correct translations are so it was nice to be able to add to the conversation without it being overly strict.",
    "After two more structured semesters, I quite liked the casual nature of this course. I felt like we had a lot of room to talk about subjects that interested us."

   "comments": [
    "Well, you probably need to take L3 anyways for your language credit. If you're an exception, then I'd take L3 anyways because the class is very fun and the workload is crazy manageable.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, especially if the student has already finished L1 and L2 of Egyptian hieroglyphics.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because you get to actually take what you've learned about transliterating and translating hieroglyphics and use it for real texts which is very interesting. It's also a fun class because it's small so you get close to the people in it which is really nice.",
    "If you've made it through the prerequisites, definitely!"
