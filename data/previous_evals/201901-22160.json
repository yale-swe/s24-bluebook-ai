    "This course helped me reconceptualise the way that I view vague, often heavily oversimplified notions like 'culture', 'rights', 'faith', 'modernity', 'tradition', and 'sexual orientation'. I feel like the course was my first step towards reframing my preconceptions of the world through a WGSS lens, and it was an excellent introduction to these concepts. I improved my ability to thoroughly & carefully break down complex academic concepts, and gained confidence when it came to taking a stab at something I wasn't certain about, or admitting that I was out of my depth."

   "comments": [
    "The course has an incredibly strong and well-oriented syllabus, which in my opinion could only have been improved by the expansion of readings and literature around gender identity and\/or transgender\/nonbinary existence. A lot of the weaknesses of the course were only due to the small size of the class, which was completely out of all of our control! I really enjoyed the 'blog post' approach, as it encouraged us to be more informal and focus on our personal interests when it came to engaging with the readings."

    "Definitely. The readings are varied and interesting but get you to think seriously about a lot of different questions, and Evren is incredibly clear and will hold you accountable for doing the readings but is also extremely kind and a lot of fun.",
    "Absolutely - I learned so much in a very stimulating, if sometimes intimidating, academic & interpersonal environment."
