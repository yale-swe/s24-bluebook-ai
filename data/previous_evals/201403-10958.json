   "comments": [
    "GLBL 801 outlines the core principles of microeconomics while providing some real-world business and policy applications. I would recommend GLBL 801 to another global affairs or social sciences student, as I thought it was very helpful in understanding microeconomics and microeconomic applications to policy.",
    "This is a required course. This is a Microeconomics course for policymakers.",
    "I would tell a fellow student that this class is an intermediate microeconomics class that will really drill down the material for a solid understanding. Yes, I would recommend the class because it will be useful in almost any position in the policy world.",
    "Policy focused micro course.",
    "GLBL 801 is a core requirement of the Global Affairs degree program. It is a graduate-level introduction to key microeconomic concepts: supply and demand, consumer behavior and producer decisionmaking, market equilibriums, how individuals and firms respond to incentives and regulations, and market failures\/externalities.",
    "Applied Microeconomics for Practitioners. I would certainly recommend it, especially for those who are intimidated by math-heavy economics courses or new to the subject material.",
    "If the course was not required, I would not recommend it to a fellow student. The course might be ideal for someone who wants a single course on econ, but for anyone with some familiarity with the discipline or who wants to explore these themes in greater depth, the course falls short. To those students, I would recommend a more rigorous course in the econ department or in SOM.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's a great introduction and relatively painless for a required course.",
    "Great introduction to micro-economics. I would highly recommend this course to others",
    "I strongly recommend. Its really for policy makers.",
    "Yes, very helpful if no prior knowledge of economics.",
    "GLBL 801 is an introduction to basic concepts in microeconomics, tailored to support people interested in pursuing professional opportunities in public policy. For students with limited background in math and economics, this is an excellent introduction.",
    "Micro concepts, tailored for the future policymaker."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it definitely has, as I am interested in economic policy, and this course had many direct applications to policy and business.",
    "A knowledge of economics is essential for anyone looking to work in foreign policy. These concepts are foundational and will be helpful for courses I plan to take in international development economics.",
    "I think macro may be a more useful course for global affairs students, but this course definitely helped me understand topics that will affect the work I do after I leave Yale.",
    "This course involved application of microconomic concepts to real-world problems to an extent I had not previously undertaken. It has deepened my understanding of foundational ideas in economic policy.",
    "After a long break from academia, I needed a good refresher to these concepts, since i plan to make economics a foundational element of my Master's studies.",
    "Not very much. Case studies were the single largest contributions to my knowledge of the interplay of economics in global affairs. Would have liked more policy analysis and some macroeconomics as well.",
    "The topics that this lesson covered were directly related to real world. It provided a wide perspective.",
    "NA",
    "The course was a solid overview of how economic approaches are sometimes considered in confronting public policy issues."
