    "Strength: - various guest instructors, basically cover many cancer subtypes, you'll find one that interests you - Professor Cartmel is super nice - Below average coursework Weakness: - Some homework are not very helpful",
    "great speakers!",
    "I really enjoyed learning from experts in the field and getting a breadth of information from various sources in cancer epidemiology.",
    "I liked the two assignments, they helped me grasp the class material. I also liked the guest lecturers.",
    "The content is great. I suggest adding one or two presentation exercises for students.",
    "I enjoyed learning about the epidemiology of major cancers from guest lecturers who are experts in their fields. It was interesting to hear different perspectives of cancer from health care professionals and researchers with varying backgrounds.",
    "The course provides plenty knowledge relating to the cancer Epidemiology, it gives you the opportunity to learn the basic knowledge and change of different cancers.",
    "Professor Cartmel invited many excellent professors to come to teach in class which is really good but may lack a clear system.",
    "The course provides a very introductory and holistic overview of cancer epidemiology. The guest lecturers were great, and so were Brenda's lectures, albeit a bit dry."

    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0very engaging and interesting topics",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0some times the lectures were too packed with slides making it hard to grasp onto the important details for the specific cancer topic. Professor Cartmel does cover most of the bases in addressing the current issues in cancer epidemiology.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Dr. Cartmel is a very supportive professor and provided good feedback on our work.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Professor Cartmel is very humble, knowledgeable, and forthright.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Professor Cartmel truly cares about her students' learning and wellbeing but it would be nice if she could give the course more structure. Learning about specific cancers from experts in the field was an eye-opening experience but the lecturers all emphasized different points so I felt stressed studying for the final exam because the material was disjointed and there was a lot of information.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Brenda is excellent in explaining the knowledge and she is also very patient and caring for the students.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Dr. Cartmel is one of the kindest people Ive met at Yale. I loved this class, and learned a lot. Favorite course.",

    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Awesome.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Brenda is lovely and provides great feedback for our assignments. Again, some of the lectures were dry, but I think that was just the nature of the content."

   "comments": [
    "It's a fairly easy course where lots of guest speaker comes to talk about their specialty and research. Very helpful for 1st year students who are interested in cancer but don't know what specific type of cancer to specialize. Workload is relatively low.",
    "definitely take! if interested in cancer, this gives a great overview of many different cancers",
    "this is an interesting course where you learn first hand from experts in the field who are doing relevant research in the specified area. I also really enjoyed learning the number of various topics in the cancer sites.",
    "This class covers the epidemiology of common cancers, mostly in the US. Lots of guest lecturers, not particularly demanding.",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "This class is a survey course for cancer epidemiology. Although I think it is important to cover the major cancer topics, I would like the course to be more cohesive because I often feel guest lecturers want to emphasize different things so studying for the final exam was not a particularly enjoyable experience. Overall, the workload is light and the material is interesting so I would recommend the class for people who want to get general knowledge on cancer epidemiology.",
    "It's a great course to learn basic knowledge about cancer Epidemiology. I would strongly recommend it.",
    "The class is good for an introduction to different cancers.",
    "basics about cancer",
    "Absolutely recommend, especially if you're interested in pursuing further studies\/career in cancer epidemiology."
