    "There really is no reason to take this course if you're not going to be a math or math and philosophy major. It's interesting, yes, but the work expected does not mesh with the information taught in lecture that well. That being said, there are only 6 problem sets for the whole course and that is the only work required. Professor Shin gives out the notes for each lecture as well. Other than that, I'd say there are better QRs.",
    "I would recommend it for students interested in math and philosophy. It is definitely not a gut class and would probably seem too abstract to most people.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in logic. The material isn't terribly exciting unless you care a bit about the fundamentals of logic and logical systems. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who didn't like PSet style courses, as the entire grade depended on a single PSet.",
    "People are quick to complain about how difficult this class is. They're wrong. It's very straightforward, and the psets aren't that difficult. The problem is that most students who take this course are Philosophy majors. Most of them are too used to pretentious obscurity and never dealt with rigorous, mathematical thinking before. Naturally, this course would be hard for anyone who hasn't any experience constructing formal proofs. But otherwise, the truly difficult parts of the Completeness Theorem were all proved in class. The psets were extremely easy by comparison, only dealing with the finer details, often telling us to fill in some missing portions of a proof we discussed in class. Office hours are very useful, and the class is very predictable. Psets every other week + 3 week long final pset worth 40% of your grade, and the class is finished before Thanksgiving break, leaving more time during reading week to focus on other finals. Overall, I really enjoyed thisclass and feel like I understand the Completeness Theorem and basic mathematical logic much more profoundly.",
    "If you're interested in Logic, take it. If you come from a philosophy rather than a math\/comp sci background, it'll probably be harder for you. Be prepared for intense problem sets that require lots of work though.",
    "You have to like manipulating notation. The ideas are intimidating but not that hard.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in the topic and to any philosophy major who needs to a fulfill a QR. Taking first order logic before this is helpful, but with a little extra work in the early weeks, I'm sure it would be fine to start right with math logic.",
    "I enjoyed this course, though not really because of the material. The TA (Sungil) was amazing, and I found a buddy to do all the HWs with and to joke about the class, so it ended up being quite fun. The HW is also strangely satisfying if you're on top of it. It feels good to get a proof done, and to know that it's right, plus you feel smart writing all those funky symbols. In fact, I actually think that there should have been more HW. Sun-joo is right that you only understand this stuff when you're forced to do it yourself, and we only had problem sets every two weeks. Should have been shorter problem sets, every week, in my opinion. The take-home final was nice, though.Sun-Joo is charming and funny, but I must say that I got a lot more out of section than out of lecture. Towards the end especially, she was racingto get done, and it wasn't always particularly clear. The lecture notes were great, though. The textbook (Enderton) is horrible; don't buy it. Or, if you do, do so just to read Sun-joo's funny quote on the back.Sungil was the best TA I've ever had. Period. So committed, so clear, so patient, so kind. Everyone in the class was in love with Sungil, myself included.",
    "This class is a continuous course that really hurts people who are unable to attend regularly. So do attend regularly to everything, else you'll fall behind too much and be forced to drop the class.",
    "This is a great class. Take it if you\u0092re interested in logic; it is similar to a proof-based math class. The whole course is framed like a puzzle. The goal: prove the soundness and completeness of first order logic. You probably shouldn\u0092t take it for an easy QR, but it could be an *interesting* QR. Background in writing proofs would help, but taking PHIL 115 (the \u0093prerequisite\u0094) first is certainly not necessary. If you have taken neither 115 nor another proof-based course, then the class would still be possible but you should shop with a bit more caution. The lectures are conducted well\u0097Sun-Joo really knows her stuff\u0097and you don\u0092t need to take detailed notes because you receive excellent lecture notes for each class. The textbook (Enderton) is dense, but the professor\u0092s lecture notes are sufficient for the homework. There were no exams; instead there were 6 problem sets, with ample and speedy feedback. The last was worth 40% of the grade and took me around 50 hours, so be sure to set aside time during Thanksgiving Break or Reading Period, depending on when it\u0092s due. Take this class if you like puzzles and proofs\u0097solving each problem was very rewarding.",
    "The people who write that this is an easy course are probably mostly people who have significant background in mathematics. As a philosophy major with barley any such background, I found this class to be very difficult at times, but also very fun and rewarding. Sun-Joo is sweet and funny but very very difficult to understand (largely because of her accent, her penchant for tangents, and her breakneck speed). Thus she takes quite a while to get used to. However, going to lecture is optional and often not necessary if you go to section, work hard on the problem sets, and seek help from other students and the TF. The workload consists of problem sets every other week (you usually have about a week to complete them). The final problem set (the take home final) is much longer than the rest of the problem sets, and you have more than two weeks to complete it. Two of the problem sets gave me all-nighters (#3 and the final). Lastly, if the TF is Sungil, you should really take advantage of his patience and helpfulness.",
    "Absolutely! One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Not too much work for anyone with a bit of background in math and proofs. The course builds propositional logic and first order logic from the ground up, and proves the soundness and completeness of both systems. It starts out very easy and gets much trickier about halfway through. Professor Shin is fantastic. Her lectures are extremely clear, and even entertaining! (Pretty rare for a course whose lectures consist almost entirely of definitions, theorems, and proofs.) She always makes sure to talk about the \"big picture\" as well, so you come away with not just an understanding of the mechanics of a particular proof, but why it is important (or not important, as she may joke) and how it relates to everything else we're learning. Section is optional. I thought the material was fun and interesting, but some other people find it dull and pointless. If you're remotely interested in logic, though, you'll enjoy this class!",
    "This is one of the most fascinating classes in the philosophy department. The entire semester is devoted to proving one theorem, which, obviously, is very important. But moreover, this is a proof-based class demanding enough to be intellectually stimulating but still very reasonable in workload and difficulty. I cannot imagine having gotten through this class without having taken first-order logic, even though FOL was only rarely used in this class. FOL is important because it helps you understand what this class is all about and why it is important within philosophy. I did very well in this class, even though I have not taken any math classes at Yale (with the exception of FOL as a QR). Ultimately, its six problem sets (five regular ones and one take-home final) were very reasonable and required very creative thinking in order to solve them, but it was an incredibly rewarding experience finishing the last problem set and finishing the class. There were long nights of staring at one problem endlessly, but those too were very helpful in my personal growth. Sun-Joo is a great professor: she is always very focused and organized. She has clear lecture notes; I found going to section a very important part of understanding this class, even though section is optional. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "To those who are thinking about taking this class because you liked First-Order Logic: beware. Mathematical Logic really is nothing like doing proofs within the logical system. It is a meta-discussion about the logical language using mathematical tools, and the activities that you do really don't resemble what you did in first-order. It is also much much more difficult than that class: there were very distinct concepts in Phil 115: there were just varying levels of subtleness in how you learned to apply the tools. But in Mathematical, there are dozens of new terms and ideas every class that are very hard to keep track of, even if you pay attention in lectures. That being said, the problem sets were very doable, and even though it was hard and took a lot of work, it didn't weigh on the course schedule very hard because there were only problem sets every other week. And doing proofs was still fun, even though it didn't make me feel like I was becoming a better philosopher. Sun-Joo is still fun,but far less clear than in 115. This is definitely still the best way for a PHIL major to satisfy the second QR; it's rigorous, a good set-up for more interesting philosophy of logic, and you're in it with a bunch of other phil majors who are also probably struggling."
