    "Definitely take this class it is really interesting and actually very applicable to many current situations outside of the Balkans. You basically just talk about nationality and identity theory. Assignments are reasonable and Greenberg is perhaps the nicest man you'll ever meet.",
    "I don't think it's being offered again.",
    "At the beginning of the course, you do know feel nearly qualified enough to contribute to a meaningful discussion about the former Yugoslavia. However, with each week's readings and videos building on one another, you feel by the end to be quite conversant in topics related to the break up of Yugoslavia, and more generally about the politics of language and identity.Would definitely recommend this course, but unfortunately Professor Greenberg is leaving!",
    "Truly an end of an era. So much interesting material, coupled with a professor who was amazingly caring, spirited, and knowledgeable. Whoever takes on this course next will surely have big shoes to fill!",
    "A good class, though with Professor Greenberg being gone, it likely will not be offered anymore.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "Good course on the Balkans. Take it if interested in language issues.",
    "It is a great discussion about the Balkans. I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about the breakup of Yugoslavia."
