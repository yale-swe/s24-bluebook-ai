    "An interesting lens through which to tackle the intersection of CS\/Music. I feel like I have a good grasp of Haskell coming out of it, and also see some of the possibilities for algorithmic computation. Homework aren't too bad, and are doable without going to lecture (unfortunately this semester Prof Hudak was very sick so Donya taught the whole class and while Donya knows pretty much everything about Haskell and Euterpea she's not a terribly engaging lecturer). Pretty easy and interesting CS elective, especially once you get into the cool haskell stuff, though you might have a tougher time if you don't know anything about music.",
    "As a math major I knew Haskell was going to be my favorite language when I finished CPSC201 a couple of years ago, but unfortunately I did not get to take this class when Prof. Hudak, may he rest in peace, was still teaching. We had a substitute lecturer Donya Quick all semester and she was given very short notice to prepare for the course due to Prof. Hudaks unanticipated departure. It was probably for this reason that the class felt pretty poorly organized especially for the first half of the course. We rarely used all 75 minutes for the lectures (she would run out of things to say usually after 60-65 minutes) and I wish we could have covered more in the lectures, since Haskell is such fascinating material. This is likely to change since Donya is now teaching the future Computer Music courses. There are weekly homework with very strict deadlines starting from the first week of shopping period, but the overall workload is fine. There are no exams and the final project is spread out into 3 weeks and can be from a wide range of things. You need very little music background to take the class, and although being able to read music is helpful, I dont think it is even a prerequisite since you can pretty easily pick up the tiny bits of music knowledge required for the class. If you are a musician you may be interested in algorithmic composition but for me, Haskell is the sole reason I took this class, and that is why I have the following probably biased opinion: We did not discuss at all the motivation behind Monads and Arrows and how they are useful in a generalized context, and were just presented their pointed-style syntax. I read about these topics on my own and they are one of the few most beautiful connections I have seen between pure math and computer science. I think the class would have been a lot more interesting to math- or programming-language-inclined students if these topics had been discussed instead of just presenting Monads and Arrows as merely Haskell syntactic features. I would absolutely recommend the class to all lovers of functional programming.",
    "You'll learn Haskell. You'll learn to use a musical library in Haskell to do cool things, if you're into that. If not, then don't. HASKELL IS PURTY SO LERN THAT."
