    "This was a great course! The professors had a wealth of knowledge to share and were very engaging. Professor Robinson has a ton of international experience, which made class discussions insightful.",
    "The pace of the class was too fast, because we meet on a daily basis for two weeks. There were not enough time to assimilate the topics learned in such short time.",
    "Professor Robinson and Professor Lye do an excellent job of presenting a breadth of material in an organized and coherent fashion. Even though the course only meets for 2 weeks, the time spent preparing a final paper (10,000 words) was where real individualized, focused research occurred. This class is valuable for anyone interested in getting to learn more about environmental law or even those already well versed. The course has something for everyone.",
    "My answers indicating that the pace of the class was too fast, and that the work level was high, are mostly related to the fact that this was a condensed class. I understand that this is to accommodate the schedules of visiting profs, so I don't really have a problem with it, but students considering the course in future should note that the work load will be very heavy for the relatively brief period of time when the class is in session. Overall, I found the class very worthwhile."

    "Fascinating lectures",
    "The eye opening perspective on how different cultures conceptualize the relationship between society and the environment, and their implications in legals systems.",
    "Very interesting discussions and clear explanations of legal systems.",
    "It was very enjoyable when students were able to present topics that they were knowledgeable about (Chinese legal system, the UN system, etc.) The one on one time the professors are willing to spend working with you on your paper was also extremely helpful and ultimately rewarding.",
    "I enjoyed having the perspective of two profs from outside Yale with extensive comparative law experience. I also really enjoyed hearing from other students about their areas of interest\/research. The readings were quite useful.",
    "The breadth and depth of knowledge held and shared by the professors. I learned so much.",

   "comments": [
    "More information regarding paper requirement can be sent out earlier to students. I would also be nice if the readings can be sent out earlier so that students can get a head start.",
    "Timing. Having the class in two weeks is extenuating. I don't know how Prof. Lye can be involved if offered in a different way.",
    "It was difficult to put a semster's worth of material into two weeks of class. Plus, students can only really start working on their papers by the end of February. It would have been nice to have a few introductory sessions with Prof. Robinson earlier in the semester so that we could space things out and start to think about the paper.",
    "It would be helpful if this 2 week course were offered earlier in the semester (or at least to have a preliminary meeting earlier in the semester) so as to get students thinking and researching for the final paper.",
    "Again, the timing poses a challenge, but I'm not sure this could be changed. Perhaps the syllabus could be released during shopping period? Or maybe there could be one or two class sessions with Prof Robinson early in the semester?",
    "It was a little difficult to attend class daily and I was unable to get through all of the material due to the compressed time period, but it was also beneficial to be immersed in learning the material daily and it may not work any other way for the professors schedules. An improvement, as discussed in class, would be to give students all of the reading materials early on in the beginning of the semester so that they can get a jumpstart, and to also host an introductory meeting to brainstorm research interests and start the ball rolling for initial research for papers.",
    "the course is too intense, wish it could extend to longer time"

    "They were available and willing to help all the time",
    "The instructors were extremely helpful via email or in person (when they were on campus).",
    "Randy was really great. I imagine coordinating the schedules of two visiting profs was quite challenging, but Randy managed it very well and was always available to answer questions about the class or help us get in touch with a prof if need be. I really appreciated his help and contribution to the class."

We cover a variety of jurisdictions and students have the opportunity to write a research paper on any environmental issue of their choice comparing two jurisdictions. This course is a great opportunity to explore issues of interest to you.",
    "Prepare the readings before the class begin.",
    "My advice would be to start thinking about your final paper topics early and consult with Professor Robinson and Professor Lye for guidance and content advice.",
    "Try to do the readings - and do them before the start of class, if you can. If you can carve out some time in your schedule for when class is in session, maybe by finishing other assignments early, you'll benefit from that. Otherwise, talk with Profs Lye and Robinson as much as possible - they were very willing to give feedback on papers etc"
