   "comments": [
    "A great deal of knowledge about constitutional law with economic application. Learned a lot about how marginalized groups are discriminated against.",
    "Constitutional interpretation. Civil Rights Acts. Various ways lawyers find discrimination in organizations. Learned how to read court cases. Learned how some lawyers work. More law than economics - but I like that.",
    "A much better understanding of constitutional approaches to discrimination, in particular race-based discrimination. I feel I understand the legal strategies and standards required to prove discrimination, and some of the challenges and controversies that arise from discrimination law as it stands. Also, some fairly minimal exploration of the economics of discrimination.",
    "History of race and some gender discrimination in U.S. history",
    "I learned about the history behind the 14th Amendment, Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act, the 13th Amendment, and the court cases that ensued after them.",
    "I learned a lot more constitutional law than I thought I was going to, but that was a good skill to learn. Additionally, you come out of this course with a greater understanding of how the Civil Rights Act works related to employment practices.",
    "This is a good interdisciplinary class that explores how civil rights law and economics often intersect. It is a historical and legal look into discrimination over the last century."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very organized.",
    "Strength: The course readings were insightful. I learned a lot from the readings and I know I would not have been able to find those readings myself. The professor's experience was also a plus. He's not a lawyer, but he's worked on many cases and can think like both a lawyer and an economist. Weakness: The course felt psychologically unsafe. As in, you shouldn't talk unless you knew you were \"right.\" I think that's how law school works, but as an undergrad, even as seniors, students should express as many opinions as possible.",
    "Maybe more compelling assignments - they started quite strong, but then kind of dropped off. Similarly, the readings went from engaging and comprehensive to fairly minimal by the end of the semester. Also, maybe more structure in preparing for the final paper: maybe an assignment to prepare a 1-2 page proposal for the paper?",
    "Readings could be a bit more organized. Professor Jaynes is a great lecturer and has great stories",
    "To me, the beginning of the course seemed basic. We could've taken more time to focus on more complicated issues instead of the basic things that we discussed at the beginning of the course.",
    "The strengths of this course are the great discussions that came up throughout the semester. The weaknesses are the fact that even though it's a seminar, there are sometimes not great opportunities to participate between whoever is presenting and Professor Jaynes input depending on how much time is left for questions.",
    "The topic was extremely interesting but the lectures were often dry. They also heavily featured class presentations, while I would have preferred more of a direct teaching style."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. A fresh angle to the economics major. Professor is great.",
    "Yes! If you're an econ major interested in law school or discrimination economics.",
    "I enjoyed the class and found the course material engaging, but don't think it was necessarily arranged in the best way. If you're interested in the topic, you'll certainly cover a lot of relevant material but may find the class discussions less exciting. Also, it's very much a legal course: the first few weeks feature more economic discussion, but the majority of the weeks explore legal theories of discrimination.",
    "I think I would. I definitely learned a lot on the subject of workplace discrimination.",
    "For a senior econ seminar, the workload of this class is super chill. Dont even shop if youre not a senior econ major or maybe ep&e. Its honestly very little econ, and can be deceiving because in the first couple weeks it seems like there will be more modeling and econ applications, but that really dwindles after the first of the semester. This is really more of a con law based class, that looks at legal cases of discrimination regarding economic issues (think supreme court cases related to affirmative action\/hiring practices, housing, education, etc). That being said, I enjoyed the material and found it super interesting, but im also an ep&e major concentrating on the ethics of con law. As an econ major im not sure if it wouldve been as enjoyable, but the work is super light with one group presentation, a few short hw assignments, and a final paper. Its not a vibrant discussion usually, but Jaynes is really nice in office hours and really knows his stuff.",
    "Yes, this a solid 400 level econ class that isn't a super heavy workload.",
    "I would - haven't taken a discrimination course before so it was very enlightening.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in both the law and economics. Interesting topic but not a super engaging class."
