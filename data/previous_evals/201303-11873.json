   "comments": [
    "A lot of work and a lot of students from different Classics backgrounds that all come together to give each other the knowledge they have. Very fun class with the right students. Could be boring but Kraus made it my favorite class.",
    "A fun, fun course. It's billed as 'Latin Lyric' but is really an intensive study of Horace with bits of Catullus at the beginning to ease your transition in. I would definitely recommend it, even if the weekly translation may seem daunting. Well worth it.",
    "Definitely one of the best Latin classes I've taken at Yale. I had never liked reading Horace prior, but Professor Kraus asked incredibly interesting questions and gave us a wealth of secondary literature with which to learn more about Horace's style and political context. The class has a lot of reading, but it's fun to do on your own, and unlike some other Latin classes, we didn't translate it all over again in class which can be really boring. The class is a heavy workload (a lot of hard reading in Latin, complex secondary literature, two papers, midterm, and final), but if you're a classics major or a competent Latin reader it's worth it to take a class with Professor Kraus.",
    "If you love Latin, take this class. All the students who take it will feel more or less the same way as you do. If you hate Latin, the translation workload might be a bit much.",
    "Latin Lyric requires a lot of work for you to get something out of it, but it's worth it. The class is centered around the scholarly articles you read and discuss, which can sometimes be overwhelming on top of the normal amount of translations, especially if you're unfamiliar with tackling secondary sources like these. Professor Kraus made me see Horace's poetry not just as a series of technical devices or grammar points, but as a coherent and brilliant piece of literature that we can discuss in as great a detail as Shakespeare or -insert other great writer-.",
    "Latin 424 is a very challenging but incredibly rewarding class. I would wholeheartedlyrecommend this class to anyone interested in Latin poetry. Aside from the fascinating content, this class is worth taking just because of Professor Kraus. She is always willing to meet outside of class and created a course that never provided a dull moment."
