   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class if the person has taken a class that covers Kant.",
    "Quite difficult for an introduction, yet absolutely worth it. If it is offered again, take it with no hesitation.",
    "I would recommend this to both humanities majors and non-humanities majors. For history of philosophy it is priceless, and for those not involved in the humanities it is a great class to make you think about life.",
    "It probably won't be offered again, but if it were, then I would. Every philosophy major should take at least one course with karsten harries, and I think understanding the history of philosophy--perhaps 19th century is particularly important--is helpful to situate philosophy historically and thus understand how it evolved and how it formed the way most of a think today.",
    "If you want to read that stuff take it. It does the job.",
    "The lectures can be a little dry but it's a good introduction to some major philosophers, from a professor who considers their arguments with great thoughtfulness as opposed to just treating them like historical artifacts you need to memorize. The essays were fun to write, since the topics helped guide you along and the TF was there to help out. There are other courses that will give you clearer answers or wrap up more neatly, but to get some flavor for interesting philosophy, Prof. Harries is a good bet."
