   "comments": [
    "Very good course. Useful",
    "This course is an introduction to Financial Accounting, which is pretty much the way companies tally and report their financial status and measures. I'm glad I took the course. It proceeds very logically, and the topics make sense. I would recommend taking this course to anyone interested in finance, as it makes the terms that come up in the newspaper a lot easier to understand.",
    "ACCT170 is a practical course where you can learn useful business knowledge. The exams are open-book and the assignments are not graded. The lectures are simply for highlighting key points from the textbook.",
    "I would recommend this especially to seniors; the workload is pretty light and it teaches important financial information for when we graduate.",
    "Take the course because it will be helpful for your summer job if you're doing something in finance. You need to do the reading and exercises and go to class to get the most out of it though. Don't bother taking the class if you're not going to show up.",
    "Take this class if you are pursuing a career in finance. It is useful even though it is not the most lively class.",
    "yes, if you're interested in business\/finance",
    "Schiffres is not particularly nice. Otherwise, you know what you're getting with this class. I found the material interesting. Recommend it to people interested in investing.",
    "I am glad I took this course b\/c it will help me out with my investment banking job next year. I really liked the textbook and everything I learned was from the textbook. Easy, open book, multiple choice midterm. Easy weekly problem sets. The final (which I haven't taken yet) is not multiple choice, but it is still open book.Warning- Prof Shciffres doesn't care about the class at all. Not a good professor!",
    "Yes. I think it's a very useful class. It really helps with interviews in the finance realm.",
    "A useful, even necessary course, for any student who will (or might) head into the business world upon graduation.",
    "Yes, if you plan on going into business.",
    "I think it is a very useful course. At times the specifics get a little dull, but overall I feel like it was very worthwhile. I think it teaches you some great skills to use in any profession. It is one of those classes that if you put in a steady amount of work it is not at all daunting at the end of the year. The problem sets are graded based on effort, but if you do try and complete them to the best of your ability it sets you up well for the exams.",
    "Interesting material, not a great class.",
    "No, although the skills are important to know.",
    "Recommend for any econ major.",
    "Sure if you want to know accounting, very functional",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn the basics of accounting. Much of it will probably be self-taught out of the book and lectures follow the exact same material in the book. A lot of people take this as a Cr\/D\/Fail course, which can be frustrating at times.",
    "If you\u0092re interested in a good introduction to financial accounting and to learn some useful concepts for evaluating investments, this is a great class. The text book is clear, simple, and useful.",
    "It's an accounting class. It teaches you accounting, nothing more, nothing less. Plus it's pretty easy.",
    "Definitely take it! It's great to know, a fun atmosphere, and a really nice instructor. I am happy that I did it and would definitely do it again.",
    "Yes, I\u0092d recommend this class to another student.",
    "Sure, it's helpful.",
    "Course is self descriptive. Take it if you want to learn a lot about accounting. Don't take it if you're not interested in accounting. The HWs range in difficulty, the midterm and final are difficult but not impossible.",
    "Acct 170 is a basic introduction to accounting. I would recommend it.",
    "ACCT 170 is an excellent course. I highly recommend it."
