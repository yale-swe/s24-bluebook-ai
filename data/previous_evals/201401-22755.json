   "comments": [
    "It is an excellent course that I would highly recommend for anyone interested in doing cancer research",
    "An overview of general cancer biology; both in different types of cancer, and different techniques common to cancer research and therapies.",
    "PATH 650 is a very interesting class that will allow you to gain a deeper understanding of cancer with a multidisciplinary approach. You will be exposed to the cellular and molecular hallmarks of cancer but also to the histology, pathology and the public health impact among the US population. This broad and well-rounded exposure will probably be beneficial to your current research endeavors. The workload is reasonable on a weekly basis and the final paper is also a good opportunity to engage with a specific topic of your interest that may have grabbed your interest during one of the lectures. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "Take it if you have any interest in cancer biology. The focus is on the core oncogene\/tumor suppressor pathways that form the genetic basis of cancer as well as the biology of metastasis and the tumor microenvironment. There is less of an emphasis on clinical applications of the basic science, although most lecturers do bring in a little of this. The format is a series of guest lectures, a final paper, and sections led by TAs that meet about 5 times over the course of the semester. There is a 10-minute quiz during each section, and then two students present papers from the primary literature. Most of the lecturers are outstanding and discuss cutting-edge work.",
    "Great overview of cancer biology and the cutting edge research currently going on in the field. I highly recommend it to any student interested in cancer research.",
    "I would definitely recommendthe course. It's great for learning exactly what the course is titled--the cellular and molecular biology of cancer. I would probably suggest that a student who has never learned about cancer do some research on their own first, though; the course seemed as though it assumed you had some basic knowledge on cancer as well as other biology.",
    "Yes I would recommend it as it gives a broad understanding of the topic of cancer biology.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student, but only if their schedule was already not too demanding because of the amount of work required, especially when presenting for discussion sections."

   "comments": [
    "It helped me to better understand different aspects of cancer and work on my presentation skills.",
    "Very well. Going into a cancer lab now, so nearly everything could be relevant in a way.",
    "This course has been extremely helpful to guide and deepen my understanding of cancer, so that I could bring it back to the lab to improve my research efforts. While the information I learned in class were not directly related to my research question, this course gave me a broad overview of the molecular and cellular pathways that drive cancer growth, which in turn allowed me to start to observe recurring patterns that applied to my own research as well.",
    "I now have a much deeper understanding of cancer biology and the ongoing research in the field. This knowledge will certainly help me throughout my research-- it has already led to the generation of several interesting ideas.",
    "This course provided some great information that I'll be using in my future career for sure. I can't say how much it will contribute to my dissertation yet, but I imagine that it will be helpful somewhere along the way."
