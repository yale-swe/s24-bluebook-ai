   "comments": [
    "I gained very little knowledge in this course apart from a canonical survey of the historiography of Western art. If there was anything that I found valuable in this course, however, it is that it was a felicitous introduction to the general character of the PhD program in its blatant oversight of diversity and irresponsible emphasis on 'tradition'. After having spent an entire semester engaging in undirected discussion and an overabundance of poorly selected readings, I hesitate to say that this course was worthwhile.",
    "I learned more both specifically about the history of art history as a discipline and generally about the process of comparing art historical methodologies.",
    "I gained a useful overview of foundational art history texts, which helped me to orient my own position within the field."

  {
   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I emphasized most of the weaknesses in question 1 but would add that not all readings were made available to the students, and not on every occasion were enough copies available in the library system. This deficiency meant that on more than one occasion students had to purchase their own copies, an obligation that should have been made clear at the very beginning of the semester.",
    "This course did a beautiful job of tracing some of the less-trodden paths of art historical development, and presenting a persuasive view of how they contributed to contemporary art historical thinking. That said, it was frustrating to discover that no woman or person of color was represented on the syllabus whatsoever--not to mention any feminist or post-colonial theory. I understand skipping post-structural theory, new social history and other oft-examined contemporary methodological strands, but if anything I think feminist and post-colonial ideas get bandied around without a lot of understanding or grounding as it is; perhaps flexing the rule about dead scholars to include insufficiently understood scholars might be useful. That said, the syllabus as a whole did a beautiful job of hitting important methodological points without replicating the absolute bog-standard list of texts that often crop up.",
    "I felt I wasn't able to read as deeply as I would have liked, since some weeks there was an overwhelming amount of material. I also wished the students were more willing to get into real arguments - I'm not sure there's anything the course could do to encourage it, but our discussions often felt stilted."

    "Not that it is an option for future students, but no, I would not recommend this course.",
    "Absolutely! Of course, in this case most people who should take it, must, but it was a worthwhile (and even fun) experience."
