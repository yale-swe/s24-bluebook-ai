   "comments": [
    "They are serious when they say you should be good at languages, but if you are, this is the only way to take Russian. You'll be bored to tears otherwise.",
    "Much work, but much learning. You know what you're getting into from day #1, and if it appeals to you, this is an excellent class.",
    "Great course. Work load can become a bit annoying sometimes but if you want to learn the language, you just have to do the work. The book and video were not as good as first semester, but all in all, still a great course.",
    "If you're willing to put in the daliy work and struggle a bit in the beginning if you have no exposure to Slavic languages, then definitely! The growth in this class is exponential, and the 8 hours a week doesn't feel bad at all--you really build a great relationship with the teachers and your fellow classmates! Everything in the courses is given and graded very straightforward and honestly.",
    "The course covers two years of college-level Russian in one year.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I started this year with NO background in Russian, but really wanted to learn the language for a number of reasons (career, literaure, theater, politics, etc.). I left feeling I could actually speak the language (to a limited degree) and that I had the foundation to learn more rapidly next year and privately. Of course, you have to be willing to do the work to get anything out of it, but its worth it to learn a new language in an intensive way, and the teachers are phenomenal.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to other students, especially if Constantine and Julia continue to teach it. This class taught me beginner's Russian. Looking back, I am amazed at how much I have learned over the course of a mere 2 semesters. The two instructors worked very well because they each focused on different areas of language-learning and were able to teach things in similar but different ways, which was helpful. While I probably complained a fair bit about the nightly homework assignments, I think that they were key in helping learn the language. I wish that we had more time to do skits and conversations that were not drills, but I understand that the nature of the intensive class did not really allow for that. The first semester's textbooks were definitely better than the second semester's, although the quality of the video supplements remained good. The dynamics of the people in the class also made it great, because students taking intensive Russian are more homogeneously serious about learning the language."
