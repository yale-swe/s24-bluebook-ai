   "comments": [
    "I had an incredible experience in this class, but yours may be very different depending on the professor you have, so take the time to talk to the professor before committing to the class.",
    "This is a fun, not too difficult class to end the math major at Yale. Take it, especially if Prof. Goncharov is teaching it.",
    "You have to take it, so do it. Very light workload, what you get out depends on what you put in and mostly on the professor. Choose your section based on the professor, trust me.",
    "This course was great. It was not too much work, but we all learned a lot of new math. The course was well designed to help the students gain an understanding of the connections between different areas of math and see the bigger picture. I would definitely take the seminar with Goncharov in the future if it is again an option.",
    "MATH 480 is a class that you probably have to enroll in, but regardless, is an excellent course that really beautifully ties together some of the interesting concepts that we have learned in prior math classes. You have to present on different concepts multiple times in front of the class and there are a few assignments. Overall, a very relaxed and fulfilling course that increases your appreciation for mathematics."
