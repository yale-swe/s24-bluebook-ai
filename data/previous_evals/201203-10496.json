   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to my fellow students if they are really interested in Cell Biology because I think the coures could provide a lot they need to know.",
    "I would recommend it for an incoming grad student in cell biology who needed to learn a lot about the different aspects of the field. For a student outside of cell biology I wouldn't recommend it because it's a little too specific for a more general interest.",
    "I would suggest the class to new graduate students because it makes you familiar with different research techniques that are used. And because they have the opportunity to interact with several faculty members.",
    "It gave basic overview of cell biology. I would recommend this course to others.",
    "Very useful introductory course, would definitely recommend it to students who don't have a strong cell bio background.",
    "It was a very good class covering a wide range of topics. I would definitely recommend the class if you're interested in basic cell biology.",
    "Yes, can learn CBIO in a historiacally organized way",
    "Its a required course for most so I probably wouldnt have the option of recommending or not recommending it...",
    "It is a great course ONLY IF you are going into a cell bio lab, but if not I would not recommend it. It is based too much on what has been found rather than the logic and methods behind how it was found.",
    "It was a lot of information put together by many differently faculties with different specializations. Was a good summary course to get everyone on the same page.",
    "Yes, this course is good for providing comprehensive coverage of the cell -- however, sometimes the lectures were too basic and other times lectures assumed you knew background that was not explained properly. I felt the course lacked balance and a steady pace."

   "comments": [
    "Deepen in some extent...",
    "I learned a lot about cell biology that I didn't know before so I would say it deepened my knowledge a lot.",
    "The course causes you to think like a scientist during the examinations, coming up with approaches to answer scientific questions in the different fields. I thought it was important for my research that they covered different techniques and technologies used to answer research questions.",
    "I learned very in-depth details about basic cell biology. I had never been introduced to this subject in such a detailed manner. The discussion of experimental techniques as well as the new knowledge I have gained will undoubtedly help me in my thesis research.",
    "It was a great review of undergrad cell biology with more in depth information but I do not feel it will help me increase the efficiency or scope of my thesis research.",
    "It was a good refresher for cell biology.",
    "I certainly know a lot more about cell biology through this course. Since I am now studying living organisms, this definitely has helped my understanding for my dissertation."
