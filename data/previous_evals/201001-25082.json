   "comments": [
    "It's a great learning experience. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "you study computing machines (turing machines, recursive functions, and briefly the abacus). we show they can all compute the same functionsyou study godel's incompleteness theorem--the class ends with its proofonce-a-week class, no homework, just sit and listen and understandone presentation (not much work), one oral exam, and one take-home finalthis is the class you are looking for",
    "Great class. The material on computability and G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems is very interesting, and Sun-Joo is a great professor. I took it without having taken Math Logic I without a problem. Not too much work either (no problem sets, just a presentation, oral exam, and take home final).",
    "Amazing course taught by one of the best teachers on campus. Yes you'll learn the famous G\u00f6del result at the end, but what's cool is that you'll get about 20 other tools and novel approaches to things on the way. Its entertaining lectures that teach you formal things about and around logic, all the while building up to an epic conclusion. Definitely worth taking for anyone who enjoys the domain.If you're not interested in the material, it could be a bore, but I can't imagine why you wouldn't be. You get to learn what calculating something really means, and how you can do math about math.the prereq is not a prereq if you have some idea of first order logic.",
    "Computability and Logic is yet another awesome class taught by Sun-Joo Shin. If you liked math logic, you'll love this class. There are so many interesting results and ideas, and Sun-Joo is the best. Math and philosophy majors should rejoice that this is a required course for the major.",
    "Cool if very abstract stuff. You'll learn a lot about godel's results and some related structures. It's good to do in a seminar setting to make sure everyone is on the same page. Sun Joo doesn't make it easy for you though, she can be a little hard to understand and you need to be on top of things to understand whats going on"
