   "comments": [
    "You wouldn't be considering this class out of anything but obligation. It could be worse.",
    "Long problem sets and long derivations in class that were difficult to follow. Thermodynamics is supposedly the basis of chemical engineering but when rushed through it is very unproductive. If you are taking it its is only because you have to.",
    "CENG 300 can be challenging if you do not have a good study\/Pset group that can help you through topics you don't understand. Recommend taking ENAS 130 (or just know MATLAB) before even though it is not a prerequisite because assignments require MATLAB knowledge. Feels like a struggle most semester but at the truly you truly feel like you learned a lot.",
    "Thermo was a lot tougher than I was expecting it to be. If you don't have to take it, don't take it. You'll learn the theoretical and mathematical basis of thermodynamics - everything from enthalpy to entropy to free energy to equations of state to chemical potential and equilibria. If any other teacher besides Professor Osuji were teaching this course, we would never have gotten through all of the material. But Professor Osuji dragged us through this course the same way Achilles dragged Hector behind his chariot around Troy, which I guess in the end was a good thing for us. However, although the material had the potential to be really interesting and enlightening, Professor Osuji did nothing to make it appear that way - it was really demoralizing when he said that all of the bewildering equations on the board were \"simple\" or \"trivial\" or \"unimportant.\" First of all, NOTHING we learned was simple unless you already have a PhD in chemical engineering. Second of all, if it's trivial or unimportant, I wish I never knew it because I still had to agonizingly learn it before the midterms (which were ridiculously long - not difficult, just meant to be finished in 5 hours, not 1 hour and 15 minutes). I also wish that we could have covered fewer proofs in class and instead thought a lot more about the MEANING of everything we learned - I know the mathematical and theoretical basis of entropy just fine, but this course never taught me what it means (I read other books and Wikipedia instead). But still, that's kind of sad. Overall, this course was difficult and frustrating, and ultimately nowhere near as rewarding as it should have been.",
    "Challenging and time-consuming class, but you come out of it feeling accomplished and having learned quite a bit. Try to learn some MATLAB beforehand if you can, and prepare to spend lots of time on the psets, but they really help you learn the material.",
    "People aren't going to take this class unless they have to but I would not at all be sad about having to take it. I'm not the best engineer ever but I think if you go into this class with an open mind you can really learn a lot about how the world functions.",
    "Junior year will be difficult. This class does not help. However, Osuji does a fairly good job of teaching thermodynamics. If you don't know MATLAB, you will by the end of the class ... or you'll decide that excel does it better. Pchem is pretty much a less math intensive version of this class.",
    "From what I've heard, you should try to take this with Osuji rather than PvT. Osuji does a good job of teaching the class and has a focus on learning things that are relevant to things you may be doing in the future (as opposed to straight theory). Problem sets are long and hard, but you'll learn the material well because of them."
