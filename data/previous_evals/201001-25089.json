   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as exactly what the course is called and I would definitely recommend this course to anyone.",
    "Firstly, I don't do math. Or science. I just can't. Or... I thought I couldn't. I'm not sure exactly how he did it, but Professor Robinson was able to create a physics course that even someone like me could do. There was no constant worrying over difficult concepts or praying that, at the very least, I might pass the class - I was very comfortable discussing the topics with the other students and the professor. If you need a QR or a Science credit, I'm not saying this is the easiest way to get those credits, but it is definitely the best way.",
    "A great way to do a QR or SC.",
    "By all means.",
    "Would so recommend this course to anybody, especially someone who really dislikes math or physics. It's a great way to fulfill a QR because the movie clips are great and Professor Robinson really makes an effort to make himself available for any questions you might have. Problem sets were manageable and did not take long and were even fun because you still got to watch movies. Great course, all my friends were jealous.",
    "Movie Physics is a great course for non-science\/math majors. Usually non-science\/math majors take courses like movie physics just for the credit and to get in and get out. With professor robinson, you actually love the course, and love the material, and actually look forward to class.",
    "Yes! It's a really fun class, the seminar format is really helpful and the clips are a great way to learn physics. Don't try to get into it if you've done physics and calculus, you will find it boring, but if you've been searching Yale for a class you can understand, Frank is great! And yes there is real physics, it's not just watching movies, but he's really helpful and nice.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for anyone who wants to get a QR that will be useful and helpful. This course covers elements of physics in an accessible way, even when the concepts are a bit more difficult to understand, and applies them to action movies in order to examine how realistic they are. Not only is it useful, it's a lot of fun and a great way to open your eyes to the ways in which physics surround us.",
    "Take. This. Class. You have no idea. Do you like the movies Hancock, Casino Royale, Die Hard, the Hulk, or Star Trek? Good. Then take this class. Frank is the man too.",
    "Interesting, fun, and different physics class. I would definitely recommend it."
