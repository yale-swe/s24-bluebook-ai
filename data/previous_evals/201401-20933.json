    "181 is the second half of the introductory physics sequence. However, the class is not your typical science class. Phys 180 and 181 have implemented a program of learning called smartphysics, in which the course material is learned through well-made khan academy style video lectures on the topics instead of a textbook. I know this sort of learning is not for everyone, but I felt that I got much more out of this course than if I would have had to read the old HRW physics book. The problem sets are very doable, the exams aren't too hard (though the instructors are still trying to tune them to have a nice balance between easy and hard), and the course gives you a lot of free points in the realm of participation (via clickers in lecture) and simply doing the smartphysics coursework. Also, the prereqs state that you should take it concurrently with MATH 120, but very little other than a basic knowledge of single-variable calculus is needed for the course. Professor Fleming is the better instructor, as her lectures are clearer and she can better answer the questions of confused students.",
    "A decent class, take if you need to fulfill requirements. Otherwise, boring as hell.",
    "smartphysics sucks",
    "Only take it if you are required to. If you are required to, consider 171 vs 181 and which would be better for you.",
    "Take this class over PHYS 171. Smartphysics makes everything, including both how much you learn and your grade, soo much better.",
    "it was not fun. the difficulty of the class could be mapped by a sigmoidal curve in which the first midterm was not bad, but the material quite suddenly got exponentially harder. E&M is really hard in the first place, but the teaching was poor. Probably one of the worst classes I've taken",
    "It was incredibly difficult and time consuming, but in the end you need to take Physics and one point or another. Take it with Prof. Fleming if you have to take it!",
    "Be prepared to learn E&M on your own.",
    "This course was a surprise. I have never been good at physics, particularly E&M. That said, Bonnie Fleming made the course about as painless as a physics course can be. She is a strong lecturer and did her best to make the class as engaging as possible. The \"SmartPhysics\" curriculum makes the class very manageable and makes it so it's nearly impossible to fall too far behind. Maybe the best intro STEM class I've taken at Yale. If you need to take PHYS 181, I STRONGLY recommend taking it with Fleming if that is an option.",
    "Meh",
    "It's a horrible class. It's hard: you fly through topics without ever consolidating anything or getting sufficient practice in an area unless you do it in your own free time with your own sources. If you don't have to take it, don't.",
    "While PHYS 181 was definitely harder than PHYS 180, I was more satisfied with this course because I clearly learned a lot. Take it if you have to, and do your homework regularly - than you won't have too much to worry about.",
    "Interesting",
    "Not fun at all. No conceptual understanding and the lectures were not very interesting. I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "An intro physics class that is just as poorly taught as 180, but harder because of the content. I heard that 260 and 261 are more thoroughly taught. Options are limited, so 180, 181 are not that terrible considering you could end up taking 200, 201.",
    "Yes, it is slightly harder than AP physics but doable. Better than other physics classes because has AMAZING TFs. If you already like physics it is god class to take and you'll do well. Like I said, the TFs were PHENOMENAL - by far the best I've had a Yale. Especially, James, Jeremy, Elena,and Tonima. They all deserve a HUGE shout out!!",
    "You probably have to take this class, but it is a good course, Professor Fleming is a good lecturer, and although it is a lot of work, you learn a lot of physics.",
    "PHYS 181 is a calculus based introduction to electricity and magnetism. I didn't take AP Physics C in high school, but if you did you'd probably want to take a more advanced course. The SmartPhysics system is a useful break from traditional assignments.",
    "I absolutely, emphatically, insistently DO NOT recommend this course to anyone. I usually write good course reviews but I have a moral responsibility to keep as many people away from this course as possible. I would have been considerably happier this semester if I had not taken this course. If you just need any physics course but don\u2019t really care about physics, take 171. The workload will for sure be lighter. If you are actually interested in physics like I was, take 201. I assume there you will actually learn some things and not just memorize formulas and apply them blindly.",
    "The difficulty level of this class is comparable to AP PHYSICS C, although it is probably harder in terms of the problems that they give you on exams. I would recommend this course to premeds that need to take a physics class, since physics 201 seemed to be a lot harder from what I have heard from my classmates. I'm not so sure about physics 171 in comparison to 181 though. The Smartphysics format is quite tedious and I would have rather have it be normal lecture with the teacher teaching us concepts and equations rather than watching a video on it before each class and then have the teacher go over brief concepts and checkpoints from that same video.",
    "PHYS 181 is a difficult course. There are multiple way to get help on class concepts with Professors that are very patient, review sessions and, of course, Smartphysics, but that doesn't mean the information given is easy to internalize. However, if you think learning about electric fields, magnetism, and circuits is useful, then take the course.",
    "eh, take it if you have to. Fleming is not too bad...I hate smartphysics though",
    "i would recommend if you want a good intro level course in physics",
    "Physics 181 was okay. I didn't mind SmartPhysics because at least I never got behind and was able to find everything I needed to study very quickly. If you're premed like me I would recommend taking 171--it didn't fit into my schedule but it's much more clearly linked to pre-med.",
    "If you want to learn physics and have a good math background I would actually recommend taking 260. If you have poor math background and don't really want to learn physics I recommend 170. If your math is okay and are only vaguely interested in passing a physics course I recommend this one.",
    "Rudimentary physics introduction. Take if it you want to not have to think and actually learn physics.",
    "I really liked Physics 180 and the smartphysics program first semester, so I was very disappointed in this class. Part of that can be blamed on the fact that electricity and magnetism was just harder than mechanics, with a lot more integrals and confusing quantities. However, the professors were not that great and the tests were much harder. I would say Professor Fleming was the better of the two, because at least she understood her own explanations most of the time.",
    "The course was far more difficult than PHYS 180, which I wouldn't have minded if we were informed such was the case. Being in the same sequence as PHYS 180, one naturally is inclined to believe that the two courses are similar. Thus, when the second midterm was extremely difficult compared to the first half of the semester (including the first midterm), I was thoroughly caught off guard. In a way I felt tricked by the ineptitude of the course to make clear what kind of course it was before students were locked into it at both the shopping week phase and the mid-semester point. It is, in a way, almost cruel and unethical to make the first unit of the course (and its corresponding midterm) incredibly easy, lower the students' guards, and then catch them off guard with a midterm 2 that could have easily been from a totally different course. In this regard, I am extremely dissatisfied with this course, compared to PHYS 180, which had, throughout the entire semester, adhered to the tone and character of the course it had committed to from the very beginning. In addition, I hated SmartPhysics. Though it must have saved the professors (and their TFs) a lot of work, SmartPhysics caused a lot of trouble and pain for me. Although I enjoyed the online aspect of the homework, this system is a good example of an idea that was better on paper than in its execution. The prelectures, especially, were very poorly done. The narrator was totally unprofessional and very whimsical in his narrative style, resulting in a narration that was very distracting and totally detracted from the material of the prelecture itself. In addition, the writing was quite verbose and nebulous as well. In the end, my verdict is that if PHYS 181 your year is going to be anything close to the disaster it was my year, I'd advise you to think twice before you take it."
