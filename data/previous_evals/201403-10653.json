   "comments": [
    "This class is useful to art historians, archaeologists, and classicists alike. Members of the class brought different pieces of knowledge to the table that I think fit very well together to bring shared understanding about Hadrian in literature\/history (the classics side) and Hadrianic art & architecture (the art history side). Rather than clashing or causing confusion, our different viewpoints helped deepen everyone's understanding.",
    "This course is great because you design your own pace as your work on your paper and you have ample time, and opportunity, to test your ideas and produce a paper that you find valuable. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Definitely I will. It offers a great oppotunity to work as a group on very interesting issues.",
    "CLSS 846 provided an engaging and interesting way to evaluate the degree to which ancient emperors produced their own autobiography in art. The course focuses on many aspects of ancient Rome and challenges students to come up with their own interpretations of an elusive emperor and his reign. I would highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "I am unsure whether I would recommend this class to other students. As I stated above, I really do not feel that students were able to learn or consider much before being forced to focus on a specific topic for their final paper\/presentation."

   "comments": [
    "Loved the exposure to art history that I don't usually get in my text-based studies. I think all Classicists should take a course like this.",
    "I was able to do research that will help me when I work on my dissertation. I am glad for the opportunity to have begun this research.",
    "This course is my initiation in the field of Roman Art History, and I learned not only knowledge but also important methodology and perspectives of inquiry.",
    "Prior to this course I had only a limited understanding of ancient Roman art and architecture. I also had no experience with writing in the style of an art historian. This course challenged me to improve my speaking, research, and writing skills. Along the way, I came to better understand the course material as well as how to form my own interpretations. Thanks to this course, I feel I have a better grasp on how to interpret, evaluate, and utilize ancient source material. I also have helpful feedback and experience with writing in an art history context. This course will be of use for years to come.",
    "I do not feel that this course really deepened my knowledge of this time period or Roman civilization as a whole."
