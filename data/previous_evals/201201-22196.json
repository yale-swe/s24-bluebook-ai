    "A good course that you should definitely take if you like math.",
    "If you are interested in calculus, this is a great course. It was especially comfortable after having taken Math 115. Make sure to stay on top of the practice problems and homework assignments, but otherwise, this course is very straightforward and interesting!",
    "Take this section! The instructor is knowledgeable and has a great sense of humor. He's highly organized and does lots of good examples that help out with the homework. If you try and if you study, you'll do well -- this course rewards hard work.",
    "Take it if you like maths. If not, choose something easier.",
    "The class if a great overview of vector and multivariable calculus. I would recommend it if you are interested in math or need it as a prerequisite.",
    "Math 120 is a study of calculus in functions of several variables. Main topics include partial derivatives, double and triple integrals, and vector calculus. I highly recommend it to all math-minded students.",
    "Difficult course, but if you study a lot, pay attention in class, and actually learn the material and insight, it's doable. Igor is a fantastic professor. Explains everything very clearly and thoroughly and even helped us by providing summary sheets. Additionally he always answered questions by email very thoroughly in an easy to understand manner. I learned the material very well.",
    "Standard multivariable calculus course.",
    "The class is really fast-fast paced. I considered myself OK at math, and was able to grasp most things after a few tries. The final is very hard, and soul-crushing. However, put up with it and you'll learn a few neat tricks along the way. Look for a good instructor, I had an amazing guy--Igor Rapinchuk--if you have the chance, shop around. You'd be surprised the difference it can make.",
    "No. There are better ways to fulfill pre-med math requirements. Only do it if you have to.",
    "MATH 120 is a pretty straightforward class. Don\u0092t worry if you took single-variable a long time ago, you only really need to kind of remember how to differentiate, integrate and how to use polar coordinates. A lot of the applications involve physics, so sometimes it\u0092s hard to visualize or conceptualize the operations you learn without that background. Nonetheless, the tests and problem sets are very reasonable, and the material makes sense provided you do the readings and do problems."
