   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in the subject! For history majors interested in the Middle East, a great way to get a pre-industrial requirement done.",
    "I would not recommend Three Empires to Islam to another student. While I was interested in the topic, I do not feel that I developed a strong understanding of any of the Empires.Professor Alan Mikhail was hit or miss with the lectures, and there is a strong focus only on political history.There was a ton of work for the class, and it was very harshly graded. We had reading responses every week, and a midterm and final paper. The final paper is supposed to be fun because you are writing a first person narrative, but it ends up being a nuisance. Professor Mikhail is a new professor, so he is still working out some of the kinks of adjusting to Yale. At this point, unless altercations are made, I would not take this course.",
    "A great history class (and a pre-industrial credit for history majors). Highly recommended.",
    "It's a survey course run in a more intersting and engaging way than most. You'll learn a great amoutn about the complexities and history of Islam, and learn about places and peoples that you really should study. The workload is extremely reasonable and Professor Mikhail is understanding, engaging, and makes the course fun. Take it!",
    "Yes, if you want to learn about the Ottomans, Safavids and the Mughal. But, this course only remains as a survey class, so some may find it unsatisfactory.",
    "This class is pretty good if you'reinterested in the material. I wouldn't take it if you aren't because some of the reading is really bad. On that note, I also wouldn't take it as a freshman unless you're already really good at determining what reading you can skip. But I do think it's worth taking because it is about a part of history that is often overlooked.",
    "Good class, however the scope at times is overwhelming. The reading was on par with most of my seminars, and we move around very fast. However, unlike most survey courses, you will actually learn a good deal about the regions under study. I would recommend next year having a bit less reading, and having lectures focus directly on the readings. The examples and primary source work that Mikhail had us do was very good, I would recommend keeping that, but I feel that because of the large volume of the readings, often having us go back over them during the lectures would increase one's retention",
    "Legit Fun.Like Legit Fun.But there's a lot of reading, so beware."
