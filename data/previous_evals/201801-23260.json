    "The course was definitely informative and I appreciate the different ways that Sabrina engaged with us in order to make learning things such as grammar more interesting. I also really enjoyed our unit on famous Brazilian writers, specifically how we were able to write our own poetry. I think, in terms of improvements, the course could benefit from more organization."

    "I definitely would suggest this course to any student continuing their learning in Portuguese because of the quality of the professors. Sabrina was truly superb as a teacher and elevated all source material. The book used for this course, however, is arcane and not engaging. Th textbook holds the course back.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Portuguese at Yale is lit (both as in literature and sweet af), and it's not too much work, though class meets Monday through Friday.",
    "Yes, it was a good and well-paced course, definitely not overwhelming."
