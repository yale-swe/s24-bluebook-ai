    "free thinking, critical thinking",
    "HLTH 250 offers very brief introductions to a number of topics in evolutionary medicine (much less in-depth than I would have expected for a seminar), but demands that you go very deep into one topic for the final paper. All of the topics we cover in class are extremely interesting, and make you think of medical interventions in a new way. The class places heavy emphasis on developing writing skills, and pretty much every section is spent on writing exercises or planning the final essay.",
    "A comprehensive framework from which to analyze evolution, medicine, and how an understanding of our evolution can aid in medical approaches.",
    "I learned both critical reading and effective writing skills in this science course, which are both especially valuable because I had never received much science reading\/writing training in my previous classes. Of course, I also learned an extremely large quantity of information about evolutionary medicine in almost every existing health and disease context. My own worldview on medicine and disease significantly shifted as a result of this class, in that now I have a much better understanding of why humans become sick in the way that they do.",
    "In this class, I learned to consider medical questions from the perspective of evolutionary biology. This class also helped me to improve my writing skills through several reading responses and a longer term paper."

    "very interesting, very engaging",
    "You're guaranteed to learn a lot in this course... Prof. Stearns makes sure to engage every student both inside and outside of class, and demands a high level of involvement. The seminar format assures that you get a chance to ask questions, discuss unresolved issues in evolutionary medicine, and hear Prof. Stearns's valuable life lessons, but also allows the class to stray off-topic pretty often. In any case, what we discuss in class is sure to be interesting. The class is taught flipped, and Prof. Stearns implements the flipped model better than anyone else at Yale. Most of the learning is done outside of class, and seminar sessions are spent clarifying things students didn't grasp in the online lecture responses or discussing issues in evolutionary medicine. The course is also great at giving feedback. Prof. Stearns reads every single one of your lecture responses and responds to them individually. Some sections are also spent peer-reviewing drafts of the final essay, which is a great exercise that makes your writing better and allows you to learn what other students are up to in the class.",
    "Strengths- very comprehensive, lots of information weaknesses- not too much attention paid to helping individuals improve, kind of a fend for yourself",
    "I think the main strength of this course was the wide range of interesting material that we covered very in-depth throughout the semester; each week, the reading material and the in-class discussions were extremely fascinating and almost undoubtedly gave me new insights into a health problem that I have been exposed to in one way or another. The other strength of this course is the final paper (which is 50% of your grade!). I really enjoyed writing my own original research paper and learned so much from the process about both evolutionary bio and the writing process, and I was so proud to see it in its finished product. The weakness of this course, which may not be one depending on how you look at it, may just be the extremely high workload. Definitely plan to prioritize this class if you choose to take it, but if you do, I don't think that you will regret it.",
    "The small size of class sections was a definite strength of this course. Everyone was able to participate in class discussions and it was interesting to hear each person's insights into the topic. Professor Stearns experience in the field of evolutionary biology was another strength of this class. He knew so much about the topics that we covered, but he was also able to facilitate class discussions in such a way that the material was easy to understand."

    "absolutely, best professor and best class ive ever taken",
    "This is an amazing class! Absolutely worth taking. Students gain so much out of it, but only if they are willing to put the work in.",
    "incredible course, learned SO much",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student who is interested in and committed to learning the material. There is definitely a ton of work, with in-depth weekly reading responses along with other work occasionally due in section regarding the final term paper (the paper is 50% of your final grade). That being said, this is easily one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Yale. The material is so interesting and relevant to health and everyday life, and Dr. Stearns really does his best to make the information accessible and engaging for each student during class. The main grade in this course is the final paper, and you have a lot of freedom with this-- it simply has to be a 15-20 page paper about any aspect of evolutionary medicine that interests you, with the goal of making an original statement or insight about the field. I loved writing the paper. As a science major, I generally am not thrilled about writing long essays, but because I got to choose my topic, I made sure that I would enjoy reading and writing about it. The in-class discussions are generally pretty chill because of the small size of the class, although Dr. Stearns does enjoy cold-calling students so you have to come prepared. If you are interested in better understanding the evolutionary causes of human disease and the treatment and prevention implications, and are willing to put in a lot of ultimately rewarding work, then you should definitely take this class.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to anyone who is interesting in either evolution or medicine. Professor Stearns is a great professor and a really interesting person, and the class material is fascinating. The workload is managablejust watching video lectures, doing reading responses and writign a term paper. There are continuous deadlines for the term paper throughout the semester, so it's pretty easy to stay on track. Doing so many reading responses each week was a little bit of a pain, but it wasn't too bad and it definitely improved class discussions.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. It is set up very well- your writing will improve and you will talk about the same topics enough that you will really remember them. This is one of the few courses that addresses medicine, so if you're interested in that definitely consider this course."
