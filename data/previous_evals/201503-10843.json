    "It's a heavily-loaded class but you can learn a lot.",
    "CHEM 540 is an excellent class that begins as a review of undergraduate quantum mechanics and uses that as a starting point to explain optical spectroscopy via operators written in matrix form. You will learn the quantum mechanics of systems up to small molecules and will understand how any form of optical spectroscopy works (e.g. IR, rotational, NMR) and near the end there is also a focus on NMR, by which you will gain a fundamental understanding of chemical shift, peak splitting, pulse sequences, relaxation processes etc. Prof. Zilm is an excellent lecturer and has very well written notes for the class. You will have weekly psets that take a while to do (up to 5 hours, if you now what you're doing), but nevertheless help you grasp the material covered in class. The midterms are plentiful but fair, and there is no long cumulative final for the class. Do expect it to be a work-intensive class, but at the end you will be amazed of how much understanding you have gained of quantum mechanics and spectroscopy. In terms of math prerequisites, multivariable calculus should be enough. Knowledge of differential equations helps, but you can get away without it. So as long as you have that in terms of math background, you should definitely take this class - you will not regret it.",
    "Challenging but not impossible course. Very interesting. I would recommend it.",
    "Molrad is a good course for students that have some background in quantum mechanics and want to learn time dependent QM theory and its application in spectroscopy",
    "CHEM 540 is an important and useful class. Yes I would recommend it to other physical chemistry students, because it teaches you useful concepts.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, the course is very well designed and organized.",
    "The class is a required class for PChem\/Biophys Chem students. In general it's a great class to both review and learning more about quantum chemistry and the theory behind molecular spectroscopy."

   "comments": [
    "I believe this material will help me later in my graduate studies.",
    "This course filled in the gap between QM theory and soectroscopy",
    "I learned many concepts that will be useful for my future research, especially in NMR.",
    "The class helped to clarify many theoretical origin of spectroscopic features and is good for people whose research involved many molecular spectroscopy."
