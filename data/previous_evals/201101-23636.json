   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course to any student interested in learning about translation immunology and how basic research can be applied to the clinic. I would describe the course as a discussion class based on assigned readings.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in more translational research rather than basic science research.",
    "It can be a lot of work especially if you are taking other classes or anticipate a busy semester in lab. However, it is a great opportunity to cover a lot of concepts that affect both basic and clinical research.",
    "I would recommend IBIO 536 to any student interested in clinical approaches to immunology. It offers a good opportunity to understand current translational, as well as some basic, immunology.",
    "IBIO536 is a seminar-style course, with an emphasis on recent experimental papers of both a basic and translational nature, primarily centered on adoptive immune system therapies. The focus is on understanding the (many, 4-6) papers, and we examined them figure by figure. Each session was 2hr long, and began with a ~10-15min intro by the faculty member leading the session that day. I would recommend the course, as it was a very thorough intro to immunotherapies.",
    "Immunobio 536 delves into the ongoing research into antibodies, genetic engineering, and cell-based therapeutics used to treat autoimmune disorders, primary immunodeficiencies, and cancers. The course focuses heavily on mechanisms of disease and the way the aforementioned therapies perturb the normal\/pathologic immune response.I would definitely recommend the class to other students."

   "comments": [
    "This course was beneficial in teaching me how to critically read papers and write grants.",
    "This course helped broaden my education in immunology in areas to which I might not normally be exposed regularly.",
    "I was not very familiar with B or T cell therapies until this course; I believe this will contribute to my future interest in immunotherapies.",
    "I would certainly say that I walked away with a deeper understanding of translational immunology from this course. As a first year graduate student still developing my thesis, I'll have to defer the answer to the second question."
