    "This was an excellent class. Wendell is a delightful instructor and clearly knowledgeable in her area. Her advice and insight given during the class was a constant flow of new information in the practice and psychology of projection design. The assignments and critique was also well done and very valuable as she gave her opinion on the class assignments as they were reviewed.",
    "How picture can tell story. I lern that projection work closely with sound. I lern that it is not about movie or VDO. Simple move or picture can tell a lot of story.",
    "Understanding how to use few image to tell a story and how to use images and movement to interpret music.",
    "The best thing about this class is Wendall. She's a wonderful role model and has a perspective and sense of humor about the business that is invaluable. She also gives great assignments and really useful critique.",
    "Having Wendall for about two hours every week and just listening her talk is valuable. I've learned a lot from the simple exercises that were assigned to us throughout the semester. What I take away from this class and will always use in my work is the power of gesture and how it can be used to tell a story in the strongest way possible.",
    "We touched on a lot of things and that was great."

    "there might be a bit more information given on the tools to be used to design and render the projections. I felt that some in the class had more insight into the tools than others. Having a session or two (not more) completely devoted to outline the tools that are used to do some of the projections rendered would have been useful Then those of us who were clue-less could better focus on what we needed to learn in order to do abetter job on the assignments.",
    "it will be useful if we can do more video project.",
    "I can't really think of anything, since the assignments are so much a part of the spirit of the class. I think the assignment in which we all did five minute presentations was really helpful - maybe we could do more things like that. The only thing I would say is, it's more helpful if they are actually five minutes - some people gave 20 minute presentations. Keeping it down to 5 forces you to think efficiently and present information concisely.",
    "It would be great to get a little exposure to what is doable with projections."

    "Much of what was done was on an individual basis. It owed be useful to perhaps assign groups of 2-3 to do each assignment so that there should be more collaboration and sharing if ideas an how to execute them.",
    "I think some home work is time hard for sound designer who do not have experience in editing VDO. We did not have class with David Like visual designer."
