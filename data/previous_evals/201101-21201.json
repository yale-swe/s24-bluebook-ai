   "comments": [
    "NT and early Christianity PhD students are required to take this course. But I would happily recommend it to other Divinity students (in academic tracts) who seek a thorough introduction to Second Temple and especially Rabbinic Judaism, with its plethora of current scholarly debates.",
    "RLST 675 is basically a crash course in rabbinics scholarship. The course combines exposure to primary rabbinic sources and some of the most important scholarship on these sources. The balance is definitely tilted toward secondary sources, however. There is quite a lot of reading, and some of it can be frustrating at times if you don't have much prior exposure to rabbinic literature, but the overall the readings are well chosen and will introduce you to important issues in rabbinics scholarship. It isn't really possible to become fully comfortable with rabbinic literature in the course of a single semester, but this class is a great starting point if you are interested in working with these sources."

   "comments": [
    "This course added depth to my knowledge of an important field: early Judaism. As an aspiring scholar of the New Testament, but with an eye toward the Jewish matrix of earliest Christianity and the NT, early rabbinic Judaism is something that is often overlooked or simply not available. I feel like I now have a good grasp on how these documents, which took form after my period of focus but which nonetheless contain relevant data, relate and can be used critically in the study of Mediterranean religions in late antiquity.",
    "I think this is basically covered above. The course was a great introduction to important issues in rabbinics scholarships and the kind of work that scholars of rabbinics and the history of the rabbinic period are doing. I also started to learn, from Professor Hayes' example, how to think critically but fairly (and even generously) about current research in rabbinics."
