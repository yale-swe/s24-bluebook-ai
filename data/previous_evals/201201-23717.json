    "A field trip would have been a nice addition. Question 9 inspired this comment.",
    "#10 I want to have a career doing environmental justice work and this class was perfect for me. It gave me a theoretical basis in which to work with and the final projects introduced me to the breadth of environmental health. I have used both the theoretical concepts learned in this class and examples of the breadth of environmental justice when speaking with employers and networking with colleagues. It's a wonderful course and one that will have growing relevance in the future as disparities become more pronounced.",
    "This is a social science course. Don't expect to talk about real world change in its own context.",
    "I felt frustrated with the quality of the readings and the quality of the lectures. This is such an important course, and it's unique at FES, but I think it needs to be more rigorous. For example, if we are going to talk about what justice means, we should read some of the philosophical giants instead of referring casually to them in lecture. There could be a really deep and powerful philosophical and ethical underpinning to the case study explorations that we do later in the semester--this would enhance our understanding of different scenarios AND make us more powerful advocates for advancing justice.",
    "The professor led lectures could have gone more in depth. I would have liked to be challenged more by the material the professor brought to the class. She did an excellent job explaining the material that she brought, but I want more."

   "comments": [
    "A mix of student- and instructor-generated content.",
    "The class really forced me to think about the application of environmental justice in multiple disciplines. The course really forced me to define environmental justice in my own context and in the context of other people's frameworks. This is very important as EJ means many different things to many different people. Being able to understand EJ from others' standpoints in central to advancing EJ in the US and worldwide.",
    "I really enjoyed the opportunity to discuss EJ issues with my classmates. I think these sorts of topics don't get covered very much in other courses on offer at FES, so it was good to have a forum for that.The opportunity to create our own case studies and present them to the class was great because I needed to practise my presentation skills, and also because I relished the freedom of picking my own topic and pursuing the research independently. It was also great hearing other people's presentations because everyone spoke about topics they were personally interested in and passionate about.",
    "I learned a lot from classmates' case studies, but I think that student work took up too much of the semester. Perhaps instead of devoting an entire seminar to one group's project, the course could condense a few into a single session. This way there would be more time in the semester for digging deeper into issues and exploring more literature.",
    "Developing a basic literacy in various environmental topics with a strong justice element.",
    "Having the liberty to choose a topic that I was interested and really thoroughly research it, and present it to the class. I was able to learn a lot about a specific topic, as well as other topics the rest of the class was researching. I like the structure of the class and was able to learn a lot from it.",
    "Freedom to complete the final assignment in a way and on a topic that interests the student."

   "comments": [
    "Nothing. I am contemplating sitting in next year to listen to the discussions, if allowed.",
    "perhaps we could have some speakers in the class who do EJ work. There are plenty of groups in CT and NYC.",
    "The course in general doesn't need much improvement. Perhaps more connection to EJ issues in our immediate environment would have been good - maybe through having people come and speak who're involved in EJ issues in New Haven, or doing a walking tour around EJ sites nearby (like the EJAY student groups organised).",
    "Amity is really smart and interesting and willing to listen, but it's hard to articulate what I got out of this course. I know that Amity is sympathetic to students' interest in this class being more oriented to the \"real world,\" and I have trouble believing that the academic review board could be SO insistent that it be grounded in social science theories.",
    "In general I felt that discussions were too unstructured and went on too long. The lectures at the beginning of seminar didn't provide enough meat for a rich discussion. I would have like to go into greater depth with different issues. In a way, this class echoes the Linkages of Sustainability class--it introduces problems that are, essentially, impossible to bound. One problem is linked to a problem or a demand elsewhere, such that you are constantly confronted with the highly complex interconnectedness of systems. The class would have benefited from exposure to systems literature, or social network literature, or political economy literature--more foundational material in which to ground problems, beyond just thehistory of the EJ movement.",
    "I wish the course challenged me and my thinking more. I think the instructor also could have pushed us more to think about why justice issues are relevant.... whether through a framework of ethics or environmental impact, etc.",
    "Depth of knowledge and understanding brought to the class"

    "I'm a public health student studying environmental health. Prior to taking this class I only understood EJ in the context of health effects and cumulative impacts and health disparities. This class just opened my eyes to the other parts of EJ--the economic injustices the come about from land degradation, as well as the climate justice and the plight of indigenous peoples and their lands.",
    "I am interested in environmental governance so this course was really valuable for highlighting environmental issues from a justice perspective, and learning about how different communities can become marginalised or privileged through the implementation (or not) of particular policies. I think every environmental practitioner should think about these issues at least onceduring their careers, and preferably on a regular basis.",
    "In my first year at FES, and through my field work, I came to realize that essentially all environmental issues are justice issues, and I wished to explore degradation and exploitation through the lens of equity and human dignity.",
    "Although it is tangentially related, I believe justice is something that should be considered by anyone doing environmental work."

    "I'm glad that we got to choose our groups and that we could choose how integrated or separate our projects were. Having a two-part project was very frustrating though.",
    "Great working team. I learned somuch from my collaborator. It was a challenge to do such a big team project (worked on it all semester, devoted a lot of class time to presentation\/discussion), but ultimately really rewarding.",
    "It was helpful to bounce ideas off of one another, and to work on making conceptual connections between distinct topics.",
    "It was great to work with a partner for our final project. We were able to offer different perspectives and bring different ideas to the table about our subject matter. It was great and worked out really well.",

Think outside of the readings and come ready to generate discussion and ask provocative questions in class, because often there is a lot of time left by the seminar structure for conversation."
