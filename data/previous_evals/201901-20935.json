    "French!",
    "Because of this course, I gained a much deeper understanding of the French language and culture and this course definitely helped build my love for it.",
    "So much! Solidified grammar in a big way. Learned how to read and analyze critically in French. Speaking abilities improved dramatically.",
    "How to engage with academic French (French as not only the tool of communication but also the historically and culturally produced mode of expression)",
    "I increased my French vocabulary and learned more advanced grammar. I also finished my first long novel in French."

   "comments": [
    "I liked when we were reading Sac de Billes and were able to learn vocabulary, have discussions, and not just be so focused on grammar.",
    "Strength: you learn a lot of French Weakness: it is a lot of work",
    "A strength is that the course is very intensive which is needed when learning a foreign language since in order to progress in it, you need to be constantly engaged and working. A weakness would be that we did not practice conversational speaking as much as I wish.",
    "So. Much. Work. Unrelenting homework. The class itself was not conceptually too difficult but the amount of work was absurd. There were many nights when all I had time to do was French homework because there was so much. The work kind of consumed my academic life. And a lot of it felt unnecessary, repetitive, or like busy work.",
    "Wide range of course materials which allowed us to learn history not only of France but also of other francophone countries, through different materials (novels, short stories, films, songs, pictures\/paintings and other visual expressions, etc). The course was focused not only upon the skills to use French but also upon the understanding of francophone culture, a culture shaped by the French language, which incorporates different localities, histories, and experiences of different peoples.",
    "This course does a very good job of teaching grammar, vocabulary, speaking, and listening skills at the same time. I like how the grammar homework is based on the books so that you can review and learn at the same time. However, at least three of the texts we read ended with the female protagonist committing suicide, and I don't believe that's a narrative we should perpetuate."

   "comments": [
    "If you are taking French 130 right now, defiantly take 140.",
    "Yes! If you are enthusiastic about French and want to learn the language take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to students wishing to improve their French.",
    "Yes but only if you are passionate about improving your French. This amount of work would not be for everyone. But Im grateful to have been in the actual class because I do feel like my spoken and written french hs improved dramatically.",
    "Yes, this course is the first moment in which you can learn the wealth of the francophone culture. Using French, you can appreciate various cultures and civilisations beyond France, critically think about the history of colonialism and the contribution of the French langauge to the imperialist project, and how the colonised people have used the French language to challenge the colonisers' inhumanity and create \"their own\" culture",
    "Yes, if you're serious about learning French. It's very well organized, but a significant amount of work."
