   "comments": [
    "Take it if you can. Taking this course made me want to possibly major in Religious Studies, and it definitely changed the way in which I considered Christianity in our modern world. While the work load is considerably large (a lot of reading), everything that you learn makes you want to learn more. You just don't do it because you don't have enough time. But take it! Also, if you take it, you're going to need a lot of chocolate and candy to get through, because some of the readings are just too depressing.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Regardless of personal belief system, the systematic examination of the problem of evil was a valuable pursuit that changed the way I look at world events and my own response to them.",
    "It is a survey course of sorts into the theologies and theodicies of various theologians and philosophers. I would absolutely recommend it!",
    "An discussion seminar for people interested in philosophy, religion, and\/or humanity.",
    "The quality and focus of this seminar really depend on the students in it. For my class, we wanted to talk about Calvin almost every meeting for half the semester, even though he was one of our first readings. There is also a mix of religious and non-religious people, and people of many different Christian beliefs, which made it difficult at times to pin down the main assumptions of the Christian faith during a discussion. The subject material can be depressing, but it helps if people bring in candy to each class, which Shannon advocates at the beginning of the seminar. The readings are generally not too long, and there is a presentation of the readings at the beginning of each class in case you didn't read at all, so you can still contribute to the discussion. The assignments are a presentation, midterm paper, and a final paper\/project. It is a great course!",
    "This was my first religious studies class, and it was definitely a rigorous course but definitely manageable for people without experience. Professor Craigo-Snell is wonderful, and really cares about her students and creating a great discussion atmosphere.",
    "Fascinating material, amazing and accessible professor, occasionally dry but usually great readings (particularly during the end of the class).",
    "RLST 278 takes the class through a procession of readings designed to make them question and analyze four main characteristics of the Christian God: His omnipotence, His omniscience, His omnibenevolence and the fact that he is in conflict with a very real Evil. It challenges the students to understand the perspective of the writer, stack up different writers perspectives against each other, and then perform a personal, critical analysis to decide which system they think works better. Its not necessarily about right and wrong answers, but about the why behind each possibility. This class was amazing. Highly recommended."
