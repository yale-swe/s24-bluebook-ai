    "I learned a lot about Connecticut policy and climate change mitigation in the transportation sector.",
    "Project management, analyzing survey data, writing a report with other people, environmental justice, the link between climate change and health, survey administration",
    "I learned just how much background information is needed in doing research.",
    "By taking this course, I learned about state climate change policy, team project work, environmental justice issues, environmental public health issues, and flexibility in project design based on working with a advisory non-profit group.",
    "You work in different teams on a variety of projects related to environmental sustainability and climate justice. We have lectures every week that dive into different tools that might be helpful while working on our projects: community-based participatory research, principles of environmental justice, qualitative research, library tools, etc. You learn how to work in a team, plan out long-term projects, balance a heavy workload. You learn how to communicate information both in presentations and written reports. You get hands-on experience working with community partners."

   "comments": [
    "I expected to get very deep into the project this semester, which I felt like did happen.",
    "I expected to do a bit more applied work, but everything ended up being theoretical and kind of detached in the end. A lot of it felt like it was practicing work, not doing work that was for someone and meaningful. I guess the whole experience just felt a little too disconnected for my liking. I learned a ton of content (knowledge - exceeds expectations), but I do not feel like I gained too many new skills or insights. Perhaps, most importantly, I got to flex my oral & written communications skills.",
    "They aligned very well. I was very excited to take this course and hopefully I will be able to take it again in the future.",
    "I learned much more about the subjects than I anticipated. The group work was both challenging and rewarding, and I learned more about myself as a team player. I learned less about environmental public health issues than I anticipated.",
    "fairly well. I don't think I anticipated spending such a significant amount of time on project framing and literature review vs more active engagement with stakeholders, clients, etc. However, I understand why this was the case.",
    "It aligned well with my expectations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are the partnerships with these clients. Overall, it was interesting to work with CFE and I liked the opportunity to work on a project that they are going to keep working on and make into something really useful for them. As far as the class goes, I think it could work with the clients more from the beginning to specifically define the project so that the student groups are not left like we are, which was spending half the semester trying to figure out what the project even was. In addition, I did not find most or any of our class time valuable. It was good to meet with Laura and spend some group work time, but that could have happened on our own. I found the class lectures to be way too basic for a graduate level. While I understand that not everyone is coming in with a background on these topics, I thought they were very rudimentary introductions into these topics and not very interesting. I also thought that not all of the lectures applied to every group, yet we still had to be there for all of them, which didn't make sense to me. I feel like we had to be in class even when we didn't need to be in that space to be working on the project. Dinner would have been nice the whole semester, since that is a challenging time to be holding a class. I think all of the progress reports and reflections are unnecessary.",
    "Strength: The project was really cool. My team was lovely. My advisor was well informed on the topic and really cared about our success. Weakness: I felt like we spent so much time talking about the project and not enough time actually doing it. In class, we spent an hour learning topics that were not particularly useful. We then spent the next hour meeting with our preceptor, followed by another preceptor meeting (with little progress in between) later that week. I feel like this project was not unlike my summer internship which I found super engaging. Unlike my summer internship, however, I was not immersed in the place or the people or the work, I didn't feel like our preceptors valued us too much or the work we were doing, and I didn't have a dedicated time to work on it. Instead, I just had meetings on meetings on meetings with very little progress in between to justify the meetings. Another weakness is that the deliverables were not flexible enough to make sense for our project and resulted in a lot of extra work on our part and a lot of unnecessary text that I'm not sure our preceptors will take the time to read. I think our deliverables should have just been our aims & transition memo. In total, both of these weaknesses meant that I spent a ton of time on this class meeting obligations and very little time moving the project forward.",
    "Weakness: Sometimes our professor micro-managed us and we didn't get a chance to learn from the other professors that were not our advisers Strengths: They provided dinner at the class, the professors gave lectures on their work and connected it to the class",
    "I think the course can be improved by designing targeted workshops that multiple groups will benefit from, while leaving other groups to work in class. This will require prior coordination of project activities for the semester and looking for areas of overlap. I think it would also be useful to have more structured interactions between projects that have similar deliverables to facilitate discussion of approaches and challenges faced.",
    "The GANTT Chart was kinda weird, but other than that, it was a very strong course.",
    "One strength of this course if that it gives students the opportunity to work with a non-profit consultant group on issues that are meaningful to that group. Also, the course provides the opportunity for team work towards a product that will be useful for real world application. The teaching was excellent, and the instructors provided ample structure and resources to guide all the clinic projects. Course lectures were interesting, though not always relevant toward all clinic projects. Weekly meeting with faculty advisors kept clinic work on track.",
    "Strengths: Commitment of supervisor to projects our team dynamics presence of all three instructors and their different contributions Improvements: More engagement with other teams and classmates Oral presentation earlier in term so get updates on what other teams were working on? Organization of files on canvas and use of announcements vs files etc. to post items could be improved! it was very hard to find stuff in canvas.",
    "Strengths: Gain practical work experience, team members are great, support from instructors & preceptors Weaknesses: Classtime is during dinner time (they started providing dinner halfway in the semester thankfully), sometimes lectures are not as relevant\/pressing to needs of the project, difficult to transition into a project (slow start because teams are getting to know each other, trying to plan out best steps to move forward), teams don't really get to communicate with each other outside of your own team, don't really get to meet instructors outside of your main preceptor, lots of busy work that kind of distracts from actually doing work on the project"

   "comments": [
    "It depends what project you are working on, but if it is something you are interested in and you are excited and flexible when working with your client, I think this could be a good experience.",
    "would absolutely recommend taking this course if: - You find a project you love - You work well under uncertainty - You are self-driven enough to work in an unstructured environment",
    "Talk to students that took the class before you",
    "Understand that this course is kinda time consuming and it is meant to be that way. Look to block out 8-10 hours weekly to dedicate to this course working on various things for the project. Some weeks might become more time consuming than others if you do not stick to the 8-10 hr a week schedule.",
    "Allow for more time for course work than a typical class. Work closely with your advisors to keep projects on track. Divide the work among your teammates, but make sure to review each other's work for consistency. We found that rotating team roles (leader, speaker, note-taker, emailer, researcher, writer, etc) allowed all team members to take the lead at different points in the project depending on strengths, weaknesses, and personal time constraints. Stay flexible; the real-life nature of the work may dictate a shift in the work as you learn more about your topic.",
    "It's a lot of work and very project dependent. Only take if you are truly interested in the project you will be working on.",
    "Be prepared for a heavy workload that may fluctuate throughout the semester. Think about what you want to get out of this class and make sure you are ready to commit if you decide to take the class. For me, I realized that although I appreciate the practical experience of this clinic, I found it difficult to balance the workload with other classes. However, working in a great team and with an amazing project was a meaningful experience that I wouldn't trade for anything."
