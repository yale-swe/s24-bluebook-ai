    "I gained knowledge on various issues concerning US-China relations.But I am also confused on many issues.",
    "I learnt about the value and relevance of international law and domestic law in bilateral relations as well as the attitudes of the state parties toward legal instruments involved.",
    "I learned much more about U.S.-China relations and important political issues facing China today.",
    "Critical thinking skills, ability to appreciate different sets of opinions, ability to understanding different legal frameworks",
    "Great course covering U.S.-China relations and what implications law has. This course allows students to discover U.S.-China relations through a different lens and offers critical analysis from both sides.",
    "Significant insight into law and international law, current relations, and political ideologies.",
    "exposure to new topics on china and ways to think about them",
    "I had no background in law before taking the class, and spent the semester learning to apply legal arguments and questions to policy debates.",
    "I deepened my understanding on the points at issue concerning US-China political relations. The course covered a wide range of topics like Taiwan, South China Sea, trade, investment, AIIB, environment, cybersecurity, and human rights. I also learned about the legal systems of the two countries as well as the basic structure of international law."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this class is that the readings cover various topics and perspectives, which is very comprehensive. The weakness of this class is that the instructor would lead the classes by asking broad questions which is not very good for making the discussions organized and structured.",
    "Relevant experts were invited to share on their experiences and views in class and these were interesting as they provided a first-hand account of the management of US-China relations and the legal principles involved. The class size was too large and it was difficult for everyone to be actively involved in the discussion during the seminar.",
    "The strengths are that Robert is an engaged professor who cares about the material and student learning. However, the course can become boring since it is 2 straight hours of discussion. Sometimes guest lecturers come in, but that makes it only more boring, since the guest lecturer just goes on and on - at some point the human attention span just conks out. Also there is a debate portion of the class where students are split into groups and debate an assigned topic, which at least forces engagement with the material since no one wants to look like an idiot but the drawback is that the students not participating in the debate are not engaged and hardly participate in the after-debate discussion. I think the course could be greatly improved if there were a presentation section. Another seminar I took required every student to give a short oral presentation (you could use PowerPoint, YouTube, etc.) on any topic within the scope of the class. It was the best part of the class! For this class, students could craft presentations based on their editorials or have a separate presentation assignment altogether.",
    "Excellent readings that covered a broad range of topics. Knowledgeable prof who was able to introduce us to some fascinating speakers.",
    "Course is highly unorganized and lack depth. No feedback was given to improve learning.",
    "Strengths: very broad, comprehensive Weaknesses: discussion can be too superficial sometimes",
    "It would be better if the seminar topics and readings are fixed before the semester kicks off.",
    "Strengths: Course covered all of the major areas of interest; Prof. Williams did a great job with reaction papers\/debates to make sure all students participated equally. Weaknesses: We often spent a lot of time discussing China's side of the relationship but not an equal time trying to understand the U.S. stance\/approach.",
    "This course was excellent in that Professor Williams allowed us to come to our own assessments of previous legal cases and current events and discuss our points of view with him and our peers. I especially enjoyed and learned from the in class debates in which we had to argue an assigned position. The debates really required each side to think out of the box and beyond the assigned readings.",
    "This was by far my favorite course this semester and a fascinating take on current events and the intersection of law and international relations. The course was well-taught and engaging,",
    "good coverage of contemporary chinese issues, but discussion could be more structured",
    "It would be nice to have more time to discuss the legal arguments in question, but otherwise, the class was incredibly informative and provided a useful primer on just about every issue in Sino-US relations today.",
    "Strength: The reading assignments and the professor's explanation helped me to understand current situations, historical backgrounds, legal limitations, and political difficulties of each topic. The professor was so energetic to enhance our understandings that he gave us thought-provoking feedback to our papers. Weakness: At times, he didn't show us a clear answer to the question he asked us even when there is a sole answer."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is a very informative class and the debates conducated in class are very fun and engaging.",
    "There was nothing particularly special about this course - a typical seminar. If you're very interested in the course topic then it may be worthwhile.",
    "No. The organization of the course leaves much for desire.",
    "If you want to know more about the law, policy and implications for US and China",
    "Yes, great course for anyone interested in U.S.-China affairs or diplomacy in general.",
    "This course is not a large class in which the professor lectures at you as you frantically take notes. Also, while in other courses, I have found myself trying to write an essay in coherence with the professors own views - politically or otherwise - there was no such pressure to do so in GLBL 817. Professor Williams was a fair grader who appreciated a well written and thought-out argument no matter where it fell on the political spectrum.",
    "Yes, without hesitation.",
    "great if you like to contribute to class discussion",
    "If they are interested in Sino-US relations but have little understanding of law, absolutely. This class makes a lot of sense for Jackson students in its current configuration, introducing law to students who are more familiar with policy.",
    "Yes I would. After the course I became able to explain core political concerns of the US and China, legal limitation on their political choices, and influence of the characters of the administrations under Trump and Xi on the decisions of the two nations."
