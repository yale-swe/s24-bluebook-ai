    "I would definitely recommend this class if what you want to do is read French. It won't help you at all with speaking or producing French, but that's fine - all I wanted to do was to be able to read my favorite books in their original language, and the class made me feel like I can do it! The workload is constant but manageable, and doing a bit of work every day is the best way to increase your proficiency. Not doing the translations makes class awkward the next week, so you should actually do them. They help you a lot too. And Professor Sanjabi is great and always willing to help you!"
