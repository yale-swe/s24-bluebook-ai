   "comments": [
    "This course taught me the basics of coding and how to think in a coding framework. Specifically, the course taught rudimentary R skills. I also learned non-Darwinian evolution and how to approach language and culture in a phylogenetic framework.",
    "I enrolled in this class with an entry-level knowledge of linguistics and evolutionary biology, but with virtually no experience in computational methods of historical linguistics, anthropology, or their connection to evolutionary biology. As such, I learned a lot about these topics and methods, I learned the ropes of several computer programs and languages used in these methods, and I learned about several cutting-edge issues in the field of anthropological phylogenetics.",
    "Computational skills. linguistic skills, writing skills",
    "Unlike many Yale courses, which are all about theory, this class taught both the theory behind phylogenetic approaches to language and culture and how to implement them. We learned a lot of practical skills regarding computational phylogenetics, as well as how to analytically approach quantitative questions and think about topics like religion and ethics in a new light."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the course; I liked both the instructors and I enjoyed the small class size. However, I found the class dynamic to be a little bit problematic in that one person who was only auditing the course seemed to monopolize the conversation whenever he was present. Similarly, the fact that the course was mixed grad-undergrad meant that there was huge variability in prior knowledge, which I found quite frustrating.",
    "This course is quite ground-breaking. Everything we discuss in class is on the very cutting edge of phylogenetics, linguistics, and anthropology. We discuss papers that have just been published and issues that are still hotly controversial. As such, it feels like a very immersive first step into linguistics and anthropology. That said, the learning curve in the computational parts of the class is very steep and it's easy to find yourself falling behind even if you keep on top of your work.",
    "A great class but I wish I had more background coming in"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. However, I think one would get the most out of the course if they could do all the readings and devote a lot of time to it. Thus, I would suggest it to someone who is taking fewer classes.",
    "This class is not the sort of class that you should take if you're just looking for an easy Social Science credit. If you're really interested in human evolution, biology, linguistics, or contemporary issues in the studies of humanity, then you should definitely check it out. Professor Bowern is a wealth of knowledge, and interacting with somebody like her - whose work is groundbreaking and important - is a privilege. Some of the work is, conceptually, quite hard and requires a lot of diligence and weekly trips to office hours, but it's really worth it if you're at all interested in the subject.",
    "I would recommend this class to people interested in Computational Linguistic, this would be the best class to take",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was fascinating and teaches you useful things; whether or not you plan to continue studying the evolution of language and culture using these tools, it introduces you to R and how to think in a certain way. Unlike many courses, you get the satisfaction of applying what you learn to get real results. They also modified the course significantly after the first year, so they take student input into consideration, which is nice."
