    "We learned a broad overview of important 20th century Latin American artists and movements, spanning Central to South America. We considered the question of the \"global contemporary\" and had conversations regarding the transient nature of the art world today.",
    "Professor Bravo is an excellent professor, and she is clearly expert enough in the material to make really appropriate selections for readings.",
    "As someone who has little to no background in art history, this class was challenging but rewarding. the course was well structured to suit students of all backgrounds, and the discussions we had in class were very productive.",
    "Learned an enormous amount about Latin American art and culture, the patterns across art movements as well as their differences, and their relationships to art movements throughout the rest of the world."

   "comments": [
    "I thought that this class was well structured - Monica organized each class to revolve around a theme, place, or movement and the seminar was conducive to discussing the readings. I thought perhaps there were too many people in the course - a smaller discussion maybe would have engaged more people in the class.",
    "I felt the highest strength of the course to be its accessibility. As a student who had never taken art history before, I was concerned about my capability, but professor Bravo made the course extremely accessible. I felt the course could be improved by putting more responsibilty on students to do readings. I feel it might improve our discussion. Perhaps there could short, weekly responses rather than two short papers? I feel that the consistent workload would be more ideal for students and would better facilitate discussion.",
    "Strengths are in Professor Bravo's fluency in the material; weaknesses are that occasionally the reading load I think was too much to fully integrate into each session."
