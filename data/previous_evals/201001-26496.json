    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this class. It was a great introduction to legal discussions taking place today about the online world. I also learned a lot about the legal system.",
    "I would highly suggest this course to those individuals who are interested in pursuing a career in law. It give you an idea of how to approach court cases and such and although it made me realize that I was not as interested in a career in law as I thought I was, I value the interpretations and perspectives that the thinking required for this course gave me.",
    "THIS CLASS WAS AWESOME. Reasonable workload, fantastic topic. I doubt it will be offered again though so this is a non-issue. If it is a new teacher, research the new professors other classes.",
    "Great class, I would recomend it",
    "A great seminar environment in which you will learn a lot about some very critical issues that are central to the way our democracy is evolving in the 21st century. Everything you learn in this class is fascinating.",
    "Definitely"
