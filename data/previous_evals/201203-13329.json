   "comments": [
    "Hard to evaluate this course under the normal paradigm - it's different. Incredible opportunity to learn about an incredible artist and scholar - I'd say the reading list gave us a pretty solid introduction to this man. I sometimes found seminar a little structureless but it some ways I'm learning to accept that this class is almost more about building an ensemble of thinkers about Grotowski than imparting each of us with knowledge we can walk away with.Dominka is incredibly knowledgable about the subject matter and is cool as a professor in that she seems genuinely interested in collaborating with us rather than just teaching us. This provides an awesome opportunity for us but it also requires a level of engagement and dedication that sometimes we busy and less-narrowly-focused undergraduates cannot really give.",
    "Terrific opportunity to learn more about Grotowski, whose life and work are truly fascinating. The readings and screenings are interesting, and the workload is manageable. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking forward to being a part of THST 425 in the spring!",
    "if you like experimental theater or grotowski, then take it.",
    "A deceptively huge amount of material that runs across a HUGE spectrum -even with some exposure to Grotowski before this class, I didn't realize how much of his work would be relatively uninteresting to me. The semester separation of theory and performance\/physical engagement is a big problem; reading about Grotowski's theory for a whole semester and seeing\/trying very little of it incites some dangerous skepticism and confusion. Also, class discussions often feel kind of unfocused- what was the takeaway of today's class?",
    "This class is a valuable, in-depth introduction to Grotowski's work, and I would absolutely recommend it to other students. It is a unique opportunity, as his work is not studied often at Yale, at least not in my experience, especially to this extent."
