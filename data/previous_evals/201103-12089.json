   "comments": [
    "This class is fascinating. I would strongly recommend it.",
    "Great class- take it. It is a very interesting topic and a fun class as well.",
    "Definitely--even for those who are unfamiliar with music or architecture, this class opens you up to a different way of thinking and a different perspective.",
    "A wonderful, intimate seminar. Ideal for the musician wishing to broaden horizons and explore the study of architecture for the first time. Readings and listenings are fascinating and not too dense. Suitable for someone with background in neither field, but the musical part might be a challenge.",
    "It's not just about jazz or architecture, though there's a lot of both. It's about thinking in an abstract manner and learning to borrow ideas from different artistic disciplines. Prepare to do a lot of head-scratching, but if you keep an open mind you will gain a lot from the class."
