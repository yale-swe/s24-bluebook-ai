   "comments": [
    "Unfortunately, this class is much better on paper than in actuality. I enrolled because the syllabus and reading list appealed to me as an East Asian Studies student with little knowledge of Buddhism, but found the class overly complicated with a flawed structure to lectures. There seems to be a disconnect between what is learned in the class and what is examined by the four short paper assignments, and I think this - in addition to a difficult-to-understand instructor - resulted in a class that was under-attended and overambitious. Shinohara is clearly brilliant, and his notes for each lecture were terrific, but somehow that didn't translate into an enjoyable classroom experience. I'd only recommend this class if it undergoes serious changes, becomes more thematically based, or turns into a seminar.",
    "The class is great ! The readings and the insights that Professor Shinohara will really make you question many things you have probably taken for granted throughout your life. While Professor Shinohara might be hard to follow at times, his notes are incredibly useful. In addition, the structure of the class with 4 short assignments allows students to critically engage with the material and start developing a sense on how to deal with this very large corpus of texts. Therefore, it makes this class the best \"introductory\" course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes!",
    "A little disappointing. Lectures aren't that great, but all the readings are very interesting.",
    "interesting class definitely take it",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone. I am really interested in Buddhism and wanted to learn more but this class was a total turnoff. You can't hear the professor and even when you can he doesn't make any sense. It was almost a total waste of time twice a week. It's great that there are only 4 papers due and no exams but if you can't follow anything that is going on in the readings those 4 papers become a total nightmare.",
    "Yes, please take it, to know that whatever you know about Buddhism is not true at all. Like a quote in the class we took away with \"If you see a Buddha, kill the Buddha.\"",
    "You must be very very interested in Buddhism to find this class useful in anyway. The readings are really all you will take from it. I would not recommend this class to another student.",
    "Take it!! Buddhism in China and Japan was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The material is very interesting and Professor Shinohara is quite brilliant. Do yourself a favor and go to class- he may be soft spoken but if you pay attention to even half of what he says you will really get something out of lecture. There are only four short essays which are quite straightforward and enjoyable to write. And our TA Alex was really helpful and an awesome person to talk to. Overall this was a fantastic class!",
    "It is not much work and the grading is not tough. I would not recommend it to someone not using for their major or taking it Credit\/D because the material is opaque and difficult to understand without a lot of effort. Most of the coursework is reading old, confusing Buddhist primary sources and writing short 4 page papers comparing them.",
    "The course was interesting and informative. I feel that it better suits students wishing to learn about the history of Buddhism than those wishing to engage with Buddhist philosophy.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone with a deep interest in the subject of buddhism, but only if they are willing to do a large amount of reading and learn well from interpreting primary texts. This is not a history-type course, it is more about reading important texts from different schools of buddhism and inferring the values\/similarities and differences between the schools through them."
