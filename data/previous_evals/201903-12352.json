    "I learned about medieval and modern Russian history, the importance of Orthodoxy in Russia, and the influence of international relations on the development of Russia.",
    "General overview of Russian history, and a great introduction to the world as it was back then.",
    "I learned a great deal about a topic I had no previous exposure to. Reading primary sources gave us a really fascinating insight into this time period!",
    "I learned more about medieval Russia.",
    "I learned a great deal about a period and region I had little to no knowledge of. Themes surrounding changes in society and politics were clear throughout and were helpful in evaluating and learning about the nature of Russian society and government over time.",
    "Obviously we covered most of the important going-one and people in Russian history from the start of the Russian state in 800 up to the end of the Napoleonic wars in Europe in 1815. It was also cool though, to really get a better sense of what historians do and the sorts of questions they try to answer as well as the resources available to them."

   "comments": [
    "Honestly a great all-round course.",
    "Strengths: the course is very organized. the primary readings are very interesting. Weaknesses: assessments are based on exams, which I don't think are the best for history courses. I think writing research papers give students more opportunities to explore and draw connections with course materials instead of mere memorizations. The content of the readings sometimes overlapped with the lectures. I hope there are more primary readings and less secondary readings especially the chapters written by Janet Martin.",
    "Professor Bushcovitch is great, especially if you're engaged with the material of the course. The class covers a wide array of subjects throughout this fairly expansive period in Russian history, but never loses its focus the rare tangent is interesting and tells you more about either Russian at the time or sometimes later Soviet treatment of Russian history.",
    "Strengths: super interesting material, good balance between lectures and readings. Weaknesses: often not enough time to really discuss primary sources."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. The professor is absolutely amazing and really passionate about the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who like to do readings and like to learn historical facts of Russia. No prerequisite knowledge of Russian history required.",
    "Yes, the teaching and material are both exceedingly interesting.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in history, especially if you want to know about Russia and how that country got to how it is today. Professor Bushkovitch is somewhat unorthodox but I found that refreshing. He is certainly incredibly knowledgeable about the material and interested in getting everyone to think like a historian."
