    "Gained a better appreciation for the philosophy and story of the Mahabharata",
    "You will learn about the Mahabharata, a Hindu Epic poem",
    "This class explored the Mahabharata, secondary literature written about it, and, more broadly, Indian philosophy.",
    "I have about the importance of introspection in this course. What I love about the course is its impact beyond the walls of the classroom where every lesson is something very much applicable to one's daily life. It has taught me that there is never a direct answer to everything and that there are always multiple dimensions to the idea of righteousness."

    "Amazing professor! Did an absolutely amazing job!",
    "Could have had more engaged students. Class participation was very low, despite the professor trying to encourage it.",
    "As a student approaching the Mahabharata for the first time, I think more could have been done to contextualize the epic before we started reading it. I also felt some of the readers were very difficult and inaccessible if you did not have prior knowledge.",
    "The readings are honestly fascinating. I think forcing students to submit discussion questions each week (like submit a PDF with 3 critical questions and then pick a few to discuss in class) and facilitating more discussion would have been good, but I enjoyed the content quite a bit.",
    "There was a lot of reading. I think it was overwhelming how much reading there was at times. Having said that, I think this caused some people to not do most of the reading.",
    "Some discussions were a little bit meandering, but, still, I feel that I now have a much better understand of the Mahabharata, its characters and concepts of Indian philosophy. I liked the weekly discussion forum and I also liked the readings Professor Flick chose for each week.",
    "The choice of readings were excellent and thought provoking. I really enjoyed the student presentations as they had so much insightful ideas that truly inspired me."

    "Must take",
    "Dean Flick is absolutely amazing! This class will change your perspective on so many different things. You can really enjoy the course because of Dean Flick's laid back approach.",
    "Fun and easy 5th class, assuming you're interested in the material. Dean Flick is a great and very chill professor",
    "This is a very easy class with a very low workload. You probably won't learn a ton, but there are plenty of interesting essays on an area of the world and a genre of literature that you may know very little about. And you should do very well.",
    "Great course; the readings are short, but fascinating. The workload is super manageable: a 3-5 page paper, a 10 page final paper, and a presentation + 3ish page write-up. I learned quite a bit and came away more appreciative of the epic.",
    "If you are interesting in this religious text then yes.",
    "Dean Flick is amazing! While a lot of people may not put much effort into this course, you can really learn a lot. I had little previous knowledge of the Mahabharata before coming into this class and I learned a ton, through the readings and individual presentations. The workload consists of weekly readings, midterm and final papers, and an individual 15 minute presentation on one of the readings, so definitely manageable. There was one topic at the end of the course that I was particularly interested in, and Dean Flick talked to me about it on the side and was able to provide me some interesting resources to look at. This is a pretty interesting, low workload humanities credit by a great, super sweet professor-- would recommend!",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, I think it is a very interesting subject.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in South Asian religion and philosophy.",
    "Yes",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to students who are very much interested in the philosophical discourses of righteousness. The course is a wonderful one as it takes students on a journey of self discovery where the epic does not become a narrative but the symbolism of reality that every individual can relate to."
