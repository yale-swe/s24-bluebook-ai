   "comments": [
    "I learned how to do order of magnitude estimation in order to fact-check information propagated by the media and politicians, which I expect will be useful in the future. I learned about global warming and the feasibility of space travel, as well as how to write eloquently and persuasively about scientific topics.",
    "Never have I learned more life skills in a science class before! Wonderful course, learned computer science to FERMI problems to planet formation. Order-of-magnitude problems showed me just how much I already knew.",
    "I learned a lot of astrology but also a lot of other information, such as bit flops and biology, which was fun to learn. I think the skills, especially fermi estimation, will help me in the future.",
    "More than anything else, I learned to be comfortable with estimating answers to some of the most difficult questions one can imagine e.g. estimate the number of planets in the Milky Way or the number of ants on Earth. While at first an odd skill to consider, I consider it particularly useful as a someone interested in political economy.",
    "This course was super cool! Even as an engineering student, I learned to think about problems in innovative, interesting ways. The course touches on order of magnitude estimation, planetary orbits, and interesting thought experiments, to name only a few subjects.",
    "Expanded my ability to use estimation to answer seemingly impossibly questions, to better understand many concepts from the formation of solar systems to the phases of the moon to the development of life on earth.",
    "The course forced me to engage in a kind of creative reasoning unlike any other Yale course I had previously taken.",
    "The ability to accurately estimate things that I thought were impossible before.",
    "The most useful thing I learned from this class was how to confidently estimate large values such as the mass of a building or the volume of oil humanity has extracted from Earth to within a factor of ten. This skill will be useful in future discussions of large-scale topics, both in college and post-college.",
    "I learned a great deal about the world we live in, and the fundamental processes that drive the universe. I developed the skill of how to estimate and come up with a solution myself instead of simply relying on what others may tell you. This is a very important and overlooked skill in the world and stimulates quick-thinking and responses."

   "comments": [
    "The lectures were really interesting and the skills were important because they were life skills and not just important in the context of the class, which I really appreciated and I think is the point of being at college in the first place. Professor Laughlin is a great teacher and explains things very well with engaging examples. I found the problem sets pretty difficult and time consuming, but if I put in a lot of effort I could do quite well on them. I would have liked the information given about the final to be more in line with what was on the exam, because I thought that we were led to believe that the final would be something different than what it actually was. Nevertheless the class was challenging in a good way as well as very interesting. The system of grading and the amount of work expected was very fair.",
    "Professor Laughlin is a great asset to the course. What he finds interesting is really interesting! He's very humorous and can make 75 minutes tolerable and enjoyable. P-Sets are hard, but there are not too many and the teaching staff makes every effort to help.",
    "The lectures were fairly unstructured and didn't follow the syllabus most of the time. However, it was a very enjoyable class, and I think Greg will learn how to be more structured as he continues to teach at Yale.",
    "Overall, a great class. However, it could have been more interesting for longer periods of time had certain, arguably more exotic, concepts been discussed e.g. black holes, supernova, quasars, neutron stars etc. While the Milky Way is interesting, it would have been more fun to drop certain concepts e.g. the phases of the moon (which I realise aren't as well known by US students as for most internationals like myself) to dedicate more time to debating more complex ideas and conundrums.",
    "The biggest strength of the course was by far professor Laughlin. He made lectures engaging and interesting, and made sure everyone was along for the ride. I think the homeworks could have been structured a little better. For instance, we didn't re-use the horizon drawings from the first homework even though I initially thought we would. Honestly though, I wouldn't have wanted to keep referencing my horrible drawing anyway, so I was thankful for that.",
    "Really passionate, helpful, well-spoken and flexible professor. Interesting material and sometimes challenging problem sets, but again helpful professor was great for that. Sometimes got a little more QR-ish than expected\/preferred.",
    "There is no clear syllabus or teaching structure. It is very tough as a student to put together the pieces of the class. It could be improved by better pedagogy and more coherent structure. The strengths are that the class has great depth as an introductory astronomy course.",
    "I think a strength was the diversity of material covered, and a weakness was its overemphasis on QR in what was supposed to be a non-QR class.",
    "Sometimes the course material was dry and uninteresting (topics such as orbits) while other times the material was engaging (such as energy).",
    "I felt that the course was a little structurally unorganized - despite the topics being interesting, we would jump between different material without connection. We also could've spent less time writing out specific numbers, and more time learning about concepts. However, I thought that the course provided an understanding of a lot of topics that related to the Earth and universe."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course if one is interested in astronomy, but would also caution them to go into it understanding that there will be quite a bit of math involved (even though the class isn't for a QR credit) and the psets will require a lot of time. However the class is good because if one works hard and tries to engage with the material one can do well.",
    "Six problem sets that take about 5-7 hours each and a very low stress final. Classes passed by pretty quickly although they were sometimes disorganized. This class is much more about Prof. Laughlins favorite topics than it is specifically about astronomy (ie. global warming, energy usage, computing power, interstellar exploration, etc.). Also at least half of the class time\/homework is estimation problems (ie. How much oil has been produced in all of time? How long would it take to travel to mars?), so you should only take this if youre up for that. Probably useful if youre doing consulting interviews or want to get better at back-of-the-envelope fact checking. Very random assortment of topics but a low key, definitely low stress science class for non-majors. Also Greg Laughlin is the nicest\/coolest prof ever.",
    "Yes. If you're not a science wiz or if math is not on your side, take this course. It's incredible. It changes the way you think and tethers so much unbelievable information. Professor Laughlin is terrific and will be there for you every step of the way. Give him your best effort and he will give you a terrific semester.",
    "This class is a very low stress science credit, but I also learned a lot more science than I was expecting. There are only 6 psets total and one final, but the PSETs taught me a lot. The PSETs are really hard, but the grading is very fair and will give you a lot of points for effort. The final is also really straight forward. Take it if you are looking to learn a little bit more about the Earth and have it impact how you will do policy in the future (most of this class is fermi estimation problems). It doesn't really teach you the cool stuff about astrophysics such as black holes, but it teaches you relevant to policy making astrology information which will probably be really helpful later in life.",
    "If you need a science credit but don't want to take just another easy class at Yale, if you want a challenge and an opportunity to think about the bigger ideas behind some of science's most fundamental principles, then this is the class for you.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course to other students. Professor Laughlin is a joy to listen to.",
    "Good science credit for non-science majors, great professor, you'll come away with lots of fun facts, a better understanding of some complicated concepts, and more skilled at order of magnitude estimations.",
    "Yes I would. It's a great science credit for non science majors.",
    "I would recommend this course because it offered a low-stress opportunity to understand a little more about our universe. It is mostly Earth-centric, however I learned about other planets and solar systems as well in this class. This is not a difficult science credit."
