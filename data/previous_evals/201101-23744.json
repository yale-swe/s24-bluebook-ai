   "comments": [
    "Yes absolutely, it's critical to knowing Spanish.",
    "AMAZING CLASS! Quite a bit of work, but it improves your Spanish SO MUCH. Sybil ALexandrov is one of the best professors at Yale. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "If you are serious about working towards fluency, or close to fluency, take this course. If you are looking for an easy, laid-back L5, this is not the class. This class was A LOT of work, but if you put in a lot of effort, you really will improve your Spanish. I took this class because I want to study abroad in a Spanish-speaking country, and now I really feel prepared. Also, take it with Alexandrov if possible, she really cares about her students and somehow makes Spanish grammar class enjoyable most days.",
    "This class is a lot of work and you will be tested on a lot of the nuanced aspects of Spanish grammar. Your grammar will definitely improve in this course. The grading is very tough though.",
    "Alexandrov is the person to take this course with. She is wonderful, and even manages to make grammar interesting. Lots of homework though, and definitely not easy.",
    "I took this as a second semester freshman after already taking \"Spanish in Politics, International Relations, and the Media\" (another L5 class) and I wish I had switched when I took these classes. I really recommend taking this as your first L5 class, no matter how good at Spanish you think you are, because it really helps you increase your fluency and reduce the grammatical mistakes you make. Writing papers in my other class would have been easier with the material I learned in this class. Take this class, especially if you can take it with Alexandrov. She is the sweetest, most fun professor I had this year and was more than willing to help. That being said, this is a tough class and the grading pretty rough, but you will learn a lot. I recommend taking this credit\/d\/fail if it's your 5 class, especially if you are taking it freshman year.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because first off, Professor Alexandrov is absolutely amazing and she is willing to work with me outside class on numerous occasions to help me improve my writing skills. Although this class requires a lot of work, the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. It enabled me to understand many nuances of the language that will allow me to speak more like a native speaker.",
    "Spanish 243 02 is a comprehensive course on the fundamentals of Spanish Grammar. I would recommend this course to any student who desires to improve not only their written but oral skills so as to further their understanding of the Spanish language.",
    "I'd recommend it if you're serious about improving your language skills, as these are things you need to learn and probably haven't",
    "A fantastic course. I definitely felt like my grammar improved. And Sybil Alexandrov is wonderful. Easy to understand, super friendly, etc. I can't think of a single negative thing to say about her.",
    "You'll learn a lot of subtleties of grammar that you wouldn't pick up otherwise. Even native speakers learned a few things in the class, so it's obviously useful in that respect. I don't really think I got better at speaking in the course of the class, but I was more aware of the mistakes I was making. I would say I increased in Spanish skills but lost Spanish confidence by taking this class.",
    "I loved this class, but I went in expecting and wanting a lot of grammatical busy work. The homework load is constant, but all helpful, and manageable because it's so structured (though you should get your act together early on deadlines--there are a lot and it can get confusing!) Take it if you need to be whipped into grammatical shape. I came out of it feeling a lot more confident in my language skills, and I think it's essential for moving towards fluency. DEFINITELY take it with Alexandrov--she's amazing.",
    "Advanced Spanish Grammar is an intensive course that addresses the most prominent grammar issues in the Spanish language. It's broken up into topics which makes the material easier to grasp. The class does meet 3 times a week, but I found it to be an enjoyable course. It's a lot of work but you will learn a lot. I would recommend it if you're willing to put in the work. Your Spanish will definitely improve by the end of the course.",
    "Professor Alexandrov is amazing. She has a great energy that is really infectious and she clearly wants to help you learn and have fun doing it. She is a fantastic teacher. Although the assignments can sometimes feel like busywork (and there's a lot of it), they really do help you learn the material. I really felt this class improved my Spanish, and I think the way Professor Alexandrov runs the class ensures that you improve your speaking too.She won a teaching award this year, and it was absolutely deserved."
