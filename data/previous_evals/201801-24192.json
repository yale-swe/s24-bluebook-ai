   "comments": [
    "This course taught me how to approach international development from a multi-faceted perspective. I learned how to write policy memos and briefs and to discuss development issues on a country-level and regional-level. The \"sovereignty gap\" was a very meaningful concept that I can hopefully apply in a future career.",
    "Prof Lockhart brings a ton of practical experience from years working with global leaders in developed and developing countries. Her experience has been invaluable to understanding the shortcomings of todays approach to development. I learned a lot about current practices and developed a good framework to think about approaching countries that require assistance.",
    "Better understanding of the different functions of a state and how to more effectively address each of them in the post-conflict\/fragile states.",
    "practical insights into the array of challenges facing reformers, and a much improved ability to communicate succinctly but substantively",
    "Statecraft, effective statebuilding, weak states.",
    "Differnt perspective. Loved interacting with students from other schools. Completly differnt from traditional courses I am taking at SOM",
    "I learned a whole lot about the development of effective states in terms of best practice, cases, and meeting key people in the development space. This class was amazing",
    "I have learnt ten functions of a state and this course helps me to understand and evaluate the government. The visit to DC brought textbook discussions to life."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: strongly discussion-oriented, diverse group of students, the professor is an esteemed practitioner. Weaknesses: N\/A. Students would show up late often.",
    "Strength: good balance between practice and theory, size of class, amazing professor, DC trip and in class speaker series Weakness: we should organize a more extensive trip given the success of the DC trip.",
    "The topic of the course was very interesting and relevant, and I appreciated the opportunity to learn from a distinguished practitioner like Clare. Really enjoyed the DC trip in particular as I thought it helpful to hear the perspectives and work of major stakeholders. However, the course suffered from serious organizational issues -- didn't often know what type of format we would get in class (guest speaker, seminar, or lecture) and whether we would discuss the required readings for that class or not. I often preferred the lecture format as seminar allowed for too many non sequitur or irrelevant comments from some students in the class.",
    "While learning from fellow students was great, it would also have been interesting to able to learn the more technical aspects of perhaps a specific function - how to evaluate or develop that.",
    "maintain a stricter schedule - put stricter time limits on topics discussed so that we can get to all scheduled topics in a session and avoid having to discuss things for which we did the readings a few weeks prior needless to say, the DC trip was an absolute highlight of the class",
    "It's a greta class, no improvements necessary.",
    "Strength: Great diversity and depth. Amazing exposure. Weakness: no direct feedback on how to improve my learning",
    "Excellent use of class discussion, real lwife examples, very knowledgeable and experienced professor. Class trip to DC was amazing. Professor Lockhart is exceptional, very knowledgeable, but also has an excellent teaching style and makes students feel comfortable and empowered to participate.",
    "I like the element of bringing speakers to classroom but sometimes I found the sharing from speakers is not related to what we are learning in class."

    "I thought this was an excellent course! I would recommend it to anyone interested in working in a global affairs-related field. The practical skills and insights you receive are very valuable.",
    "Absolutely, not least because Prof Lockhart is a fantastic professor who has unparalleled knowledge in the field she teaches. And for anyone looking to understand the theoretical shortcomings of todays development practices, this is the class to take",
    "Yes, but with significant adjustments in terms of consistent format and also more structure\/moderation in the discussion.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes - this course provides very important practical knowledge on state fragility, and the experiences of seasoned practitioners such as Prof. Lockhart and the guest speakers are invaluable for our learning",
    "Absolutely, Clare is a great prof and an asset for Jackson.",
    "Yes. Very different from other courses.",
    "Absolutely. This kind of course is one of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Definitely recommend if you want to understand what failing states need to perform to fulfill the sovereignty gaps."
