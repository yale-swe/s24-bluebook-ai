   "comments": [
    "Music 110 is an introductory music theory class. I would recommend it to any student interested in knowing more about music and music theory who doesn't have any background in it. I've played an instrument for years, and so I hesitated to take the class because it was \"meant for students who can't read music.\" But I only felt ahead of the game for the first week or two. It was exactly the right level for me from then on. If you play an instrument, but have never learned music theory, don't hesitate to take it! The skill practice can feel tedious at times, but it feels great to finally have a solid base of musical knowledge!",
    "It is definitely very beginner at the start of the semester, but it quickly moves to theory that many practicing musicians wouldn't necessarily know.",
    "MUSI 110 03 is a good introductory music class. As someone who last studied music in elementary school, I had forgotten much of what I had learned. This class reintroduced the same concepts I had previously learned and taught me so much more. At the beginning of the semester, the professor had us fill out an evaluation form to see how much musical knowledge we already possessed. My evaluation form was almost blank when I finished filling it out. But by the time the semester was over, I had learned about everything that was on the evaluation course. I definitely recommend this class to other Yale students."
