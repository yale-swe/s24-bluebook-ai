    "I continued to develop my knowledge of the Spanish language and to build an appreciation for the culture of Spanish speaking countries.",
    "I learned a lot of grammar and vocabulary, as well as social\/cultural information.",
    "In this class we focused a lot on grammar and vocabulary which makes sense as it is an L2 class. I learned a lot of grammar and I would say that my writing skills improved.",
    "I learned a lot about how to communicate more fluently and effectively in Spanish.",
    "I was able to greatly improve my communication skills",
    "Improved speaking, writing, and reading Spanish. Learned more about the history and cultures of various Spanish speaking countries.",
    "Basic Spanish Knowledge",
    "I was able to get a comprehensive basis for Spanish and brush up on my Spanish from high school.",
    "I learnt how to develop my Spanish skills, as well as working well in a group setting. It set a good basic understanding of the language as well as introductions to some literature etc.",
    "In taking this course I developed all the skills relevant to becoming more adept at a foreign language: reading, listening, speaking, writing, etc. There were also opportunities throughout to gain insight into the cultures of Spanish-speaking countries."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Very well organized Weaknesses: Very harsh grading",
    "Strengths were the organization, the instructor and sometimes fun activities! The course was definitely planned to the T. It was very textbook though, it did not seem to have many original ways of teaching Spanish. Dictations and other activities in the syllabus are outdated in many universities for teaching language nowadays so I was surprised to find them at Yale. Very cookie cutter which is good for learning grammar but less helpful when it comes to speaking or learning culture. I would say the course would be greatly improved if it moved away from encouraging the type of tourist, surface level depictions of Hispanic countries.",
    "It was very organized",
    "Course was paced faster than I expected.",
    "Very good class. Some of the work was unnecessary, but it helped in the long run",
    "It really helps you become fluent because you speak everyday in class.",
    "The strengths were definitely the breadth of the course and the high level of teaching as well as the workload which was consistent but challenging enough. However the weaknesses were a few of the texts that we studied: they were mainly relevant and of the target level but by the end I think were above the level of the course in terms of vocabulary and it seemed that it was harder for the people in the class to engage with. However, the instructor was good at clarifying the story the day after we looked at it individually.",
    "This course is very fast paced. Professor Alexandrov handled it excellently, but sometimes the syllabus meant concepts had a rapid turnover, and I didn't remember them in the long term.",
    "The course was exceptionally well organized, both in regard to its layout and the general flow of daily classes. The variety of course materials kept me engaged. Another major strength was the abundance of resources available to us, making it straightforward to study and prepare for evaluations."

    "I would recommend this course if you want to improve your Spanish, especially with Sybil. She is an excellent teacher: kind, clear, and helpful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn Spanish.",
    "Yes, I mean you have to take a language class and I would say that this is a solid language class. Just be prepared for more of an extension of what you did in high school as it is textbook heavy and even uses VHL (Vista Higher Learning). Get this professor if you can, she is fantastic and makes the whole class infinitely better.",
    "Yes - great class",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It fulfills the distributional requirement and could be relevant to your major.",
    "Yes, it is an engaging class. The is a high level of work, but it is all extremely manageable",
    "If they took Spanish in high school, this is the way to review before going on with your language requirement.",
    "Yes! An excellent way to move beyond an elementary understanding of the Spanish language and tackle tougher grammatical constructions and more complex sentences while also learning more about the cultures and countries in which Spanish is the dominant spoken language. I think my Spanish has improved greatly as a result of taking this course."
