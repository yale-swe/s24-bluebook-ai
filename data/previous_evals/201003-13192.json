   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this class although the structure, as my class took it, was a little unorganized in a general thematic sense. The topic is very broad but we certainly learned a lot about the inception of Islam, its spread, and some of its principles that conflict with the West. My only complaint was that we never dealt directly with the Qur'an but instead learned about it through the writings and teachers of secondary sources, albeit not contemporary.",
    "I would recommend the class if you want a low work writing credit, or have an interest in West African Islam. You don't need any previous knowledge of the subject, and the readings are not exactly mandatory except for the weeks you're presenting and of course the work for the research papers.",
    "Yes! It's a great course especially if you have any interest in Islam and don't have any background in the religion. For me it served as an introduction to islam in general while at the same time allowed me to learn a lot about a specific type of islam in a specific region (sufism in west africa) It was really a great course.But start the papers early!! do not try to write the papers in two days like I did. the class deserves more attention than that.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student with genuine interest in the subject, even if he or she has no prior knowledge of it. Bear in mind also that the course is somewhat unstructured, so students who prefer a more strictly-defined courseload may find it disconcerting. Professor Sanneh is fantastically knowledgeable, very relatable, and a pleasure to discuss issues with."
