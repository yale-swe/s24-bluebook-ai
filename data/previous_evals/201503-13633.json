   "comments": [
    "Coordination theory is super interesting and permeates almost every area of life. This is a really fun way to get the rational theory requirement of EP&E out of the way, particularly since there are so few class options under this heading. In important point to note is that Prof Sabl manages seminars so that they actually do what they say on the tin. The time you have in seminar flies by because you are not just listening to the professor lecture at you for ages. Instead, you are actually engaging with your peers, and learning from the texts by asking your peers questions and trying out arguments you could later put in your term paper to check their logical coherence. Definitely take this class.",
    "Amazing readings, and very well curated class. We had guests from the law school and marine core on separate occasions, which really added to the class. Some of the readings were truly mind-blowing.",
    "Excellent",
    "The content of this course is very interesting. You gain a framework that will influence how you think about government and society for the rest of your time at Yale. Guest speakers were well chosen. Professor Sabl could perhaps improve the administrative aspects of the course. Sections sometimes felt unstructured and devolved into debates about contemporary politics that weren't really relevant to readings. Readings could be more carefully curated to emphasize what is really important and interesting. Readings were sometimes far too technical. The course would be improved if section questions were given to students in advance and students were accountable for answering them with reference to the text. Despite these areas that need improvement, I enjoyed the course and felt that the subject matter was important.",
    "Highly recommend this class. It was one of my favorite classes at Yale and though it may be clich it really did change the way I view the world."
