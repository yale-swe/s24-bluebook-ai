    "Knowledge of Multivariable Calculus, including triple integral, line integral, Stokes' Theorem, Divergence Theorem and so on.",
    "Multivariable calculus: line integrals, multiple integration, partial derivatives, vector notation, cross\/dot product, surface integrals, 3d geometry",
    "This course was extremely challenging for me, so the main thing I learned from it was how to persevere and start with what I did know how to do. It also helped me to learn how to seek out help through the many resources offered at Yale. I learned a great deal of calculus, as well.",
    "Got better at visualizing 3 dimensions. Learned to manipulate 3 variables in 3 dimensions at the same time with many theorems. Very fulfilling course.",
    "This class allowed me to practice math and better picture spaces in 3D.",
    "I expanded my mathematics knowledge by learning how to deal with functions and situations of objects in higher-dimensions.",
    "The main skill I developed was an understanding of functions in 3-space, including gradients and tangent planes, and to ability to integrate 3-dimensional functions and vector fields on 2d planes and lines as well as 3d surfaces and volumes.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is a great course.",
    "Class is a good mix of theory and examples, but examples got dragged down by professor getting caught up in discussions with students or making a mistake with the math so that we had to rework the problems.",
    "I'm very thankful this course is taught in small sections, so we can ask questions when we don't understand what is happening. There are also many resources offered to help struggling students. Homework is graded fairly and always has enough feedback on it for me to understand why I got something wrong and how I should do it in the future. We also always received it in a timely manner. The homework provides useful practice and application of the topics we go over in class. I had a professor, not a grad student teaching me, which I was happy about. I heard from many other people that they wished they had a professor and not a grad student, though.",
    "After understanding all the material, I feel that getting to this point would have been much easier if your professor or TA was good at explaining concepts clearly. I think there should be an attempt to standardize the way some of the topics are taught more in an attempt to make the class more consistent across all the different sections.",
    "I think weekly quizzes instead of problem sets would avoid the cramming that was sometimes necessary and counter productive for midterms.",
    "The main strength of this course is that the subject matter is extremely interesting, and in hind-sight, the content was all very inter-connected and makes sense. The main weakness was that there was no overview given of the course; in other words, students were unable to totally grasp how the material being taught sequentially was related, and only once all the content was taught did it finally make sense that, for example, \"Oh, limits and double\/ triple integrals, etc are all methods of actually representing area and volume, etc. in greater dimensions, and ways to come up with these representations are gleaned through the various theorems...\" It was very hard to make connections between the matter.",
    "I think the course might be improved if there were a better textbook available. The Stewart book can be very frustrating because it does not approach concepts the same way we do in class (at least in my section) and often explains things rather poorly in comparison to sine explanations that can be found even online.",
    "Strengths were how much we had to learn and how rigorous class was. Weakness was the disjointed teaching between sections.",
    "Strengths: Forces you to learn Multivariable calculus. Weaknesses: Some parts of the curriculum essential for doing well on tests and homeworks were barely emphasized during lecture and were left as jigsaw puzzles to solve. For people not mathematically inclined, just having the bare minimum of a hint really held us back for tests. I dont believe they approached nor taught the 'extended' versions of the course well (extensions of theorems which aren't found in the textbook).",
    "It is very clear what we need to know and what we will be evaluated on",
    "The course covers multivariable concepts well enough, though not as deeply as I would like (encouraging memorization rather than true understanding through understanding proofs). Also, the course starts off very slowly, with concepts like vectors and the definition of limits--concepts that were already extensively covered in lower-level math courses. If the course did not review these basic concepts from precalculus and MATH 115, the course could have devoted more time to the concepts that students really struggle with.",
    "The biggest weakness of this course is that some instructors teach the materials far better than the others, leading to an uneven distribution of grades across sections."

   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course to students who are interested in mathematics. I don't see why multivariable calculus will be helpful to a political science major for example, but professor Rosenthal might be able to convince you how amazing math actually is.",
    "I would recommend this class to people who are interested in taking upper-level math. Most of the people in this class are STEM majors, although I am a social sciences person. As many people told me before I started this class, a lot of the people taking it have already taken multi-variable calc. This was my first time, so that was difficult. Sometimes, I felt like the class required me to know a lot of math skills (like pre-calc concepts) that I hadn't done in a long time, and had to go back and learn. It was challenging, but every time I managed to understand a concept, I felt a great deal of accomplishment.",
    "If you really like math, then yes I would recommend taking it anticipating having to put in a lot of work understanding the concepts. However, I feel that these concepts can be carried over to other areas in math and physics, so it is more fulfilling.",
    "It is a very hard and work intensive course but Professor Rosenthal was especially helpful in office hours.",
    "Yes, because it is necessary and applicable information, but I think at times it is unnecessarily tricky. I was annoyed by the fact that the aspects of multivariable calculus I find particularly useful (i.e. Lagrangians in economics) are not even present in the course, while much of the focus is needlessly placed on some of the toughest sections without any obvious applications (i.e. surface integrals).",
    "I'd recommend the course to another student because of how interesting and, frankly, cool the math is in multivariable. However, I'd really recommend daily practice of the subject and\/ or extra reading just to understand how everything relates, and one isn't as lost as I was come the second midterm.",
    "I would recommend to another student that they take this course in the spring term. I was not able to take multivariable calculus in high school and was very frustrated to find that many other students, at least in my section, said that they had. Because of this I was often lagging behind a large portion of the class who had already learned at least some of the topics we covered this term.",
    "If you have to take Math 120, do it. It's a cool class, but is undeniably difficult and takes a lot of time and effort.",
    "FOr an Engineering student I would recommend the ENAS equivalent of this course. You'll learn more direct applications to engineering and won't have to deal with some of the pedantic sections of the course. If you're set on taking 120 take it with Miki, and make sure you go to some of her review sessions.",
    "Yes, very interesting course.",
    "Yes, you learn efficiently and it is useful",
    "I would not recommend this course. Take ENAS 151. Homework takes up a gross amount of time and yet is only worth 10% of the grade. That is ridiculous. If you mess up one midterm, it's basically over for your grade. This class does not test your ability to actually do math, but your ability to memorize the formulas, which is not a learning-friendly environment. The fact that even the syllabus says they won't round up a 92.9 shows the class cares more about making kids worry about their grades rather than actually learning the material. If you take it with Rosenthal: he is a nice guy (sometimes obliviously crude) but his teaching is confusing and that makes lecture incredibly unhelpful. His office hours are good, but that's it. I know several people who tried to switch out of his lecture\/immediately dropped his section after day one when he started ranting about computers. Even I ditched to go find another teacher but the section I went to was even worse so I decided to stay in his class. Moral of the story: don't take this course if you can avoid it\/take ENAS 151",
    "Do your due diligence with notes, problems sets, and practice problems, and you should come out fine.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to. So the only thing you can do is to get into a good instructor's section."
