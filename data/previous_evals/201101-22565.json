   "comments": [
    "Excellent for anyone wanting to learn more about how a micro-processor works at the very basic level.",
    "TAKE ITGreat intro class. You basically build a processor from the gate-level on up. It provided a lot of really cool insights into programming and computers for me, even though I'm technologically inept. I might have majored in EENG if I'd taken it earlier.I took this as a senior so it seemed relatively easy, the key is to make sure you work through the labs well before they are due.Makris is the most clear and patient teacher you will have at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a student because it is very interesting subject matter yet not a lot of work given that the homework is optional. The only thing that is a lot of work is the labs, but if one does them reasonably ahead of time to protect against any problems, one will be fine. A great class.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone interested in computer hardware. The labs require time, but if you are interested in processors, this class is perfect for you.",
    "A great course with a truly great professor. This course basically teaches you how a computer processor works by covering the basic logic and architecture of memory and cpu combined with the basic boolean algebra employed to design the necessary circuits in each unit. It is not a detailed investigation of the workings of a microprocessor so it is not boring or excessively elaborate. Professor Makris who I heard might not continue teaching at Yale next term was great helpful and also generous in grading. Still though if this course continues to be offered it is an interesting introduction to the EE major so if you're considering the major at least shop it or take it. The lab is a bit frustrating but the satisfaction that comes afterwards makes it worth it. The TA's unlike many other courses are actually very helpful and know the work very well.",
    "Any student even remotely interested in computers will be blown away by this class.",
    "I'm an American Studies major with no background in engineering and this was the first QR I took at Yale. I had a lot of fun with it\u0097it really did start with the basics and there was no preassumed knowledge, though you might have trouble with some of the logic or boolean algebra if you're severely quantitatively uninclined. There is a lab component to the course, and you may end up spending a lot of time on it; the instructions are pretty clear but a tiny mistake can break the whole thing since the software is finicky. Also you will have to go to the lab in the basement of Bechdel to do the work. But Prof. Makris and the TAs were great, and the material was interesting and satisfying. Very worthwhile, especially for someone who needs the QR credit!",
    "Covers a lot of the same ground as CS201 but more in depth. You will never forget how adders and flip-flops work again.",
    "This was a good class - you get to learn some basic \"computer architecture\", which i thought was quite interesting. Yeah, lectures did become a bit tedious, and the laboratory software lived up to its reputation as the buggiest program you will ever meet. But the labs are not hard, and were quite fun - the last lab is very comprehensive and especially rewarding. Exams are straightforward: the class prepares you well for them. I came out of this class with a much better understanding of how computers compute and it was definitely worth taking the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to take an interesting course. Not only will you learn about the hardware behind computer processors, you'll actually get the chance to implement your own basic processor on a circuit board. Although working with the software to draw circuit diagrams is admittedly frustrating sometimes, it's all worth it when you manage to make your own processor (also, the ta's were always very helpful). Besides the lab, the course wasn't too tough in terms of workload, although you will need to understand the material to do well on the exams. Overall, EE201 is a really fun course (although unfortunately Professor Makris won't be here to teach it).",
    "If Yiorgos were still teaching it, I would definitely recommend it. However, I have no idea if this course will be offered in the future.",
    "Fantastic course. The best I have taken here. Professor Makris is a gem, and it is a real shame that he was denied tenure. He made a very large amount of complex material accessible to students of all backgrounds, and he is one of the most compassionate individuals whom I have ever met. He truly cares for his students and his job, and his departure will be a real loss for Yale.For those considering the field of Computer Engineering, start here, then take EE 348 and EE 425.For those considering Electrical Engineering, do not, DO NOT, start with EE 200 in the fall of your freshman year. It is a real doozie (weed out, if you ask me) of a course that will make your head hurt and may even discourage you from pursuing the degree.",
    "This was an amazing class. It was a lot of fun and very informative; if you've ever wondered how computers really work (this applies to CompSci people who have only ever programmed in high-level languages too!), this class is definitely for you. It requires some good logical thinking but it's not too hard. Highly recommended.",
    "EE201 is a good introduction to the fundamentals of computer engineering. I would definitely recommend it for those considering either a major in Electrical Engineering or Computer Science.",
    "EE201 was my favorite course of the semester and one that I would definitely recommend. The course material is interesting to anyone interested in how computers work, and there is not much work at all. Yiorgos isvery lenient with grading, and overall, it was just a great course."
