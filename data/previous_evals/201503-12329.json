    "Semantics is without a doubt the best course choice I have made so far in my time at Yale. I took it as what was intended to be a gut QR, and was almost frightened away by Professor Deo's insistence that the course wasn't a gut during the first lecture. She was right - it isn't. What is it, then? A fascinating, endlessly varied, incredibly entertaining, thought-provoking and mind-opening exploration of an often overlooked field. This course singlehandedly made me, a diehard humanities person, into a linguistics major. If you have even the slightest interest in language, please take this course. The workload was incredibly manageable: only one 2-4 hour pset a week (attend section and it will be a breeze!). It is not math-intensive at all, which some will find to be a huge relief. Although some if it was a little rote, I found something thought-provoking in every week's assignment. I literally cannot recommend this course highly enough. I recommend it to every single one of my friends, regardless of major. If you need a QR or a social science or just have a gap in your schedule to fill, take this course. Take it if you don't meet any of those criteria! Just do yourself a favour, and take Semantics.",
    "Take it if you like puzzles and language. The course will get you to think rigorously and analytically about how meaning is built up out of the component parts of a sentence, which is a fascinating project. There are weekly psets, which can take quite a long time, but the material is for the most part stimulating and gives you some of the tools needed to think about language in a truly logical way.",
    "This course shows you how to look at the meanings of simple sentences as logic equations with individuals, sets, and truth values. There are weekly problem sets, which are super fine if you go to section, a midterm, and a take home final. One thing that caught me off guard was that the take home final was only over 3 days from the monday of reading week to the first day of exams. I don't think these dates were mentioned in the syllabus, although I wish they had been. The psets make for a solid amount of weekly work. I found the lecture to be a bit boring and hard to sit through. I would say, go to the first lecture or two and imagine sitting through it for 75 minutes twice a week. If that seems unpleasant, probably don't take the class. If the material excites you a lot, go for it.",
    "Semantics is a very interesting subject, but if you have experience with formal logic, beware that this class will feel very, very slow. Once it picks up about halfway through the semester, the topics are great, and you will consider problems in natural language that will definitely make you scratch your head.",
    "Ashwini says it best on the first day: if you are interested in an easy QR, this is not the class for you. On the other hand, if you are interested in linguistic puzzles and the tools semanticists use to address them, then you will certainly get something out of this course. The first half of the course is slow-going, especially if you are already familiar with logic and set theory, but the second half, in which puzzles abound, is totally captivating. One thing to look out for: the expectations on the homework were not always as clearly spelled out as one would have liked, so if you have any doubts whatsoever about the directions, ask!",
    "A great introduction to semantics. The kinds of formal reasoning involved in understanding semantics are extremely interested for someone who enjoys mathy topics as well as natural languages. Semantics is often about how different people interpret the meanings of sentences, so there will be times when your understanding of a particular word or sentence differs from that of the rest of the class. Not an easy QR credit for sure, but a very interesting and valuable one if its a topic you're interested in already.",
    "Semantics was an excellent course that built upon concepts covered in previous linguistics\/logic courses. It covered set theory, type theory, and lambda calculus. I would recommend this course to any student interested in logic, linguistics, or philosophy of language."
