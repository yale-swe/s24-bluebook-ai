   "comments": [
    "Wow. Where to begin. I went from not knowing the Greek alphabet to finishing Plato's Apology. I think there's enough said with that. Prof. Robinson made me look at language in a different way and genuinely made me start thinking in a more philologic way than I ever have before. He not only taught the mechanisms of the language, but he also taught me how to think about language and its creation.",
    "First of all, I gained a proficiency in Ancient Greek that I did not think possible in 13 weeks. Alongside of that though, I gained new insights in both how to look at a language and study and learn it, through decomposing words into their basic parts, and tracing their historical development.",
    "Greek vocabulary, basic grammar",
    "Besides learning all about Greek grammar and how to read Plato's apology, I learned more about how to study efficiently and how to manage a difficult workload. The experience was immersive to be sure, and I never would have imagined I could learn so much in a single semester."

   "comments": [
    "This class is so strong. Professor Robinson has clearly done this class enough to know how to properly pace it and how to adapt to the needs of the students.",
    "This course is absolutely INCREDIBLE. It's strength lies in how it forces you to really engage with the subject matter, and at the end of the day, internalizing a good chunk of it. Also Professor Robinson is an incredible Greek teacher, and has insights into both the language and how to teach it that are remarkably helpful.",
    "Strengths: fast pace, wonderful teaching,",
    "The course meets every day for 2 hours, these high contact hours provide regular practice and sustained learning.",
    "This course's strength lies in its organization, logical progression, and clear expectations. These assets coupled with interesting material and the prospect of reading Plato made for a motivated and exciting learning experience. The only thing I might have changed is the review during the reading week. I think a more directed grammar review would have been helpful for me."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this course! That being said, only take the course if you are REALLY into it and you have the time to commit. Professor Robinson is very nice and very accommodating, but you will get out of the class what you put into it. This is a must take class if you are genuinely excited about learning the language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has any interest whatsoever in studying an ancient language or learning Greek specifically. It's an absolutely fabulous introduction to Greek, and you really come out with the skills needed to approach most Attic texts.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course. If you apply yourself to it, the rewards are enormous. And it is excellently taught.",
    "Yes, but they should take at most 2 other courses.",
    "If you want to learn Greek, this is a wonderful course for you! If you don't enjoy learning languages, though, it might be a nightmare."
