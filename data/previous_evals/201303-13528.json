    "Question 8: He is not really clear at all... His focus for lectures is to give foundational knowledge and then talk about questions that still exist in the field. Inherently this will leave lectures covering confusing conceptual material.Question 10: Graeme is unbelievably knowledgable! but he is dull and slow and confusing. but his knowledge is irreplaceable!Question 12: This course is very valuable! Graeme gets students thinking about the whole physiological picture of trees from birth to death. All MFs should take at least one course with him!",
    "Question 1- on course materials, the syllabus mentions a HUGE number of readings and texts, which if all utilized and read would make this course a tremendous workload. Most of the concepts could be learned from the \"Raven\" textbook in addition to class summaries, maybe the others would be better listed as recommended readings or supplemental instead of becoming overwhelming. (and expensive)",

Also, the information taught in class was often difficult to follow and not explained very clearly.In addition, the course could have been improved by having more time in the field or in the lab in order to solidify the material we learned in class and in the textbook. It would have been great to visit the Marsh Gardens to examine different concepts. Also, more time in the lab looking at the structure of different wood would have been very interesting.",
