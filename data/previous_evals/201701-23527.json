    "This course should be part fo the compulsory coursework. There is something for everyone, be it a practitioner in the field of energy, water, wildlife conservation. The readings are extremely important for anyone who wishes to understand the political and social history of how and why we do things the way we do. Many of us do our jobs without fully understanding the history and its implications. I recommend this course strongly!",
    "This course has some great readings, but ultimately they are too numerous and time-consuming. These are not the kind of readings one can skim either. I would suggest Professor Carpenter cut down the readings a bit. If some weeks can suffice with two readings, I would just assign two readings. For weeks with three readings, I would suggest Professor Carpenter assign specific page ranges. This would be done with the understanding that students are expected to work on their term papers. Perhaps reduce the weekly readings, but let the students know that the term papers will be held to a higher standard. (I also think the course would benefit from having specific benchmarks\/check-in points for the term papers, so the professor can ensure that the students are making progress). The problem currently is that the weekly readings would be appropriate if they were the only thing students were expected to do. But they are not. There is also a term paper. One can barely keep up with the weekly readings, let alone write a term paper on the side. The result of overloading the students is that discussions suffer (b\/c students don't thoroughly do the readings) and the term papers are whipped off and of poorer quality."

    "The readings. Carol's dissecting of those readings.",
    "The readings and Carol's reflections",
    "The readings were fabulous for this course! They stimulated so much new thinking, and each week's compilation complemented one another well. I also thought the structure of the course as a whole was great, each week built on prior weeks in interesting ways. While the end of term paper was long, I really appreciated the opportunity to dig into a topic of interest. I had fun writing it!",
    "The readings are why you should take the course (get a copy of the syllabus and look at the readings beforehand!). Professor Carpenter is also very supportive, so if you want that type of learning environment, this is a good course to take. It's also nice to have the time to pursue a research topic in-depth. Readings that I particularly enjoyed: Foucault Li Polanyi Gidwani Ferguson (Bovine-Mystique) Kopytoff Ferguson (de-moralizing economies...this was perhaps one of the most insightful readings of the course) Harvey Vail Readings I did not particularly enjoy: Ferguson (Copperbelt) Williams (Country and City) The \"Commons Debate\" week Watts The \"Globalization and Scale\" week",
    "Making students think in a different way as the \"mainstream\" courses of the MEM.",
    "The readings were very thought provoking and I appreciate how they broadened my perspective on the topics we covered. The weekly assignments were time consuming and varied based on how difficult the readings were, but definitely facilitated better class discussions because we were required to do the readings before every class. These discussions definitely helped increase my understanding of the readings.",
    "I appreciated the pragmatic approach to anthropological aspects of the current economic model and their impact on environmental programs and consumption patterns. It is not a class that just stays on theoretic concepts. The class helped me to settle many ideas and how to use them to position myself in the work I do. I also appreciated that the content and class discussions do not necessarily lead to pessimistic perception and inaction but it rather describes how things have been, discovers roots and drivers and different conceptual frameworks that can be used. I enjoyed the way the class brings up students' experiences and different perspectives."

    "At times Carol gets a bit off topic and rambles, but all in all it's part of her charm and I didn't mind.",
    "Professor Carpenter covers the major themes of the readings for each week. This is a great service that few other classes at FES will provide. That being said, they can sometimes be very long and limit the amount of time that students have to discuss the readings on their own. Half way through the semester, Professor Carpenter accepted student feedback and shortened her discussion of the readings to allow more time for students to discuss the readings. I think this worked out better and I appreciate Professor Carpenter's willingness to try it. I would also note that Professor Carpenter can often get off on tangents. This can sometimes be frustrating and eat up valuable time."

    "This course really helped me fit economics into the social and political processes of conservation.",
    "This course was an excellent complement to the perspectives of other courses I've taken at FES. In addition to shedding an anthropological light on the environmental field this course helped me to take a step back and think about how the world we live in today came to be. Specifically, I'm referring to the rise of capitalism, increasing global connections, the relationship of the developed and developing worlds, etc. I believe, especially after taking this course, that without an understanding of these trends over time that it's hard to understand the present for what it is and therefore difficult to think about how to shift the future.",
    "I am highly interested in the intersection of economic systems (capitalism, socialism, communism), wealth\/income inequality, and environmentalism. I think this is a great course for people who want to think about commodities, consumerism, and critiques of capitalism. This class pushes back against so much of today's environmental thinking that views economics and technological advances as being the solutions to our environmental problems. This class problematizes some of that thinking. If you believe that capitalism and endless economic growth and environmental concerns are all intertwined, then you may want to consider taking this course...",
    "I plan on working with native communities in Peru when I graduate. A different approach to the \"Development\" conversation is very useful.",
    "It does not necessarily fit into my academic focus; however, I believe it was a very valuable course to take at F&ES. Definitely one of the classes I learned a lot from and gained new, more critical perspectives from.",
    "As a Master of Forestry student it was a little of a stretch for me to take this course because the work load is heavy and took some time I should have invested in silviculture. But I am really happy I took this course because I believe it is highly important to always be aware of how forestry fits in the broader economic and cultural context. Besides, many forestry and environmental programs such as the REDD+ mentioned in class come from specific frameworks and mindsets that need to be understood to fully visualize their impact."

Readings in some classes at FES are assigned with the expectation that students will skim. This is not the case for Carol's class. In general the readings each week took me five hours or so. They are dense and theoretical, and require extensive time to understand. If you don't carefully read them you will likely struggle to follow and participate in class discussions.",
    "If you take this course, I would make sure you have the time to commit to it. It requires more time than most courses at FES. Also, I would pay close attention to who else is taking the course. This is a discussion-based class, so making sure that the other students are good, thoughtful, and engaged students is critical. The class succeeds or fails based on the students in the room.",
