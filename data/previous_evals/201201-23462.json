   "comments": [
    "Nice overview of a lot of the relevant topics. As a physics major, I found the problem sets to be fairly trivial, but still do feel that I got something out of the class. Several cool field trip opportunities over the course of the semester as well.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The material is technical, which is a welcome break if all the energy you've studied at Yale has been soft. The difficulty will vary greatly based on your technical background. Poli Sci>> Econ>> Engineering, and likewise, Sophomore>> Senior. As a senior engineering major, I found the class pretty easy, but I still got a lot out of the material conceptually.",
    "It is an awesome survey course that goes into rather intense detail, but the details helped me to better understand renewable energy and use it in other discussions. Take it if you are willing to get into the math, chemistry, and physics of renewable energy.",
    "This was the first year this class was taught - and boy, were we a fine set of guinea pigs. This course was all over the place. I had imagined that we would learn the basics of how each technology worked, and then spend the majority of our time comparing their merits and learning about future applications of these technologies in the US, etc. Instead we spent what I thought was an inordinate amount of time re-learning basic chemistry and physics concepts, while simultaneously being expected to know aspects of advanced thermodynamics and electrical engineering. The \"pre-requisites\" for thiscourse were supposed to be a basic high school science background, but my basic background seemed woefully inadequate. Some of my engineering major friends informed me that we were dealing with topics that they hadn't learned until they began taking advanced courses. Although we got a broad overview of every kind of renewable energy in existence today, I leave this course knowing little more than that these technologies exist. Maybe this course would be good for new Environmental Science majors. Everybody else - stay away!That being said, I think Ron Smith is an amazing teacher. His sections of the course were clearly communicated and easy to understand. I don't think this class should have been team taught - Professor Schwartz knew his material, but was nowhere near as good a teacher as Ron Smith. I frequently left Schwartz's lectures baffled and unsatisfied.",
    "I learned a great deal about renewable energy technologies in this course, and I think the broad range of technologies we covered was great. My one caution, however, is that while the course suggested a basic understanding of physics, students were expected to have an understanding of thermodynamics and electricity that a number of people struggled with. Since this was the first year the course was taught, this will probably be made more explicit in future years.",
    "I would not recommend this class. The lectures are incredibly boring and the focus of the class is more on nitty-gritty scientific facts and less about the policy and adoption of renewable energy technologies.",
    "Terrible the first time it was taught. Hopefully it will get better, but be warned. LOTS OF PHYSICS.",
    "It's very useful for anyone interested in studying Renewable energies, but the kinks have to be worked out firs.",
    "I really feel that I have a greater understanding of the essentials of renewable energy: the problems facing developers and policy makers, the capabilities we have, and some technology that I hadn't seen before. The class covers each major renewable in pretty good detail; the number of energy solutions available make it difficult to cover everything however.",
    "Worst class I've taken at Yale. It's too bad, the subject has the potential to make an awesome class. Be prepared for heavy physics.",
    "Interesting material and poor lectures with exams that had little to do with the lectures make for a disappointing experience.",
    "Take this class ONLY if they change the syllabus to reduce the amount of thermodynamics, electricity, and magnetism that is part of the class OR if you have a good background in those topics. Otherwise, you will struggle. I would be wary of taking it if Professor Schwartz is co-teaching it again--his lectures are not very clear if you don't have an extensive physics background.Otherwise, though, the course is great. Ron Smith is a great teacher, and the renewable energy topics he discusses are relatively easy to grasp, and its very interesting to get at least a basic sense of the science behind these technologies. Also there are cool field trips to a hydropower facility and to the Yale power plant.",
    "absolutely terrible. do not ever take this class. never ever.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It was unfair, frustrating and hard. Physics was not a pre-req, but we were required to understand thermodynamics, circuits and magnetism. I loved learning about hydro and wind and going to the hydro plant. But, when Larry Schwartz taught geothermal and solar, it was too mathematical and physics-driven. His slides covered way too much material and it was too advanced for a 200 level class. He was also frustrating to approach and made me feel dumb when I didn't understand physics topics I had never learned before. If this class focused more on two or three renewable energies instead of trying to cover way too many in not enough time, it might be more successful. i felt at the end, the material was rushed. also, the final only tested us on PHYSICS. i could have taken the final and done just as poorly if i had never studied or went to class. barely any questions on the separate renewable energies!! do not take this class unless you know physics and are not frustrated by a harsh professor.",
    "Yes, however, I would caution them to shop it without any preconceptions and check the syllabus. If they do not change the scope of the class or make it more directly geared toward a specific audience, there may be better G&G classes to take. If they do clear up the purpose of the class, I think it will be an awesome class!! It already was, it was just a little confusing at times for those of us with little knowledge of electricity and magnetism. I think it should either be taught with less of that - or at least teach it better - or be taught with a physics pre-req.",
    "This course is a very good survey of renewable energy technologies. The difficulty of the exams makes this a challenging course.",
    "I enjoyed this engaging introduction to renewable energy technologies. Lectures were clear, subjects were well chosen, and efforts were made to trace out the wider implications of each technology. The problem sets were sometimes overly tricky - covering material we hadn't in class, and the midterm was a complete surprise in its format. These could have been cleared up. Also, I would have liked to see more scientific analysis of possible policy proposals too. But overall, well worth the credit.",
    "Take it only if you are comfortable with physics.",
    "You definitely need some background in college physics for some pparts of the class but otherwise the workload isnt bad at all with one pset each week",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this class as a good overview of all the major renewable energy technologies (hydro, wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, tidal\/ocean, etc.). Note before taking this class (though it will likely change in the future) that it is not a descriptive course about renewable energy policy, but a class that focuses on the physics of each technology while only touching on policy issues. If you don't have a good physics or math background, this course could be difficult.I had some experience coming in, and now I\u0092m leaving the class with a good sense of how each technology works and what its potential is for the future. I thought the class had a hard time finding the right balance and direction during the first few weeks, but I found it to be much more interesting and organized after spring break. The field trips were a welcome addition and actually did add to my understanding of the class, especially the field trip to the Yale power plant.Problem sets were not too long but sometimes had unclear questions, and were a good approximation of the difficulty of the midterm and final. Both professors and the TAs were helpful and responsive. Professor Smith is excellent (definitely deserving of his recent teaching award!). He's friendly, knowledgable, and approachable. Professor Schwartz was not as informative or clear at the beginning of the semester, but he found his voice by the end and will definitely improve in the future.",
    "This semester was the first semester and it's likely that they're going to alter the course. I think it's interesting and valuable as it is for people with only a little background in science, but for people with no background and for people with a lot of background it's a little dull. All the same, talk to the professors if you're interested about the syllabus.",
    "This is a good class. Not difficult if you have any science background. Problem sets are quite short and doable and the material is interesting.",
    "DEFINITELY",
    "Renewable Energy is a class that surveys the main sources of renewable energy. Given the prerequisite of high school physics, I do not think that the course should have focused such a large portion of its class on physics and thermodynamics. At the beginning of the course, I was very confused with the problem sets and had to teach myself physics to complete the problem sets. There should not be a wide knowledge gap between what is tested in problem sets and what is taught in class. I would not recommend this class to another student who has not takin chemistry or physics at Yale."
