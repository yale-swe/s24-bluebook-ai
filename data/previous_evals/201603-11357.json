   "comments": [
    "Historical perspectives, musical ideas, politics and more were covered in this very comprehensive course.",
    "Definitely learned how to listen to music and hear different elements of it, and also how to hear the history in the music. Amazing.",
    "I gained the new ability to both listen and analyze music formally and connect this formal analysis to the social context and specific conditions of its creation. This class is both very informative about the history and politics of many areas of Subsaharan African and clearly shows the connection between social life and the music. It also introduced me to incredible new areas of awesome music to listen to.",
    "I learned a tremendous amount about modern and traditional musics from all over Africa. This course improves your understanding, discourse and ability to listen to any music that has been influenced by music of the African Diaspora (so almost all modern music).",
    "Fantastic course that looks in depth at music from Western Africa and South Africa (it cannot of course cover all of Sub-Saharan Africa; perhaps the title should reflect this?). If you are new to music you gain listening skills and introduction to ethnomusicological practices. You are exposed to incredible music and learn a fair amount about the cultures and societies they come from.",
    "I learned how to better listen to music as well as how different histories impacted the different sounds of music in Sub-Saharan Africa. I was exposed to the different kinds of music in different regions and how the music and their artists played a role in the development of the culture and vice versa.",
    "I developed immense insight into the connections between music and politics. Through listening, writing, and reading, I learned how to link my thoughts coherently.",
    "From this course I gained a broad knowledge of social issues, musical genres and nuances, and the way that these concepts interact in West and South Africa. I also learned about how religion, tradition, and contact with other societies can drastically influence the music of a place long-term. Finally, through the final paper I learned all about the history of the banjo in American folk music according to its African roots."

   "comments": [
    "I thought this class was amazing. It was both socially and musically incredibly interesting, and the themes we talked about really connected across different subject matter over the entirety of the semester. Professor Veal is very knowledgable and did a good job sharing his knowledge with us while encouraging participation and discussion.",
    "Wouldn't change anything!",
    "Great course, conversation between students was low and I think the course could have improved from increased dialogue. This was not the professor's fault, however, he tried his best to get us to talk we were all just too nervous.",
    "Overall really great and such an important part of the music department that is far to euro-centric. It is hard course to teach because it has to work for both experienced musicians and non-musicians. Veal handles that well and fosters great discussion even though it is supposed to be lecture based generally. I wish there could be more time for each thing, especially more detailed sociopolitical discussions in class for each place, but it is a hard balance between that and include a broader range of music.",
    "Overall an incredible course. It was as fun as it was intellectually stimulating. I found that classes that were more discussion heavy were the most fruitful and allowed the students to best practice the skills they were learning in the class. The material was interesting and rich, so I would have liked to have had more time to focus on each of the readings. I enjoyed the flexibility of the class but did wish for us to stick to the syllabus a bit more, at least in regards to exams and assignments.",
    "The strengths of this course are the small class size, emphasis on listening, and dynamic personality of Professor Veal. Every class was engaging. The occasional movies were welcome, too. The weaknesses of this class lie in organization; there was so much content to cove, and we couldn't get to all of it. In addition, there were extensive readings, and we rarely covered them in class. We had the opportunity to refer to the readings in the four unit quizzes and final paper, but they were rarely brought up in class.",
    "Though it was technically a lecture, I appreciated how we would often break into discussions. It seemed like a better way to critically engage with the music itself and the issues surrounding it. There was ample listening time, but I would have appreciated even more in-class listening. There were some issues with organization, where assignments would get pushed back or changed to take-home, and it was nice that there was flexibility, but maybe next time the syllabus should be adjusted to reduce the amount of change during the semester",
    "I thought the material discussed in this course was fascinating, but I felt that the structure of the class held it back. Oftentimes, I was hoping to discuss material with classmates, and listen to music in class while discussing the political and musical ideas it conveyed. However, I found the predominant style of the class to be a lecture in which I hardly got to know my fellow classmates. I think some of the use of the lecture may have been a factor of lack of preparation by the students (to be honest, there are many readings that I only half-finished, or skimmed), but I think that if there had been more friendly encouragement of class discussion, or even group discussion, that people would have prepared more for class. As it was, most of the information in the readings was provided by Professor Veal during the lectures. So I think that a more seminar-based structure of the class would have increased my engagement, and developed a more friendly and relaxed class environment."

   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend!",
    "Do it. There probably aren't many excellent interdisciplinary music\/history\/politics courses out there, particularly on Africa.",
    "Yes! Professor Veal is great and you will learn new things and new perspectives on this music and culture.",
    "This class is exciting and fun without lacking rigor. The assessments encourage active engagement with the material and not simple regurgitation, and since they are based around analysis of listening, the class does a really good job of connecting active listening of music to more theoretical ideas. This class offers an incredible listening list and a great historical primer. I would highly recommend if you love music.",
    "Yes absolutely do it!!! Prof Veal is phenomenal.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in studying music or in studying culture and power throughout the world.",
    "Most certainly - Veal's classes are some of the few in the music department that I reccomend to everyone. People need musical education but are often turned off by the classical heavy offerings in the department. This class brings a wide range of students through the doors of stoeckel that might never enter the building without it.",
    "Yes, I would, especially if they were interested in the intersectionality of history, music, and culture.",
    "Yes. It is a very unique course, probably the only one geared toward African music, and Professor Veal is truly a gem.",
    "I'd recommend this course for anyone with any interest at all in African Music. I came in liking a few artists and was exposed to a load of new artists who I now listen to regularly, and getting an understanding of the cultural background and political issues behind the music really does improve the listening experience. The readings were often dense, and I think for a lot of students only really engage with them while writing the papers. Professor Veal is an engaging lecturer and often makes it a full-class discussion",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because the material is fascinating and the use of music to analyze historical, political, and social change opened my eyes to the importance of a certain culture's music. The class also taught me how integrated the world music scene is, and how many modern musics are a conglomeration of other cultures' musics and traditions. However, I found the structure of the class very frustrating in that I hardly got to discuss ideas with fellow students at all. I found the professor unable to remove himself from the discussions and let the students talk and think about ideas. I also found him slightly intimidating which seemed to limit the amount of class participation and how relaxed the environment felt. Given a structural change I think this course could be one of the best!"
