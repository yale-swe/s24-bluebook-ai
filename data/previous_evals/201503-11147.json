    "This class is more for AFROTC cadets than for a typical Yale student, but anyone can take the class. The workload is definitely manageable and reasonable, and topics covered in the class are meaningful to those of us looking to learn about the Air Force in general.",
    "This class prepares you with relevant information to a career in the Air Force and educates you on what you will need to know in your career. It is directly applicable to real life."
