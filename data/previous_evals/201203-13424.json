   "comments": [
    "Absolutely - pick a topic you like and the readings\/essays are easy to get through.",
    "I would absolutely recommend shopping the course to find the instructor you get along with the best. The subject is important - but secondary - to this point.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking English 114 with Matt, he is fun to work with.",
    "It was a fun class. There were definitely many things I learned about writing and about digital media from the class. I would recommend it.",
    "I totally would if you are not that sure about your writing. Its a good place to begin your Yale english career because they move at a slow pace and work on teaching you everything more than expecting to much out of you in the beginning.",
    "Absolutely, but the section and professor are crucial.",
    "This section, Digital Cultures, was really interesting. Rager is a great teacher, very chill, and he picked some good readings and assignments. I highly recommend this section.",
    "I took Digital Cultures with no prior academic knowledge of the subject and it was great. No prior knowledge necessary and I learned a lot. There's a good amount of readings which you should definitely do, but it's manageable with other courses.",
    "A great english class if the topic of digital cultures sounds interesting to you. Professor Rager was engaging and entertaining and I would definitely recommend him as a Professor, as well as this class",
    "This is a good course that involved reading interesting works that pertain to digital media and reading on the internet. The works we read in this class were to learn concepts, not writing style and structuring. The conversations in class were interesting and overall, it was a fun and relaxed class. However, if you want to learn more about structure and grasp the basics of writing then this is not the class for you. It is a class to hone your arguments, thesis statements, and analysis, not for writing style or grammar.",
    "Mr. Rager is great but I wish the topic was less specific. I think I would have preferred something more broad and general and be able to run in many directions with paper topics."
