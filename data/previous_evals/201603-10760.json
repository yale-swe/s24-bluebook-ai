    "The range of Modern European Drama--both through reading the script and from viewing performances.",
    "As an English major, I was used to looking at literature through an analytical perspective, but because plays are written primarily to be performed, this opened up a new avenue for discussion and thought. The papers allowed me to approach the text in multiple ways, which helped me as a student, a director, and a performer by giving me new things to think about and implement.",
    "I had never taken a class that covered this period of European Drama before. These were some of my favorite dramatists, or the ones that I badly wanted to engage with on a deeper level, so this class gave me the opportunity to really understand a stunning body of work at a historical moment where their words and goals could not be more applicable.",
    "I came into this course reticent to read a lot of dead white men who've shaped theater history. I left pleasantly surprised: Professor Robinson moderates far-ranging discussions encompassing modern productions and interpretations of the works on the syllabus and engages issues of gender and race throughout. Spending two weeks with each author left me with a much deeper understanding of their oeuvres than the 110 and 111 survey courses produce. This class was supposed to be a burden, but ended up a surprising joy.",
    "Amazing class. Loved all the readings and the blog posts.",
    "Such an excellent reading list and a great professor"

   "comments": [
    "This was because of the people in my class, but the discussion often fell between two students, while some students didn't speak at all, even when they had interesting things to say on the class blog. The blog was a good way to hear these students' thoughts, though, which I appreciated. The once-per-week meeting time was conducive to the distribution of work, which was very fair and manageable. I liked reading about four plays per author and spending two weeks on each because it gave me a more well-rounded perspective of each playwright's work.",
    "This class has a fair amount of reading each week but the paper load is low and Robinson makes every class fascinating. It is a great integrator of different types of media in the classroom.",
    "Honestly I think this class is structured perfectly I wouldn't change a thing.",
    "Wonderful class.",
    "While I adored the professor and the material, the class itself was often taken over by several students who would often talk for the majority of the class, making it very hard to have a discussion.",
    "Fantastic overall, not an unmanageable workload and good discussions."

    "This was my favorite course this semester. Robinson is absolutely brilliant, and the plays we read are some of the best ever written, but still controversial enough to get some really good discussion going. As for structure, the course is split up by playwright: two weeks on Ibsen, two weeks on Shaw, two weeks on Beckett, etc etc. It stays chronological, with one or two exceptions, and we generally read 4 or 5 plays for each playwright. (Workload isn't bad either--there are two papers, each ten pages, and you can choose pretty much whatever you want to write about.) If you're prepared for some very involved conversation about the details of theatrical evolution and worth, this is the class for you. Even if not, you should consider it: the professor is at the top of his game (which here means the top of his field--I doubt there are many people more engaged with this sort of material than he is) and establishes a very high baseline for discussion. You will learn so much.",
    "Yes! If you're interested in Modern European Drama... fair warning the plays are a little strange.",
    "YES! This is a great introductory course to six of the most important playwrights of the past 150 years. Even if you are not a theater studies major (I am not), your literary experience will be enriched by this course. Often literature classes do not pay enough attention to great works of drama, of which this class has so many. The workload is very manageable: two plays per week (~4-5 hours or less), seven blog posts over the semester, two 10-page papers, and no final. Professor Robinson is great!",
    "This is a great class, but it is often overrun by theater studies majors who think they are Gods gift to seminar discussion, so beware. The plays are all fascinating to read, some you'll have read a hundred times and some you'll have never heard of. Robinson is a great facilitator of discussion and two ten page papers is a very manageable workload.",
    "This is a wonderful class for Theater Studies and English Majors alike. Marc is a treasure and he makes class feel more like a meeting for the creative team of a theater company than an academic pursuit. I left class inspired every week, often carrying on conversations from class well into the week. Take it even if you think you have no interest in these writers, everyone needs them in their lives.",
    "Yes! The assigned plays are must-reads and Professor Robinson leads fabulous discussions in class.",
    "Absolutely. The material was wonderful and important. Classes were conducive to open conversation. You will leave this course with an excellent understanding of modern European drama.",
    "Yes! You will gain a substantial working knowledge of major authors who have shaped the course of modern dramaturgy, and you'll enjoy it in the process. There's no one better than Professor Robinson to learn from in this department.",
    "Amazing class! Marc is an incredible instructor and the readings and discussions were always informative and interesting.",
    "If you like learning about the philosophy behind theater and the history of theater, absolutely, but if you're interests are more practical, you'll probably be frustrated. Professor Robinson is fascinating though.",
    "Absolutely"
