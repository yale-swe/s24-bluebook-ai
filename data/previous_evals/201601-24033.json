    "In regard to the homework assignments, they were often assigned just a couple of days before they were doing (usually reading assignments) and it was difficult to get them done in that timeframe, considering the myriad other commitments students have. A syllabus with all the readings for the semester would have been a good baseline, and changes could have easily been made if necessary throughout the semester. This practice did improve as the semester went on, but is worth noting.",
    "The course was extremely valuable as a professional interested in engaging with different stakeholders, as well as an academic interested in better understanding network theories. The professor put so much time and energy into lectures, readings, and project support that the course was incredibly valuable and one of the most enlightening I've ever taken."

I very much liked the class structure: lecture, time for discussion - definitely a class where you learn a lot from your peers! (given that I was not involved in specific client project work I cant speak to the client projects) ONE OF THE (next to industrial ecology) ONLY CLASSES AT YALE FES I EXPERIENCED THAT IS TRULY INTERDISCIPLINARY. WE SHOULD HAVE MORE CLASSES LIKE THIS AT FES!!! (TA's did a great job)",
    "Paul was the best aspect of this course - his passion for the subject is contagious! He is super knowledgeable and really cares about student learning",
    "The critical thinking about communications strategies was enlightening and well worth it.",
    "The best aspects included lectures, which informed our projects and had immediate relevance to real world projects. The client projects built upon the theoretical knowledge in class, and I learned a lot more than I thought from listening to other groups' project work. I also liked having a 3-hr session because we could get into deeper discussion.",

Paul does an incredible good job in introducing and guiding us to new cutting edge approaches to science communication. He facilitates session in a very engaged and motivating way. If you need more support in pushing this forward on this front I am happy to help! THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!!",
    "Professor Lussier is obviously very smart and very talented, but a bit more organization would have been helpful for this course.",
    "The only point I would note (which is to an extent, outside the professor and TA's control) is that if we were able to attract more students, the discussions would be richer and there would be a greater number of projects with more hands per project. Perhaps advertising the class as a clinic course (or just taking it for 1 credit) could help attract the attendance the course deserves.",
