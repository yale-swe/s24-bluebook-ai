    "It's a shame that more students from other departments don't enroll. If I'm not mistaken, a reading knowledge of Russia is not strictly required? Anyhow, yes, I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the course. It will give a great overview and important information about one of the most artistically dynamic and historically significant periods in Russian history.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in this particular moment of Soviet history. The choice of literary texts and films was spot on.",
    "Solid overview of early Soviet literature and film. Not very theoretical, but historically very useful, and we read some *wonderful* texts."

   "comments": [
    "This question kind of answers itself. It contributed to my research by deepening my knowledge of the discipline? I have read most of the texts that we're 'required' to know before I took the course, so I appreciated reading lesser-known works. If I had not been in that position (which is to say, if I hadn't focused on the 20s and 30s in undergrad), it would have been a little frustrating.",
    "Gave me a great deal more background knowledge of history which will help me situate and construct future research. Gave me a great deal more understanding of this time period and the ways that the discipline approaches it which is invaluable in future research.",
    "It was absolutely essential to my scholarly interests as I'm in the Slavic department.",
    "This course filled in many gaps in my education previously because it was so systematic and thorough. For that, I am very grateful."
