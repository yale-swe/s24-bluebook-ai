   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about how to use text and movement to accurately embody and portray what it means to be human. I learned how to do a detailed analysis of myself through writing and how to use that to approach my work in performance. I learned new ideas about writing and about performance and how they relate.",
    "This course was essential to not only my development as an artist and a writer, but as a person. In general. Like, I feel like I've grown just as a human.",
    "I gained so much from this class - the confidence to perform solo in front of a group of people, the inspiration to create my own original work, a set of tools with which to approach theatrical material. I learned a lot about myself as an artist and felt myself able to open up to a group of people through theater.",
    "A regular writing practice, experience making my own work, practice checking in with myself.",
    "I gained new tools of developing character in performance, using the body and impulses. I developed myself creatively as a theatre-maker.",
    "Automatic writing. Let myself go. Theatre of Desire. I will always be employed if I can write my own theatre - and I can. Fill in the Blanks and how I can use them for my writing, as well as bring them to the rehearsal process that I am directing. The mind will follow the body - the body creates feelings, a story, and a character from the inside out.",
    "Theatrical inspiration, creating own original work",
    "I really enjoyed learning about my personal performance influences; Deb Margolin does a great job of helping one develop an understanding of what topics and impulses are most rewarding for one as a performer and playwright.",
    "As a class, with the help of the lovely Deb Margolin, we learned about movement, ensemble, theater of desire, writing, self, and others. It was a safe space in which we came together and brought all of our similarities and differences to the table so that we all were able to grow together and individually."

   "comments": [
    "All of the work that happened culminated together towards the end. Everything was very well structured and organized to culminate in our final work. The class seemed worthwhile and was overall very helpful. I can't think of many weaknesses.",
    "This course is amazing.",
    "The strengths of this course lie in its teacher: Deb Margolin. She is brilliant. I will brag about her later. She creates this amazing course, a compilation of different amazing theatrical scholars, and invites her students in to participate every week. I have learned so, so much from her and could hardly write enough to record every incredibly wise thing she'd say in a class's time. My one wish for the class is that we could have approached more scenes and monologues over the course of the semester. I'm sure, had we had more class time, we would have done so, however, and wouldn't have wanted to sacrifice any of the ensemble work we did.",
    "Theatre of Desire - do what you want. An environment of amazing people that respect your work and create a safe space for you in which to explore some of your most personal experiences and find ways in which to express them through performance.",
    "So fun and freeing and inspiring",
    "I felt the strength of the class lay in Deb's investment in our student group, and in our mutual commitment to the course.",
    "This course was one of the most freeing, accepting classes I've taken at Yale, and it really helped nurture and spark my creativity. Deb is absolutely wonderful, and so is the structure of the course-- you feel like you're not even doing work because it is so enjoyable and carefully planned out. I don't have suggestions for improvement, because I also feel like it is a class that changes depending on the people in it each semester."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, the best course I have taken at Yale thus far. Deb is one of the most caring, intellectual, well-spoken, and HUMAN professors out there. Her work is brilliant and she has a way to pull out the best work from you. If you are interested in understanding the role of the performer more, getting to know yourself, and doing some writing, you must take this course!",
    "Hell yes.",
    "Absolutely. You will learn about creating new theater, but even more about yourself.",
    "This class with Deb Margolin is a must take for anyone who wants to get better at making art. I wish it were available to everyone, not just theater studies majors, because it teaches you how to get to know yourself, and then how to stand up in front of people and share yourself. Deb is the kind of professor I wish for everyone--kind, brilliant, focused but still flexible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!!! This has been my favorite course I've taken at Yale, hands down. You develop yourself as an actor without it being in a super obvious way. All the exercises we do are so helpful and have helped me develop as an actor. The class calls for major introspection which helps you as an actor. Our class became incredibly close and it's just an amazing, accepting atmosphere.",
    "Absolutely! Take it if Deb Margolin is teaching it! Its Theatre of Desire - thats what you get when you work with Deb Margolin in THST210. There is no formal syllabus. You only have one paper: a response to a book of your choosing from a list she gives you, in which you share your thoughts and feelings about the book. You do automatic writing each day that will help you create a presentation and a final 10 minute solo performance of your own. You learn A LOT about yourself, your classmates, your professor, about everything in this class.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would really recommend it to anyone interested in theater. It's a great class to have on your schedule as a bit of academic therapy. It can be as work-intensive as you want to make it; your investment in the course determines your return.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Deb is lovely, funny, caring, and the absolute best. You will learn so much about theater and what it means to you, what it means to others, and how many aspects of many experiences come together to make art. You will learn to write and end the semester with a self-scripted performance that allows your to synthesize your learning in unexpected and truly rewarding ways. You will have a safe space to look forward to twice a week, with a teacher and (hopefully) classmates you support and who support you in turn. Take this class!! You have to anyway if you're a THST major, and if you're thinking of abandoning the major don't until you've taken this course."
