   "comments": [
    "I would take this course if you are looking for a low key seminar. The time of day it is offered is hard because its in the late afternoon and you can get sleepy. Its a good way to fulfill your 20 page requirement.",
    "This course introduces you to an interesting and fairly recent topic in the psychological literature. I really enjoyed writing my senior essay using ideas I picked up in this course. The subject matter is pretty different from what is covered by most other psychology courses at Yale and it is very relevant to many fields, so I would recommend it to those interested in the topic.",
    "Interesting material though a lot more philosophical than I would have liked. Great option if you need a psych senior seminar, but not a must-take if you do. Topics are a little repetitive and confusing, but the research in the field is really current and exciting.",
    "Really interesting class. I especially enjoyed how we were able to connect the topics we covered to existing social issues, which gave this class a grounding in the real world that other Psychology classes sometimes lack. Professor Napier is alsoreally cool.",
    "Great overview of legitimacy, intergroup relations, controversial topics like AA and social uprising, etc. If you want to explore these topics more in depth, this is a very laid back, informative seminar with the potential for great discussions.",
    "Psychology 424 covers many different theories of how and why we do (or do not) justify the systems in which we find ourselves. The material was interesting, but the manner it which it was covered was a bit hard to follow. I would recommend the class to those with some background in the area.",
    "I would characterize the course as more of an application of psychology to political theory. It was a dramatic departure from most of the other psychology courses I had taken (despite being in the major), which was both refreshing but also left me feeling as though I was lacking a certain requisite background or foundation. I would recommend the course for the subject matter and often interesting readings, but the format of the course could use reworking."
