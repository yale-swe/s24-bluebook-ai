   "comments": [
    "The readings were very insightful, because they came from a wide range of views that we openly analyzed, criticized, and synthesized in class. I would recommend the course to other students without a doubt.",
    "Absolutely. The class was the best I've ever taken. It is a lot of work though so don't take the class if you are not interested in the topic.",
    "This class was definitely interesting, and most of the reading is quite relevant. At times the focus is less on the topic than it is on Professor Shaker and her own life experience-- but in her defense she has led quite the interesting life and is deeply engaged in issues of conflict resolution in the Middle East. Overall it's an ok class, and would, if anything, look good on your transcript.",
    "This was a great course. The topics we covered got a little specific, and people began to branch off onto largely irrelevant tangents at times. But it was a marvelous opportunity to combine interests with Divinity and Graduate students. And the professor is a ballerrrrr.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student unless you enjoy seminars (at the Div school!) in which anyone can say anything without textual evidence and have it be accepted. If you know nothing about the Middle East, you still wont know much after taking this course. It would be better to take an intro to Islam class, like Griffel's Jihad& Fundamentalism. If you know a lot about the Middle East, you ALSO wont like this class, because it's not intellectually rigorous. It was more like a discussion group than a class.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you have every had any interest in conflict resolution!"
