   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody interested in propaganda art, literature, and film, and in a review of the major ideological and theoretical developments in those fields over the 20th century.",
    "An informative and wide-ranging survey of novels, plays, films and art of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, with particular, but not exclusive, emphasis on culture produced under totalitarian ideology (Nazi and Soviet).I would recommend it as it gives a chance to become acquainted with films, in particular, that are less than well-known (such as early Soviet films not by Eisenstein). It also opened my eyes to how even mass-market, seemingly mindless films (such as Rambo, or Footlight Parade) can contain ideological subtexts. For someone with no background in film studies, therefore, the course is an valuable and interesting introduction.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to a fellow student who wants to understand the ideological implications of any art form, in order to engage with it more thoroughly and in a politically\/socially informed manner.",
    "A fantastic introduction to the role ideology plays out in film, theatre, visual art, and literature from the early 20th century. The course has a great balance of theoretical and artistic materials.I would HIGHLY recommend this class. This is one of the best courses on Marxist and \"totalitarian\" theory I have ever taken. Prof. Clark's choice of art was also spectacular.",
    "Yes, very informative class."

   "comments": [
    "It showed me how other disciplines, such as the study of film, art, and even architecture and choreography, can be incorporated into a broader historical-cultural study of society.",
    "I feel that this course allowed me to be better informed about deeply embedded histories\/complicities of the art institution."
