   "comments": [
    "This class is a history course from the medieval times to Renaissance music. This class definitely has a fair amount of work, but if you are interested in music history, it is worth taking!",
    "I would tell every student to NEVER take this course, unless they were forced to for the music major. Then I would tell them to prepare themselves for the worst course in the music major. I would summarize it as an extremely disorganized approach to early music history that will make you regret every moment of the class",
    "If you're a music major, you have to take it... Prof. Z is extremely enthusiastic about the topic and clearly very knowledgeable. You also do some singing, which can be fun! However, the course was not well organized and I often left lecture confused.",
    "I would never recommend this course in a million years.",
    "You're looking at this review. It's likely that you're a music major and this class is required for you. You take this class, it's work, then you're done. You have to eat your veggies sometimes. There are some amazing pieces that we looked over this class, but many readings (and there were many) and projects seemed unnecessary or besides the point of what the course was trying to accomplish. This class has its profound moments where you do learn about amazing things, but it is a lot of work, and sometimes you feel like your searching for a needle in a haystack (pages of the verbosity of early musicologists) when the needle could have easily been provided in lecture.",
    "Musi 350 is the earliest in the track of music history requirements beginning with the earliest forms of notation and moving to the late madrigals of Marenzio\/Monteverdi.",
    "It's a lot of work for sure, but it's also a really fun class that will give you a breadth and depth of understanding of music pre-1600. Plus, if you're taking it, it's probably because you have to. Enjoy it and do the readings!",
    "Only take this class if you really really really like medieval music. This class is a lot of work, especially because of the weekly reading quizzes but the lectures weren't bad I learned a lot. The most interesting topic we covered was the history of musical notation which I think is something every musician should understand.",
    "Terrible class. Only take it if you need it for the major.",
    "For the humanities-minded, I'm sure it's a perfect class. For the analytically minded it seems fruitlessly esoteric at times, but the meat of the material is yet intriguing.",
    "Be prepared for a busy semester! You'll learn tons and a lot of it is very intriguing. Don't let the workload keep you from taking it.",
    "this class is a lot of busy work, heavy reading, many hours of listening, projects, written assignments, and weekly quizzes. unless you were exceptionally interested and excited about the material (or a music major for which the class is required) i wouldn't recommend it",
    "The listenings for music 350 really grew on me and I actually can't wait to go back and listen to them again. Medieval\/Renaissance music is just beautiful beyond words. The selection is perfect. The quizzes aren't too bad, because most of them are played from the beginning (especially the earlier ones) which I think is a great decision because during monophonic chants it's so difficult to recognize a piece half way through. Prof Z's greatest strength is that she is definitely enthusiastic about the subject. However, the biggest problem with this class is that information is just scattered everywhere and not given to us in a way that we can study for it well. I spend more time finding the information than studying for it. Lectures are in need of organization and better preparation. The content needs to be more capturing and there should be some more link between them. I think it just needs some revision. I feel that overall we emphasized notation too much. It would have been really nice to have studied the historical context more. The readings are also WAY too dense and too much that sometimes I don't even bother to read it. I remember my first reading was the Rules of St. Benedict and it overwhelmed me because I thought I had to memorize it. A lot of self reviewing is required for this class. For example we would be quizzed on a material based on our (super dense) readings that would then be taught AFTER we took the quiz. I don't get that. We go to lectures to learn, and after we are taught, THEN we can be tested. Not the other way round?",
    "Music 350 is fantastic early music history. I would recommend this class to anyone that is willing to commit themselves to a challenging approach to a complicated topic. The rewards are truly great.",
    "Unless you want to become a historian or performer of Medieval and Renaissance music, I would not recommend this course. Normally I'd be embarrassed to make such a statement, as I generally believe that everyone should know history and be exposed to many subjects, but the negative aspects of this class largely outweighed the positives for me. I certainly learned many facts about Medieval and Renaissance music that are essential for me to know as a musician and composer, but this didn't change my perspective of history in the same way Hepokoski's music history courses did. While it was nice to have enthusiasm from Professor Zayaruznaya, the workload was absolutely insane--we'd often have a 2 page paper, 100-200 pages of VERY dense reading, a listening\/reading identification quiz, and a project EVERY SINGLE WEEK. I've never had so much work in a class at Yale before--there was simply no option but to stay up all night once a week to focus on doing what this course required. Granted, you could probably get away with doing much less than what is assigned and still do fine in the class (e.g., all 11 quizzes are only worth 10% of your grade all together), but like many Yale students, I tend to find it hard not to complete work that is assigned. If you're comfortable doing this, however, you might get by fine in the course. My sense is that only music majors who are required to take the class do take it, so probably the most useful advice I can give it--take an easy workload in addition to this class if you are going to take it. You will regret overcommitting with this on your schedule. All this being said, I think the course covers interesting material, and my TF was fantastic so helped tie things into the larger music history narrative (connecting it with some of the things we did in Hepokoski's class during sections occasionally). I also think Anna will reduce the course-load in future years (she did reduce the reading after getting some feedback from students mid-semester, and this was her first time teaching the class), so it may turn out to be a much better course in the future. Also, if you're more interested in studying medieval and renaissance music in terms of specific musical\/notational developments and (especially) scholarly approaches to history than in learning about how things pit into a larger historical framework, then you might actually love this course!",
    "The highlight of this class is that it covers absolutely beautiful music, which you might have never heard before. The material is great, and the class emphasizes the particular difficulties associated with studying this time period, which are also fascinating. There were a lot of small assignments -- 4 projects, 5 reading responses, and weekly quizzes -- and reading (which was usually interesting!). The quizzes required a fair amount of studying, but they ended up being extremely helpful since they forced me to stay on top of the material. The midterm and the final were both straightforward. I didn't love Professor Zayaruznaya's style of teaching. She didn't provide much of a broad historical context, and sometimes she didn't respect the students enough. However, she got better and more comfortable in front of the class throughout the semester, and she took the midterm feedback seriously, so she'll probably be better next time around. Section discussion was also one of the best parts of this class. The TAs grade all of the assignments and lead sections, so your TA is important to your impression of the class.",
    "Professor Z has a huge amount of knowledge about early music to impart, and I think MUSI 350 can be really great. As it was offered in Spring 2015, however, this class was a real struggle. First, the workload is massive. Second, the readings -- usually scholarly articles -- are consistently dense. And finally, Professor Z's classes are a little wayward, and really don't address the readings closely enough. If you have to take this class for the music major, do keep up with the listening -- it will make the midterm and final much easier.",
    "This class I hope will get better But right now it's really not the best \"history\" course. Professor Z Approaches it from much more of a historiographical perspective than historical - meaning most of the class was reading dense scholarly articles and learning about specific aspects of the music we were learning (notation, specific techniques), which Though I think was valuable, was really lacking in a broader historical framework. The class was a ton of work - quizzes each Thursday on listening and quotes from the readings that had to be situated - and disjunct. I was often confused as to what we were learning, and my section was a saving grace in terms of figuring out what was going on. I came to enjoy the class\/appreciate it more, I guess, as the term went on, but it was certainly a trial."
