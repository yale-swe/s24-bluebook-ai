    "Deepened my understanding of scholarly work in the profession significantly. Did not contribute to my dissertation\/research.",
    "It was at times difficult to apply the course content to my own dissertation work, as I am not focusing on management of chronic illnesses. It was important content to be aware of and learn about, but I think a half-semester would have been sufficient for my own needs."
