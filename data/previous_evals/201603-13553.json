    "Great course",
    "I think the course overall was helpful. Something that would be incredibly helpful is if each lecture started or ended with slides on the basics of each method: why you would choose this approach, when would it be helpful, what are the advantages and disadvantages, any assumptions. It would help compare between the different methods and would be very useful in the future to look back on.",
    "It's okay. I think the strengths are it covers a lot of different type of analytical methods that are widely applicable in any field. It's all SAS so I feel much more adept at SAS than before having only taken the first AAMIE course. I think you should probably take it if Epidemiology is your interest. Weaknesses: the amount of work becomes overwhelming and you have to rush through it to get it done on time. There is no TA so we did not receive timely feedback at all, so often I did not even know if what I was doing was correct. Improvements: not necessarily less work, but maybe just more time, especially if we aren't getting feedback anyway. I think a big improvement would be to use more practical and real world examples of the methods we use. This would have gotten me more excited about the topics and would have given me a better understanding of how to use them instead of just trying to regurgitate code and interpretation wording for silly assignments.",
    "This is great course.",
    "An amazing class. You will learn more than the rest of our courses combined. But you have to put in the work. It's a ton of work but it's worth it.",
    "It would have been beneficial to have grades for homework and midterms returned prior to final exam.",
    "This is a fantastic course! Must-take if you are interested in exploring epidemiology methodology!",
    "This was the hardest class I have taken at YSPH so far, but one of the most useful and methods driven courses as well. Was scared at first for this course, but it really has an intimate atmosphere and instructor is very flexible and attentive to shaping around needs of students. A lot of work for the work week, but got many skills that are competitive against other similar courses at SOM and other schools. Highly recommend."

    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Great instructor",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Dr. Shebl is a positive, helpful professor. She did a great job of laying content out clearly and answering questions when necessary. Grading has become a bit of a problem in this class, as we have not received our graded midterms or the last five (I think?) assignments. Although I understand that it was hard to find a TA or a grader for the course, shorter (and easier to grade) assignments could have been given to alleviate that burden.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0An incredibly helpful, knowledgeable professor.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0She is very helpful and wants us to learn and succeed.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0She definitely knows her stuff, good powerpoints, but she can be a little intimidating. Sometimes she makes you feel embarrassed for asking a question though I am sure she probably doesn't mean to. The class desperately needs a TA.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0She is a great professor.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Fatma is incredible. She is the most dedicated professor who is committed to her students. She probably needed a teaching assistant for this class because there were so many assignments to grade. But she tirelessly teaches, answers questions, and provides extra information if you wish to carry out any of these analyses outside of class. She is an amazing professor and should be recognizing as that.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Professor Shebl IS AMAZING. She has the ability to take VERY DIFFICULT concepts and explain them in an understandable format at an introductory level (since most of us in the class have never been exposed to the concepts covered in the course). She is PHENOMENAL. I especially liked the format of introducing the topic in lecture on Monday and then going into the lab together on Wednesday and implementing what we learned. The lecture slides she prepared were extremely helpful, and she explained everything in a very coherent manner. She was also extremely willing to meet with students outside of class during office hours if we needed the additional help. (She does seem a little over-worked though.., and may benefit from having a Teaching Fellow as this course grows)",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Loved this course and Dr. Shebl! She is such an amazing, intelligent professor that genuinely cares about her students. I learned the most from this course out of any course I have taken at YSPH. I think that having a TA may have made things a little easier for students with questions, but other than that this course was flawless.",
    "Instructor: Fatma Shebl \u00a0Fatma is very wonderful and extremely knowledgeable. She is very patient and kind, and has many many times in class shown and made clear that she truly wants us to learn. When she is accessible, she explains things very clearly. However she is quite busy and sometimes it is clear that she is balancing several projects at once. She would definitely benefit from having a TF in this course! Fatma is very wonderful though, and really appreciated her expertise in the class. Slides are very very helpful and labs for this class were even more helpful. Superb. Class could benefit from having labs or slides posted a few days early so students could review more ahead of time to be more prepared for class or labs."

    "This is great course.",
    "Great class. Tons of work but it's all worth it. These are the skills you go to graduate school. These are the skills that will get you a job or help you in any field.",
    "This is a course that should follow Epidemiology 1 and Epidemiology 2 to introduce you to methods that Epidemiologists should be familiar with. Unlike the two other courses, this course focuses on methodology and how to implement these new Epidemiology methods in SAS programming.",
    "Such a useful course. Take it!",
    "It is a lot of work, but I highly recommend this course to students. The work is worth the reward of the amount of skills gained - in terms of modeling and data analytics. Helps students especially in CDE and SBS gain skills that otherwise would not be strengthened in other courses. Valuable skillset, this course should definitely be utilized!"
