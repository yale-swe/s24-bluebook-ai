   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student because although the workload is quite heavy, Professor Kavanagh is extremely knowledgeable on the subject and facilitates conversation very well.",
    "In French 751, you read all the major (and many of the minor\/unpublished) works of Rousseau. You have a weekly response essay due by email the Friday before class on Monday, two presentations, a reading guide for the class, and a final paper. I would recommend it to a student who is interested in Rousseau and who has lots of time for the written work, not to mention the three bricks: the Confessions, Emile, and Julie.",
    "I would summarize this course as a comprehensive survey of Rousseau, and I would recommend it, as I've undoubtedly obtained a pretty good sense of who he is as a writer and thinker. It is an effective course."

   "comments": [
    "The information I learned from this course will be very helpful indeed for my area and for my dissertation. I was a little surprised about how far-reaching Rousseau's influence has been--from the ideology of national parks, nature, education, memory, the autobiography, government, introspection... It seemed Rousseau had something to say about everything. I sense that people often only know about political Rousseau, so I feel fortunate to have a more complete idea of his work.",
    "I've gotten a much better sense of who Rousseau is, and after having taken this course, it's been impossible for me to not be able to see Rousseau's influence nearly everywhere else in the literature that succeeds him."
