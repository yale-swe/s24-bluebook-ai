   "comments": [
    "This spanish course is for anyone who would like to improve their speaking skills and vocabulary, but not necessarily your grammar.",
    "yes - def take it. awsome L5",
    "This is a good class if you are worried about losing your Spanish and need a filler. It's not difficult and doesn't require a large amount of work. On the other hand, the material is not inspiring and neither is the course structure: we spent most of our time answering reading comprehension\/reflection sort of questions in pairs. If you want something a little more interesting and challenging, I recommend literature or topics-based classes.",
    "Span 151 is basically all about conversations - there are some low-key homework assignments, panel discussions, and two oral exams, plus you read a short book. It's not much work at all and it's a great way to practice your Spanish skills, if you don't have any other way to do so. Also a huge plus in the case of taking it credit\/d\/fail. However, your grammar does seem to slip a bit in terms of your technical knowledge. Overall, I'd recommend the course - especially if you can take the section with Sebastian Diaz; he's funny and engaging!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student that wants to keep their Spanish fresh in their minds. It's good for improving speaking fluency, and you also get to read interesting passages and books. You gain the ability to speak about really obscure intense topics, like privatization of prisons, indigenous struggles in South America and capitalism.",
    "Spanish 151 is great for sharpening oral skills. I would only take it if you are comfortable speaking aloud in front of other people. But the topics for discussion are interesting and help you learn Spanish in a way that translates to the real world.",
    "I would definitely recommend it as a fun, relatively easy class to improve your spanish speaking skills.",
    "I'd probably suggest a different, smaller class for someone who really wants to work on their speaking."
