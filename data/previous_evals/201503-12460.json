    "good if you want to spend some quality time in the lab. wouldn't do if you don't enjoy the lab as much.",
    "20 hours of independent research per week along with a proposal, presentation, and mock grant report. This course largely depends on your lab and your mentor. If you like research, you should definitely choose this option.",
    "The time commitment is no joke and highly recommend that you find a good lab with a nice mentor truly willing to mentor you. Helps if there's an established project with some direction so that not just doing lab tech-y \"research\"",
    "Excellent chance to pursue independent academic research with a faculty mentor in the lab - be prepared to work hard!"
