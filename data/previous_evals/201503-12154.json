   "comments": [
    "This class needs to be eliminated from the Global Health Studies curriculum. While Professor Bradley had promised at the beginning of the semester that the structure of the course would be much looser than in previous years, this ended up being far from reality. Nearly half of the total class time was consumed by student presentations that, while certainly interesting, provided little pedagogical value for the rest of the students in the class. It would have been so much more productive to undertake an independent study with a professor in my field, which I thought to myself every Thursday as I left this class. If they somehow end up offering the class again next year, do not take it if you ended your summer with anything less than a clean, complete, and meaningful set of (quantitative) data that you are 100% committed to publishing. Otherwise, you will spend the semester absolutely miserable.",
    "If you have summer research data, this course is excellent for helping you think through how to properly develop your background and work through your analysis. Writing the paper\/finishing analysis gets a little tight at the end of the semester, so be sure to stay on top of things!",
    "If you are looking to write up global health research in a serious manner (perhaps for publication) then you absolutely should take this class. It'll make you a very researcher and student for sure. Also, Professor Bradley is an incredible professor who makes every class engaging.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a fellow student, especially if Professor Bradley is teaching it again. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale in four years. This is essentially a 1 semester global health\/health services research thesis. This course will give you a chance to write a full manuscript with excellent guidance. Note, though, that you should talk with the professor ahead of time about what your project will be - if you don't have a good project to work on, then you may not enjoy the class. The most successful students had already collected data (over the summer or previous years) and were bringing it to the class to write up. You also will be served well to have a faculty research advisor outside of the class that is working on your study with you. If you are in the Global Health Fellows program, definitely take this class. Take the opportunity to ask for feedback often. Statistics knowledge is not needed but if you are doing a qualitative study be sure to know who is going to work with you on your data analysis. The semester is not very long - in the academic world 3 months is not much time to write a manuscript - so be prepared to work hard!",
    "Great class to take if you have global health research you'd like to develop into a paper and presentation (even if you're not a Global Health Fellow)! If you're going to be analyzing data and writing a paper anyway, it's minimal additional work, and it was really fun and valuable to learn from other people's work as well. You emerge from this class knowing your own research, but also with significant knowledge of everyone else's work. Also one of the few classes at Yale that teaches you how to give a good presentation!",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you have done original research and are unsure how to move forward.",
    "Definitely. It is a lot of work at times, but I think I got more out of this class than many others I have taken up to this point at Yale. I learned about my own potential as a writer, how to present to a group of people, and how to accept critical feedback. What really made the class however wasn't the information itself but the instructor. Being taught by Prof. Bradley was really a joy and an honor and I feel lucky to have been in her class, regardless of the subject material."
