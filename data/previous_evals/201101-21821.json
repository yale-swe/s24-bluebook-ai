   "comments": [
    "I would totally recommend this class to another student if they are into the material or want to get into the material. Also, I would recommend this class just because of Professor Walsh because he is outstanding.",
    "Take this class! It's a great survey of Early Modern Drama, with a professor who keeps the conversation interesting and informative.",
    "This is an interesting class, covering a lot of infrequently read plays from Shakespeare's contemporaries, as well as Shakespeare plays. I recommend Brian Walsh-- he is a really nice professor and really likes the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend this class for Shakespeare enthusiasts. It's very interesting to put Shakespeare into a more historical context and consider him alongside other playwrights. I would say two-thirds or so of the plays we read were by authors other than Shakespeare, so if you are looking for a pure Shakespeare class, this may not be the class for you. That said, this was one of the most interesting seminars I've taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take it! It's a great chance to study Shakespeare's contemporaries (and Shakespeare too, of course). Brian Walsh is great, and discussions were interesting and fun.",
    "This is a wonderful class. I highly recommend this seminar and Walsh's classes in general.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who enjoys drama, and wants to learn more about playwrights outside of the Bard.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, even if you're not a senior English major. It's a really fun discussion seminar. You read a bunch of interesting plays and write a few papers. The workload isn't too bad, though keeping up with the readings (a play a week, roughly) can be a little rough. But the focus of the class is really interesting, and Professor Walsh is wonderful."
