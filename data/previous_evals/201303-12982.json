   "comments": [
    "The class will serve as a great introduction to early modern Japanese history for those new to the field. At the same time, it has much to offer for students who already have some prior knowledge of the field, but want to delve deeper into individual issues (which was my case). It is a very informative and enjoyable class; highly recommended.",
    "Highly recommend to anyone who is interested in early modern Japanese history.",
    "I would recommend this class. This class is great for anyone who is interested in East Asian history. One can gain deep understanding of many aspects of Japanese history from this class.",
    "An overview of many topics in Tokugawa history. Highlights were crime, prostitution, social status and infanticide. Some books were translations from Japanese.Yes, I would recommend the class to another student. The instructor made sure that even those who did not specialize in Japan could participate. If a student wished to learnhow to write book reviews, this would also be a great class regardless of specialty.",
    "This class is a perfect introduction to some of the deeper themes of Japanese history during the Tokugawa period. Reading a book a week on average, you will be able to examine Japan's early history through the lens of a different theme each week. The grading structure, which depends on five in-depth reading responses, allows you to manage your workload and also gain a deeper understanding of the five books that you choose to review. Professor Drixler is simply wonderful.If you are interested in Japanese history it is a must-take!"

   "comments": [
    "This course deepened my knowledge of early modern Japanese history, which is a necessary prerequisite for me, since I am studying modern Japan, and need to know what came before it. The theoretical frameworks and use of sources in several of the books also gave me some interesting ideas that could help me in my dissertation research.",
    "This course enables me to form a clear mind-map on both Tokugawa Japan and the Meiji Transition, and gives me a better grasp on the grand picture of modern East Asian history in general",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of many aspects of Japanese history, and it helped me to understand Japanese history systematically and understand Japan's position in East Asia. This course isvery eye-opening to me, and I got many inspirations for my dissertation from this class.",
    "It deepened my knowledge of the historian's profession and how history changes constantly. The Tokugawa period is not my area of research, so it was not a great contribution in that respect, but it informed my views on modernity and the politics of history.",
    "This course was invaluable for shaping my thoughts about this period of Japanese history, and, by extension, trends that would surface in the twentieth century. I am confident I will use the knowledge I gained here not only in a dissertation, but for the rest of my academic career."
