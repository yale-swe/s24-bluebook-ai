    "I highly recommend this course. Take it! If you want to understand Africa from a unique viewpoint, I recommend taking this class above any other introduction to Africa politics class! With this, you relive Africa through the decades, you understand more and internalize African philosophical thought and then begin to appreciate the repercussions of some broader policy objectives and implications.",
    "Yes, if you would enjoy the books!",
    "The class was interesting and fun due to the small discussion size and the enthusiasm of the class members.",
    "It was an interesting discourse on African literature and opens your eyes to interesting depths. I would highly recommend it!",
    "Yes, its a nice easy class, and the books are really interesting!",
    "Wonderful class! Basically you read a book every week and have a long discussion. Before each class you have to prepare a short reading response ( just one page) and at the end of the semester you write a paper. The Professor Ann Biersteker is very knowledgeable and always provides an interesting perspective of the book. Being able to hear from students who may be familiar with one or two of the books in their original language also really helps get a fuller understanding of them. The class is very relaxed and fun with a sensible workload."
