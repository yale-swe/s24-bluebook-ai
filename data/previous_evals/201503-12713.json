    "This is an odd course. The subject matter is critical for anyone planning on grad school, so I won't waste time telling you to take it. I don't think this course deserves the reputation it has the most difficult course in the physics major. Perhaps Doug Stone is just getting soft in his old age. Both as measured by the difficulty of and by the average amount of time required to complete the problem sets, it is very similar to 410, 430 and 440-441. In fact, problem sets for this course may actually have taken somewhat less time than usual, because all the problems were worked through in detail during the TA office hours, which nearly everyone attended. What makes this course odd is the textbook. Doug Stone insists on using an obsolete text by Sturge which is literally out of print. The text is chock full of errors and at times is extraordinary unclear. Compared to any standard text (Reif, Kittel, Schroeder, even Landau & Lifschitz), it does an extremely poor job of explaining very simple concepts (e.g., heat engines, phase transitions, and almost all of introductory thermo.) It's alright for stat mech, but even there it uses uncommon notation. I suppose the main incentive for using this book is that no one else uses it, so it's impossible to find solutions for most of the problems online. I don't think this is worth it, though. Beside his poor choice of textbook, Doug Stone seems to be a pretty nice guy.",
    "Not as bad as you think it is, but still pretty bad. It'll be no small portion of your life.",
    "Only take this class if you live and breathe phsycis",
    "Honestly, you might love it. Statistical mechanics is a fascinating theory. Without it, you're pretty much left to experimentally measuring curves and having no idea where they come from- quantum phenomena. This quantum phenomena takes familiar forms in the limits of low densities and high temperatures, and unfamiliar forms at the other extreme. And there really aren't many better instructors at this institution to teach these truths than Stone, who wrote a book which talks a lot about the development of this very science. Now lectures. Stone doesn't really lecture directly from notes, he comes up with a lot of stuff from memory. Some might dislike this, but I think it's actually better. I feel like a lot of my other physics lecturers have gone through the material too smoothly by looking at their notes that I missed the thinking process. Stone actually has to think about what he's going to do next and seeing that process play out I think leads to much stronger student understanding. You have to focus. At 9am likely. Coffee. But I think it's well worth it. If you really try to understand the material rather than just finish problem sets and take partial derivatives without thinking (you'll have to fight the urge to in thermo), you'll learn a ton of physics and become smarter in general. Focus on understanding the material, keep complaining to a minimum, and you can do great things in this class. Tip for exams: It helps to figure out how Stone thinks (in fact in his exams he pretty much tells what steps to take)- he tries to make things computationally simple and they often are (sometimes to the great surprise of the class). Logic and solid fundamentals are the key to doing well rather than trying to memorize random details. Also, figure out how to Taylor expand correctly and efficiently. Limiting cases are super important. Oh, and learning Thermodynamics from Reif would probably be helpful (also very good for phase transitions) just try to ignore the chemical potential stuff. You talk about chemical potential eventually.",
    "be warned that this class is a lot of work and a ton of stress even though you do learn a lot. i would recommend, but only if you have a TA as good as ananda. because the homework is impossible at times without a good TA.",
    "This is likely the hardest class I will have taken at Yale. The material is extensive, comprehensive, and in some ways is very different from other physics that students are required to learn for the major. The problem sets are many, and are often long and difficult (but thankfully you have a GREAT TA in Ananda Roy make sure to go to all of the problem review sessions). The exams can be brutal, and don't be surprised if you do worse on them than you have ever done on any other exams in your life. YET, all that being said, the class is *definitely worth taking*. I learned so much more this term than I have in any other single physics class so far, and a really fundamental understanding of statistical mechanics is likely crucial to being a good physicist. Professor Stone is very adamant about the material, and doesn't go through lectures like a rote exercise, as if often found in physics and math courses at Yale. If you are interested and have the time and patience, DO IT.",
    "Physics 420 had its ups and downs, but at the end of the day, it was one of the better courses I've taken in the physics department. I certainly learned a bunch about thermodynamics and statmech, and felt like I left the course a more confident and competent physics major. This class is pitched at a higher level than 410, 430, or 440, and you'll cover a lot of interesting material at a solid level. That said -- despite the rumors you've heard -- this class won't kill you. Professor Stone assigns good problem sets that take 7-15 hours each week, and do a great job of preparing you for his challenging but fair exams. If you put the time into doing the homework yourself (as opposed to, say, just watching the godly Ananda do them at the TA sessions), you'll learn a lot, and do well on the tests, since exam problems are very similar to the exercises Stone writes for the homework. The hardest part of this course, I thought, wasn't the workload, but the physics maturity it expected from those taking it. More so than the rest of the core intensive sequence, 420 requires you to teach yourself a great deal of the material: Professor Stone's lectures, although animated, are not the clearest, and the main textbook for this class (Sturge) isn't very good. But 420 is an ultimately rewarding experience -- statmech is really pretty -- and not nearly as difficult as people make it out to be. You've got this.",
    "This class really tests your ability to understand concepts and their interactions, instead of calculations and memorization. The problem sets are pretty long and require a significant amount of effort, but are actually very enlightening. The exams are fair in terms of content, but not very fair in terms of grading. Overall, I feel that the effort devoted to this class is 100% worth it.",
    "This was one of the most fun courses I have taken at Yale thus far. Before taking this class, I was informed that it was going to be a disaster. On the contrary, I found the workload to be very reasonable, and that I learnt a ton of physics. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn the fundamentals of stat mech and thermo. My only three gripes were 1) the final pset, that was due during reading week - I would really recommend changing this 2) that sometimes the lectures were a little disorganized - clearer headings and introductions at the top of each section would have been very helpful 3) the midterms seemed to test speed over knowledge - make the tests harder, but make them shorter, or give us more time. Doug Stone is super-dedicated - I would recommend seeing him during office hours, and making sure you nail the concepts. Ananda, is also one of the most wonderful TAs I have ever had. This course was really not the hell I was expecting it to be - on the contrary, I found it to be a very approachable introduction to SM and TD, in a very lucid and exciting form. Stone lectures well and really knows his stuff cold.",
    "This is a tough course, but it is totally worth it. You will learn a tremendous amount of physics that will transform the way you think about the world and the types of problems you are able to solve.",
    "I was really looking forward to learning statistical mechanics, and I'm glad I got around to it, but 420 fell well short of expectations. The course failed to provide anything resembling a unified picture of the subject. It felt more like a smattering of loosely related facts about statistical mechanics, and the elegance of the subject (which I'm told is not a fantasy) was lost. Prof. Stone is a nice guy (even if a bit intimidating), but his lectures weren't very organized and he did not spend enough time on quantum gases, which were about half of the final.",
    "All I'll do is leave you with a poem -- Getting Stoned at (PHYS) 420, by a survivor: Ananda,\/ The savior.\/ Wasnt it for you,\/ 420 wouldve been (more) painful.\/\/ About Stone,\/ Ill give you a head start.\/ Hard to believe in the beginning,\/ But deep inside he has a heart.\/\/ Sturge,\/ The confusion.\/ Why so many typos?\/ Your textbook is a delusion.\/\/ Schroeder tries to save you\/ When Sturge tries to confuse.\/ Though Im really sorry to warn you\/ That his text youll barely use.\/\/ 20 to 30 hours\/ Problem sets will take.\/ With physics majors youll bond.\/ Plenty of friendships youll make.\/\/ At the CEID\/ Late nights youll spend.\/ And every Monday evening\/ TA sessions youll attend.\/\/ You wont only learn physics.\/ History will also come along.\/ About Einstein youll hear a lot,\/ And Bose will also be very strong.\/\/ During reading period,\/ A very long pset youll get.\/ And wait for the last lecture\/ Therere still three chapters to digest.\/\/ Knowledge, pain and tears\/ Will be your semesters flavor.\/ So all I wish is that the odds\/ Are ever in your favor.",
    "I really enjoyed the class and learned a tremendous amount. One of the greatest strengths of the course is the sheer scope of the material covered, which is quite impressive for a one-semester treatment. I enjoyed the thorough presentation of thermodynamics at the beginning, followed by statistical mechanics, beginning with the classical treatment, followed by the density of states, and finishing with quantum statistical mechanics and the ideal gas, photon gas (blackbody radiation), and Bose and Fermi gases. While the course was certainly challenging and the workload heavy, I found Professor Stone to be extremely approachable, accommodating, and helpful in answering questions both in office hours and after class. Lectures were comprehensive but not always easy to follow so you may need to set aside more time to process the material outside of class. Problem sets were lengthy and often challenging (and also assigned during the midterm and reading weeks) but were manageable, especially with the help of the TA sessions, which Ananda did an incredible job with. Exams were challenging and time-pressured but reasonable in difficulty. Id definitely recommend the course to anyone looking to gain a solid grasp on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, but be prepared to put the work in to get the most out of it.",
    "First, a warning. Don't take this class at the same time as CPSC323. It was rough dealing with both of these plus all my other classes (phys441 and a couple others). You really will regret it if you take them both, once psets for both classes kick in. Now the review. I though this course was excellent. You get to calculate many interesting things from first principles, including the ideal gas law, phase diagrams, specific heats, Bose-Einstein condensates, and more. This course also felt the most grounded in reality of any physics course I've taken so far. We work with materials, calculating intuitive things like temperature, and also standard thermodynamics, doing things like finding engine efficiencies. Professor Stone was actually a classics major as an undergraduate. He wrote an awesome book called \"Einstein and the Quantum\", viewing Einstein's role in the early development of quantum theory. His lectures are infused with anecdotes and stories about the lives of Einstein and others. I thought these added greatly to the excitement of the lectures. His lectures take a bit of getting used to, the blackboard presentation can get disorganized at times, but Professor Stone really knows the material so try to keep up with him. Psets start short but quickly grow to 15+ hour workloads. Especially at the end of the course, when he crams several chapters into just a couple lectures. Hopefully he fixes that in future years. Make sure you go to the problem solving sessions, and work in groups to help understand what the questions are asking you to do. Tests are really difficult, work fast; closed book and he only gives you a couple formulas, but the questions are such that memorizing lots of formulas won't really help you.",
    "I would certainly recommend PHYS 420 to another student, although would need to include the warning that it is a challenging class and will require significant time. If you don't have the time then don't take the class, it will be really stressful! (Plus you will miss out on how cool the material is!)",
    "Intro to Stat Mech, follows Sturge very closely. 9am class can be hard to make however.",
    "Ay, this class is hard. GO TO THE PSET SESSIONS. The material is unfamiliar and kind of unforgiving, and Professor Stone is a very classical and old-fashioned physics professor. He doesn't do in-class examples, so sometimes I was really lost about where to start with the psets. GO TO THE PSET SESSIONS. That being said, in retrospect, I really enjoyed the class, and I don't think it completely deserves its reputation as the hardest class in the department (I thought 430 was harder). Thermo and Stat Mech are a different flavor of physics that I found new, refreshing, and elegant, and I believe Professor Stone taught the subjects effectively and rigorously. The problem sets were difficult - so difficult that they would have been actually IMPOSSIBLE if it weren't for the pset sessions each week. HEED MY WORDS: GO TO THE PSET SESSIONS. DO IT. YOU MIGHT FALL IN LOVE WITH THE TA. GO TO THE PSET SESSIONS. Really, sometimes the pset sessions became essentially lectures, with the TA presenting new and essential material, which was frustrating and unfair for students that couldn't attend them, but hey. Hopefully you can used the psets as an opportunity to work with other people in your class and make friends - I was lucky that that was the case for me, and it made everything more bearable and fun. The exams for this class are super challenging, but they were (for the most part) the fun kind of challenging that really forces you to apply your knowledge in a new way, so I can't quite complain there. You feel kind of awesome when you get to the end of the class, looking back at everything you learned and the kinds of tough problems you are capable of doing. Ultimately, I think I might have sprained my brain during the final, but I am really happy that I chose to take 420. GO TO THE PSET SESSIONS.",
    "This class is hard. Like really hard. Honestly, only take it if you have to. That said, I did learn a lot, and have a much deeper appreciation for the role thermodynamics plays throughout science and physics."
