   "comments": [
    "\"Anthropology of the Contemporary\" is an advanced graduate seminar that explores what sort of research and work anthropologists should be doing today after the critique raised by the anthology Writing Culture. The course was named after James Faubion and George Marcus' book \"Designs for an Anthropology of the Contemporary\" which are a series of transcribed conversations between some of the leading anthropologists who ask epistemological questions about the state of anthropology today and how it ought to be done differently. Each week, we read a book by various contemporary anthropologists who do multi-sited fieldwork in many different countries all over the world. Each of these authors come to our class each week to engage in discussion before an 1.5 hour long public lecture. I would definitely recommend this course to anthropology students, but would caution anyone outside the field that the course material may be quite dense for those who have not done any introductory course work in anthropology.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to my friends."

   "comments": [
    "I hope to work with Professor Clarke on my M.A. thesis particularly in the area of anthropology and literary engagement. The discussions in Marcus and Faubion's book on multi-sited fieldwork, para-ethnography, the design studio, and defining the \"contemporary\" and how to study it are all broader questions that I feel open up more collaboration between literary scholars and social scientists.",
    "This is the first anthropology class I have taken in life and believe that it has opened a window for me."
