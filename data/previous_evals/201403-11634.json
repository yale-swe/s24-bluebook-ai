   "comments": [
    "The great thing about this seminar is that it is helpful for students who have not worked and came straight from college. Learning how to give a pitch and learning the art of networking are two completely new concepts to me, and it was nice to be exposed to that. It was also helpful in allowing us to evaluate ourselves in regards to our interviewing and public speaking skills. One of my goals here is to become better at public speaking, and the seminar allowed me to identify my strengths and weaknesses as the training coaches provided great feedback. However, I think the primary weakness is that not much time is spent on the resume, and more time could be spent offering students tips on how to write a cover letter. Also, it is difficult to learn too much in just three days, so while this serves as a good introductory course, it by no means really teaches you how to navigate the career field.",
    "Maybe make the use of time more efficient.",
    "Useless. Absolutely useless",
    "It HELPS A LOT in improving our presentation skills.",
    "Having come to Yale with some work experience, I decided to take part in the Professional Skills Seminar because I thought that I could beef up on some of the skills I already had. Unfortunately, most of what was taught was not particularly helpful. Many of the units seemed to be things that could be gleaned from the internet with a simple Google search.",
    "This seminar was a huge waste of time. As I explained on the survey sent following the event, not only was time not spent wisely (on skills we might actually need and utilizing the career coaches), the skills that were presented to us by William Vance were presented poorly. This seminar was a disappointment, as I was hoping that--if we were going to be forced to spend our break at school--we might get a \"Yale\" quality seminar. This was NOT that caliber of seminar.",
    "Strengths: covers skills students who have always been in school might need once they are out in the professional world Weakness: some information might be repetitive to those who have already been in the work force before coming to graduate school.",
    "strengths: good idea weaknesses: poorly executed. get a student working group to help better develop this course next year. i am sure there are a lot of people who would be interested.",
    "Horrible course. Could have covered entire material in one day. Useless",
    "Speaking from the standpoint of a graduating fifth year, it just wasn't the right year for us to take it. I'm still not convinced it would have been very helpful last year either but at least it would have been more applicable. So in the future I would recommend mandating that all fifth year students must take it during their senior year.",
    "I thought that this seminar could be better organized. Prior to the first day of the seminar we were supposed to prepare a PowerPoint presentation and practice it, but then on the first day we learned all about how we should make and give presentations. It would have made more sense if we had seen this presentation prior to making and practicing our own. We also talked quite a bit about resumes, but never had time to get feedback on our own, which would have been much more helpful than some of our other activities. The time for the seminar also could be cut down - we did not need an hour for lunch, for example, and having this during our fall break was difficult.",
    "helpful for public speaking skills, interviews, and resume building",
    "This course was helpful with the interview and presentation building skills. These are skills that are also needed in class so it was useful to know how we could improve these skills.",
    "Great intro to professional skills. However, taking away our fall break for such a class is not right - we had no break in between midterms and the second half of the semester, and no time to refresh. There has to be a better timing option - maybe take class days away. That's a better idea.",
    "Annoying, but I did take away a few things from it.",
    "I thought the seminar was great and important for all students to partake in. My only complaint is that I wish that it took place earlier in the semester. By the time many of us had taken the seminar, many of us had already conducted class presentations and\/or job interviews that the information would have been beneficial to know earlier.",
    "It's good practice but I feel like it was too general and did not go over specifics on how to improve resume, cover letters, and interview styles.",
    "n\/a (i waived this course)",
    "The course would be better if it didn't occur over fall break. Most students (myself included) were very exhausted from midterms before break and thus had a hard time actually focusing or wanting to be there. I think it could be better if the course was spread out as well, because changing behaviors take time.",
    "Great information, tools to succeed in the workforce",
    "Very good!",
    "good introduction to professional skills. the presentation skills was extremely helpful. I would have preferred to see more one on one work on resumes, etc.",
    "A good idea, but needs to be 8 hours shorter. Either make the course required for everyone or required for no one. DOn't do it over the first fall break.",
    "It's useful and helpful to me. I like it, except for the time of the course...",
    "it was alright",
    "It encouraged students to participate in presentations. I would have liked to spend more time in activities\/presentations.",
    "The seminar was at too low of a level. Most of us have had experience with doing a resume or interviewing so it would nice if there were different experience levels or the seminar targeted different experience levels.",
    "I thought it was a great class and very worth while.",
    "good. not long enough",
    "I learned a lot from the PSS. I learned new skills to better communicate and present myself. I have more confidence as I enter the internship search, absolutely.",
    "Strengths: the course itself is great for individuals that will be professionals in the field of public health. Focus on continual improvement and engagement. Weaknesses: during Fall break. So late in the year (should be done earlier and maybe for longer).",
    "exempted out",
    "It could be shortened to two days. A Wednesday-Thursday, 2- 8 hour sessions First years deserve a longer fall break.",
    "I think it was helpful in building my interviewing skills which I appreciated.",
    "The workshop had very good tips for improving presentation skills. In fact, all of the information presented will be very helpful in the future. However, I think that the wrap-up sessions at the end of the day were a little pointless and things could have been said before we broke off into groups.",
    "None of us liked doing it, but I felt like I got some good information out of it. William Vance was awesome in the small group settings and had lots of great tips.",
    "All the skills discussed during the seminar was very helpful and it was a great way to be introduced to new resources and persons for help. However, it seemed unfair that it had to take place during our break period and the sessions were also very long, sometimes repetitive.",
    "The course could have been shortened to two days.",
    "strenths: provide lots of useful hints for professional development weakness: too short. I think this should not be only 3 days. Maybe this course is designed to give students a sense, and expect students to grow by their own later.",
    "This was not a good use of my time. I believe I could have gained more from it over the course of a few evening or lunch time sessions. The format was frustrating and the content felt sleazy.",
    "The professional skills seminar was a very useful means to evaluate and improve skills such as public speaking, professional presentation, and networking. The general course load of YSPH doesn't necessarily have strong focus on those skills, so it was really appreciated to have a time set aside specifically for that purpose. It probably could have been done effectively in two days instead of three.",
    "It could have been done in 2 days. It was too long, and there were too many breaks that were too long. It was timed terribly. People would really like it if it was Wednesday\/Thursday and you gave us Friday off.",
    "I exempted out of this course.",
    "A very useful workshop, that made me discover my assets and how to put them forwards.",
    "I thought certain components of the seminar were useful - practicing presentation and interview skills, working with voice coaches, and learning new techniques and strategies for self-presentation were all very useful. I also liked working in smaller peer groups. However, it would have been useful to have more feedback on our resumes\/CVs, which we were required to bring with us, but on which we never actually received any feedback or edits. Further, the scheduling of the course to overlap entirely with what is otherwise a vacation, was somewhat disruptive and felt as though it was replacing time that could have been used to de-stress. The intent of the course is great, I'm very glad to have gotten individualized coaching and am grateful for the opportunity to work on personal professional development, but I felt that the actual scheduling and execution of the course needs improvement.",
    "I outlined most of my responses in the required evaluation that was sent out earlier in the year, and the fact that we need to complete a course evaluation as well fits with most of the other things I had to say.",
    "It is a valuable skills development for those with little work experience. Five years should be required to take it before their MPH year as the internship search information session would have been very helpful for us. Overall, the program could be combined into two days and held on a weekend or Friday\/Saturday as it is very unfair to require students to stay for the seminar during their Fall break, especially first year students.",
    "The Professional Skills Seminar was very useful and forced me to actually prepare for the presentation and the mock interviews. However, I wish it was not 3 days long when we should have been getting out well-deserved break from classes. Because many of us were burnt out from class work, I felt like many of us weren't fully engaged and motivated as we would have liked to be.",
    "Incredibly helpful. If only we had spent just a little more time with the coaches...",
    "Helpful on the whole.",
    "I felt that is was a very strong experience. It was much more useful than I thought it would be. I did feel however that each dya could be shorter. Have the talking happen during lunch instead of an hour break and get out an hour earlier. a little too much down time. Since its over break it should take as little time as possible and cram as much in to feel worthwhile.",
    "Its really important information at a really awful time of year. Those of us who went were completely exhausted form the beginning of the semester. It really took a toll when the rest of our cohort had a break and we did not. I would urge the administrators to move the class to another time. The content was fine, but a bit vague. Some instructors were not interested in being there. I still don't know how to network or have any concrete information on how to address or follow up with professional contacts. Finally, I was frustrated that much of the advice was to \"come see Felicia,\" but she has been consistently unresponsive to emails.",
    "Although I was extremely tired going into this three day course, I found it to be very helpful and informative. It was an excellent way to practice speaking skills and learn about practical professional considerations, such as cover letters and networking. Strengths included training in public speaking with relevant feedback and evaluation, multiple practice rounds, the opportunity to learn more about other students' interests and experiences, and good connections were made with the office of career services. Weaknesses included no time to evaluate resumes, difficulty getting responses to emails in a timely manner, and not enough examples for good resumes and cover letters. Overall a great course though - the coaches and career services touched on many topics of interest.",
    "Overall, I really liked the professional skills seminar. Although I had enough work experience to exempt the course, I opted to take it anyway as a refresher for many skills that lay dormant. I think it was a very packed, somewhat exhausting schedule. There was a lot of information presented each day and not a lot of time built into the session to digest the information that was presented. For example, a longer break between the information on the elevator pitch and having to present it would have been useful. It would have been nice to have a few more breaks in the day to allow time to review information prior to the next presentation, especially since we often had time left over in the recording sessions. I think the presentation and elevator pitch sessions were the most useful, especially recording. The ability to watch our presentations was very useful in improving our skills.",
    "This seminar did not meet my expectations. I don't think I learned anything that I haven't already learned or could have easily looked up online. I thought there was going to be a resume workshop which would have been powerful (instead of just a powerpoint). The mock interviews were somewhat helpful but we didn't get much time or feedback from the professionals. Working with my peers was nice to get to know them but not very useful for feedback.",
    "I really appreciated the Professional Skills Seminar. I thought it had the potential to be really beneficial to our professional development. Some lectures were more beneficial than others - for example, I thought the \"personal brand\" lecture wasn't useful. I also thought that some of the coaches were not fully invested in the workshop. They didn't provide as much constructive criticism as I might have hoped. I also would have appreciated a resume critique.",
    "Some parts of the seminar were useful, but others felt less applicable or did not feel like the most efficient use of time. I liked the break-out sessions the most and found them to be the most useful. I wish there was a specific break out session for resume editing. It was useful to have the lecture about it, but I think that the time spent on that could have been cut down, and then more time applied to peer editing\/discussion of resumes. I also think that the course could be condensed into a two-day 9am-5pm sessions instead of the three-day course.",
    "I found the presentation improvement portion of the seminar to be the most helpful. The resume\/networking portion didn't really seem to add to my knowledge on the subject. If possible, it would be better to split the seminar over several Fridays rather than taking away our fall break for this. Many students were grumpy and came into the seminar with a negative attitude already, knowing that they could be on vacation instead. It could improve overall enthusiasm and increase participation if the seminar were held on non-vacation days.",
    "I didn't like that it was during fall break and some of the presentations were redundant.",
    "Even thought I had worked previously, I chose to take this course because I felt there would some new things I could learn. Some of the recommendations pertain to some people but not others. I felt that this seminar could have been completed over the course of 1 day as opposed to 3.",
    "It was difficult to enjoy this course with it taking up what would've been a fall break (right after midterms so a break felt much needed) and having to do some work to prepare for it while still taking midterm exams. However, I went into it with an open mind and got some good things out of it. I liked the small group setting for the break outs with fellow classmates and I liked that it was the same group because you can provide more constructive criticism with people you are comfortable with. I found the interview practice very helpful to hear a lot of different feedbacks. I liked the video recordings and learned a lot from watching myself. I also liked that the coaches rotates so we had different perspectives. My main complaint is that there was a lot of down time or extra time, especially after lunch, and I felt that it could have been condensed to two full days because of the extra time after activities. I didn't get as much out of the whole group presentations because they are not as interactive.",
    "Outstanding.",
    "Did not seem very professional."

The coaches give invaluable feedback on presentation, interview, and elevator pitches. Even for those who have worked, it is a useful seminar to brush up on skills you have or to develop skills you don't have.",
    "If you can exempt out of this, you should absolutely do so.",
    "This is a professional development seminar designed to improve public speaking and interview skills. I would recommend participating.",
    "A course that gets you thinking about how to present yourself professionally and provides feedback for areas to work on.",
    "It was helpful, but if you already have work experience and feel confident about your presentation\/public speaking\/professional skills, I would exempt out of it.",
    "Overall, the professional skills seminar was beneficial. The time when it was held didn't seem effective because we would not have been interviewing at that point. It might have also been useful to have had more student presentations.",
    "I think if you have no professional experience you can gain some helpful tips from this course."
