   "comments": [
    "Professors were very disorganized this year. The first few courses that were justice focused were the most interesting.",
    "It would have been helpful to have more lecture-based information on human rights treaties and basic arguments. The readings were really interesting and definitely were all new material for me.",
    "I liked the set up of the class, and do not think anything needs to be changed.",
    "I really enjoyed that this class was taught by professors in the field - their job deals with human rights issues just as the ones we speak about in class...",
    "The readings chosen for this class are very good, and I appreciated their depth and breadth of topic choices. It would be improved by having a smaller class size to encourage more discussion and greater ownership of the material.",
    "This was a very good course!",
    "i learned a lot in this class as i had never had the opportunity to analyze public health from the perspective of international human rights documents and treaties. the final paper was especially constructive. even though it was helpful to have students lead the discussions, sometimes i wanted to hear more from the instructors as they are the experts in the field.",
    "Strengths: Interesting topic, great readings, real-life expertise of lecturersWeaknesses: Attempts to create good sustainable conversations and debates mostly failed, not because of a lack of interest in the topics but because it didn't seem like things were brought up in an open thoughtful, thought-provoking way. Also, it's pretty clear where the professors stand on most issues which can make things a bit more difficult if you're coming from a different (perhaps more conservative perspective).",
    "The course was a little bit too unstructured at times, and it would have been nice to learn more about the experiences and opinions of the instructors, rather than primarily the opinions of classmates. Sometimes discussions got a bit repetitive or people were talking for the sake of talking, and at these times it would have been nice if the instructors more actively redirected discussions or contributed more of their own thoughts. They are very knowledgeable and experienced, and it would have been nice to benefit more from that. Some of the memorably good discussions that should be continued in future classes were the debate simulations, etc., that excited more people to contribute their ideas. Both",
    "Interesting material. Too focused on reproductive health. A little disjointed and disorganized. Best sessions were those run by students."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Michael Bochenek \u00a0excellent. best are both when lecturing togetherhe provided really helpful comments for my final paper.Marianne - she is also a great lecturer, but sometimes wants us to know all the human rights background without having introduced us to it. This is why some more initial lectures would have been helpful",
    "Instructor: Michael Bochenek \u00a0He was very good at engaging students in the discussions that we had each week. He was also a very good moderator, and able to extract points out of what we said.Marianne-She is very knowledgeable and smart. However, she was not as effective at eliciting responses from students.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bochenek \u00a0He often put class discussions back on the track of law and legal guidelines and perspectives - I thought he did a good job facilitating the class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bochenek \u00a0Michael Bochenek: Fair in discussions, listens to both sides of argumentsCo-instructor:Marianne Mollman is the worst person I've ever come across to teach a class at EPH. She is just not cut out to teach in any way whatsoever. Being an advocate that she is, her sole aim was to propound her views while throwing contrary views to the wind... or even mocking such views. Not least of all, is that she comes to classes without adequate preparations and totally expects us to fill in the lapses for her. She should never be allowed to teach at EPH again. Period.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bochenek \u00a0Michael was an excellent professor...insightful, well organized, and had a wealth of experience to share with the class!",
    "Instructor: Michael Bochenek \u00a0marianne and michael are smart and inspiring--it is refreshing to have instructors so active in the advocacy\/human rights\/policy world--the probing questions were helpful especially when we took the conversation off turn. towards the end i got the feeling that marianne was frustrated with us, but perhaps we were off on those occasions. all in all i am very happy i took the class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bochenek \u00a0Both Michael and Marianne should actively contribute more of their opinions and lead discussions more directly, rather than waiting for students to fill the silences. Sometimes, students had little of substance to say and both instructors are very approachable and possess a wealth of knowledge- it would be great if they shared this more and had a bit more of a lecture style rather than looking for constant student participation."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "i would recommend it to students interested in global health",
    "Yes, it is an incredibly interesting topic, that you are not really exposed to in other classes if you are EMD. It involves a lot of reading, but it is very interesting reading!",
    "Yes I would recommend the class. Students thinking about taking this course should know that this is a class is based on participation - it's a seminar course. This means that the class is structured on a discussions from the reading and comments from the class. That said, if there are no comments, it gets a little awkward just to be staring at each other when Marianna takes a breather.As someone who's not that familiar with human rights before coming into the class, it was hard for me to try to think of things to say during class, even though I might've done the readings. I thought the subject matters and reading materials we looked into during the semester were interesting and something I never would have researched myself outside of the class.",
    "With the way it is currently structured, I won't recommend it to any student",
    "This is a great class if you are truly interested in the material and are curious about its practical manifestations. The professors both focus on these issues in their professions, and their experiences are invaluable to the class discussions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student!",
    "in this class you will get the chance to examine public health issues from a human rights perspective, learning the core international human rights treaties and documents and how they might be applied in real world situations.",
    "This is a pretty self-directed class, so it can be pretty good if you do most of the readings and really engage in the topics; however, I wouldn't expect a really amazing in-class experience, and because the lecturers travel a lot and are not based at yale there is a lapse in organization.",
    "Overall, the subject matter for this course was very interesting and it provided good exposure to the field of human rights and its intersection with health. Discussions were sometimes a bit tedious, but Marianne and Michael are very interesting to listen to."
