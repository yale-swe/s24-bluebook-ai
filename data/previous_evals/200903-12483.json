    "Absolutely take it. The readings are so much fun, although they can take a fair amount of time. The class is structured so that people without much background in literature or feminism can follow and learn quite a bit about both subjects, and people who do have that background can help to make the conversation even more meaningful.",
    "First: This class needs a new title, because ''feminist fictions'' scares away most people, especially men. Which is too bad considering that this course is very interesting and would benefit from different perspectives. I took it CR\/D and was thankful that I did, because the readings were great but the discussions were not. So I mainly pleasure-read my way through. I would say that there are much more interesting courses that you can find at Yale than this one--and caution against it. The teaching was not to my taste, but maybe you would like it---definitely shop it first and then see what you think.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is one of the best courses I have taken here."
