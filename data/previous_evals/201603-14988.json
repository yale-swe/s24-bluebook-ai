    "Skills processing advanced material, exposure to what a \"hard\" question is in this particular realm of algebra (for example: no one knows how to compute u-invariants, in general). Very interesting, new take on a topic I had no idea was so rich.",
    "It's a neat subject, actually. Here I thought linear algebra was \"done\".",
    "I have learned many unimagined interesting facts about the general algebraic properties of quadratic forms and their relations to number theory.",
    "I found that my ability to work with new algebraic structures (quaternion algebras, Clifford algebras, etc) greatly increased, and I was able to work more readily with such structures even without having more concrete examples in mind. This is a skill I had not developed very far before.",
    "Quadratic forms, Witt Ring, etc."

   "comments": [
    "Due to some scheduling conflicts, there weren't quite as many meetings of the class as I would have liked (instead we met weekly for 2:15 hr at a time)",
    "Our professor is very knowledgeable, energetic,encouraging and humorous. He has conveyed the importance of the general algebraic theory of quadratic forms in the deepening of the understanding of field theory and number theory.",
    "I thought the material was well-organized and logically presented, and I found that most of the proofs were well-motivated. One of my favorite parts of the course were the historical asides and connections to other fields. I think this course could be much improved by having problem sets every so often, even if they were optional. As the topic is more specialized, it's hard to find problems to work to reinforce understanding of the material.",
    "Learning could probably have been improved with more psets, but it was a grad class, so fair enough."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I doubt it will be offered again anytime soon, but the material was really interesting. Some pretty crazy topics in algebra: the Witt and Grothendieck-Witt rings, Milnor K-theory, spin groups, beautiful material. A few glimpses at theorems we couldn't really go into, which was intimidating but par for the course in a graduate class.",
    "This is definitely a worthwhile course to take if one is interested in witnessing the vast amount of algebraic properties quadratic forms have that span a wide array of areas in mathematic such as field theory and number theory.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Interesting course, particularly for those interested in number theory.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. Asher Auel is a great professor and the material is super interesting."
