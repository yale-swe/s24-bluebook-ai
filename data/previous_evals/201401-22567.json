    "I would definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to read a lot of Latin in a short amount of time. You definitely feel accomplished after completing such a course.",
    "One of the best Latin classes I've ever sat in.",
    "Latin Survey II, like Latin Survey I, is as much Latin as you can fit in a single semester, but I do think we were able to have better and deeper discussions in this course, since there was a shared group of texts that the entire class had read. Latin Survey is an excellent way to get your Latin in gear and increase your exposure to many authors and some major themes across a large span of time.",
    "Classics 889 01 is intended to professionalize future scholars of Latin literature. It does an excellent job of doing so. I would recommend it to any professional."

   "comments": [
    "I have been introduced to many authors whom I previously knew tangentially. I'm really glad that I have so many texts under my proverbial belt.",
    "I enjoyed the class very much and felt that it prepared me for the Latin oral exam. Although the class moved very quickly (which is expected from a survey class) it was well-structured and there were many recurring themes that tied the entire semester's worth of material together.",
    "This course prepared me towards my well towards my oral and written Latin qualifying exams",
    "I am very pleased by the amount of new material and ideas I was introduced to by this course, as well as how I was able to deepen my pre-existing ideas about the topic. This course was certainly helpful in fleshing out my knowledge of the field that my dissertation will most likely be in, and I am sure that some of the ideas encountered in this course will show up again in my future research.",
    "This course introduced me to the profession, so it deepened my knowledge by 100%. Although the course does not directly contribute to my dissertation, my knowledge of Latin with directly impact my research and I know I will benefit from a knowledge of Classical literature for the rest of my career."
