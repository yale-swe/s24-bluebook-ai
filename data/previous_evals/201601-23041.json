    "I would recommend the course, more for the experience than for the material taught. Prof. Bloom has many interesting anecdotes and stories to tell, and during discussions, he spots the soundness and merit in every comment. A less intimidating course than one might expect.",

    "Classes like this are why you go to Yale.",
    "Not at all a typical course, but a fantastic opportunity to do some \"big\" thinking. This class is the kind of experience you will only have at this school, with this professor. Completely and utterly worth it. A year I will never forget.",
    "I would recommend this course--and have done so. It is marvelous."
