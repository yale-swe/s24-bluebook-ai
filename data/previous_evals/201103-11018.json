   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, though more for the reading list, as mentioned above, than for the benefits gained during class meetings. That is not to say class meetings were unhelpful, and the course format, with multiple choices for readings every week rather than everyone reading the same book, was interesting and allowed us to cover more ground. All in all, a very informative and interesting course.",
    "I would recommend this course for its ability to provide a good overview of the topic while at the same time allowing students to delve into subjects that interest them more particularly in their own papers.",
    "Very good course that, while maybe a bit loose in organization, offered really good treatment of important topics relating to the Medieval Church. I would recommend this course to another History grad student working on Medieval or Early Modern history.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I felt that I learned a great deal about various facets of Church History, and that the structure of the course was helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Great review of some themes\/events which I've heard of before, and lots of new information - I felt students got to read a lot of the books that are on everyone's reading list in this area of study, but that we can't always get to given other requirements. The course provided many points of reference which can be returned to in the future and explored more deeply.",
    "This course is not so relevant to my dissertation\/research, but it did give me solid background for a period slightly before my own.",
    "Church history is an extremely important aspect of the medieval world, and having a stronger background in this will be very useful as I continue in my studies.",
    "This course went into specific detail on many issues surrounding the Western Church which had eluded me for some time. Understanding relationships between bishops and chapters, papal oversight, and the development of theological disputes is invaluable to my dissertation research on the counter-reformation."
