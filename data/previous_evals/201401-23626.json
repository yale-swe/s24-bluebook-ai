    "I have really mixed feelings about this class. In terms of the good: I LOVED having class with Leslie Curry, who was so tweet, and the TAs were amazing. The guest speakers were great across-the-board, and it was so incredible to get to interact with them in a small-group setting. For the bad: I really don't think I learned anything in this class, and the assignments sucked. The group project was a particularly brutal experience, though I guess I learned something about team dynamics in the process. I feel like I'm leaving this class with a vague knowledge of what some research methods are, but no ability to design a study and match methods to aims.",
    "This class is really fun and you will learn a lot from it. It is very interactive and Professor Curry is great at getting discussions going in the class. The class will teach you a lot about how to find gaps in evidence and how to fill them with evidence. It is a great survey class of methods in global health research from the formation of the question to the different ways to collect and analyze data. It is also great to be in a mixed class of under grad and grad students. As an undergrad, I learned a lot from everyone in the class, not just Professor Curry. The diversity makes it a lot of fun, especially when it comes time for the oral presentations!",
    "It's ok. Professor Curry is great, and I wish we had learned more about her experience working with stakeholders to get evidence into policy change. You will learn how to write a research proposal after some struggling. The group project is absurd-- a lot of stress but not a lot of learning. If you want to do a group project and actually learn a lot, then just do the Global Health Case Competition.",
    "An interesting course although it could have included more real-world examples of how things actually work. The largest criticism I would have would be the decentralization of information pertaining to assignments. The main idea would be clear but the components to comprise the completed project would often be ambiguous. If you're interested in mixed methods theory, take it.",
    "A good intro on the complexities and challenges that are present if one is contemplating performing research in a global health context.",
    "Students that have some research experience should take this course as most of the content came from individuals doing work on the ground. I also think students need to be screened before they are given permission to take the course."
