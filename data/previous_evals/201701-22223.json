    "Despite the title of the course, the course covers more than just quantum optics; in addition, it also covers quantum dynamics with the master equation and input-output theory as well as applications to cavity QED, circuit QED, optomechanical systems, and more. I developed my ability to follow current research topics in quantum optics and information that I would not otherwise have gotten from only the first year required physics courses.",
    "I learned a substantial amount about quantization of the EM field, semi-classical physics, Atom-field interactions, optomechanics etc. I also worked on my presentation skills in doing the final project.",
    "This is a very well structured course and provides a great overview of Quantum optics",
    "Basic theory on quantum optics and its application on cutting edge research"

   "comments": [
    "It was unfortunate we only met once a week so the material wasn't always fresh on my mind, but the course was great.",
    "There is no weakness for the course.",
    "Both the instructor and the TA did an outstanding job helping students to learn the material. The went above and beyond to help answer any questions, staying after class, answering emails, and meeting whenever possible. The homework was also very well formatted. Difficult, but attainable. Overall, I thought this course was fantastic! Only two negatives: 1) having a 2.5 hr session instead of 2x 1.25hr sessions was certainly difficult. While the instructor was very good about being engaging, it is hard to digest all that information in one sitting. 2) Each student was allotted 15min to present their final project. However, the majority of students took well over 20min. Additionally, students were allowed to leave so that going over time didn't hold any consequences for them. Perhaps a solution would be to make attendance as part of the grade.",
    "As a student, I learn material better in courses with exams, as they force me to internalize the material in a way that homework and presentations do not. So while it was nice not having to worry about exams, I think I would have come away with a better understanding of the material if there had been an exam\/midterm."

    "If the course was the exact same, yes I would recommend to another student. However, I feel like much of the success of the course was due to the instructor and TA. Under different circumstances, I can see how this class might become overwhelming."
