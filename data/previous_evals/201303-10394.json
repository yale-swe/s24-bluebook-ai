   "comments": [
    "If you don't mind doing a lot of reading, then yes, take it. I absolutely loved the novels, and learning about the cultural context was very interesting to me.",
    "Great course, but it was awkward as a lecture because there were so few students. The Idiot was the least interesting book, but other than that great material. The class is structured fairly and well.",
    "This was a great class! It's really interesting and immerses you in Dostoevsky's work. Professor Brunson is a wonderful teacher. Of course, just be prepared for a lot of reading, although the written assignments are not too overwhelming.",
    "Professor Brunson is awesome. Dostoevsky is awesome. Why wouldn't you take this course?",
    "Highly, highly recommend. Great lecture, fun papers, great books. Oh, but be aware that in order to get anything out of this class you MUST do the reading. You don't necessarily have to do it in sync with the assigned pages (although you'll get more out of lectures\/sections that way), but if you're not planning on finishing most\/all of it there's no point in taking the class. It's a lot, but it's fun-- it's not heavy theory, etc."
