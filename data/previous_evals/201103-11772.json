    "Be prepared to do a lot of work and keep up to date, but it is very possible to succeed if you put the work in and stay on top of everything.",
    "My french grammatical, reading, and writing skills improved tremendously in this class.",
    "Yes. It's a good program.",
    "Great class, especially with Ngame. You learn a lot very quickly without even realizing it. This has been my favorite class of the semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student at all interested in learning French. Ngame is very patient and understand, plus the workload is not too heavy. Resist the urge to skip doing the workbook though; the exercises are actually very useful for grammar.",
    "Ngame is a very good professor, but this course will be difficult if you come with only a year of standard high school french. As this is the second half of the French in Action program, it makes a lot of assumptions about your prior french knowledge.",
    "I would strongly recommend the class to someone who is looking to improve their French language skills both in vocabulary and grammar. The class also greatly increased my confidence in speaking.",
    "An excellent course where you learn the french language and culture from around the world and are taught how to communicate effectively in common everyday situations.",
    "Good course with a steady pace in terms of workload. Lots of grammar but not enough oral practice. Not really an immersive course."
