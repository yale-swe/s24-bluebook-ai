    "I would recommend taking this class if you're interested in a general overview of biomedical imaging. It isn't too difficult, there is almost no \"actual\" math involved past a few simple plug and chug equations, but there are a lot of concepts that become important. You should have some minimal understanding of fourier theory and concepts of resolution\/contrast\/etc., but nothing too much because it is taught. Overall an enjoyable class, although some of the guest lectures are way too in-detail and just go over your head.",
    "This course is pretty interesting if you're into imaging. It's mostly conceptual, very little math involved and whatever math was done was basic algebra. We did have to memorize some equations for the exams though which is just annoying. He provides you with the previous year's midterm and final exams and the ones we took this year matched the types of questions from previous years pretty well, so nothing was too surprising on the exams. The final was noncumulative and there was 1 short paper (1-2 pages) and 1 long paper (8-10 pages), not much work at all. There is a deceptively large amount of information to remember for each exam, though. Overall, a solid class.",
    "There were 2 papers (a 1-2 page one and an 8-10 page one), a midterm, and a final. The course wasn't too hard, but also not all that interesting. You pretty much just have lectures every class, no external readings. It wasn't that great to me, but I guess if you want to learn about imaging modalities, then this is a good general info class.",
