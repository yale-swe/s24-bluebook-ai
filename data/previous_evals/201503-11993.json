    "Wonderful class with a wonderful professor; I'd absolutely recommend it. If you've ever taken one of Stephen Latham's lectures, this is basically that in a seminar room with 20 people. He's one of if not the best professor I've had here at Yale - he's incredibly knowledgeable about bioethics, possibly more than any other professor here on campus, and if you get into this class you must take it. Two assignments throughout the semester, one midterm paper, about ten pages, and one final paper, twenty pages, involving anything to do with bioethics. Other than that, only reading and discussing readings in class. Gem of a class, absolutely worth taking, one of the best professors around.",
    "A survey of different topics in bioethics. Would definitely recommend- light class, reading basically optional, and you'll learn a lot. Go in knowing it's hardly a seminar, though. If you've taken his lectures, it might be receptive; law isn't in the title, but we always go through the bioethics laws, too.",
    "yes",
    "This class is pretty great if you're interested in learning anything more about bioethics. Professor Latham is fantastic and class was always riveting. Perhaps it wasn't the most \"seminar\" like seminar I've taken, but it definitely was my favorite. If you can get into this class (It's not easy) take it! It's great.",
    "Many people don't like this class because it is more like a lecture than a seminar. This is precisely why I liked it! If you are also sick of fellow undergrads spewing BS 90% of the time, this is the class for you. It's also annoying that a lot of people don't pay attention. Don't mind them! Engage with the material, and the professor. You will get a ton out of it.",
    "Recommended if you are going to put in the work, i.e. actually do the reading and engage with your classmates. Latham knows he's a much better lecturer than seminar leader (and said as much in the first class meeting); consequently, seminar usually devolved into lecture because people were silent and hadn't done any reading. This was supremely frustrating because these are fascinating topics - abortion, vaccination, human experimentation, surrogacy. Please only take this class if you're going to make the most of it; otherwise, your desire for a chill senior seminar will unfairly steal a spot from the dozens of shoppers\/underclassmen who want to take the class on its own merits. That said: contemporary topics in bioethics, with an occasional foray into health policy and politics. Midterm paper, final paper, participation. If you have taken one of Latham's lectures, expect some repetition of material.",
    "Yes, I would take the class. Professor Latham is knowledgeable, clear, and reasonable. The seminars are interesting and well-led.",
    "Interesting reading material, but wasn't a very engaging seminar. Part of the issue was that only a few people in the class participated at all, so discussions were not very lively, and this could change year to year. Professor Latham provides strong feedback on papers and is a wonderful professor, but a much stronger lecturer than seminar leader (which he himself started off the class admitting)."
