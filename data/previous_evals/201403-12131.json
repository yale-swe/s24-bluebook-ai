    "It is a wonderful class and a really fun way to spend time with children! I would definitely take this class if you are interested in being a teacher, or are genuinely interested in what high quality early childhood education looks like.",
    "I would recommend it if you really like kids and enjoy working with them, because the observation was my favorite part. If you don't enjoy that, then I don't think the seminar component alone is enough to take this class.",
    "This course is a big time commitment that's totally worth it. There's the two hour seminar, 2-3 hours observing in the day care once a week, plus the trek to and from Calvin Hill for class and for observations, which eats up a lot of time. The workload is heavy but not hard: a lot of reading, nine journal entries, and a 10-15 page final paper. What makes this class the best are the hours spent watching these children. I learned so much just from seeing the way they approach the world and they also brought joy to my week. The class discussion is interesting. Carla has been working in early childhood education for many years now and it can feel a bit like her bestowing wisdom upon the class instead of a discussion. Which isn't to say she's wrong about anything just that one should enter the class expecting to learn from an expert in a discussion format. But really those kids are what make this class the best.",
    "If you have an interest in education at all (not even specifically childhood education) this is a class worth taking, as you end up discussing aspects of the education system applicable to all levels. As others have recommended, try to do your observations earlier in the day, before nap. You can learn a lot during the children's outdoor play at the end of the day, but during the weeks where you discuss math and science, for example, you would benefit from the more organized daytime activities.",
    "Early childhood education with Prof. Horwitz is an incredible opportunity to get to spend a semester playing with and getting to know a class of three year olds and watching them grow. Every week you go to Calvin Hill, which is a 20 min walk up science hill, and observe (and then interact with) a classroom of around 20 preschoolers for around three hours. The observation is by far the best part of the class, and it itself should be enough to make you want to take the class (the kids are the best, and you learn so much just from being with them). Unfortunately, the seminar itself isn't great. Professor Horwitz talked for most of the class, and talked not about interesting issues around childhood development or policy, but mostly assorted anecdotes about Calvin Hill, and vague\/general thoughts on the issues from that week's reading. She would ask us broad questions that you could answer without doing the reading, instead of engaging us in any sort of interesting conversation. The weekly observations were a highlight of my week, and made the class more than worth it, though -- so expect to get a ton out of being able to do the observation, but not so much out of the seminar itself.",
    "PSYC 127 is an amazing class if you are at all interested in the education of young children. The best part of the class is the observations you do at the Calvin Hill Daycare Center. The kids are absolutely adorable and it is a fun way to spend 2-3 hours each week. However, I will say that the class is somewhat time consuming because you have the actual seminar which is about 2 hours each week and then you also have to find time for the 2-3 hour observations. Also, both the seminar and observations are at Calvin Hill, which is way up past science hill, past the divinity school, so it would probably take over half an hour if you wanted to walk. Luckily the blue line shuttle stops right by Calvin Hill, although sometimes the shuttle times don't match up great with the class time. There is quite a bit of reading each week, but a lot of it is repetitive, so you can just skim some of the articles. You are also asked to keep journals for each observation, which are actually pretty fun to write, but take more time than you'd think so don't leave them till the last minute. At the end there is a 10-15 page paper, but you have a lot of flexibility in the topic so it's not too bad. Professor Horwitz is super knowledgeable in her field, and is very kind and funny in her own unique way. I would highly recommend the class, especially to psychology majors.",
    "If you are at all interested in working with children in the future, you need to take this class. It is reasonable on the workload, the readings are easy and fun, and the only significant time commitment are 9 journal entries (3-5 pages), 1 final paper (10-15 pages), and a weekly observation (significant amount of time spent getting to Calvin Hill). But overall, completely and totally worth it for anyone, and especially someone interested in ECE or planning to have children at any time.",
    "You learn a lot about practices in the early childhood education system. Working with the children during the observation part is fun. Keep in mind that you will have to travel near east rock at least twice a week. That is where the Daycare center is located. The professor is very knowledgeable and has many years of experience in the education field. But she tends to only stick to her views and beliefs, so don't expect this course to be entirely well rounded in diversity of views. The professor also says that she does not easily give out As, and it is hard for a student to receive an A in her course. Yet she doesn't give out guidelines of what she precisely expects and her grading seems arbitrary. I suggest you communicate with the professor many times throughout the semester so that you know exactly what she wants or expects from your work. Other than that, this course will challenge your preconceived notions about the early childhood education system, and it is worth taking."
