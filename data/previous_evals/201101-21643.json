    "Very good class that teaches you a lot about biomedical microtechnology. Not too much work as long as one goes to lecture and a great professor. One only really needs a intro bio class to benefit from this class. I would recommend it!",
    "Interesting material, not very stressful.",
    "Exactly what the course title says. Good class if you're interested in kind of an overview of various micro- and nanotechnologies being developed with an emphasis on their applications to biomedicine. Prof. Fan is very nice and enthusiastic about his subject. No homework, just a midterm, final project and two lab sessions so not a huge time commitment."
