    "My Chinese, both oral and written, has improved greatly. I came in knowing maybe 50-100 characters and now know how to write 400-500. I really enjoyed writing the essays every few weeks and seeing the improvement in my sentence structure and vocabulary.",
    "This class taught an incredible amount of chinese for heritage learners (students who are chiense but never learned to read nor write).",
    "I went from barely being able to read and write Chinese to mastering several hundred characters. I also learned a lot about Chinese grammar and pronunciation, significantly improving my skills in speaking and writing in coherent paragraphs.",
    "I improved my skills with written and spoken Chinese.",
    "Developed my reading and writing proficiency in Mandarin.",
    "A intermediate Chinese class with a heavy emphasis on vocabulary building. Less emphasis on fluency than the non-heritage track: it is assumed that most students are fairly fluent. Vocabulary dealt generally with transport, finance, and travel, with diversions into culture and history."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "A big strength of the course is teaching us hundreds of characters through the semester without it being overwhelming. At first, I hated that there were daily quizzes, but I really think they help us remember all the characters. One weakness was repeating the grammar\/vocabulary structures every day. It got boring, and I think we could have done more discussion instead. Towards the end of the semester, there was more discussion, which I really enjoyed.",
    "Really helps and focuses on all areas of language acquisition. Would be helpful to have stronger feedback on pronunciation within class, greater emphasis on creating sentences from scratch in class as opposed to following the teacher, and to have more feedback around principles on which to improve grammar on homework\/essays.",
    "The course was really wonderful. I think the teaching staff are all amazingthey really care about the students and do a great job of being encouraging and supportive. Although keeping up with the course load can be difficult at times, everyone seems very motivated and diligent.",
    "I enjoyed the emphasis on immersion for learning, speaking Chinese entirely in class. However, I didn't like the constant grammar drills as much because I felt like without an actual context to use it in, I quickly forgot a lot of what we had learned."

   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend this course; you learn a lot of Chinese and it's not very stressful. I didn't have to work more than an hour each day for this class, except for nights before unit exams\/essays. This Chinese learning experience has been much more enjoyable than Saturday Chinese school. This was my favorite class this semester (fall of freshman year), and I think it had to do with having two engaging teachers that really cared about the students.",
    "If you intend to learn Chinese and use it practically then definitely. If you want a chill class then this is a bad idea.",
    "If you had a bit of a background in Chinese and want to actually take it up, there's no better place or time to do it. The teachers are incredibly engaging and create a warm class environment which forces you to step out of your comfort zone and develop the language skills you need.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any heritage learners who want to improve their Chinese skills. This course is particularly helpful for students who have not learned Chinese in a formal setting before and instead have mainly learned Chinese through interacting with family members, such that their knowledge of Chinese characters might be minimal and their grammar\/pronunciation might be a bit off. The teachers and tutor are really wonderful, and the course materials really help you get a grasp of useful characters and grammar patterns. I was amazed at how much more fluent I felt in Chinese after taking this course.",
    "This is a wonderful course for heritage speakers that are really dedicated to learning and improving their Chinese. However, at least for me, I feel like it's hard to see much improvement without using it outside of class as well, or doing a summer program such as Light.",
    "Absolutely! Although this was a higher level language course for me, the teachers were excellent and made sure that I did not feel intimidated despite my lower proficiency in Mandarin in comparison to other students.",
    "A good class. Workload tends to be on the higher end of things (expect 1.5 hrs a day as a baseline), but is ultimately manageable. Class is straightforward and does a good job of reinforcing vocabulary and concepts."
