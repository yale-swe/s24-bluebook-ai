I would say the workload is pretty heavy, but it provides a solid foundation to continue studying the language during your time at Yale.",
    "Absolutely - if you're interested in learning Portuguese, it's a great course.",

    "Anyone interested in learning Portuguese--absolutely. You will never have a better opportunity to learn the language (aside from going to Brazil, I suspect)."
