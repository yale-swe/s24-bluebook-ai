    "This has been said in prior reviews of the course, but the course is incredibly poorly constructed considering the nature of the material. The professors have a strange power dynamic and can't co-teach, or be in the room at the same time, which is unprofessional in itself and begs the question as to why the university can't hire a single professor to teach this material coherently. Borak teaches in the beginning of the semester, Cheryl writes and grades the test, despite not being in class while Borak is teaching. To the mass frustration of the class, Borak never described what was on the test, and we did not do well, then Cheryl returned to class at the end of the semester asking us why we did so poorly. Assignments include powerpoints and powerpoints and powerpoints, with limited direction, ex. \"Present on the precautionary principle using these 4 readings\" and that presentation will be the same for all the groups. It's redundant. And at the end, either Cheryl or Borak (whoever has shown up that week) will say that they wanted more opinion or discussion in your powerpoint.... something that was never stated in the assignment description. Having multiple groups present on the same thing is not a fruitful use of class time. The profs seem more interested in having students share opinions and debate during class time than having them learn key facets of the risk assessment, read case studies etc. Tests are memorization based, which wouldn't be a problem if they told you what the tests would be on or that they expect you to use the EXACT same phrasing used in the study guide. Cheryl and Borak seem focused on proving their knowledge and reinforcing that they're relatable (sitting on desks, legs on chairs) than actually teaching. They fully believe that Risk Assessment is a discussion and a debate... I just don't think that's what any of the kids desire from the course. Assign a writing piece where a student can answer both sides. Why everything needs to be an oral debate or discussion while in class seems unusual.",
    "Good course",
    "The concepts involved in risk assessment are very challenging. The course is difficult at first because of this, but by the end you come away with a much better understanding of what risk assessment is and how it is done."

    "Instructor: Cheryl Fields \u00a0I found Ms. Fields patronizing and incredibly informal, at best. She continuously uses the approach of \"Do you guys know what X is? No?\" to teach. But it's not once or twice in a class for difficult topics.... It's for every little thing. She responds to silence as an assumption that the class is not comprehending, rather than it being a 9 person, 2 hour long class and there's only so much acknowledging that can go on. Furthermore, her answers to these rhetorical (?- with the frequency she questions you would assume they're rhetorical but she seems to think students are dumb if they don't respond so who really knows?) questions are never in depth and sometimes just plain inaccurate. If she would just stick to slides and keep focused (same goes for Borak) the class would be immeasurably improved. Other kids might enjoy her tone and over-explanation of basic topics, I did not. I thought she was very knowledgeable and could have been a stronger professor than Borak if her attention was more directed and less focused on calling students out for looking confused or being silent.",

    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Sort of rambles on. Clearly has a valuable background in the field but his teaching is not focused in any way.",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Very knowledgeable and responsive",
    "Instructor: Jonathan Borak \u00a0Excellent. Really glad I had the opportunity to study with him. He is a true expert."
