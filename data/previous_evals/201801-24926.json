    "I really liked the organization of this course and the way Lynne emphasizes skepticism and critical thinking.",
    "I learned to think about the information we obtain from the literature and to judge whether it is credible or lacking.",
    "I found this course very useful for establishing reference points which will allow me to self-check my own data in a biological context. In addition, every class was fun. I think the small class size contributed to this.",
    "Learned about many techniques that could be used in my research, information availability, and knowledge about my own 'thesis' project",
    "This course taught me how to really think critically about the data I am presented with and how strong it really is. It also taught me weaknesses in certain methods to look out for."

    "Wish it was a semester course!",
    "This course could easily become a full term course as it felt like much more could be covered than what is possible for a half term course. It is a good course that was not rushed nor condensed with too much information. It had a very natural progression for the type of questions being sought.",
    "I wanted to learn more about the biology of macromolecular interactions but i t felt like we spent a lot of time talking about ways to measure and observe the interactions.",
    "small class size led to great discussions and group projects. The lack of exams allowed for a better focus and general understanding rather than cramming and memorizing little details."

    "Yes! I loved it. Maybe out of personal interest and the class size was small which facilitated better interactions, but still very good.",
    "Yes. The approach to this class is flexible and can cover topics of interest to the current group in the class.",
    "Absolutely",
    "YES. Solid course, 10\/10 would take again. Learned so many valuable techniques and resources that have continued to help with my research.",
    "Definitely. The small class size really allows you to engage with both the professor, TA, and other classmates. I believe this is a course that will teach you valuable skills that can be applied in a research career."
