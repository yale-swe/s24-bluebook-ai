   "comments": [
    "This was a really cool seminar that taught me a lot about research and data presentation. I'd recommend having taken a course on China before this so you're not behind in discussion, but there's definitely a lot of new material here for anyone. Professor Davis is reallynice and a great seminar leader who knows so much about the subject matter. She's usually clear about expectations but not always clear about grading. The discussion sections are kind of a drag if you're not a native speaker, but are a nice idea and an easy grade boost. The final paper is a pretty intense undertaking, but there are good stepping stones on the way. A very solid seminar.",
    "This class is challenging, but I thought it was worth it. Deborah Davis is an amazing resource, and it's rare to have a professor who is so knowledgable about so many aspects of Chinese society. There is quite a lot of reading (as is to be expected in an upper-level seminar), but the papers could be quite technical and Davis really pushes you to approach the questions of the class in a rigorous way. Thus, if you're really not a quantitative person, you might struggle with some aspects of the class.",
    "More work than anticipated. Very interesting material though.",
    "I would recommend the course. You learn a lot.",
    "I think that this class is good for people who are really interested in studying China and who already have a strong background in the social sciences. Otherwise, I think you might want to take some other intro classes first.",
    "Really good course. Prof. Davis is a great teacher: she really tries to get you to learn how social science is done. And she also has just so much energy and commitment for working with her students. She responded to one email query when I hit a roadblock in an assignment and didn't know how to proceed -- it was such a thorough and engaged response that it really left an impression on me.",
    "This class is not for the faint of heart. Professor Davis is very particular about teaching the METHODOLOGY of sociological research, and she tends to be very quantitative. This is NOT a bullshit class. You will be challenged in class and in your work on a regular basis.If you only have a passing interest in modern China, you might want to take another class - there's a CHINESE section (all in Chinese) and Davis will assume that you know pretty much the basic facts about China already (modern history, social makeup, etc.). This is not a beginner level course.That said, it's a fantastic class that will actually teach you something concrete and useful about China and about sociology, and given the lack of quality classes on contemporary China at Yale, this is a must take if you are indeed interested in really understanding today's China.",
    "I loved the course! Especially for those with a firm interest in China, this seminar is perfect for getting a pretty good overview of modern disparities that exist in China. The topics range from healthcare to gender equality to political engagement, so there's really something for people with a wide range of backgrounds. This is, however, very much a sociology course, so expect a lot of data and statistical evidence presented in the course of the class. For someone without any background in quantitative analysis, the material might be a little hard to digest at first. The good news, however, is that we are NOT expected to know how to do quantitative analysis - in fact, you can get by this class completely fine without any background in it.A lot of the readings were very engaging.",
    "This class was a lot more data and economics based than I anticipated, with a fair number of dense and technical readings. I was expecting a more anthropology-oriented class, although we did have several pretty interesting anthro readings. I definitely have a better grasp of working with data, especially after our twoexcel exercises, but despite my interest in modern China, I can't say I especially enjoyed this class. But Professor Davis is really brilliant and asked a lot of tough and thought-provoking questions in class, and I'm glad I got to take a class with her. I also gained a much better understanding of the various dimensions of inequality in contemporary China, from gender to health care to education."
