   "comments": [
    "This course broadened my understanding of Art Historical discourse and the ways in which it has been incredibly limited in scope. I now have a new and deeper understanding of the objects I used on a daily basis and their rich histories.",
    "Thinking critically about objects",
    "This course helps you build a vocabulary for describing decorative arts. It also provides a framework to understand what various objects are made of, how these production processes work, and the history behind various pieces. You also learn about trade and commerce.",
    "I developed a knowledge of looking at the objects surrounding us in the world. Rather than just looking and taking the object for granted, I learned how objects were made, their purposes, trade networks, and the different takes on decoration of the same object throughout the world.",
    "This class taught me so much about the material world that surrounds me. It changed how I think about daily objects, their manufacturing, and the reason behind their design. This class also caused me to adjust how I think about industrialization, trade networks, and aesthetic influences. I learned a lot about materials, but also about materials and their geographical significance. Such a wonderful class.",
    "Engaging with objects in my environment in different ways; thinking of objects\/material goods in different ways; learning history that I hadn't known before; learning about the fallacy in certain ways of thinking (e.g. privileging print\/visual art)",
    "This course gave me a new appreciation for the decorative arts, especially everyday objects and their cultural value. Studying the processes and techniques involved in creating utilitarian objects has also provided me with an artistic literacy that has definitely enriched my own experience in the material world.",
    "Through this course, I was given into objects and materials that I encounter on a daily basis. Everything from tableware, to bedding to furniture have played integral roles in human culture and relationships throughout history, and these roles are often overlooked. I was able to explore the origins of certain techniques, material development and the evolution of decorative arts over time. This is an incredibly approachable art history course for anyone who, like me, has never taken any art history before. For those who remain skeptical about the importance of art history, this course gives applicable uses for understanding the origin of everyday objects all around us.",
    "This course is great to get a general interview of materials used in decorative arts as well as the origins of decorative pieces.",
    "Lots of insight into how decorative arts around you are made, and their importance.",
    "I learned about a wide variety of materials and techniques used in the creation of various art forms, as well as the theoretical background and historical development of material culture.",
    "Knowledge of how to look at objects in a critical and descriptive way."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the course lies a bit too heavily on morphological similarities between objects and underplays the social structures behind them. Those structures are certainly acknowledged, but not dealt with in any rigorous way. The course really successfully developed my understanding of the development of material objects and the global nature of material culture.",
    "Strengths: Lectures were put together quite well; object study room portion of the course allowed us to apply what we learned in lecture to real objects Weaknesses: I wish that we had spent more time in the actual art gallery than the study room. Of course it was great to be able to handle such precious objects, as we normally couldn't have were they displayed, but still-- sitting in a plain white room for an hour became tedious eventually.",
    "Strengths: videos provided, the labels pushed you to develop your ability to describe pieces and chose the important information, it was great to handle and further discuss objects in section. Section was great at reiterating content discussed in class. Weaknesses: memorizing dates and other tombstone info for the exams can be tedious and not retained over time.",
    "The class is very interesting. I was hesitant to take the course at first because I was not sure what it was going to be about, however I am so glad that I did. Professor Cooke is an amazing lecturer which kept me engaged during class. Also, the sections were awesome because we were able to interact with the objects that we were discussing in class.",
    "This class is taught by an incredibly engaging and knowledgeable professor. I was never bored during lecture and looked forward to sections. It was wonderful to be able to go to the gallery and handle objects since this allowed me a much more thorough appreciation for the objects discussed in lecture. Professor Cooke cares deeply about the material he presents and puts a really thoughtful and nuanced spin on what could otherwise be a fairly dry topic. A great class! The only weakness that I could think of would be that all of the written work is stacked during the second half of the semester. I would have preferred to have it more evenly spread out across the semester.",
    "I thought this course was extremely well organized and engaging. The lectures were brilliant and the opportunity to handle objects from the Yale Art Gallery Collection was truly exceptional.",
    "By far the greatest strength of this course was the ability to go into the Yale Art Gallery and work with materials and objects hands on. As Professor Cooke repeated again and again, the ability to touch an object with your own hands, to feel its weight, to understand its texture, to gain knowledge of its ins and outs, is invaluable. I found the weakest portions of the class to be the readings. I didn't find them to be very approachable, especially as someone with no prior art history experience. I think if the readers were shorter and more straightforward, more students would gain better understandings of the course materials.",
    "The professor was amazing. Great and engaging lecturer. The only drawback were the tests, which were based on sheer memorization.",
    "The lectures were really fantastic and provided a wealth of information. The writing assignments were particularly beneficial; while they were short in length, the demand for concision certainly improved my writing ability."

   "comments": [
    "Don't be fooled-- although the workload throughout most of the semester was minimal, once the midterm and final hit, you have to memorize A LOT. About 50 slides' worth of objects for the midterm-- date, place of manufacture, materials, etc. The museum labels were not too bad, but tedious because there was a 150 word limit.",
    "It's a fun intro course and the labels assignment teach you to write concisely.",
    "It is interesting. Workload is not too tough, though there are small assignments fairly often (4 labels throughout the semester, a catalog entry, midterm, and final). Spends a lot of time discussing objects from ancient history all the way up to the 17th-19th centuries. Spends less time on modern objects. The last week was plastics and some furniture examples.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in the material world. It is an interesting and different look on history.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to everyone, whether they are a liberal arts inclined person, or not! This class was so wonderful.",
    "YES TAKE IT! It's a wonderful opportunity to learn about things never usually mentioned in an art history course. Professor Cooke is an incredibly engaging lecturer and very clear. This was a lecture I looked forward to attending.",
    "Absolutely! I left with a different perspective on my world.",
    "If you are interested in a 'traditional' survey of the history of (Western) art, this is not that survey--and it isn't designed to be. With that disclaimer in mind, HSAR 110 is a worthwhile foray 'off the beaten path' and into the world of material culture. You'll learn a LOT about objects, and find many\/most of your assumptions about the things we use every day challenged.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Professor Cooke is an incredible lecturer, and the course provides valuable insights regarding the material world and its construction. Take this course if you are interested in art history, cultural exchange, and true craftsmanship. It will definitely change the way you see the objects and materials that make up world around you.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to anyone even remotely interested in Art History. Professor Cooke's passion for his students and course is clear, making this course well worth the time. The opportunity to experience materials discussed during lecture hands on in section is critical to learning in this course. It is also an opportunity unique to Yale though its incredible collections.",
    "Yes!!!!!",
    "This is a great class to get exposure to art history, even if your major is completely different. Not a lot of work, interesting, and you learn a lot",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in decorative arts!",
    "Decorative Arts provides a wealth of knowledge that is rarely considered in the discipline of art history. The course has quite a bit of technical information, but that becomes necessary in the theoretical discussions in the second semester. Most importantly, engaging with the objects directly is a truly amazing opportunity that we are privileged to have at Yale!!",
    "Yes, although I don't plan to become an Art History major, this class was very interesting and well worth it.",
    "YES! Take it, take it, take it! You learn SO much and Professor Cooke is INCREDIBLE!",
    "Absolutely. This was a great introductory class. Section in the YUAG was definitely a highlight.",
    "Absolutely, the course was well-organized and accessible to students of all levels of knowledge."
