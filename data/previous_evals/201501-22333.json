    "An excellent capstone course for Art History majors. Discussion was incredible and really what made the class. Prof. James did en excellent job of guiding our conversation without dominating it. Basically, each week you get to spend two hours discussing critical art theory with a small group of highly intelligent peers who share your passion for art. Class meetings were typically split between discussion in Loria and then viewing artworks in person at the YUAG. Beware, the workload is very heavy, as is expected for this high-level of a course: long, dense readings (mostly on critical art historical theory), five weekly response papers, two larger papers, two in-class presentations, and a major final paper. Be prepared for the course to take up a lot of your time! But you absolutely get out of it all of the work that you put in, and more besides. This course definitely solidified my passion for the field of art, and greatly expanded the scope of my knowledge in this area. Highly recommended!",
    "You won't learn a ton--it would be nice if Jackie Jung or Diana Kleiner taught this class--I'm sure it would be WAY different, way more structured, and you would learn a ton. Unfortunately, methods seems to be a class nobody wants to teach, so they take turns \"suffering.\"",
    "Take it with Prof. James. She's a gem down to earth and easy to talk with. Readings can get dull, but the fun ones far outweigh the terrible ones! Papers\/assignments are manageable, flexible, and fun.",
    "This is a great course for students interested in art and who are willing to put in the time necessary to read the course materials and write responses.",
    "HSAR 201 is a great introduction to the methodology used in history of art. It is an intensive writing course which also requires a lot of reading. It will eventually change the way you think about history of art, museums and other institutions related to art."
