    "Policing in America is one of the best classes that I have taken during my time at Yale. I wish the class lasted the entire year because Chief Esserman has such a nuanced, robust view of the field. If everyone at Yale could take the course, I would definitely make it a required class. Chief Esserman really cares about his students and wants to do everything that he can to \"leave it all out on the field.\" Personally, as a Black man, I appreciated how open and honest he was about the policing department while helping me to better understand policing in general. He opened up the policing department for his students and made it as transparent as possible.",
    "An unusual course, taught by the experienced Chief Esserman. Chief is honest and open, and I learned a lot simply from listening to him every week, as well as the guest speakers he invited. This is a great opportunity to learn about policing in general, as well as New Haven. The workload is not stressful, and you have quite a bit of room to explore whatever you are interested in.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. It's not even really a class. The whole class consisted primarily of people just asking the Chief about random topics and him talking about them. We didn't follow any sort of syllabus, though the paper syllabus made everything sound legit. We had some interesting guest speakers, so that was a plus. But our last guest speaker, for example, was really bizarre. The man clearly didn't prepare at all (apparently the Chief asked him last minute if he could come in that day) and didn't really have anything to say that was comprehensible -- and that was our last day of class.",
    "I would recommend it to a student who is interested in discussing matters of policing. If you are someone who needs a strict syllabus to get something out of the class I wouldn't suggest going. If you don't participate it's not worth it.",
    "Take this class if you can get into it. You wonare regret it.",
    "I would definitely recommend PLSC 225 01 to any student studying in Yale. It not only provides an invaluable insight on the issues within policing from a police chief himself, it also covers a broad range of issues within the criminal justice system. One would be challenged to look at policing from a completely different perspective and be inspired by Esserman to make a difference in the world.",
    "Definitely take it",
    "Yes, absolutely take this class if you can get it. First day, over 50 people showed up so it's a little tough but don't give up!"
