    "You learn basic conversational patterns, particles, grammatical constructions, and how to tailor your speech style to different scenarios. You learn that Japanese speech style rests in 3 axes: direct\/distal, honorific\/humble\/neutral depending on in-out context, and masculine\/feminine. You learn to speak through Core Conversations, to listen through Quia, and to read through various homework assignments. You also learn hiragana, katakana, and 70 kanji. Absolutely do stick it through to the end and do all of your homework thoroughly; you'll be shocked at how much you pick up in one semester. The class moves at breakneck speed, so keep up with your work! It's really not too much (~1-2 hours a day), especially if you're invested. I personally found the work therapeutic and low-stress compared to all of my other classes (am a computer science major with a concentration in applied math). As with any other language, becoming skilled at Japanese takes time, but it's not necessarily hard in the sense that it requires extensive amounts of critical thinking. Just put your work in and you'll do great.",
    "Basic ability to speak and understand Japanese, the foundations for basic literacy, how to type in Japanese, and knowledge of Japanese culture.",
    "This is my 4th language I've started at Yale and I would have to this I learned the most in this class!",
    "Basic communication skills in Japanese such as greeting people, exchanging basic information and having small chats. I can use Japanese to go shopping, count things and describe what I exactly want."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - The incredible investment that each teacher has in the individual success of the students. Absolutely stellar course. Some people who've taken the course before complain about JSL being overly complicated, but I genuinely appreciated and loved reading the JSL from cover to cover. It was significantly more rigorous than any other Japanese textbook that I've ever come across and does a great job of systematizing potentially confusing grammatical constructions in a powerfully concise and efficient way. Weaknesses - I would've liked to have more exposure to listening to Japanese outside of class or eavesdropping. My listening definitely came out to be the worst out of all of the 4 language skills (speaking, reading, writing, listening). I suppose it's a function of the fact that we can't achieve full immersion in America. Also, Japanese people tend to speak quickly to the point that syllables end up slurring\/eliding together, so I wish we could've covered some common elisions more thoroughly (e.g. wakannai vs wakaranai, watashinchi vs. watashi no uchi, etc.).",
    "Strengths: many practices, very nice teachers",
    "The pace of the course was appropriate for the breadth of the material needing to be cover and the lessons were rigorous enough to provide a solid understanding of the language concepts. The teaching staff were all excellent, this has been the best taught language course I have taken thus far. I have no suggestions for improvement.",
    "It's all strengths, the only difficulty for me was probably the overall tempo of study (a bit too fast and too little class time for revision)"

    "Yes, as long as you are not taking 5 courses.",
    "I surely will. The course is very effective and efficient in language learning."
