   "comments": [
    "I fundamentally altered my conception of the Presidency, partly in a historical sense (learning about the happenings within Presidents' terms that I didn't know beforehand) and what links the Presidents who succeed and fail. I also learned how to evaluate the prospects of what a Trump Presidency may feel like, and the implications for the wide range of decisions he has to make.",
    "I loved this class. I learned so much about the American presidency--and in a new lens that I would never have expected myself to see the office through. Very engaging. Really makes you reevaluate how you see the president and government.",
    "This course offered an insightful overview of the Political Development in the American Presidency. It represented a thorough mix of history and theory.",
    "I loved this class and learned an absurd amount about the historical course of the office of the president and how it has evolved. Skowronek did a great job of both teaching the history aspects of the class and also applying those points and their implications to what's happening today. This was obviously a crucial semester to be studying the presidency, which is why I took the class in the first place, and I gained so much insight over just a few months.",
    "I learned how to synthesize knowledge across a wide variety of topics within the context of American history, and how to think critically about how present-day events relate to the past.",
    "I learned a completely new way to view American political history and the American presidency.",
    "This course gave students an relatively in depth knowledge of the development of the american presidency over time.",
    "This class was an excellent introduction for me into the development of the office of the president. Learning about the history of the office provided a new facet of American history, while the theories on leadership provided me with a new way to think about politics in the present day.",
    "I learned how to analyze multiple sources and apply the concepts across different historical time periods. I also learned a lot more about American history from a presidential perspective.",
    "I was able to learn the different theories surrounding the various political times throughout the United States history. The most valuable information that i learned was how political time differes from secular time, which in part explains the current political climate.",
    "The course was very thorough examining the forms or leadership and strategies used by past presidents instead of a generic US History review. Talked about what other political scientists thought about the American Presidency as well as discussed Prof S point of view. Was also useful and interesting to talk about it in respects to the most recent election. Gave me a new frame to look at the President and how to evaluate the future. One of the classes I have talked about the most.",
    "Knowledge of the development of the presidency during a pivotal point in time, during the election. It allowed me to really develop my own perspective about the election and kept me engaged with the class materials and current events.",
    "Vastly increased knowledge of the minutia of presidential power and skills in writing political science papers",
    "An understanding of how different Presidents have treated the office of the Presidency and how the powers and constraints of the executive branch have shaped different Presidencies.",
    "This course provides a comprehensive look at the history of the presidency and offers insight into the ways in which presidential responsibilities have expanded over the years. I learned a lot regarding the ways various presidents have fulfilled the role and the means by which we can evaluate their preformance.",
    "I learned a great deal about the American Presidency, including the development of the executive's powers throughout time, the politicization of the office, and many of the leading theories about how the presidency works.",
    "This course helped me reconsider how to consider to analyze and evaluate leaders throughout history. While I had basic knowledge of presidential accomplishments beforehand, this class really put into perspective how these feats affect the executive.",
    "I learned so much in this course and as it was an election year, everything taught was really applicable to current times. I never thought the American Presidency could be so interesting and complex yet predictable and patterned.",
    "I learned multiple frameworks proposed by political scientists to understand and analyze developments in presidential politics. From Neustadt, Kernell, and Moe and Howell to Skowronek's own model, I learned how different scholars define power, authority, and success for American presidents. I also learned about the importance of executive bureaucracies and agencies in the modern presidency and the challenges they pose for overseeing the presidency and keeping constitutional checks in place.",
    "My TA: Torey was phenomenal in terms of writing and speaking in section",
    "I developed the ability to analyze history with a critical eye and look at the political trends that have shaped and will continue to shape our country's government.",
    "I learned a lot about the American presidency. Because there were two essays, I think my writing improved especially because I worked with my TF a lot on them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is strong in that it combines American history with political science. Everyone learns. The baseline level of knowledge needed to succeed when coming in is relatively low. Serious engagement with the course material is all it takes to become a confident student of Skowronek. The course isn't weak, but I think the gaps in this course could be achieved with some other course called \"The Forgotten Presidents\". I would take a course that discussed all the Presidents that we didn't engage with deeply. Secondly, the timing of the second essay should be changed. Even with October break, Wednesday to the following Monday isn't enough time, compared to the normal week that the assignment conferred. It is harder to get TF help.",
    "Strengths: very well structured, organized, great lecturer. Weaknesses: paper prompts are very long and hard to figure out exactly how to answer. They give out the final essay prompts which sounds good--until you realize that the final essay prompts only loosely relate to the class and this gives an advantage to all of the students that never attended class. I wish the final essay prompts matched more closely what we learned in class and not quite so long\/complicated. If essay prompts were more straight forward, that would have been a lot better.",
    "Strengths: incredibly interesting lectures; Professor Skowronek is brilliant and he exposes you to many different ways of thinking about the office of the president Weaknesses: some readings are a pain to get through because they are rather boring",
    "The strengths of the course lie in the quality of the class being taught. There are very few people in the world who are as well-versed in the class's topics than Professor Skowronek, and he surrounded himself with two competent TAs. The weakness of the course is that the reading workload is rather heavy, like I would expect from a seminar. Papers can also be graded in a hit or miss fashion; they are thoroughly reviewed by both TAs, but this was a very hard class to get an \"A\" in, from my perspective.",
    "The course covers a huge range of subject matter, but it's expertly woven together so that we can pick out unifying themes and patterns. I appreciate the care Professor Skowronek took to include discussions of the election in the class, as it was a unique experience to take a class about the presidency in such an important time for that office.",
    "Too large of a gulf between the readings covered in section and the lectures. The structure of the lectures, while engaging, were very difficult to follow",
    "Skowronek is a fabulous lecturer. He truly pulls in the students and provides a lot of structure in his lectures, despite covering so much information so quickly.",
    "Strengths were the coherent vision of the presidency that the course offered, great lectures, and dedicated TFs. A main weakness was the intense focus mid-course on bureaucracy and understanding bureaucratic structures, which are, mostly, boring.",
    "The lectures were a definite strength of this course, as they presented the material well in a way that was very understandable and relatable. The readings for this course also matched and complemented the lectures very well. However, sometimes it was unclear when readings were expected to have been completed. Clarification would help this matter.",
    "There was a lot of reading and was some disconnect between the lectures and the readings. I think if concepts learned in the reading were applied in class the course would have flowed more smoothly.",
    "Professor was difficult to follow",
    "All of the readings in the course are very interesting, however, some more scheduled readings could be used, for example, the syllabus just says read this book, and doesn't mention when one should read it by.",
    "Sometime Prof S went a little fast in lecture and it made it hard to write down everything he said while also digesting the material. Sometimes the readings were a little heavy which made it hard to go as in depth as Prof S wanted us to. I think Prof S lectures were always engaging and interesting, and the TAs and their discussion questions were always well prepared and encapsulated the last week's lesson.",
    "Strengths: the course overall was organized in a really great way, especially with respect to the syllabus and development of the course subjects. The professor is super passionate and there was really good communication between the professors and the TFs, which helped a lot.",
    "Great course! Strengths: Professor Skowronek's great lectures, and a fantastic selection of books and sources throughout the semester. Weaknesses: Lack of visual aids meant it was sometimes to follow along during lecture.",
    "The lectures were a good length and weekly discussion sections were really good; structured and informative. My only comment would be that the lectures could be a little more structured.",
    "The course is great and develops well over time and through the theories. I would have liked to have had more time to discuss Professor Skowronek's theory, but the lack of time was understandable due the nature of this election cycle.",
    "This was a great course. Professor Skrowronek was a great lecturer and you can really tell his passion for the topic. I would have preferred more interesting essay topics, especially for the last paper, maybe more pertaining to current events. There was also a lot of reading each week, maybe a little too much to keep up.",
    "Prof. Skowronek is the best Yale lecturer I've had- and I'm a SENIOR! The organization of the class and syllabus is easy to follow, he sticks to it, and he unfolds the presidency chronologically while gracefully working in different political scientists' theories and scholarship in the readings and lectures. He is passionate and engaging, and he is a super star. I have never been bored or daydreamed in his class.",
    "allow the dispersal of writing prompts to all students even if they happen to miss a class.",
    "Strength - thorough analysis of the history, power, authority, and future of the American Presidency Areas to improve - (may put too much emphasis on the context of power) needs more of a consideration\/look into the particular skills or personality traits that made a president like Lincoln or FDR great",
    "There was a lot of material, so it was hard to study as a whole. However, the evaluations were reasonable in the sense that he gave us the prompts beforehand."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this course if you are interested in the Presidents or want insight about how the office works. I also used this course, in part, to contextualize Bush, Obama, the Clinton electoral failure, and the upcoming Trump presidency. I have fundamentally altered my conception of political time, and though you cover a lot of history before you get to what I think the best part of the course is, I believe it is definitely worth it. If John is a TF, try to be in his section. He is so kind and thoughtful and great at synthesizing. Professor Skowronek is so fair in his exam. He gave us full access to the potential essay prompts beforehand, and if you write out and study detailed responses to each, that is enough to excel on the final. Get help on the reading response papers beforehand.",
    "Yes. For anyone interested in learning more about the presidency, absolutely. Taking this course during the election cycle was an excellent decision. I truly loved this class and learning more about the presidency...I honestly didn't know it could be so interesting. The class actually made me decide to declare political science as my major.",
    "I would recommend the course to students who are genuinely interested about the subject matter. The readings are long, papers perilous to write, and section discussions intense. You will learn quite a bit about the presidency, but only if you commit to a heavy workload.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this class, although we took it during an election year which obviously made it more engaging. That said, it's super important stuff to know and the material will become even more relevant with our new president-elect. Regardless of your major, it is important to understand the origin, transformation, and current iteration of the American President.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The readings are fun but can be long, and Professor Skowronek is a great lecturer. Discussion section with Torey helped a lot to understand the material in a deeper way.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in the presidency at all, you must take this course.",
    "If you're looking to understand the presidency, want to take a course with one of Yale's best authors, learn about Skrownek's interesting theory on the presidency, and are willing to do lots of reading (or choose not to), this course is pretty good.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material is exceedingly relevant, and Professor Skowronek provides invaluable insight into the office of the President. In addition, the workload was very reasonable, the readings interesting, and the writing assignments were fair. Professor Skowronek is an excellent lecturer and brought up many interesting points and theories. I was very glad to have taken this course.",
    "Yes",
    "Wouldn't recommend",
    "This is a fascinating overview of the presidency, though admittedly it took me a while to love the course. The readings were challenging at first, but Professor Skowronek and my TA clarified them every week so that we could understand their fundamental arguments and their relevance to the presidency over time. I especially liked the professor's reading towards the end of the class, as it gave me a new perspective on the factors that define a president's \"greatness.\" For a history and political science double major like me, the course was a great combination of the two subjects and I would highly recommend it if you're willing to put in the effort.",
    "If you want to know how Trump was elected, take this course!",
    "I would. I think that Prof S gives information that is extremely relevant to today's political climate while not overwhelming student's in material. Well taught and interesting course.",
    "Yes. Great class!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone even slightly interested in the subject matter. You should definitely go to lecture; the material starts to get more and more complex as the semester progresses, and Professor Skowronek's personal theories\/research is incredibly interesting. His book may be one of the most enjoyable books I've read at Yale.",
    "Skowronek's is a wonderful lecturer - he's engaging, insightful, and organized. The class covers the history and theories behind presidential leadership in a way that is relevant and exciting. Highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes. 100%. I felt I learnt an awful lot about the executive branch, American history as well as basic principles of political science.",
    "If you are at all interested in American history or the presidency itself, this course offers a great look at the executive branch.",
    "This course is great for any poli-sci major interested in American politics. It details all facets of the executive branch of the government and its interplay with other branches and within itself.",
    "Yes, not only is the assigned literature incredible interesting and Skowronek a passionate teacher, but also the topic of presidential leadership is timeless.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are actually interested in American politics. It is not a hard class but it isn't a gut either. There were a lot of graded assignments and other students took the class seriously so section was fruitful but you have to be engaged. Interesting course with a lot of relevance for the upcoming years so I would recommend.",
    "PLEASE TAKE THIS COURSE before you graduate. Polisci and history majors will not regret it. THE best polisci class I've ever taken, amazing lecturer, relevant and engaging readings.",
    "Yes if you can get Torey as a TA",
    "Solid course, come in with a background and read",
    "Yes I would recommend this if you like history and political science or are very interested in learning about the American presidency. It is interesting material but a lot of it you have to know a lot but if you go to class, then it is engaging.",
    "Yes it was a fantastic class that goes into depth of many of the presidents of the United States and the theory behind it. It has made me look at the American presidency in a way I would've never thought before, and you get to read very interesting books."
