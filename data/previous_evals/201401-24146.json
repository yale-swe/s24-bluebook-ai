    "This course is pretty unnecessary in terms of how long it is. I feel like it might be more efficient in the future to touch on all topics covered in a 3-hour or so session (we probably don't even need three hours). The primary points of interest, in my mind, are:1. Authorship issues and considerations2. Plagiarism",
    "A complete waste of time. If it wasn't required to go and sign in, I would not have bothered going at all.",
    "We have discussed a lot of interesting topics and gained necessary ethics training. This course is excellent. There is no weaknesses.",
    "It helps us know more about research ethics and also policy of the university.",
    "It was a nice intro the way things are actually done. Some of the non-Chris presenters gave introductions that were dry and too clean-cut--I think several of us found the ethics particularly to use examples that were too clean and not address issues we'd more likely see.",
    "A more than manageable adequate overview of what is required for good research practices. Clearly only grazes the surface but between guest lecturers and links\/references provided in the presentations, the opportunities to engage further are there.",
    "It is a very good seminar. More practical examples are needed. Required to complete an online course, such as those offered by the CITI program, could be a good way to reinforce what is teaching in the course and at the same time the students can obtain a certificate that could be needed later.",
    "good",
    "Much more useful and interesting that I expected from a required ethics class. I would say the sexual harassment session was not as useful or relevant as it could have been; I would like to see more complex and real-life examples provided that go beyond the typical examples of sexual harassment. I also thought the IRB talk was extremely dry; perhaps a different speaker could be used next time?",
    "Interesting and important topics covered.",
    "Useful course.",
    "Very good",
    "Good overall"
