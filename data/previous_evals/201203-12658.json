   "comments": [
    "Don't take this class. Waste of time. Horrible subject. TA's are brutal. Way too much picky work while learning nothing.",
    "This class is an easy writing credit, only two 5 page papers and a weekly assignment (about a page) each. Lectures are pretty boring and nobody ever really goes, but you don't need to go to lecture to do well in the class.",
    "No.",
    "Worst class at Yale. Do not take.",
    "Examination of the cultures of the ancient Near East based on the examination of several primary sources from the time period.",
    "Great Class. Funny Professor. Field Trip to NYC. What more can you ask for? Sure the has almost nothing to do with your life but neither does a great deal of what you are learning now. If this years reviews are anything like last year's, most of the other reviews are on point about what you're going to get in this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about ancient cultures or the myths they often told. It is fun material to learn but it also gave us practice in writing.",
    "do not take unless you want a lot of work that will get you no where at the end of the semester. they also expect you to pay to go to nyc for part of your grade, cost me 50 dollars which is a lot to me, and just not fair that they expected the entire class to pay for the trip. not everyone can afford to drop 50 bucks to go to nyc for an entire day at a museum for 10% of the grade.",
    "Expect to spend about 4 hours every Sunday night to do your weekly section responses. This class is a ton of work, but the TA's are generally really nice.",
    "Take it if you need the WR",
    "good writing credit, and yes id recommend if you need a writing",
    "The overall experience really depends on the TA - Georges is incredible, but I haven't heard much about the others. Definitely take this if you're looking for a relatively easy, but interesting course in Mesopotamian history!",
    "Yes because it combines writing and history",
    "No.",
    "The subject matter was extremely interesting, and besides the weekly assignments, there wasn't too much work. Definitely a good class.",
    "Not a gut, but still a decent writing credit",
    "Not a gut anymore. It's not a ton of work, but 2012 was definitely a different work load than I had expected. Only take it if you're interested in the subject.Was a decently easy writing credit though.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have an interest in middle eastern studies or would like to try something new. It was nice to be able to learn about a subject I knew nothing about but the work was annoying in a busy-work sense.",
    "Easy class, really straightforward. It's nice because there a lot of opportunities to get points and although the workload is about average for Yale, the grading is real easy.",
    "Good amount of work but a solid writing credit course.",
    "Humanities 441 is an overview of heroes in the ancient near east. While some aspects of the course were interesting, others were not. I personally would not take the course again, but I know people who really enjoyed it.",
    "I sometimes hated this class throughout the semester. But at the end when I was studying for the final exam, I realized how much I learned and how cool this material really is. If you have a better attitude about this, then you will love it throughout. But simply said, this is a gut class, and everyone treats it as such. But, if you have any interest in heroes and the Ancient Near East, do take this class. I learned a lot about Mesopotamian society, and how it influences our society today. Having known very little about that part of the world at that time, it was great to learn some history and a general timeline. Overall, a good class, with interesting readings. The workload is spread out throughout the semester, and everything is just a small percentage of your grade. The MET assignment was a great way to see the ANE exhibit there, which is not visited enough. The papers are not difficult to do well on, and the final exam was rather easy if you study lecture notes. Overall, a fun, solid course.",
    "Interesting material. Important material.",
    "Yes definitely take it. Very interesting and not incredibly hard.",
    "I would not recommend it. There is a lot of work without much useful knowledge gained in the end.",
    "THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST COURSE I HAVE EVER TAKEN IN MY LIFE. I HAVE NEVER HAD MORE BUSY WORK IN MY LIFE. I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO IS MAD AT HIS GRADE SO HE IS GOING OFF ON THE CLASS. I WILL PROBABLY GET AN A BUT THIS CLASS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME. SLANSKI HAS FIGURED OUT THAT 10% OF THE CLASS ATTENDS LECTURE AND SHE IS TRYIMG TO TAKE IT OUT ON THE STUDENTS WHO ARE TRYING TO COAST THROUGH A WRITING CREDIT. IF YOU WANT TO WRITE 2 PAGES OF READING RESPONSE TO THE DUMBEST ARTICLES EVERY WEEK, READ STUPID TEXT, AND SPEND $50 ON COMMUTE TO THE MET FOR A FIND THE OLD ARTIFACT PROJECT, TAKE THIS CLASS. IF YOU ARE SANE, DO NOT.",
    "lots of work",
    "I would only recommend this class if you're interested in the subject matter. I needed a writing credit and thought it would be interesting. It is a very esoteric subject.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The subject material was very interesting and intriguing. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Not a lot of work but pretty interesting class if you're willing to spend a decent amount of time on it. Definitely take it if you have the space in your schedule!",
    "Not as gutty as made to believe by previous years. Weekly section assignments usually took 2-4 hours, plus there was the pain of going to weekly section. End of the year museum assignment, while at the Met, will take planning to not stress yourself out. Plan on taking an entire day off for this- 3~4 hours for the assignment plus traveling times. Two short-med papers, and a final.",
    "I would recommend this class! Not too much work, it's a WR credit, and the material is really interesting if you give it a chance.",
    "It is a tough class. Tougher than it sounds but is also very interesting.",
    "Wasn't interested in the subject, tons of work, but if you do it all on time its impossible not to do well",
    "I do not recommend this course unless you're particularly interested in the subject matter. Lecture is very boring, and most of what you learn from the course will come from attending section. There are a lot of \"rules\" to this class- you must complete weekly writing assignments and most of the TA's mark your attendance in lecture. That being said, your grade from the class and how much you learn totally depends on your TA. Some TA's do not take lecture attendance, some do not care if you submit assignments on time or not, and some are very harsh graders. The class requires 2 short papers and a final exam, but the majority of the work is the weekly assignments.",
    "Take the class if you love Mesopotamia and if you're not afraid to write and write and write. Beware, though, of artistic embellishment-- this course focuses strongly on stringent organization: topic sentences, etc.",
    "Interesting class. Better than taking the same old western history and lit courses again. Not too much work, although you do have to kill a weekend by going to NYC.",
    "Gut? Writing credit? Heroes? I thought this class could do no wrong. It ended up being my most challenging class. Expect analytical and in-depth weekly section responses. An interesting class if you are willing put a lot of time in, but a pain if you are just looking for a distributional requirement. I would recommend to only those who want to learn more about Near East history.",
    "Great course. If you like history, english, and mythology\/literature, take this course!",
    "This is a decent course with a decent amount of work every week in sections, but there're only two 5-page papers and a final. Take this if you need a writing credit.",
    "Yes this course helps your writing ability and the subject matter is more interesting than it sounds. There is a surprising amount of weekly work in this class so be prepared for two page assessments consistently. Overall, a course that is interesting enough to take.",
    "There are probably better ways to get a WR credit than this class, especially because it requires a visit to the Met in New York, which if you can't go over a break, basically kills a whole day (including train travel).Some of the lectures that were close readings of the texts were interesting but some seemed superfluous. There are weekly writing assignments along with two papers and a test (during finals period) that seemed to have very arbitrarily chosen questions.If you want a WR credit lecture and you like close readings, this class is doable, otherwise probably don't take it.",
    "Yes, I would, especially for those in need of a writing credit and who are not entirely confident in their abilities.",
    "This is by far the WORST class I've taken at Yale and I would recommend the class to no one. This is not a gut and a horrible writing credit. Boring topic, teacher is a horrible lecturer, and the class had TA's that took themselves entirely too seriously. It was rare to have more than 20% of the class attend any given lecture. The fact that we had to write an essay analyzing the very first piece of literature ever for its \"literary merit and techniques\" is absurd. The class was nothing like it was advertised to be. The weekly section responses were long, cumbersome and often involved analyzing academic works that were poorly written themselves. Often times felt that the professor was making up these interpretations of ancient artifacts on the spot because she would just jump to conclusions about seemingly random symbols. TA's also had one of the worst review sessions I've ever seen. Basically just criticized the students for not knowing anything when it was the professor's and TA's fault for not teaching anything. The identifications on the Final were also absurd and showed no reflection of actually knowing anything about the subject. All it proved was that you had the ability to remember obscure characters names. Very bad class. Not worth it as a writing credit.",
    "I heard in previous years this class was a massive gut, so I thought it was be a great way to get a WR\/HU. However, they apparently restructured the class to make it a lot harder. For the section assignments I probably wrote>1000 words every week. There was no direction. Awful class, take an art class instead.",
    "An average class, lots of busy work and not incredibly interesting. It had its moments though.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students. It is more work than you would expect going into the course (with many assignments), yet with this being said, you have extreme control over your grade and always know where you stand in the course because of the many grades you receive over the term.",
    "First off, this class is NOT a gut. There are weekly writing assignments (response questions or mini essays) that take a bit of time. The class has two 5-7 page essays, two museum assignments (1 requires you to go to the Met), and a final test. Not bad at all though, especially for a WR credit. I was surprised by the amount of work considering its reputation (which is, by now, inaccurate). Nonetheless, I found the class enjoyable - I had NO background in anything related to the ancient Near East, but the tales\/stories\/secondary sources were actually really enjoyable to read, and itmade me think more carefully about creation myths, the development of civilization, and what we deem heroic. Really, this class isn't difficult to do well in, you just need to put in the necessary amount of effort you'd put into any other history\/writing course. Great WR credit.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course unless you plan on majoring in something related to Near East Asian Studies; the workload is manageable but the course itself can be a bit mundane.",
    "Do NOT take. Sure you can come out of it with a good grade, but it is absolutely not worth it.",
    "Great class! Not particularly difficult but it is time consuming. The material is interesting though. It's worth it.",
    "Great way to get a WR credit. You learn a good amount about ancient Mesopotamia and Gilgamesh. There is work, but it is all very manageable. Two not long papers (5 pages, and 5-7 pages) and a final. There are two museum assignments (one at the met and one in Sterling) but you will be glad to have them count towards your grade. If Tasha is still there she was a very good TA."
