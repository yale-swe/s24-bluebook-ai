   "comments": [
    "Phonetics, morphology, syntax, semantics. Learned IPA, which was very neat. Lots of breaking down words, sounds, and sentences.",
    "I learned about phonology, morphology, and syntax. It allowed me to get a pretty deep understanding of Linguistics, and it you get exposed to a wide variety of topics, all of which are relatively complex.",
    "I learned how to view language in a very different way. This course teaches you how to analyze it as data and break it down like you would any other topic.",
    "A basic understanding of the different subfields of linguistics: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, psycholinguistics. The ability to use analytical methods and tests to look at a specific language.",
    "I learned a significant amount about each module of linguistics.",
    "I learnt the major fields in linguistic studies: phonetics, syntax, phonology, semantics. The course enables me to look at language from an academic perspective and prompts me to reflect on many of my daily language uses. You will learn to appreciate the complexity and the rules that constitute languages, shared across different speakers.",
    "I learnt some key basic skills in the field of linguistics. As well as learning concepts, I was able to put them into practice in weekly homework assignments.",
    "I developed skills to analyze data in different languages on a phonological level. I also am able to understand the IPA chart and other basic linguistic concepts.",
    "This course covers a wide variety of topics and skills within linguistics. The class is divided into several units, including the basics of linguistics, morphology, syntax, semantics, phonology\/phonetics, and sociolinguistics and some psycholinguistics. You learn a lot within each of these topics and as a result that can make the material fairly challenging at times, but the course is well organized. There are readings for every class, there's a homework due every week (except for test weeks) that's graded on a small scale so that you do well if you put in genuine effort and generally understand the material (even if you make a few mistakes). There are also three in-class tests instead of a midterm that cover a unit or two at a time, which I actually really preferred to just one midterm. There's a final exam that is cumulative and very similar to the structure and content of the quizzes. Basically, you learn a ton in this class, section is really helpful (and required), and the course is well structured to be pretty fair and reasonable. This class is definitely not a gut, but you walk away with a lot of knowledge and skills in linguistics that can carry over into other courses and life which is pretty cool!",
    "I learned about the nitty gritty of linguistics, like the details of how to make syntax trees and other very detailed and confusing operations which I will likely never use again. We barely learned about why all the the things we learned mattered, there were three lectures in total in which I found interesting. If I ever want to know how to break down the morphology of a word, I know how.",
    "This class gave me a very strong foundational knowledge in linguistics, and gave me a deeper appreciation for language.",
    "I learned a lot about linguistics.",
    "I developed skills in analyzing data, specifically language, when presented to me. I learned more about the field of linguistics and picked up some lingo (and understanding) that will be beneficial if I decide to take more classes in the subject.",
    "Knowledge of how humans speak and where language comes from, the International Phonetic Alphabet, what linguists do and how data is collected",
    "This was an entirely new subject for me; Id had absolutely no exposure to linguistics prior to taking this course. I learned a lot about the field as a whole, and also the four main topics we covered (morphology, syntax, semantics, and phonology).",
    "I learned about how we the different levels of language formation, as well as a little bit about a few specific linguistic case studies.",
    "IPA, basic overview of phonetics, morphology, syntax, semantics, and phonology.",
    "LING 110 provided me with a pretty surface-level overview of a variety of topics found within Linguistics. It's a good preview of all the different topics that can be pursued through the Linguistics department.",
    "I gained a basic understanding of major areas in linguistics, including: what is linguistics\/what do linguists study, phonetics\/phonology, semantics, syntax, sociolinguistics, and a teeny bit of psycholinguistics. This course was a solid introduction to the field, and it took an interesting research-oriented approach - we talked a lot about how linguists study language and reach the conclusions they do, and how the scientific method is involved, and our homework assignments involved both reasoning problems and hands-on exploration of a foreign language.",
    "I gained an understanding of the field of linguistics from the overview of the core subfields that this course covers. I now have a basic understanding of linguistic analysis of languages.",
    "Learned a survey of topics within linguistics (morphology, syntax, semantics, phonology)",
    "Foundational basis for linguistics",
    "I learned a lot about linguistics, even if it isn't something that I will study more in depth, I'm glad that I took it.",
    "I learned introductory knowledge in various areas of linguistic study",
    "I learned about core aspects of linguistics, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics.",
    "Better understanding of linguistic processes in society and how to analyze them scientifically.",
    "I learned a lot about the overall field of linguistics. This class was a fantastic introductory overview course, covering a broad array of topics. I feel that I come away from the course with an understanding of the sub-fields of linguistics, and I know which areas I would like to pursue further."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: 1. I found the readings helpful Weaknesses: 1. Both the class structure and section structure were helpful to start but then become less and less helpful as the semester continued.",
    "Sections were helpful, prof was great, lectures interesting",
    "Professor Shaw was engaging and clearly put a lot of effort into teaching the course, as did the TFs. The problem sets were challenging but definitely helped to develop the skills we needed for the course. One thing I wish was emphasized more is why we should care about any of this. Like why do I need to know about syllable codas and compensatory lengthening?",
    "Strengths: covers a lot of ground, clear organization, concise powerpoints. Weaknesses: the class is sometimes vague about to what extent we need to know the concepts. The readings would often go into great depth and cover a lot of complicated linguistic phenomenon, but then you never encounter them again for the rest of the semester. Lectures often felt disconnected to the readings. Feedback on homework is not always clear -- I approached a problem on a midterm the same method I've always used it in my homework, but found out that it was wrong (wasn't pointed out in my homework).",
    "The strengths of this class are in the lectures' real-world applications and demonstrations. The weaknesses are in the infrequency and unavailability of practice problems with corresponding solutions, and in the inefficiency of Section.",
    "As an intro-level course, it did a good job of introducing the students to the study of linguistics. The materials were well organized and the lecture was 90% of time engaging. However, the section may not be the most efficient use of time. Instead of regurgitating what's taught in the lecture, it could expand on some more interesting stuff.",
    "This course was good in that taught students a broad and interesting array of information. However, there were definitely many things that could have been better. For instance, I felt that the discussion sections did not always correlate directly to what we learning in lecture or what we had to know for our 'quizzes'. Additionally, I felt like we were sometimes ill-prepared to do the homework assignments. Because we only had access to them typically two or three days before they were due, it was often a bit of a scramble to try to figure out how to do them in time.This seemed pretty unfair and frustrating. I found it especially difficult to garner the information necessary from my native speaker because this person was not living in New Haven, so I constantly had to try to arrange a time to talk with only a few days notice. Because people have such busy schedules, including students like myself, this was an additional level of stress that no one needed. I also wish that there more practice problems. There were some in the readings that we had to do, but not many, and none of them came with solutions. For students trying to learn material on their own, it is not much help to do practice problems but have no idea if they're right or wrong. I also felt like the grading of the homework was inconsistent between the TAs. It would be nice to have better consistency. Lastly, I wonder if the format of this course was the best it could be. I don't know if it would be better for students to have it be 3 times a week instead of twice, with longer lectures. But, I did feel like the 75 minutes would be hard to get through sometimes.",
    "The course is, beyond the topics being confusing and poorly taught, basically a rapid memorization of how to perform different linguistic computations (if you want to do well in the course, that is). The weaknesses are how deeply the course goes into some linguistic concepts (in which I had to use the readings to teach myself), followed by quizzes that were way more in depth than anything we had done, as well as what many of us thought was very unfair grading in response. There was a question on a quiz that 4 people got correct (because it was something we were never taught or exposed to) and they did not seem concerned as to the fact that NOBODY WAS GETTING THE MATERIAL. I have never not enjoyed a course at all in my life until this course.",
    "This class had a very wide scope in terms of what it covered, and I thought that the class was very good at getting us fully immersed in linguistics. I, however, did feel as though some of the material that we covered was a bit tough and I found some lectures going over my head.",
    "I thought it covered a lot in the short amount of time we had.",
    "Professor Shaw is an excellent professor who clearly cares about both students and the subject matter very deeply! He explains concepts in a way that makes them easy to understand, and seeing how passionate he is about linguistics was always a plus during lecture. One thing that was confusing was that the homework, quizzes, and final were not weighted in Canvas in the same way as they are in the syllabus. I also did not receive feedback on what was correct or incorrect on homework, which could have helped me learn from my mistakes.",
    "The homework for this course felt very tedious. I thought the course-long case study of an individual was interesting, but the problem sets were very repetitive. I thought the powerpoints very extremely helpful in clarifying the material, and I also liked how the discussion sections did not just repeat topics in classthey often covered more detailed material.",
    "I think the strengths of this course are the TFs; each week in section was the most productive time for me. The weaknesses might be the blandness of the homework material we were meant to read each week.",
    "Some really important topics in syntax and semantics are completely unmotivated. The course is broad that the TAs sometimes don't understand what they're teaching.",
    "The course's biggest weakness was its faulty structure. Many aspects of the class, such as the weekly language investigation culminating in a final \"language report\" seem to be much more significant in theory, and turn out to be much more half-baked in practice. Similarly, the topics covered in the homework assignments do not fully align with topics found in the readings and topics discussed in lecture.",
    "I felt like I got a really solid introduction to many areas of linguistics, and the practical\/research focus was cool. I felt like the assignments could have been shorter, particularly towards the beginning of the course when it really felt like busy work - maybe there should have been (fewer) required problems but then some additional optional problems for students who felt they needed more practice. I also wished there had been answer keys posted for assignments and tests since the feedback was very very limited and difficult to learn from. I did not agree with the no-late-work accepted policy, because it seems extremely punitive.",
    "The lectures were interesting and helpful supplements to the readings. The sections and office hours are also helpful.",
    "Amazing course!",
    "The material amounted to a good introduction to linguistics.",
    "A strength is definitely that Prof. Shaw and the TAs are passionate about teaching and willing to help. The subject matter is also really interesting, and makes for a fun intro class. However, I did feel as though some of the modules could have benefitted from better organization (especially the syntax module for example, types of phrases could have been introduced sequentially rather than all at once). Additionally, the semantics guest lecture was really interesting, but a bit too theoretical (maybe an intro at the beginning, e.g. this is where we're going, could have helped).",
    "Well organized, clear expectations. Lectures were slightly rambling.",
    "The primary strength of the course, in my opinion, was that we managed to cover a broad range of material while keeping it all grounded in the goals of the course. I never found myself wondering why something was important or relevant -- it was always clear how the material related back. This made it much easier to understand and retain the material. The design of the problem sets was another strength. In particular, the application of what we learned in class to a real world language of choice was a great way to reinforce learning and to get a small glimpse of what real linguistic work could look like."

    "Yes if you like linguistics.",
    "I would really not recommend this class unless you have to take it for your major.",
    "Yes if you are interested in the topic! Great So credit",
    "Personally, I would not recommend this course to another student unless they have their heart set on Linguistics. I found that the class was not too interesting, and sometimes the work you're doing doesn't feel very helpful. However, if you know that you enjoy linguistics, and have some experience in it, then this class will probably be great for you, but I'd advise you to make sure that you REALLY like Linguistics before taking this class, otherwise do not take it.",
    "If they are interested in Linguistics, then yes. Otherwise it can be sort of tedious\/repetitive and seem kind of pointless.",
    "Despite some weaknesses, yes. Jason is a fun lectuerer and makes the material as engaging as possible, and the course is a great overview of the field of linguistics. I have a much better understanding of the science behind linguistic phenomena and how languages relate to each other.",
    "I would recommend this course, absolutely. It is a great introduction to Linguistics and offers very interesting applications to the real world, e.g. through socio\/psycholinguistics.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in human languages by any means. Personally, I speak two languages and find it incredibly fun to compare the difference between the two. After the course, I started to look at them from a new perspective. I think you will deepen your understanding of language in general especially if you already know multiple languages.",
    "Yes. If someone has any interest in linguistics and has no idea what it is about - this paints a really clear picture of a lot of different aspects of linguistics. I would say, though, that the workload certainly increases over the course of the term as does the level of difficulty. If someone really is not enjoying or understanding the material, this can become really frustrating.",
    "No",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in linguistics and language and who wants to get some hard skills in linguistics. I took it for the cognitive science major and felt like I learned a ton, but it is really focused on the linguistic components and analyses, not the sociolinguistic or psycholinguistic structures. If you're more interested in those and no so much in syntax, semantics, etc. then this course will likely be a fair amount of work and effort with not a lot of reward. Otherwise, if you're interested in linguistics, this is a great course to take (especially with Professor Shaw) to prepare for more upper-level courses!",
    "I would not recommend this course. I took it as a requirement for CogSci, and I regret that very much. I am the type of student who never does not enjoy courses and who goes to every class, and I really apply myself. However, I could not find the joy or interest in this course despite my strong effort to do so. It is by far my least favorite course I have taken at Yale. Regardless of the grading being unfair and the material being taught poorly and incomparable to that which we would be tested on, the topics themselves were taught in such a boring way there was no hope of it being interesting. For example, we spent multiple classes just trying to learn how to draw syntax trees, which are laborious and I'll never have to do again, and many of us walked out laughing about how we still had no clue how to do them. For an intro course, the homework's were incredibly challenging and confusing, and that is coming from someone who prioritized this course above my others.",
    "I think this class was extremely interesting and mostly accessible. I think it would do anyone good to take it.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone. It is such an interesting course, and it's a fun way to learn a bit about linguistics.",
    "Its not too much work, but I wouldnt take it if youre a little interested in linguistics; in that case, I would take a more specific linguistics class that interests you, like cognitive science of language or historical linguistics,language culture and identity, etc. Its a great survey course for a future linguist because it gives you some basic aptitude in all the major subfields but its pretty technical into the quasi-scientific field of linguistics rather than focusing on interdisciplinary aspects of the field",
    "Yes. There are a lot of interesting facets of language that I really enjoyed learning and exploring. Unless they needed a course no work, I would recommend this course to anyone.",
    "If youre interested, its a good introduction, and if its an option for a major fulfillment, this is definitely an interesting course that has applications in daily life even if youre not studying linguistics.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is unfamiliar with linguistics. As one of those people, I found the beginning especially interesting. The later topics, however, I think more appeal to people who are more firmly interested in the field.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to others unless they are interested in definitely taking other courses in Linguistics and need this to take them. I think it could have done more to show why linguistics is important more broadly and show what can be done with the linguistic structures we learned about. I felt too much of the class was only learning things that would be necessary to understand more significant linguistic concepts.",
    "If linguistics sounds interesting to you, take it.",
    "I would have reservations with recommending this course. I often found the work to be very tedious and uninspiring.",
    "I wish I could wholeheartedly recommend this course to any student, because I do think I learned some very interesting and relevant material - linguistics is so cool because it is part of your life every single day! But in truth there were many parts of the course that rankled. I took it as a senior to fulfill my last SO credit, but I really think it's better suited to underclassmen - it's far more structured with far too many busy-work assignments and too little leniency for upperclassmen who are used to more independence, and there is weekly section (which was useful but more time than I wanted to commit to a distribution requirement). The lectures were pretty good, and I learned everything I needed from them for the quizzes\/exams (I only ever had to skim the readings occasionally for specific questions on assignments). There were 3 \"quizzes\" which were really full class-period tests, and one final exam (took about 2 hours). These involved a little more memorization of specific examples of concepts than I expected but were mostly focused on applying concepts, which I appreciated. The phonology quiz felt too complicated for the time limit, and since the course grades are apparently not curved, I fear this could impact grades more than it should. There was also not enough feedback on exams, and the grading often felt arbitrary because it was based on a \"right\" answer rather than a reasonable answer supported by a good explanation. The weekly homework assignments sometimes took several hours, which felt like too much for an introductory social science course and contained a lot of busy-work in the first few weeks. You should also be aware that each assignment requires interviewing someone who speaks a different language than you speak (the same person each week), which was kind of cool but means that you need to start them early and find a very patient friend for the semester (I wish this had been made clearer in the beginning so I could have made sure my friend was ok with that time commitment, since it's not really fair to someone not taking the course). There was only one one-day-late-for-partial-credit assignment per person, and otherwise no late homework was accepted, which felt punitive.",
    "I would recommend to this course to a student that is interested in studying cognitive science or linguistics. I would also recommend it to a student that would like to know what the field of linguistics offers.",
    "Yes, I definitely would",
    "Probably.",
    "Yes",
    "I would! I took this class to explore a field outside my major, and I really enjoyed it. I think everyone should have the chance to learn about language, given how much we take its complexity for granted in our day to day life.",
    "Yes! It was a great class. I learned so much about interesting topics I had never thought about before.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anybody interested in learning about language as a product of cognitive processes in the brain. The course does a great job of integrating different areas of linguistics and explaining their relevance."
