    "Great class, easy writing credit, it'll be one of the more interesting classes you take.",
    "ENGL 185 is a fantastic, fun, and interesting course. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the material. There is not too much work and Professor Minnis is great.",
    "This course was SO FUN. We read a variety of medieval texts (and a Twain novel) and watched many movie adaptations-- Professor Minnis is a great teacher who really offered keen insight into the movies we watched. I am so glad I got to read the books (Le Morte D'Arthur, especially), and the movie adaptations were a mixture of stunning and hilarious. The few movies\/tv shows we did not watch all of I had to go watch immediately. I highly recommend the course-- UNLESS you are not a morning person. The course is fun if you are willing to pay attention, enter the discussions, and actually put effort in. Two thumbs up!",
    "Very little course work. More like a lecture than discussion. Hard to keep motivated because so much of what is discussed in lecture doesn't end up applying to the two assignments. Professor doesn't seem to want to hear other interpretations and can be a bit harsher of a grader than expected after meeting with him and going over ideas.",
    "it's an easy pre 1800 if youre an english major and pre 1800 isn't really your thing...",
    "i would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially an English major trying to fulfill a pre-1800 requirement.",
    "Highly recommended... Wonderful books that you cannot find elsewhere all in one class, very open ended papers, smart (but not pretentious) classmates with interesting opinions to contribute, and great film choices",
    "Professor Minnis is great--so enthusiastic about what he teaches. It's a little more lecture than discussion heavy but he has many great things to say. And you get to watch movies!",
    "I recommend it highly - the class takes a wonderful, spirited approach to the material. The material itself is, if you have any fondness for medieval stories, or just literature and film in general, pure gold.",
    "I loved this as a non-English major looking for a fun extra class.",
    "I give this class my highest recommendation.",
    "Medieval Lit in the Movies is adorable. Professor Minnis is adorable, and he plays music from Spamalot, shows good and bad movies and admits that some are bad. If you are looking for a textual emphasis, you will not get much of that here, but especially if you have already been exposed to Chaucer, Arthurian Legend, and Beowulf, you will find this to be a refreshing new look at old pieces. Just be ready to focus for two hours, because the long lecture can drain energy before discussion. But you get to write your own screenplays if you want! It's fun as a very different English junior seminar or as a writing course for any major.",
    "This is a good class to take if you like watching movies and if you need a pre-1800.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to a fellow student, and especially a fellow english major.",
    "If you have significant interests in how Medieval literature is translated into film, then I would recommend the class. However, the class requires a lot of reading that will never be discussed, but will simply serve as background. Some cinematic knowledge would be helpful to have in advance.",
    "The course had a great reading and viewing list, and Professor Minnis made himself very available, but opportunities to participate were limited. Each meeting included an average of 15 minutes for discussion. It is completely possible to do less than half the assigned work, zone out on one's laptop during seminar, chime in with a vaguely related comment every few weeks, write excellent papers, and get a good grade. Of course, because many students did this, what could have been engaging discussions turned into long, awkward silences. I'd recommend the course to a student who likes really getting into papers more than he or she enjoys fruitful discussions."
