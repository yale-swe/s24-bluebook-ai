    "It did give an opportunity to read some great texts, but I'd tell a student that they'd get almost as much out of those texts just reading on their own.",

    "Before this class, I never had much of an acquaintance with the works of Gandhi. This course gave me a thorough introduction to his thought, and in all likelihood it will impact my research going forward."
