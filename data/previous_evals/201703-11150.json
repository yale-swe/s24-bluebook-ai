    "My french improved.",
    "Gained a lot of vocab. Reviewed grammar that was covered L1-L4, while also going into detail for some of the more nuanced grammatical rules that we didn't cover before. Read french plays and novels.",
    "Writing and reading skills in advanced French literature Conversations and oral exams are super useful for speaking skills",
    "I learned how to utilize vocab in proper context",
    "My all around French speaking, writing, reading, and hearing improved substantially.",
    "I developed French speaking, listening, reading and writing skills. My French improved significantly after this course in all these areas.",
    "I developed a greater knowledge of the French language, most specifically in the areas of grammar and vocabulary. I also learned about various aspects of the french culture and art through reading, watching, and analyzing french texts and movies.",
    "I think I got much better at writing in french and speaking in french.",
    "Written grammar; reading comprehension; critical response to texts; constructing short essays; conversational skills"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The structure of the course should be changed to better engage the students. There can be presentations, conversations about current issues since this is L5. The amount of movies watched can be reduced, it is so much to expect students to watch 2 hour movies every two weeks in addition to the workload that is already very high.",
    "Strengths: it was very clearly organized, and it was always very clear what was expected from us. Grammar review was good. Weaknesses: the works we read were meh. There was also so much content that it was sometimes overwhelming, and if you fall behind one class period, you're kinda screwed.",
    "Strength: facilitates student learning Oral exams are important way Weaknesses: Some activities (speaking in public\/acting) are unfair for students of disabilities\/students with no acting skills: these should not count for participation grade The Francophone world is more than France. Literature from around the world should be included in the syllabus, not only French. The literature of the course is not engaging\/relevant to modern day issues",
    "Very structured with good vocab, yet not enough time for each student to talk",
    "Although the grammatical review in this course was very strong, there was less in class dedication to this material than I would have liked. Instead we spent too much time discussing the rather random texts and movies on the course curriculum.",
    "People come into at various different levels of French and the class with Madame Schneider is heavily participation oriented so be prepared to have your speaking skills pushed.",
    "The course is very structured and well-taught. It blends grammar into language learning very well but also provides opportunities for students to practice speaking. The works include novels and films, which I find mostly interesting but may not be the case for everyone. It is recommended to review the course syllabus to check out the works if they matter much to you.",
    "This course does a very good job of providing a thorough review of french grammar and style, and it also helps teach the student about the language in various ways. However, some of the texts did not seem like the most beneficial or interesting texts of choice for students learning the modern version of the language.",
    "I think it should be a bit more streamlined -- it seems that different teachers' classes were run very differently."

   "comments": [
    "don't take it if you don't need to for language requirement.",
    "Take it if you want to build upon your French skills. It definitely is less work than L1\/L2, but it's still a lot of work, especially if you want to make sure you have a good grasp of the grammar and vocab. I found the readings kind of dull, but some people liked them. Class discussions were alright. There's one final, two oral exams, 3 interrogations, 4 long essays, and a few short essays. However, regular homework assignments in the course packet aren't graded.",
    "yes, to continue higher level courses in French",
    "If you are serious about learning French, you gotta give this course your all. I took it during a hectic semester as a credit\/D - I wish I had had more time to devote to it because it was enjoyable and I could tell that it would improve me a great deal if I had time to work more on it. Even so, it still helped me with my confidence in speaking (however incorrectly) and greatly improved my vocab (which is the main goal of the course). Having said that, the workload is miserably brutal. But Madame Schneider is incredibly kind, and a lot of fun! The way she runs the class makes it a joy to attend. I highly recommend taking it with her (though I suspect she is a harsh grader, so you gotta work to impress her.)",
    "Absolutely, Madame Schneider is the best professor I've had at Yale",
    "If you would to like to improve or refine your French language skills, this is a good course to take. Be prepared to work.",
    "Yes. Definitely take it if you wish to improve your French, although be prepared that the workload is decent. Grading is reasonable but you also need to put in real efforts for an A.",
    "I would recommend this course to those wishing to really solidify their knowledge and usage of proper french grammar. This course is constantly a lot of work, and it is not always enjoyable. But, the learning curve is very rewarding, especially for those hoping to get closer to reaching fluency in the language!",
    "Perhaps - however it is definitely a lot of work if you are not hoping to gain a language credit."
