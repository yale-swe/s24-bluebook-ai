   "comments": [
    "Yes, it was an absolute pleasure to attend Buckley's lecture, go to section (try to be in Will's section!), and write the assignments (which had a lot of freedom and were thus really enjoyable). As a history major, I came away with a better appreciation for the interrelationship between architecture and historical\/political developments - but it was equally fascinating to look at the ideas and designs from an art historical approach as well.",
    "Brilliant course. Covers all of the key points, links them together nicely, and leaves you feeling like a vastly more educated student of architecture. Professor Buckley was a pleasure to listen to. Perhaps one of the best lecturers I've had at Yale. Just pick your TA wisely- most of them knew very little about art history of architecture, given that they were at Yale for other topics... not sure why the professor\/administration assigns them this way...",
    "I seriously recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in architecture or the modern world.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who would like to learn more about modern architecture. The course is not too demanding yet covers interesting material.",
    "Definitely take this course. Professor Buckley's lectures are some of the most eloquent I've heard at Yale. The class is a great survey of the most important architecture movements over the last century or so, including the very famous (Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe) and the more obscure (metabolism, De Stijl). Even if you just have a passing interest in architecture\/buildings\/art history, it's a great introduction. Also a good class if you're interested in urban planning and connecting the material to the policy origins of the built environment. Workload is totally manageable - one midterm (very straightforward), one 8-10 page paper, and two smaller assignments (a little less straightforward.)",
    "An overview of like a century of architecture. The buildings are interesting, but Buckley isn't the greatest lecturer. Watch out for his flowery (and made-up) words.",
    "Yes! Would definitely recommend. It was a really interesting class, with enjoyable readings and not that much coursework. Final paper is any topic you want, so you can really pick something you're interested in. I looked forward to every lecture, because Professor Buckley made the material very interesting.",
    "A good, easy humanities credit. Not a lot of work. Many people didn't go to lecture, and I bet fewer than 10 people did a significant portion of the reading. Not sure how much I learned because I didn't put that much in, but I think if you really wanted to, you could get a lot out of the course.",
    "An in-depth exploration of modern architecture. I would recommend it to anybody interested, but those looking for a more introductory course should try a survey art history class.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course!! I find modern architecture fascinating and the course is exactly what it markets itself to be. Professor Buckley is super knowledgeable and passionate and really helpful in office hours. Sometimes he goes off on questionable tangents, analyzing aspects of buildings to a point where it is almost funny but the actual information communicated is really exciting and even after the midterm I didn't miss a class. Take it take it take it! (Also not a lot of work at ALL)",
    "I recommend this class to any student interested even remotely in architecture. It is extremely well-taught, fascinating material and relatively low workload.",
    "A good survey for those interested in the big names and movements of modern architecture and not necessarily in the narrative as a whole. Buckley is an engaging and knowledgeable lecturer and the midterm is fair and the writing assignment simple and straightforward with a final paper that allows a lot of freedom for you to take any angle you want.",
    "This course was okay. Professor Buckley gives nice well-crafted lectures, but they're not riveting. I also found the readings to be pretty boring on the whole. Interesting subject matter but not conveyed in very innovative or super engaging manner sadly. The assignments are not that hard, but the midterm was somewhat difficult grading-wise. If you want a basic survey course of modern architecture, this covers the basics well. I definitely came out knowing the architects and many iconic buildings of the century.",
    "yes it will get you to look at buildings in an awesome, insightful way.",
    "Good class; cool to look at themes in modern architecture. Very low key. Id recommend it to someone looking for a class with interesting, relevant material and not a lot of work. The lectures in particular we're great.",
    "It's a great course; Professor Buckley is fantastic. Highly recommend.",
    "Take this class. Amazing lectures. Professor Buckley is an amazing professor.",
    "This is a survey of architecture from the late 19th century through the 20th century. I would certainly recommend this class to another student. I learned quite a bit, and the course was very stimulating.",
    "This course is really interesting and the final paper basically allows you to write about whatever you want. However, lectures can be a bit dry.",
    "Thought-provoking exploration of the literal fundaments of modern society. Highly recommended.",
    "A great overview course that's not too strenuous",
    "This is a great course for people of all majors looking to learn interesting and important material. It is a manageable course load and a nice way to learn visually and try new styles of writing.",
    "A good class with a light workload.",
    "Take it if you are interested in art or architecture. Or just modern history in general. It's not much work, and it's interesting and you will get a lot.",
    "It's a great overview of modern architecture with a really interesting dose of intellectual, social, and technological history thrown in. The lectures were compelling, the readings were brief and interesting, and the assignments were helpful. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I am a science major with an interest in architecture that took the class Cr\/D. I thought the class was amazing; as long as you study for the midterm and you write the writing assignments, you'll be fine (pass fail, at least). Taking the class in this manner allowed me to focus entirely on the lectures, each of which I thoroughly enjoyed. It is also a good gateway HSAR class for the people interested in HSAR that don't want to major in it. While architecture is not your typical \"art\", the professor and TFs are very understanding of the fact that not everyone is an architecture or HSAR major, and are very accepting and supportive of this.",
    "HSAR 312 is an excellent course and a fine introduction to the art history department if you have not yet made its acquaintance (and you really should!). It really opened my eyes, even with regards to a subject that I was already very interested in and knowledgeable about. Architecture is a particularly good lens for studying history and culture as well because it has a particular functionalist tie to the real world that other modes of fine art do not have. Professor Buckley is top notch, and the course doesnt have a final. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class. If you have any interest in architecture, Professor Buckley's course is enlightening. Fear not if you aren't an art history or architecture major--the material is made very comprehensible to the layman."
