   "comments": [
    "You got to take it. It is necessary.",
    "I would recommend it. It gives you a strong a basis for further studies in economics.",
    "It gives a formal training in Microeconomics, which is what you need at the beginning of the PhD",
    "Yes, it is a good start to study micro.",
    "good",
    "Yes, it will help in understanding the theory of economics.",
    "Yes. It's a requirement for Econ \/ Mgmt PhD anyways.",
    "This was a great course for me. My situation is a bit unique - i came from industry so this was the first economics material id seen. This course was a lot of work but it gave me a great foundation.",
    "Please take this course. It is one of the most informative courses I have ever taken and will provide an essential foundation for further studies in economics. It is challenging but the professors and teaching assistants recognize this and thus, provide excellent help in aid of understanding. They provide long office hours and are willing to explain a concept repetitively to ensure that it is well understood. Furthermore, the material is interesting and fundamental and is applicable to many different fields outside of economics. Thus while this course is difficult, it is interesting and definitely manageable given the excellent help and resources that are available.",
    "The course is essential for PhD student, it is a well structured and organized course.",
    "Very technical. Recommendation would depend on students need....",
    "There are some important concepts discussed, but unfortunately, for the first part of the course, it is very hard to follow along, and I think that really basic and important elements are lost on most students, given the dry manner in which the material is presented.",
    "Very informative course in learning advanced consumer-producer theory and game theory. Excellent professors for both the quarters.",
    "They were really good. Especially the latter half of the semester.",
    "This is an important course in microeconomics theory. I would recommend this course.",
    "Overall I would recommend it. However with the precaution that the Bewley part will be tedious to follow and one should resist the temptation to dismiss the course in the first half sincethe second (Hoerner) half is so helpful.",
    "This is required material of any econ student so guess no recommendation needed.."

   "comments": [
    "good",
    "It generally went over what I learned before but it was at a a deeper level (proofs etc.). But since the exam questions were much more applied oriented, it was deep to some extent. But i think it is normal, because we will take more courses.",
    "It's a foundation theory course. Too early to know how it would contribute to my research.",
    "This course provided a great introduction to economics. I believe the material will be useful for my research.",
    "This course allowed me to understand economic concepts that I had learnt earlier within a more rigorous framework. The concepts taught in this course were fundamental and have adequately prepare me for further studies within the discipline. I have also obtained a rich understanding of some the core economic tools that are employed in research. I am certain that these tools will be of great assistance as I begin research",
    "it's essential for understanding economics research in general",
    "Very necessary basic skills.",
    "I think it will be very useful for my dissertation\/research.",
    "probably hardly contributed to research",
    "This is my first graduate level microeconomics course, and definitely deepened my knowledge.",
    "First part was the first formal encounter with different proof techniques in Microeconomics and as such helpful to set the tone for the rest of graduate school which is very Maths and proof intense.Second part was simply very interesting content wise and, given the prominence and power of game theoretic thinking in Economics these days, already proved useful in other subject we are taught and will certainly do so in the future."
