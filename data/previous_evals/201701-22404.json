   "comments": [
    "Teach some extra topics at end so students aware of topics but do not include them on the final so that attention isn't diverted from the key topics.",
    "Very practical. Lectures were a bit fast. Lots of algebra that could have used more examples or context.",
    "I thought the topics we covered were generally very useful, and followed a logical order. Some of the problem sets were quite good, though others, particularly those in the second half of the course (e.g. the LDV ones) were perhaps too difficult, I think simpler problems would have been better for facilitating student learning.",
    "Strengths: combination of theory and application in R or Stata; the Hansen textbook was great Weakness: presentation could be improved by uploading slides",
    "The Hansen textbook is very useful and the class worked best when the lecture closely mirrored the textbook. I found Professor Armstrong's posted class notes extremely dense and confusing. When material was difficult in class, reading Hansen usually solved the problem. But, this solution did not work when class material was not covered in Hansen's text. I thought we covered an impressive amount of material over the course of the semester.",
    "I hope the lecturer can spend some time on the motivations, transitions, and big pictures about different parts. Otherwise, it is very likely to get lost in Mathematics."
