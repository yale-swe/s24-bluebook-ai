   "comments": [
    "I learned a broad survey of Western art including movements, styles, time periods and mediums of works that have characterized the development of contemporary art.",
    "The ability to understand art from a historical context, the ability to recognize and appreciate different media and formal styles and how they contribute to theme",
    "I learned how to understand and appreciate art across all eras of history in far more detail than I ever had before.",
    "I learned a lot about European history, as well as details about many different pieces of art and art movements. In section we practiced visual analysis skills, but I actually thought the papers and midterms taught nothing which was a huge disappointment.",
    "Learned the history of Western art. Very useful for history broadly, for cultural history and artistic traditions in particular",
    "I had never taken an art history class, though I had always been a lover of art, so it was exciting to really dig into the different artistic periods and learn about what I have seen\/will see at galleries all over the US and Europe.",
    "I learned how to both objectively analyze and subjectively appreciate art over the centuries.",
    "Learned a lot about art history, visual analysis, culture",
    "I strongly feel as though my knowledge of the history of art was very much increased by taking this course. I am now not only familiar with many more works of art, but my skills in discerning and analyzing different pieces has been honed and sharpened. These skills can be applied to numerous other courses as well as other aspects of life, and thus I found the course overall to be both interesting and useful.",
    "I got a general sense of how Western art has evolved since the Renaissance and a sense of the style and relevance of many art movements within Western art. I learned a lot about how to look at specific works of art and how to write papers about the history of art.",
    "I developed an overview of the history of art and the ability to critically engage with artwork in a way that I hadn't been able to before. I also learnt that, while the course mainly deals with Western art, there have been so many connections and influences between east and west throughout world history that the artworks are more subtly influenced than one might first assume.",
    "I found HSAR 115 to be a really interesting and engaging course. Before taking the course I had no ability to write or speak about art and after having taken the class, I feel like I have a much better grasp on these skills. Additionally, this class betters your analytical thinking skills as well.",
    "I gained really useful knowledge about the seminal movements in Western art history and the way we think about art history. As for skills, I really honed my ability to analyze artwork based on all of the relevant elements",
    "I learned how to perform visual analysis and how to talk, think, and write about art. I also learned about the history of the world in relation to the art being produced.",
    "Everything I know about art history comes from this course, so...everything. I developed everything. I now have a framework for studying and talking about art, both visually and historically.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. It has been my favorite course so far at Yale. I leaned so much about the history of art and gained so much knowledge about it.",
    "How to look at art and put it in a historic context",
    "I went in with no knowledge of art history and I have learned a great deal about the themes and ideas of art since the Renaissance. I now know the important art movements and some notable artworks. I can visually analyze a piece of work, and, through historical research, extrapolate themes and ideas from it.",
    "This class was excellent in teaching in showing connections between changes in the art world and connections to history. I learned a lot about talking about stylistic choices in a piece in the context of its place in the history of art and learned some about writing about art.",
    "This course gave me a broad strokes over view of major trends in Western art history and taught me to do a visual analysis.",
    "Great overview of art history! Learned so much!",
    "Learned how to closely analyze a work of out - something I did not know how to do. The course is a great beginner course in learning that new skill as the TAs help students in section.",
    "I learned about artists, artworks, and art movements from 13th century to the present. This course demonstrated how historic events and developments influenced artists and the artistic world.",
    "I learned how to truly look art both in terms of materials, composition, style but also the historical context in which it is placed.",
    "HSAR 115 is a fantastic introduction to the history of art. Professor Barringers lectures are engaging, insightful, and funny. The sections, which take place in the YUAG, are also great, giving you a chance to see works by many of the artists we talk about in class. You will learn the rudiments of visual analysis and art historical research and develop a strong sense of the arc of western art since 1300.",
    "Great overview of Western art history. You only come away with a cursory glance at the material but it definitely gives you the tools to look at art with an inquisitive eye and have an appreciation of where it comes from.",
    "As the first art history class I've taken - within or without Yale - I learned the fundamental skills necessary to evaluate art critically. Beyond the skills of visual analysis, I developed my ability to appreciate gender and racial stereotypes inherent in the telling of history and in the presentation of images, through the modern day.",
    "I gained familiarity with many key works of art and periods. I learned how to write a strong visual analysis essay and thesis based essay. Furthermore, by the end of the course I was able to find historical and visual significance in art and talk discuss them.",
    "I was given a broad introduction to the history of western art. I thought the course's emphasis on how Western Art was influenced by various other parts of the globe especially enlightening and important.",
    "-Analyzing relations between artistic movements and sociopolitical trends -Recognizing the global nature of art from 1300",
    "This class provided me with a thorough and enjoyable survey of art history. I learned how to write about art and how to interpret it.",
    "I learned about the history of art from a global perspective and about how art was impacted by major world events, such as the Great War.",
    "As a newbie to Art History I acquired many new skills through this excellent course.",
    "Close observation, research, thinking about things in an entirely new way and verbalizing emotions\/sensations\/sights.",
    "I finally developed and understanding of art in context, and a vocabulary to formally evaluate works of art. I was encourage to observe and think freely, and learned how to write about art. I also learned how to look at art meaningfully and curiosity.",
    "A comprehensive understanding of the major periods in art history.",
    "I learned how to talk intelligently about art since the Renaissance. Of course I don't know about all art created between the Renaissance and the present, but I can now go into a museum and say something about over half of the paintings I see.",
    "Had never taken an art history course before but this was a great introduction, one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Gained knowledge of a subject I had never explored before, as well as a big interest in the history of art!",
    "I feel I have learned not only a lot about the history of art, but also have an arsenal of ways through which to examine, understand, and appreciate art.",
    "Great introduction to the general themes and trends of art history, how to do visual analysis, and the field of art history in general. Particularly enjoyed Barringer's insistence on challenging the canon by including artists of color and women.",
    "I learned a good basic over view of art history.",
    "I knew very little about art or art history before taking this course, and now I feel confident that I could approach nearly any painting in a gallery made since 1200 and understand the context in which it was painted and provide a robust visual analysis.",
    "I learned about how art developed\/evolved over the course of the last few hundred years. We discussed thematic and conceptual aspects of art, particularly with painting, and I learned how to look for stylistic differences in different art movements.",
    "I became a much better writer and learned a huge amount about the history of Art.",
    "The class helps teaches how to write and discuss art- on its own and in its historical context.",
    "This class will teach you how to understand and write about art via visual analysis.",
    "I learned that art is central to who we are as humans, and that the study of history is incomplete without close analysis of art. I got a lot of opportunities to practice my writing as well, and learned analytical skills (such as inferring information from symbols and motifs in art).",
    "I had never taken art history, and I learned so much about art from different eras, as well as how to write a paper about it. Art history papers are different from english papers; there is a certain type of language and style that is necessary, and writing papers for this class was a great introduction to that style.",
    "I gained the ability to examine a piece of art and critically analyze it, both visually and historically. I also gained an appreciation for the arc of art movements, and for the insight that art history is shaped by those who tell it.",
    "I developed an overview understanding of the key themes and trends in art history; more importantly, though, I learned to think more critically about why works would or wouldnt have been included in a survey course like this one.",
    "I gained an appreciation for the canon of Western Art. I know enough to fit new pieces of art into their respective time period and to talk intelligently about specific art movements.",
    "Great course with some unique insights on the history of Western art. You learn about a lot of important artists.",
    "I used to think all of modern art was garbage, but now I only think some of it is garbage! Historical context is really helpful.",
    "Knowledge of various movements, artists and artworks from the Renaissance to the present, historical analysis skills, and a new way to view art.",
    "Developed analysis and research skills, synthesizing arguments and learning to appreciate\/value art more.",
    "I had very little knowledge of art history before the course and feel that now I understand the broad progression of art history isms",
    "I learned a LOT about art history, mainly in the west, from just before the Renaissance to the present day. This includes artists, works of art, galleries, movements, techniques, materials, and the corresponding non-art history that influenced (and was influenced by) art itself. I also learned a great deal about looking at artwork visual analysis and contextualizing.",
    "I can now say I know and understand the broad overview of art since the renaissance. I learned how to conduct an art analysis.",
    "We learned how to do a visual analysis of art and how to connect certain thematic trends throughout the history of art.",
    "I learned so much about art history!! I feel like I can appreciate art so much more now, and I loved the opportunity to go to the YUAG once a week because it's such an under appreciated Yale resource.",
    "I learned a lot about how to analyze art. This really improved my critical thinking ability.",
    "I learned how to visually analyze works of art, no matter what era they come from (at least post-Renaissance). I also learned how to express my analysis of visual artwork in writing.",
    "how to analyze art",
    "A wonderful general overview of the history of art.",
    "This was my first art history course, and convinced me to pursue the major. I developed and grew so much as a writer of art history, and learned visual analysis skills.",
    "I learned all about the history of art from around the world. It was the first art history class I had taken, so I learned how to visually analyse art and synthesis the analysis with research.",
    "I learned how to analyze art while simultaneously drawing from historical knowledge. I learned to think critically and to research efficiently while using sources from the Yale library. I also learned about the importance fo art in the history of the human race and can now draw on this knowledge as I pursue my history major.",
    "overview of the history of Western art",
    "I developed a much better understanding of art and what to look for in works of art.",
    "This was an incredible course! I had taken Professor Cooke's Decorative Arts class previously, but this was my first class discussing fine art. The class covers art across the world beginning from around 1200 and ending in the present day. We learned about different art movements which reflected the culture of the world at that moment in time. This course is great for anyone of all academic backgrounds.",
    "Having very little knowledge of art prior to this course, I gained an understanding of how art has changed and evolved over the past few centuries. I also learned more about how to look at art, and how to analyze a painting.",
    "I felt like I not only learned a pretty comprehensive survey of the most important works of Western art in the last half-millenium, but also the basic tools by which to analyze all art, anywhere.",
    "Amazing. Really great overview. Thoroughly enjoyed sitting through every class and walking the art gallery every week. Took it credit D and didn't have the textbook, but I still learned a lot from lecture and section. I think credit D is the best way to take the class, personally, because you don't have to worry about small details like memorizing dates, but you can still learn about all of the overarching themes.",
    "I learned how to visually analyze art and approach it in a more logical way. I also learned the basic tombstone information on a huge amount of art pieces.",
    "I got a wonderful overview of the Western world since the Renaissance! Barringer did a great job balancing historical knowledge with visual analysis.",
    "Since the discussion sections were in the Yale University Art Gallery every week, I learned how to truly examine and discuss art. I never had an appreciation for art before I took this class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is structured exceedingly well, and is very strong overall. I think the only challenge is that there is such a wealth of material, but because this class is an intro class, this is a necessary evil.",
    "Barringer went through the slides too fast and tried to cram in more material than was possible in one lecture.",
    "Amazing lecture and subject material. Section is very rewarding. Weaknesses are the exams which are heavy on memorization and papers which are often too research based.",
    "Professor Barringer is a very good, clear, and insightful lecturer. However, in my opinion, the depth of the class was limited by the amount of lecture time per week. Professor Barringer was forced to move too quickly through many parts.",
    "Professor Barringer is very charismatic and funny. He is a joy to listen to. The weaknesses of this class are manifold, though. To begin with, the papers are graded ridiculously. It's an intro class! This is really different style writing than anything else and TAs can't read drafts. Grading them as though we were art history students, rather than for effort is absurd. It's basically impossible to do well in this class, even if you go to every lecture and meet multiple times with a TA for each paper (as I did).The way the classes were structuered was silly; you can't possibly pay attention and take notes he goes far too fast and there are no words on the screen. Either he needs to slow the heck down or else not expect us to take notes and post stuff online. Most ridiculously was the midterm and final setup which required memorizing far too many works and weighting the memorization more than was necessary. The structure of this class discourages learning for the sake of learning and merely pushes you to cram right before the exams. There is no point in going to lecture; it's all in the textbook. I could have learned this all from reading it and would be at the same point. Truly the greatest disappointment at this university.",
    "Nothing comes to mind. The course is well-designed",
    "The sections are a real strength for this class. While many courses have excellent lectures (including this one!) it's hard for section to remain engaging for most courses, but the visits to the gallery make every week's section something to look forward to. I also really appreciated the requirement that all papers include references to sources from the Haas Library because it was a resource I had yet to use at Yale and it was wonderful to get to know another campus library.",
    "I think the course could benefit from having fewer objects discussed in lecture and from Professor Barringer focusing more on fewer paintings than vice versa.",
    "I think that many aspects of the course itself are very strong in and of themselves. Each lecture was incredibly engaging, and I loved having section in the gallery every week. In future, I would love to have had more one-on-one time with professor Barringer, but I also recognize that this is mainly due to his busy schedule and fast-filling office hours.",
    "I think that this course is designed very well. In particular, I think that the three successive paper prompts coordinated very well with each other and were effective at incrementally improving our understanding of how to write about art history. I do think that the title of the course should be changed to have \"Western\" in the title--e.g. Intro to the History of Art: Western Art Renaissance-Present. I think that it is totally fine to have a course focused entirely on Western art, and I think that Professor Barringer does a good job acknowledging and addressing some of the issues inherent in the field (e.g. lack of female\/minority artists, Eurocentrism), so there is no need to change the content of the course itself. But the title as it is now implies that we consider this content to be the history of all art during that time period, which is obviously not true.",
    "This course gives a really great introduction to History of Art and I would recommend taking it as a taster to see if you would be interested in taking further Art Hist classes, however because it is a survey, not much time is spent upon each artwork. Also, despite Professor Barringer's best efforts to include art by women and minorities, the majority of artists studied are not that diverse.",
    "This was a fantastic course. The lectures are absolutely packed with information and every painting we cover is fascinating. I especially LOVED the sections in which we met in the YUAG because it was such a wonderful opportunity to actually engage with the art. The only thing I would recommend is that the slide lists that we received in class are updated slightly ahead of time and updated so that they match what materials are on the midterm \/ final exams. There can be a lot of information covered in class and it would be helpful to know for sure which works will appear on the midterm \/ final so that we can pay extra attention to these during the lectures. Overall, though, this was a fabulous course!",
    "Barringer is AMAZING. I think section material could have been more closely married to lecture materials.",
    "This was by far my favorite course this semester and one of my favorite courses that I've ever taken at Yale. More than simply learning about the narrative behind artistic movements around the world since the 1300s, I learned how to think and analyze visual works, a skill I've never been exposed to in other classes. I looked forward to both lecture and section every week -- they were always simultaneously entertaining and enlightening, and I almost always left bursting with new information I wanted to tell my friends about. The one weakness I can think of is with respect to the papers. Since writing about art history is pretty different from writing other kinds of papers because it's so heavily based in description, I wish that I had a better understanding of what each paper was looking for and how to structure them instead of being somewhat thrown into the process of researching and writing them without much guidance. The writing workshop for the second paper was helpful because we received examples of what strong writing about close looking was like, and I realized that I had much more leeway with the lyricism of my descriptions (something I'd restrained myself from allowing in the first paper because I'd believed that it had to be couched in academic language). At least being given examples of the sort of writing we should be aspiring to in our papers would be extremely helpful in making the papers more manageable.",
    "This course had no weaknesses! It was fantastic. It was thorough while still moving quickly and it gave a useful framework for understanding art I encounter in the future.",
    "Strength did the course were it was extremely engaging and interesting. Lecture was incredible and I loved every minute of it. I loved how section was taught in the art gallery where we could actually see and analyze the works in person. I have a new appreciation for art that I never knew about. I thought thbgrwding was very harsh though and could be easier in that sense because I worked so hard on every assignment and thought the grading was too hard.",
    "Incredible lectures!! And section is really worth it",
    "Strengths: very good lectures, learned a new skill, very manageable course load Weaknesses: Sometimes the lectures felt a bit like here are pretty paintings without much of a strong argument",
    "The lectures are very engaging and interesting. The main weakness was there was not a lot of guidance for the first and second papers, and the grading did not take into account that this is a survey course.",
    "The lectures were incredible and having section in the art gallery was great.",
    "Professor Barringer is a charming and engaging lecturer and it is really great to spend time during section in the gallery engaged with actual works of art. Additionally, the course was particularly strong in the renesance section. However, as we got to more modern material the lectures became increasingly frustrating. The professor flew through so many slides each lecture that it was impossible to really see any of them. Additionally his analysis of many of the images was incredibly reductive, flattening the work in question to a single axis of the artists identity. The course needs a serious overhaul in the way it talks about race and gender.",
    "Great overview of canon. Could have included more women artists.",
    "Strengths: You get to learn about some really interesting time periods and works of art. Weaknesses: Even though Tim Barringer acknowledged over and over again that the Western canon does not include enough people of color, he, the art history professor teaching us this canon, could take some of his own advice for the next generation and include more people of color and women in his lectures.",
    "This course has all strengths--the professor is superb, the material is engaging, the sections are exciting, and the assessments are fair. By nature of being a survey course it covers a wide range of art over a long period of time, which can at times seem like you are going over material too quickly, but it provides a thorough outlook at important artistic developments.",
    "I wish we had covered more non-Western art. Also the beginning of the semester was sort of boring, although that's probably because I'm less interested in Renaissance art.",
    "The lectures are excellent, as were the sections in the gallery. If anything, I would hope for more engaging reading as opposed to the rather basic Gardner's History of Art.",
    "Need more guidance for first time Art History students",
    "The lectures are of course fantastic, and the circulation of the slide lists was immensely valuable. Having the sections in the Art Gallery was really great as well, and I also liked doing research in Haas. This course could really benefit from a 75-minute lecture slot. Prof. Barringer is always crunched for time and we miss a lot of really great stuff when he cant get to everything. I also think the course might benefit from eliminating the first visual analysis paper in favor of a number of shorter visual analysis writing assignments for section (with quicker feedback) that would help us to refine our visual analysis skills a little earlier on and a little more gradually.",
    "The strengths are in the TAs and Professor Barringer's lectures. It would be more useful if the texts assigned engaged more with the material to give a more detailed narrative of what each lecture would be discussing. The textbook can be helpful when studying for exams, but not all of the images we studied were in the textbook and there were no other resources besides the lectures that we had to pull from when trying to study those images. It's easy enough to google it but it would be nice to have that information threaded into the material for the class.",
    "I have only the best things to say about this course and the professor. Lectures were fun and engaging, sections provided us with the opportunity to explore the art housed in Yale's two, wonderful art galleries, and the assignments challenged me to think critically about art.",
    "The lectures were so interesting and engaging and section was amazing. Weaknesses would be that the readings were unnecessary and we didn't really learn how to read art criticism.",
    "Felt like I didn't learn about an individual piece of art. Lacked depth.",
    "-The main strength of this course is that it allows student to gain insight on the major artistic trends that have shaped the western world since 1300. It is a great overview and also allows students to discover the extensive collections of the Yale University Art Gallery. -The main weakness of the course is exams. I feel that slide memorizations are completely out of touch with the skills we develop during the course. Although it may be useful to know paintings, their artist, and their date by heart, I felt that the exams did not allow us to fully demonstrate the skills we had learned over the course of the term.",
    "The course had an excellent professor and TAs. The section, as it was designed, was also fantastic",
    "very strong, would recommend that the TA's spend maybe 10 mins in section to review big themes of the last week.",
    "The strength of this course definitely lies in the availability of Yale's world-class galleries and collections, and in the weekly section meeting that take place there. The breadth of material covered is both a strength and weakness, because many periods and genres of art are glossed over--especially those by women and minorities. Although Professor Barringer did make a point of saying that the historically recognized canon is overwhelmingly white and male, he didn't do as much as he could do diversify the artists we studied in depth. Those remained rather canonical figures.",
    "Very knowledgeable teacher and TAs.",
    "The lectures are very well planned and Barringer is super engaging. Section in the art gallery is a big plus.",
    "I wish the sections included more of a concrete discussion of artistic techniques and the background of how and why the works were created - but overall, the sections were interesting and the lectures were always very enjoyable.",
    "Strengths: amazing professor and TF Weaknesses: none",
    "Strengths - very enjoyable and engaging lectures, section in the YUAG (get to take advantage of Yale's amazing collection!) Weaknesses - readings were not necessary for success in the course",
    "Strengths - engaging, interesting, good lectures, hands on sections. Weaknesses - a lot of work back to back which makes it easy to not enjoy the course as much.",
    "This course is fascinating, the paintings are beautiful and thought provoking, and it's organized almost as well as it could possibly hope to be. My two gripes are about the slide lists and the workload. The slide lists were not always in perfect order and that made it very confusing when trying to keep up in lecture. Additionally, the works in bold were not always the ones that were on the exam slide lists, which made it almost impossible to study for the tests beforehand. Next, this course was A LOT of work for an introductory course. I understand the workload for the midterm and final, but the three papers are just too much. I understand that the papers are a great way to practice visual analysis, but they make the workload for this class a little too much to manage neatly.",
    "This is a wonderful course -- I think the lecture\/section format is perfect for it. The lectures are wonderful, the sections are engaging, and you learn a ton about both art and how it has evolved over time. Fantastic class!",
    "I believe that lectures were truly fantastic, but I believe that the situation with the handouts was rather confusing.",
    "Professor Barringer's lectures are informing and engaging. The sections in the gallery are an invaluable addition to the course as looking at the images close-up enhances our ability to analyze them.",
    "The weekly sections have been delightful and Prof. Barringer's lectures have been humorous and engaging. It has been my favorite course of the year! I loved how we were given opportunities to analyze art on our own while being guided by our TF in the Art Gallery. I had a great time!",
    "The course was strong both in its content and organization. Lectures were captivating, and augmented by well-run discussion sections in the gallery. The survey was broad in scope but still managed to be informative about each period covered--the pace was not cursory.",
    "Really cool survey course. I wish there was a bit more emphasis on the theory behind art history, the movements, etc. With art history it seems that just looking at the art is really important, but I think the course would be improved if there were fewer slides in each lecture and more discussion of what's going on conceptually. Nice intro to visual analysis and art papers.",
    "The strengths of this class include Tim Barringer's enthusiasm, which seems boundless, and his lectures, which help you appreciate works you might already be familiar with in a new way. Other highlights include getting to go to the YUAG every week and look at amazing art! The main weakness of the class is, I think, the way it treats non-white non-Western, and non-male artists. Prof Barringer can get a bit self-congratulatory when he makes a nod towards any artists or works that fall outside of what'd traditionally be taught in a survey course like this one -- but, really, the class makes little meaningful effort to acknowledge these artists.",
    "This class could do a slightly better job of incentivizing students to read the book.",
    "It's a lot of work. You have to be committed to learning art history to enjoy it. If you do, Barringer proves to be an amazing lecturer. Hands down the most valuable sections you'll ever have for a class.",
    "The lectures in this course were absolutely amazing, insightful and engaging consistently throughout the semester. Sections in the YUAG and center for British art really helped solidify what was learned in lecture. It would be nice to get slides with more info for better revision for the midterm\/final. I would have also liked to see a greater emphasis on how to write art history essays specifically.",
    "The lectures and material are very interesting, but there is way too much work and it is graded way too harshly. I have never written and studied so much for a class AND had to take it credit D after putting in the amount of work that I did.",
    "Enjoyable to look at art. I'm not super interested in the subject beyond that, but course was still fun to take.",
    "I'm not sure how to solve this without radically restructuring the course, but lecture was honestly difficult to follow because of the quantity of information put forth every class (150 slides!). It was possible to record most of the information if you were a fast typist, but picking out overarching threads of importance was difficult; it was simply too dense. However, all of that information was both necessary and interesting, and I did enjoy learning it (or at least what of it I could scribble down or retain). It seemed that was just the byproduct of cramming 600 years of history into a single semester. On the other hand, section was MASSIVELY helpful, and also interesting and engaging. It probably goes without saying, but being in front of a work of art does seem to be the best way to really understand it, engage with it, and learn from it. My section leader was brilliant, as well. I also found the essays to be pleasantly challenging but not impossible, and the external research required strengthened the knowledge and insight I received from the class. Also and Professor Barringer acknowledged this, which I deeply appreciate the class material was heavily Western and heavily male. This could definitely be improved as the \"canon\" of art history is as well.",
    "Given that the class is an introductory-level course, one of the paper assignments should be eliminated.",
    "Professor Barringer's lectures were extremely interesting, and the discussion sections at the art galleries were highly engaging.",
    "The course had very good lectures and the TAs were really knowledgable. The class had to many papers to also have a final and the essays were graded extremely harshly. I think we could have spent more time reading examples of good art history essays because it was an intro level class.",
    "Lectures were so engaging, but I thought the course had too many papers. I also think sections could have been structured better sometimes it felt like we were just wandering around.",
    "I wish we went a little slower and analyzed each painting a little bit longer. I understand this is a broad survey course, but I wish it was a little more specific and detailed. I also felt like I lacked some general vocabulary necessary for artistic analysis.",
    "The course covers too broad a time period to allow any close analysis in lectures, however the sections did make up for this in part by focusing closely on only a few paintings.",
    "Strengths lie in Professor Barringer's pleasant personality and ability to explain artistic movements well. Weaknesses lie in the fact that the course has so much crammed into it, that sometimes certain movements or artists only received surface-level treatment or explanation during lecture.",
    "amazing professor",
    "So so interesting! Strengths include how engaging and well prepared the professor is in lecture. Section is also incredible. Can't think of weaknesses.",
    "I loved this course. This course was near perfect. Lecture was incredibly engaging, and section was wonderful. Wish the people in my section were less pretentious\/know-it-all types, but that's nitpicky.",
    "The lectures and the sections were my most engaging and interesting this semester.",
    "Strengths: I thought the lectures were excellent, good selection of material, and very fair exams Weaknesses: I thought sections often weren't nearly as interesting as lecture, some might think that this course had a lot of assignments for a large survey course",
    "Lectures were so great but almost no one does the reading. I wish the readings were more incorporated into the course material, or that there was less reading",
    "This course gives a solid overview of art 1300-now, I can't think of any ways in which I would improve the course.",
    "I took this class credit\/d as a senior and enjoyed it tremendously. I think that there is a lot to gain from this course even if you're not doing all the readings - from listening during lecture to Professor Barringer (who is hysterical and engaging) and going to section, which is held in the art gallery.",
    "One of the greatest strengths of the course was the ability to utilize the Yale University Art Gallery for sections. We were able to look at and discuss pieces that we had just learned about in lecture. The YUAG has incredible collections and this class gives students the excuse to spend hours appreciating them!",
    "The class tries to cover a lot of ground, which is great, but sometimes it feels like not enough time is given to any one painting, and lecture is just a lot of facts being thrown at you. However, I did find the lectures really engaging, so maybe the fast pace is good.",
    "This course was almost completely wonderful. Lectures were consistently dynamic and interesting, and I loved having section in the gallery. I'd say the weakest part of the course was the reading component. It felt like there was almost never any crossover between the readings in the textbook and the material of the lectures, so I stopped doing the textbook readings at some point. Maybe using more supplementary material and making textbook readings optional would eliminate this issue.",
    "weakness: presents as total art history when in reality only covers European art - make that known in the course description",
    "My only problem is that I wish notes from lecture were posted online.",
    "The great strength is clearly the phenomenal lecturer, Tim Barringer. His lectures are remarkably engaging and informative. Perhaps this can't be helped, but I think the survey aspect of the course makes it very broad. The lack of specificity can leave one a little discombobulated.",
    "The professor is absolutely fabulous - knowledgeable, hilarious, and just a fantastic human being. The discussion sections in the YUAG offer an unparalleled experience because you are literally looking at original Donatello sculptures and Van Gogh paintings."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The lectures are particularly engaging and the TFs are knowledgeable and friendly, and able to conduct sections with ease. It's a great class to take.",
    "This is a good class to take Credit D as it can actually be demanding if you want to do well.",
    "Yes. Don't expect to coast to an A, but if you put your effort into it, you can get a lot out of some really interesting material",
    "This course is exactly what it says, a survey of art history. You will learn a general construction of the progression of art, but if you're looking to dig deep into particular periods or artistic movements, you will leave a bit unsatisfied. There's just not enough time to get into the details because of the wide scope of the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone--I certainly feel like a more well-rounded person due to how much I learned about art through this course.",
    "absolutely not.",
    "An absolute must-take, as essential to your education as any class you'll ever take. Yes, it is that good!",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to any Yale College student. Every week has a fantastic set of lectures--even if the period of art isn't one you know well or even one you like, Professor Barringer makes the lectures interesting and accessible. The sections are a great excuse to go to the art gallery every week (usually the YUAG but every now and then the YCBA) and while there is a fair amount of material for the exams, they are fair. Such a great class to take as a senior or as a fun and engaging lecture outside of your major.",
    "You learn so much about art history even with no background, and the TAs are extremely kind and helpful.",
    "This is a great Intro to Western art course. If you are interested in the subject matter, take it. Professor Barringer is a good Professor and you will learn a lot.",
    "This is a must-take course for any student at Yale. Regardless of interest or intended major, I think that every student could benefit from taking a course with professor Barringer. This course teaches one how to look at something, how to absorb information, not just see something.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, but I would recommend that they carefully consider what it is they want before signing up for the class. This class is an excellent version of what it is--a general survey course in a traditional lecture\/section format--but I personally prefer courses that look more closely at smaller topics. I knew what I was getting into in advance and took the course anyway for my own reasons, but if you are someone who is looking to try out the field of art history, just know that even though this has the title \"Intro to the History of Art\", this is not the only option for getting an introduction to the field. I recommend you shop both this class and one or two of the more specialized classes in the department and decide which one better suits you.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone with even a passing interest in art. Professor Barringer brings the hundreds of artworks alive in his animated lectures, to the extent that, even when you can tell he isn't particularly fond of a piece of art his enthusiasm for what it represents remained sky-high.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a cursory overview of Art History! It covers every major period of art without leaving really anything out! Prof. Barringer is a fabulous lecturer and the lectures are extremely engaging.",
    "This introductory survey was disappointing: it simplified history in an extremely un-nuanced, problematic way. In other words, it constructed a misleading historical arc for the last five-hundred-or-so years; and as a History major and upperclassmen who has had the opportunity to take other lectures and classes, I was disappointed to see a largely-underclassmen audience presented a history that was so uncomplicated and reductive. Furthermore, it was sort of an extended enumeration of works of artit didn't teach me how to look at art or what I should glean from it. This said, the workload was fairly standard and assignments are straightforward.",
    "YES! I always kind of rolled my eyes at art history, but this is an incredible class. It forces you into the YUAG once a week (and given how incredible the collection is, it's fantastic to finally spend enough time there). Barringer is so wonderful and thoughtful and brilliant and hilarious. And the content is beautiful.",
    "This is an AMAZING class -- I've been going around telling everyone I know to take it. The lectures are phenomenal, the sections are in the YUAG\/YCBA, and the papers are a ton of fun. Taking this class is basically signing up to look at and think about and talk about beautiful objects three times a week. Prof. Barringer makes an incredible effort to diversify a deeply entrenched canon in the history of art, and you come away not only learning about the \"dead white men\" but also many women and people of color. Most of all, however, whether you're interested in the humanities or not, the skill of being able to look closely at something and analyze it based on visual cues is such a crucial one for the modern age, considering how heavily image-based our lives are. Take this class -- you won't regret it.",
    "Yes. Take this course before you graduate at all costs.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to any student at Yale no matter what their major is. It was truly incredible and such an amazing experience.",
    "Yes",
    "Yeah, very well run and manageable class that is fun - really cool to have section at YUAG",
    "I recommend this class because the lectures are engaging and you get to learn a great deal about the major themes of art since the Renaissance. There is a considerable amount of work that is associated with the class though, so you must be willing to put in the time, especially if you have no experience with art history.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. There are so many wonderful intro HSAR courses and higher level courses that conver different aspects of what was taught in the class in a much more engaging way.",
    "Absolutely!!!!! 100%",
    "I would recommend it if you'd like to know about a lot of different time periods and styles of art.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course to any student. It was my first art history class, and I loved it. The lectures were exciting to go to (Professor Barringer is a great instructor who is passionate about the material), the sections all took place in the art galleries (which hold incredible art pieces relevant to those studied in the course), and the papers and tests ensured that the material was clearly understood.",
    "Yes take it take it take it! Incredible course for anyone interested in art. I learned an incredible amount. Also you end up at the gallery a lot in section which is great.",
    "It's a good lecture, and section is a lot of fun. The art gets more interesting as the semester goes along.",
    "Absolutely. This course is wonderful in its breadth and depth---recommended for all Yale students.",
    "I could not recommend this class more highly. It is by far the best class I have taken so far at Yale. The biweekly lecturers are absolutely fascinating, and discussion sections take place in Yale's Art Gallery and in Yale's Center for British Art - every week, you are literally inches away from paintings by artists ranging from Rembrandt to Picasso. Everyone should take this class regardless of their major - it will teach you how to look at art, and the world, in a new way. It actually inspired me to become an art history major. Professor Barringer is a brilliant, wonderfully engaging lecturer and the TAs are also fantastic.",
    "I cant recommend this course highly enough, especially for non-majors. Its a discipline you might not otherwise be exposed to that will be useful for the rest of your adult life and theres really no better place to take this class than Yale, where in our weekly sections we can see in person works by almost all of the most famous artists mentioned in class. The workload is substantial but not overwhelming, and the readings can be done in preparation for the exams.",
    "Yes, one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale",
    "Absolutely. It gives you an appreciation for visual art and might start anyone on a really great path of inquiry. It is definitely an intro class, so if you have a pretty good feel of art history, opt for something a little more in depth.",
    "I have only the best things to say about this course and the professor. Lectures were fun and engaging, sections provided us with the opportunity to explore the art housed in Yale's two, wonderful art galleries, and the assignments challenged me to think critically about art.",
    "I think this course is a must take for all students. It really changes the way you view art and the world around you. It made me much stronger at writing essays. Overall, it was a very fun and enjoyable class.",
    "Yes, I think its an excellent introduction to art history, which everyone can benefit from. We encounter art in our daily lives all the time, and its nice to know how to appreciate it.",
    "Yes!! It is a very important course to take, even if you never intend to take another art history course. This class gives you the tools to analyse art and makes you aware of the major artistic trends that have shaped the western world since 1300.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Though, it is not easy and will require a fair amount of work, it provides you with a set of skills that will be put to good use!",
    "Abdolutely. This was one of the best courses I have ever taken!",
    "Take it!! You won't regret it!",
    "yes, i now love art and wish i had been an hsar major.",
    "Abosolutely. This class is a must for anyone with a desire to learn more about Western culture, or anyone who has ever step foot inside a Western museum.",
    "Yes definitely",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It's a great way to learn a ton about mainstream western art, and I can't imagine a better professor than Tim Barringer.",
    "Yes u would recommend it over any other lecture course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes - Prof. Barringer is such a great lecturer, and the subject matter is always interesting, and provides a totally new way to look at history.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester!! Interesting and engaging and low demand apart from the three essays!",
    "Yes! Barringer's lectures are a joy, as are the weekly discussion sections at the YUAG.",
    "Yes i think its a necessary and useful class for anyone to take.",
    "Absolutely take this course, maybe senior year, and use a credit\/d. Still, show up to all the lectures and study for the exams. The workload is serious, especially the three papers on top of the midterm and final, but you will gain so much from it and the credit\/d will take some of the pressure off. This course is an UNPARALLELED opportunity because it is taught at Yale, feet away from pretty much the greatest university art gallery in the world. The lectures are great but section is what makes the class. Walking around the gallery, learning how to do visual analysis with famous pieces that are in art history lectures around the world is so special. Do not pass up on this absolute gem, even if you don't know much about art. You will learn, and by the end of the semester, you will be able to approach nearly any painting in a gallery made since 1200 and understand the context in which it was painted and provide a robust visual analysis of it.",
    "Yes, I think most students would enjoy this course. The lectures are amazing, sections are worthwhile and engaging, and you really learn how to look at art\/see art as it has developed and changed over time. Highly recommend!",
    "If you are interested at all in art history this is the class to take.",
    "The lectures are wonderful-Professor Barringer constructs engaging narratives weaving art and history to show how each pieces fill an important role in its historical context. He also does a great job of including female artists and highlighting non-western influences, both of which are often left out of the 'western cannon.' Having section in the YUAG is also such a wonderful treat that feels like a field trip and is also very helpful in terms of understanding different techniques and such. Getting to look at a piece close up is infinitely better than doing so on a screen. The weekly workload is very low and even if you do not consistently do the reading, you'll get a lot out of the class. So yes, I would recommend this class.",
    "Definitely. I took this course knowing that I'd never take an Art History course again, and I was blown away with the amount of material that I learned over the course of one semester. Barringer is an amazing professor, and I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the YUAG.",
    "Take this class! It's a great 5th class to take Credit\/D - you'll pick up some new skills and you'll get to spend time in the art gallery. You walk away from the course feeling like you are more culturally intelligent and like you could have something to say about a work you spot in an art gallery or museum. This class can sometimes be a slog, but f you get through it you'll be glad you did!",
    "This is a must-take course. It entails a lot of work and is definitely not an easy A, but you will gain so much from it, and you'll love every moment. :)",
    "You should take this class! I was skeptical because I had never taken art history before and am the opposite of artistic, but I found the course extremely enjoyable. Now I feel like I can go to museums with the background knowledge required to fully appreciate art. And writing about art is surprisingly fun!",
    "Take the class if you don't know about art history! Also it aligns perfectly with \"Intro to History of Western Music,\" so you can take both for the full Western art experience. Don't forget that you can download the list of slides before each class! That will greatly improve your notetaking.",
    "I'd definitely recommend taking this class while at Yale! It's quite a lot of work if you take it for a grade - but totally worth it to have the exposure to this framework for understanding art history. It's also great to have section in the YUAG (or the British Art Gallery) every week. The class wasn't quite as amazing as I thought it'd be - mostly because the idea of trying to teach a class about four hundred years of art history in a semester is a pretty crazy idea, that leaves the lectures occasionally scattered, and any nod towards female artists, non-western, or non-white artists totally minimal, or done in a tokenizing way. That said, though, Barringer's great - and you'll learn a lot - so I'd definitely recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. As a Mechanical Engineering major, I found this class approachable and interesting.",
    "Yes, if you're willing to do the work and if you have any interest in art at all. The lectures and section are absolutely thrilling.",
    "Yes! Great introduction to Western art. The professor is engaging and the sections are fun.",
    "This is an amazing introduction to the world of art history and truly eye-opening regarding how trends in art have affected\/been affected by global events and developments in society in a constant dialogue between east and west.",
    "I would, but to take credit D and when they had not such an intense semester.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Even my friends who weren't \"art people\" loved it. Learning about art history is, by necessity, learning about the history of everything else, too lots of politics, technology, international relations, etc ... It's very valuable, and it's also just good to have the tools to look at and think about art from an informed perspective.",
    "Yes definitely.",
    "This is a great class. I really enjoyed taking it credit\/D\/fail, and still felt like I learned a lot. I highly recommend it, regardless of whether or not you think you're interested in art history. Keep in mind, though, that it involves 3 papers and 2 exams.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. While the workload is not light, there is a lot to gain from this class.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course as a Credit D class unless you are an art history major. The instructions for essays were never very clear and it was fairly difficult to keep up with all of the reading.",
    "YES absolutely take this course! You'll appreciate art so much more after learning about how far it's come since the Renaissance, and you couldn't ask for a funnier, more engaging lecturer. He knows so much and you'll learn so much in an entertaining, low-stress environment. The tests aren't too hard but there are three papers. It's a good class to credit\/D if you want no stress, but not too hard to do well in if you're willing to put in some work for the papers. I loved going to class every time and I was so sad on the last day when it was over.",
    "This class was the best class I've ever taken! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to learn some fundamentals about the history of art. Barringer is a fantastic lecturer.",
    "A phenomenal course that I was very happy to take before leaving Yale! There are more assignments than a typical class (re. papers and exams) but it's worth it.",
    "Definitely! Now, when I go to museums, I will better be able to appreciate the art and understand its historical context.",
    "If you want a passing knowledge of some of the most well-known western paintings and art movements, sure. If you've already got a grasp on the general course of art history, the class probably isn't worth your time.",
    "Overall, I'd recommend it. It was fun and useful to learn about artistic movements and specific artists, and now I feel much more confident about stepping into an art museum and understanding the works. That being said, the course moved a little too quickly for me, and some really cool artists only got about 3 minutes of treatment during lectures. That might be the result of the ambition and scope of the course, though, and no true fault of Professor Barringer himself (who is, by the way, really funny and an engaging lecturer). Assignments are three papers (two short ones, one ~10-pager), along with a midterm and final. Slightly a lot of work for a Cr\/D\/Fail, but not too bad. Grading depends on your TF and varies a bit, from what I understand. The section is fun though!",
    "YES",
    "Amazing course, please take it before you leave yale if you're interested in art! It'll give you a perfect general overview.",
    "YES. This class was amazing. Barringer also does an incredible job contextualizing pieces, bringing in non-Western influences and art. Really exceeded my expectations. You also have section in the YUAG with really cool TA's, which really solidifies your learning.",
    "Such a great survey class for art history!",
    "Yes. Such a wonderful interesting course. Being in the lectures is a cinematic experience and the TAs are so clever and engaging.",
    "I would recomend this class to another student. Yale has such extensive resources on the subject of art history including the art gallery and the library. I believe that all students should take advantage of this opportunity with such a fantastic instructor as Professor Barringer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in getting a general background in art history. This course was right for me because it didn't go too too in depth on the actual artistic technique, but made an important point of the context that the art was created in. Barringer is a great lecturer. There were many assessments that weren't too bad if you'd been paying attention to lecture or did the reading, but you still have to do them.",
    "Yes, great overview, really good lectures",
    "Anyone who wants to learn about art and art history should take this course, I definitely learned a lot.",
    "Please take this course! Professor Barringer is an incredible lecturer. You will learn so much about art, a history that you can showcase at any dinner party.",
    "I wasn't particularly interested in art before taking this course, but now I feel more excited about going to art museums, because I recognize artists and the movements that they were a part of. It's also amazing to have the YUAG, because it provides a great opportunity to get up close to the paintings of some pretty famous artists.",
    "This is an amazing course. As a STEM major, I really appreciated exposure to a breadth of topics that I previously knew absolutely nothing about. A perfect CR\/D course, but even with minimal effort on essays and not reading the textbook it is still possible to do well if you pay attention in section and attend every section because you will learn all the requisite skills to write a good art history paper and analyze art there. Plus, hanging out in the YUAG and learning about Yale's incredible collection is a fantastic experience.",
    "I would absolutely and almost unequivocally recommend this course. It is full of information that will probably interest you merely by virtue of you being a human being, and Barringer is a king lecturer. The workload is manageable (and also radically depends on how much effort you want to put into the course). I started credit\/d and changed halfway through the semester, and have no regrets.",
    "Absolutely. Most ardently, yes. A must-take before you graduate. This course is an amazing lens with which to view the trajectory of Western civilization over the past ~500 years, giving you a much greater appreciation of not only the abundance of awe-inspiring works of art looked at in lecture and section, but also of the intellectual history and influential events of the last 5 centuries which are deeply intertwined with all of said art. Professor Barringer is absolutely brilliant, extremely eloquent, and marvelously engaging. I never wanted lecture to end because Prof. Barringer does such a great job telling the stories of each artist and each piece of art, that you forget you're even in a class. Having weekly section in the YUAG and sometimes the YCBA was absolutely incredible and an experience I will always cherish. Yale's collections are truly excellent, something I think most Yalies are aware of, but don't have time to fully appreciate (because let's face it, all of our gcals look like an unforgiving game of Tetris). Yalies hardly have time to consume vital food nutrients thrice daily, let alone take an afternoon to gaze at art. This class gives you the ability to enjoy the aesthetic fruits of hundreds of years for credit all in all an opportunity not to be missed.",
    "yes I will never walk through an art museum the same way again and this course also gave me the tools to look at culture and cultural artifacts through the lens of history",
    "Absolutely. If you are remotely interested in art, this is a great class to take.",
    "I think this is a great course for those even vaguely interested in art history.",
    "10\/10 would recommend, especially for art history majors. Engaging lectures and low workload make this class a must.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Favorite class that I took all semester. The lectures are super interesting, the professor is super engaging, and the discussion sections in the YUAG offer a really unique experience."
