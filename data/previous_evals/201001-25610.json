    "The way the class is structured in terms of the discussions and assignments creates a great balance of learning to explore social science questions independently and also be encouraged by the instructor to push our thoughts deeper and further. This is probably the best class at FES in terms of being taught to think independently and at the same time challenged to question our assumption.",

Would have been nice to incorporate a more intentional discussion element to the course, since we were often busting at the seams with questions and comments on the texts. Maybe revisit Foucault at the end of the course. Latour was mentioned once in a while in class...perhaps include him?"

This was helpful for the writing process and gave us a chance to discuss the readings, which we didn't have in class. Perhaps this could be an opportunity for the TA to lead discussions?
