   "comments": [
    "Definitely if you have the time and patience. You have to go through a lot, but it's totally worth it to donate to a cause you really care about.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The best part was the hands-on allocation of the grants",
    "Philanthropy in Action was, to put it simply, definitely the most interesting and enriching experience I've had in any class at Yale. We got to read and talk about fascinating ideas, meet some extremely interesting guests, and got the once in a lifetime opportunity to give away $50,000 of real money to organizations doing incredibly worthwhile and meaningful work. I come away from this class with a new outlook on the world, on philanthropy, on myself, a new confidence in what we as college students are capable of, many new friends, and so much more. At the same time, this course was often very, very disorganized, and we never really knew what was going to come around the next bend, constantly being surprised, confused, and just downright caught off guard by what happened. So if you need structure and to know exactly what is going to happen and don't want surprises, then this isn't the course for you. But if you want a one-of-a-kind, potentially life-changing experience, then Philanthropy in Action is the class for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student because I learned a lot through the interactive, real-world experience we were provided. The topic was fascinating and completely relevant to understanding the forces of the social sector in America. However, I would recommend that more precise planning out be made in order to communicate with the students any expectations for the semester. Although I appreciated Professor Thorne's approach, which pushed us to problem-solve and organize ourselves, I think a happy medium can be reach that will guide students to be more organized and engage even more actively with the class material.",
    "Stressful, but worth it.",
    "It's a great way to establish contacts with a bunch of great non-profit organizations and discuss the pros and cons of the current philanthropic culture.",
    "I would recommend this class, but also recognize that it is not for everyone. The reading is very interesting and discussions are generally really great, however, the class was pretty disorganized. Do not take this class if it bothers you to not know what your grade is, if the idea of not knowing what to expect from a given class frustrates you, or if you can't stand the idea of having a disorganized syllabus that is subject to change.Do take this class if you are really interested in learning more about philanthropy\/non-profit work and like the idea of working closely with other students. Also, Professor Thorne is great and puts so much effort into the class. Take this class if you want to get to know a great guy who can serve as a mentor.",
    "If you have an interest in learning about philanthropy and effective giving, and have the time to invest in the class, it will be a great experience. Unlike some seminars, our class really got to know each other, and I was able togain new perspectives from the other students. Professor Thorne is an amazing individual and I'm really glad I was able to meet him through this class.",
    "The course is a very unique mixture between classroom learning and practical applications into the world of nonprofits and philanthropy. The opportunity to interact closely with leaders of philanthropic organizations is not something to pass up. It was a very cool class, I enjoyed spending time with the other students in the seminar& with Professor Thorne, and I'm glad I took it. That said, I was frustrated at times by the lack of clarity and organization.I would recommend taking this class, with the caveats that: a) there's a fair amount of reading assigned, but we didn't always get to in-depth discussion of it, b) it can be a bit disorganized (in part I think b\/c the professor wants students to take initiative in defining the direction of the class).",
    "This was one of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale. The subject matter is fascinating and extremely important, I think, for everyone to know. The course examines philanthropy from a number of angles-- historical, philosophical, practical\/strategic, and more-- and you have the unique opportunity to put what you have learned to use by giving away $50k - $100k. There is A LOT of reading, but it is all really fascinating and in-class discussions are really great, although I wish they were longer and more numerous. Additionally, I wish that we hadmore time to discuss our class's giving strategy in class-- we did most of this discussion outside of class because we had to (there was never enough time in class) but I think it would have been more beneficial \/ productive for us to have these discussions in a structured environment with Professor Thorne's input and ideas. Be prepared to take a lot of personal initiative outside of class-- there is never enough time to get anything done, and professor Thorne is not always the most organized person, so you will have to work overtime to get everything done. Addionally, Professor Thorne schedules a lot of class meetings \/ meetings with guest speakers \/ etc outside of class, so again, be ready to devote a lot of extra time to this class (but if you are really interested in the material, it is absolutely worth it). Finally, if you are interested in taking this class, then DO IT (seriously I loved it!) BUT please know that whether the class gets $50k or $100k to give away depends on the number of students in the class, and if you end up dropping it you will mess this up for everyone else (we had one student drop in the middle of the semester which put us under the limit and all of a sudden our budget was sliced in half). So if you enroll in this class, BE COMMITTED and stick with it-- it's an amazing learning experience so it really will be worth it!"
