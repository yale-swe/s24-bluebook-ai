    "Definitely, especially with Slanski.",
    "Since you did DS HP in the fall, you know what to expect. I can say that the reading for the second semester was much more interesting to me, though the pace is indeed vigorous. Overall, I enjoyed this class thoroughly. Professor Slanski is an amazing professor. Yes, she is tough, but she really works with you to improve your essay writing skills. If you open yourself up to her criticism, you will become much better at mounting an effective argument. She is seriously one of the most inspiring people I have ever met. If you put the time into doing the work and getting to know Professor Slanski, you will be in for one awesome semester.",
    "Yes! H&P is the most eye-opening of the DS courses- you will look at politics in a new way once you realize where all the ideas are coming from.",
    "H&P is difficult. I spent the most time and got the (comparatively) lowest grades on my H&P papers. The readings are long and sometimes confusing. But should you take it? YES. Judging only by the accelerated level of my political discussions now, I can say that I learned a ton, and that everything directly relates to my understanding of past and present politics. This semester lacks the fun Roman historical works of the first semester, but it's much easier to see how authors argue with one another and how historical thought evolves over time. One could argue that this course is essential to understanding all other humanities courses, and is therefore entirely worth the effort.",
    "Slansky is a tough grader. Be forewarned. But she also takes a lot of time to find reasons to be a tough grader. Constructive reasons. And you do get a lot out of what are uniformly good discussions.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The material is very interesting--more political theory than history this semester, but the ideas are all equally relevant today and are fun to grapple with inside and out of class.",
    "DS History and Politics is a course that everybody should have to take. These canonical texts instruct us how to live as a society and also as individuals. In no other history class will you read such an amazing selection of books. The professors in DS (particularly Kathryn Slanski) as well as your fellow students also make this an experience not to miss. By the end of the year, your writing skills will have drastically improved and you will have mastered the five page paper. Thursday nights get tiring but they are manageable, especially compared to the benefit you are receiving. The reading for this section of the program is particularly heavy. The final is somewhat difficult but I don't know if they even count it.",
    "he second semester of history and politics is heavy on political philosophy, which I love, but just know that going in.",
    "Take it take it take it. I had a difficult time and didn't like it as much as the fall, but Prof. Slanski made everything worthwhile.",
    "Professor Slanski knows the curriculum and knows DS. Expect to be pushed hard, but you'll develop an appreciation for the course, for Professor Slanski and for your own abilities. An excellent class."
