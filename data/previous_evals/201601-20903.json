    "Absolutely take this class if you are looking for a solid background in film photography and processing. Professor Donovan is amazing in her dedication to her students and enthusiasm. The assignments consist of weekly contact sheets and 3 critiques of your work. The class is extremely time intensive as the printing and processing is extremely long, but the end products are entirely worth it. You will learn about various photographers, photographic techniques, printing techniques (dodging, burning...) and how to present and talk about your work. Absolutely recommend, whether you have a passion for photography or are looking for something new to try out. And take it with Professor Donovan.",
    "Essential, if only for your mental health. No psets, papers or exams here. Just pictures. Lots of them, sure, and you may spend hours (days?) in the darkroom, but your overstimulated brain will thank you later. Try take it with Dru (but she might be leaving). Make friends with the monitors, they are fascinating people. Respect the space. And most importantly, have fun and take pleasure in printing and photographing.",
    "I would recommend ART 136. If Donovan Dru is the instructor I would strongly recommend ART 136.",
    "This was a phenomenal class, my favorite of the semester. I am not an Art major and I found both the professor and the TA to be supportive and instructive when necessary. I would recommend this class to anyone even slightly interested in photography, it truly changes how you perceive the world and also how you comment on light\/art\/etc (from your crits). I've made some great friends in the class due to its familial nature in the darkroom. Only take the class if you're willing to put time into it as it is important to invest yourself in your work. I had two other labs this semester for MCDB that totaled 15 hours a week and still found myself in the darkroom 10+ hours a week, by choice. Definitely shop the class for the professor that sparks your inspiration to develop as an artist.",
    "I would highly recommend ART 136 to any Yale student."
