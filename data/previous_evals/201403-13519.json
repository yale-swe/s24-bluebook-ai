    "If you can get in, it would be a massive mistake not to join the class. There is truly nothing else like it.",
    "I'm glad I took a class with Harold Bloom. It was indeed a meaningful experience that I'll remember for many years to come. This is the sort of course where you get out of it what you put in to it. It was very, very minimal work.",
    "HUMS 222 is an opportunity to read the most beautiful American poetry with the most venerated professor. If you get into the course, you must take it.",
    "I would say the course is more about Bloom than about the poets we read. I would not recommend the course to another student, though I understand students (as it was with me) will want to study with himbefore they see what doing so is actually like (or not like).",
    "Harold Bloom has read everything, and knows pretty much all there is to know about these poets. Whitman is great. Stevens and Crane are often very difficult and abstruse. Professor Bloom, however, skillfully guides you through even their hardest poems. Seminar is stimulating, a mixture of lecture, discussion (when Professor Bloom feels hes been talking to much) and anecdote from Professor Bloom's youth. It is easy to skip the readings, but you should do them; they dont take too much time and they are absolutely worth it. One final term paper, no tests. Be warned that if the class is held in Professor Blooms house its a half-hour commute each way, so leave plenty of room for the class in your schedule.",
    "Fabulous survey of three great American poets: Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and Hart Crane. We read and discuss these poems together with great attention to everything. I would strongly recommend this course to a fellow student."
