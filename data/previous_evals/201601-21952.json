    "Music 131 is a very accessible and interesting class in music history I would recommend to anyone interested in the subject content, especially people who play instruments. I've been playing music in orchestras for years and learned a lot because the material focuses on the history of the development of music. You also get exposed to a lot of cool music and genres most people don't know about.",
    "AMAZING introduction to music history - always fun and super interesting! Great for anyone with any experience in music, and you'll learn a lot while having a good time.",
    "MUSI 131 is a comprehensive survey of Western Music History since 1800. Beware if you took MUSI 130, because I think 131 is harder and it took a little while to adjust. Don't fear if you don't have a lot of musical experience. Just make that clear to your classmates. It was a bit much to share a discussion floor with multiple YSO performers who have been playing and engaged deeply with classical music for all their lives (and they aren't afraid to show it!) But, a lack of knowledge won't disadvantage you. Your perspective is what professors Mark and Kamala want from you, and yours is probably more unique. Hand-write your notes. That's a weird suggestion to put so early in a course evaluation, but it has never helped so much in a course before. Homework was fun: a little textbook reading, a lot of musical excerpt listening, and some supplementary stuff on Classes v2. Beware the reading quizzes though. I actually think those were harder than the midterm and final... weird, I know. (My highest reading quiz grade was 9\/10, and there were 5 of them.) The two written assignments are short and opinion-based. The longest has a 1250 word maximum. (Combined, the written assignments are 30% of the course.) Combined, the writing quizzes account for 10% of the grade. Attendance and participation are 10% combined. Mark and Kamala signal beforehand the days in which your input is more important. There is one mandatory Met Live in HD screening at Sprague. It was eye-opening and enjoyable. The assignment associated with it is a choice between an informal conversation about it or a short reading response. Having not gone to Met Live in HD prior to this assignment, it is definitely one of the best free performing arts opportunities to watch on this campus. The midterm and final are each 30%. Both have review sessions that are exactly what you need to do well. Take the course if you are interested in 19th, 20th, and 21st century music history. You won't regret it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. I think it's one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, for a few reasons. First, I came into this class with essentially no knowledge of classical music or background in music, and I found the area pretty inaccessible. I left with a host of knowledge (that I don't think I'll soon forget) and a really clear understanding of the development of music over the past 200 years, as well as a framework in which I can fit all kinds of new music and thereby better understand music I hear in the future. I think it's rare at Yale to leave a class with an entirely new set of skills, so I was particularly impressed by this. Second, you get to listen to some of the most incredible music of the past two centuries for your homework. You can't really have better work than this it's contemplative and meditative and an excellent break from the rest of academic life here. Third, it was fun! Not too hard (two short papers, a midterm, a final, and 5 quizzes throughout the semester) and plenty of room for discussion of what you read and listen to in class. Mark and Kamala really wanted to make this accessible and interesting for everyone, and they definitely succeeded.",
    "I definitely recommend this class if you are interested in learning about all types of music from the Romantic period to present! This course covers Romantic music (instrumental and opera), impressionism, serialism, folk music, jazz, minimalism, modernist, and post-modernist music, so it is a very broad survey course. The instructors are great and really make class enjoyable! There were 5 pop quizzes throughout the semester, but they were not bad at all if you read the assignments and paid attention during lecture. The 2 writing assignments were not too hard either, and the midterm and final were not bad as well. You don't have to have any prior music experience (about half of my class couldn't read music), so definitely take this class if you love music already or if you're interesting in learning more about music from a historical perspective!"
