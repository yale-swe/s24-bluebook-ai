    "You learn a lot of vocab and a ton of grammar. I feel like my reading skills improved markedly this term.",
    "I learned a great amount, not only about Arabic grammar, but speaking, reading, and writing skills as well.",
    "I certainly felt a jump in terms of difficulty but also in my level of learning between L3 and L4 Arabic. I felt comfortable forming sentences on the spot and spent less time translating \/ conjugating in my head before doing so. I think that we spend a little too much time on Al-arab and could spend more time practicing speaking in the classroom, although I understand that it is tough with just 50 minute sessions.",
    "I continued to develop skills in reading, writing, listening, and speaking Modern Standard Arabic. I practiced delivering formal presentations."

    "This course is great if you want to learn a lot. Prof. Aziz doesn't assign too much work, and it's a relaxed environment.",
    "I feel that I have a very strong grasp of grammar and of writing, but I would like to have spent more time working on speaking.",
    "Strengths: Professor Aziz and his desire to teach the class well. Other driven students that are passionate to improve. Weaknesses: Spend too much time learning grammar and too little working on conversational Arabic. Use more class time presenting or speaking in Arabic.",
    "Strengths: Professor Aziz is a wonderful and kind instructor. He truly cares about his students and their success. Our TA, Susan, was also excellent. I found her sections to be highly engaging, and I learned quite a bit about culture and dialect. Weaknesses: We repeated a lot of material this semester. I would have appreciated a more rigorous curriculum. Additionally, we covered some rather obscure topics that seemed irrelevant to everyday life and conversation, while I still do not feel confident discussing typical subjects or conducting myself in a daily activity."

    "I would. Be prepared to do the work.",

    "Yes, especially as a high level Arabic course, it is the only way to continue learning \/ practicing the language at that level. Maybe would encourage supplementing the class with going to Arabic dinner or practicing speaking with a native speaker weekly.",
    "Yes, L4 is a necessary step to becoming proficient in Arabic."
