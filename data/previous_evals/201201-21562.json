    "If you have a topic that you are interested in and passionate about, write a senior essay because you will get SO much out of it. If you don't really have a topic you're passionate about, take a senior seminar instead because the essay is a lot of work.",
    "Senior Essay is a lot of work. In reality it's only 1\/36 of your credits at Yale but it feels like so much more. My work in other classes definitely was affected by the amount of time and energy Senior Essay took up. But it was very much worth it. The chance to work on my own project and do my own research was very rewarding. Make sure to pick a good advisor and that he or she is into your topic as much as you are! My advisor was enthusiastic about the work I was doing, so he challenged me to read more criticism, think on a higher level, and write better. If you have a topic you are passionate about, I would highly recommend doing the independent senior essay. My Yale experience would not have been the same without it.",
    "I highly recommend writing a senior essay.",
    "N\/A",
    "YES! Write a senior essay! It's amazing to spend an entire semester on a project purely of your design.",
    "Writing a senior essay was a great experience, both because I enjoyed working semi-independently on an extended research project about a topic I had previously found interesting in passing, and because having learned something about how I respond to such projects will be useful making future plans. Getting to work more closely with my advisor was also a tremendous opportunity. The senior essay, obviously, requires a fair degree of self motivation: I worked hard throughout the term, and still found myself rushing to complete large amounts of work close to deadlines, in the absence of a class structure. That said, although I don't know yet how realistic a sense of graduate-level work the senior essay provides, I would recommend writing one to anyone interested in graduate work, and anyone interested in following up on earlier coursework with a more in-depth project."
