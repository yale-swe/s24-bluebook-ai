   "comments": [
    "Even if you're an econ major (and not an econ-math major), consider taking this class (and 136) if you like math at all. By taking 135 and 136 rather than 131, you have to take 1 fewer elective, and you'll have a much more solid understanding of regression\/stats.",
    "Great instructor, and a good way to find out if you really are interested in statistics.",
    "A basic intro stats course, with a sprinkling of easy-to-medium proofs. Little to no \"econ\" needed. (Granted, there was a lot of irritating summation notation on the final, although that's more rigorous record keeping than original thought.) Surprisingly not very difficult, despite what I'd heard from others, although your mileage may vary depending on your previous math preparation. Not the most interesting subject in the universe, but very important to understanding more interesting subjects in the universe. Problem sets and readings were quick; exams extremely easy. Prof. Armstrong is fairly good; the lectures aren't going to rock anyone's world (it's stats, after all), but they're captivating enough.",
    "Fine. Material is a bit dry but worth knowing",
    "A required course you have to take for the math econ, but if you want some more rigor and a better understanding, I think it may be of interest to examine a probability theory course instead or a higher level probability course (maybe grad) in lieu of this. This class was literally just glorified AP stats with integrals. Don't know how much I learned, and it was very hard to pay attention in class. Good that the book is tested, so essentially as long as you know the book you're fine (which is very easy, as the book is readable). I don't blame Armstrong, who tries his best to make it interesting. I just feel like the material sucked.",
    "Stats and probability - not a hard class, but the lecture is not super useful in understanding the concepts thoroughly. You have to do the problem sets to figure out what we talked about in class. Fair exams but harsh curve.",
    "This was probably one of the most useful classes I have taken at Yale. Although in the beginning it felt like the things we were learning were kind of random and useless, by the end I realized that this class had many real world applications in the finance fields. I would recommend this class to anyone with a stronger math background looking to go into something finance related.",
    "The best introduction to probability and statistics I shopped. A rigorous approach to probability and statitstics that provides good fundamentals and builds on itself in an accessible way. The textbook is organized and pairs great theoretical fundamentals with real world applications. The professor is very dry, however, and teaches by the book with little perspective to add in lecture.",
    "No frills attached, solid course for the information. Not too difficult, so no reason not to take it if that's a concern.",
    "Yea, it was pretty run of the mill probability and statistics. Useful for applied math, econ, and some other STEM majors.",
    "Take it if you must. It's necessary as an Econ and Math major. It's not a terrible course, but it's not life-changing, either.",
    "Basic probability and statistics. Most of the stuff can be learned from the textbook. Homework is really not that bad, and the tests are fair. Tim is a good professor overall. He knows his stuff, but he isn't the best lecturer - he stutters a lot (but he's also really cute!)",
    "It's what the title suggests - Probability and Statistics. We learned about some distributions and statistical tests. I would recommend. I felt that I leaned quite a bit.",
    "ECON 135 is a rewarding course that allows students to begin diving deeper into statistics and probability, beyond the level of interaction they experienced in high school. The course also builds a good foundation for ECON 136.",
    "I would summarize ECON 135 as a straightforward econometrics class that teaches you the basics of probability theory and I would recommend it to a student who was interested in math and economics."
