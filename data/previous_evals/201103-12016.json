   "comments": [
    "This class is fantastic. You learn a lot about the cold war period in several countries across Latin America, and this is all material that you will not learn any where else. The class discussions are lively, Professor Joseph brings in truly fantastic guests, and readings are very engaging. All around, this is a fantastic class!",
    "I would recommend this class! Know that there is a large amount of reading.",
    "Yes and no.Yes to those who are interested in this huge continent and no to those who are not. If you are not interested in this area, it would be somewhat miserable. And also this course focuses more on social history, rather than political history.This course did not teach you too many methods but Professor Joseph picks tons of interesting materials for us to read. If you really want to learn, you would learn a lot!",
    "Fantastic class. GilJo is the man with a plan. Might be a touch frustrating if you come in with any previous knowledge on the region in the era, but ultimately a very cool class.",
    "This is an intensive seminar on revolutionary movements in Latin America, focusing especially on the changes occurring during the Cold War era. The class allows you to read and think about U.S. involvement in Latin America, what constitutes a revolution, and what drives repression. Professor Joseph is a fantastic teacher. Take it if you get in!",
    "If you are a history major interested in Latin America, yes take this class.",
    "Definitely. Some people had previous experience or knowledge in the subject, some didn't. Either way you learn a lot coming out.",
    "Take this class, it's definitely one of the best seminars I've ever taken.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any Yale student who is interested in learning about the Cold War and its impact on Latin America. Absolutely rewarding class.",
    "History 372 is essentially an analysis of Latin America during the Cold War. Each week you focus on a different country (though 2 weeks are devoted to Nicaragua, since there's so much material and it's one of Professor Joesph's specialities), which keeps the class exciting and entertaining. If for some reason you're not excited by the reading for one week, you'll be looking at something new the next. I truly loved the course -- I felt that the information we learned definitely improved my depth of understanding of Latin America. Moreover, many of the things we learned are relevant outside of the region -- left-wing revolutions, right-wing coups, the \"third world\" during the Cold War, etc.",
    "This is a class that delves into the political conflicts faced by many within various Latin American countries, such as Chile, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Colombia, and Cuba. You watch many films and do many readings.",
    "Absolutely. You would be a fool not to take this if you got in. Prof. Joseph is wonderful. The readings and films are consistently interesting. The journal and final paper give students considerable freedom to explore their own interests in depth."
