    "I would highly recommend Ital 110 with Kyle Skinner to any student who wants a fun language class. There is work, but Kyle made the class totally worth it, and put in extra effort to make sure everyone did well on graded work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to fellow students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. You get to have fun while learning a new language. Even though Italian might not be the most \"useful\" language in the real world, it is very interesting to learn and you can study abroad in Italy for L3 and L4.",
    "If you are interested in learning Italian this is definitely a great intro course.",
    "Teaches the fundamentals of Italian at a reasonable pace. Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from an introductory course in foreign language, so if you're interested in learning Italian, go for it.",
    "I would definitely recommend Italian, especially with Kyle. It's a fun language to learn and we grew very close as a class. There's a fair amount of busy work but it didn't feel like too much of a burden, nor was it especially stressful. Even after just L1, I feel like I can hold basic conversations in Italian.",
    "I would absolutely recommend taking Italian courses.",
    "This class is great and you learn a lot but you have to keep up with material. I would recommend it to other students."
