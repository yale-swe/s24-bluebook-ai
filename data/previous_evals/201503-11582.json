    "If you are reading this, you have probably seen countless positive reviews for this class. I am here to warn you DO NOT BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ. I am a non-art major who took this class to broaden my horizons and try something new. I was disappointed to discover that, while this class teaches some useful photoshop and printing skills, it is much more about discussing what art MEANS rather than the mechanics of actually making it. That would have been fine (though admittedly not what I was looking for) except that the environment was incredibly judgmental and at times hostile. Ka-Man clearly knows a lot about digital photography, but she does not create a welcoming environment, particularly for non art people. On at least one occasion she made disparaging comments about Yale students who go into finance and consulting and, on the whole, seemed to look down upon people who do not view the world exactly as she does. What pushed me over the edge, however, was the way she spoke to me when I went to her for advice after receiving some feedback on my crits (which I got months after the crits happened). During our conversation, she told me I shouldnt feel the way I did, accused me of being closedminded and having no vision, and told me I brought anger to the class. (I also feel I should note that she cited the reason she thought I was closed minded as coming from my unwillingness to explore a classmates suggestion that I take nude portraits for my next crit. I explained that I was uncomfortable about doing that, but apparently did so in a closed-minded way). I dont want to come across as a crazy person who is just on a rant, but I want to make sure prospective students know what theyre getting into before they take the class. If you are not an art major, you will likely receive some rude criticism and will get a mediocre grade. Youll also learn some good skills, so if you have thick skin and a CR\/D left, go for it. But dont take it for a letter grade.",
    "Great class! I really learned how to look at art. Keep in mind this is an art class, not a technical photography class. You will do some photoshop, but it's mostly looking at art. Not that that's a bad thing, but I wish I had known that more going in. It's also a lot of work.",
    ". Don't do this to yourself. The workload is pretty low but there's definitely less annoying humanities classes out there if you wanna fulfill your requirements. You won't learn much about how to use a camera or Photoshop but rather engage in never-ending discussions about the meaning of what I would call some pretty random photographs. While it's understandable that Ka-Man is worried about some students taking a photography not as serious as their science and math classes for example, if you come late or miss a class she will actually take it personal. I should have dropped it.",
    "Definitely worth taking. Focusses on both technical and artistic details.",
    "Art 138 is an intense intro class that offers a window into an alternative framework for education at the \"ivy\". The class covers both the technical and theoretical aspects of photography and enabled students to really drastically improve over just three months. It was amazing to compare both the first and last crits of students over a single semester and this is really thanks to Ka-Man's methodology and the care of the two Teaching Assistants. The class does not only enable tremendous technical growth but most of all, it enables students to develop a visual language in a way that feels personal and important."
