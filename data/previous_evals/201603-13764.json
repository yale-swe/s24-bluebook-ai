   "comments": [
    "The preliminary understanding of sound design. I really like to do the homework of this class, very creative. And because it's a big class, it's very good to share everybody's idea within the class.",
    "The framework of the course is great and very well organized as David stays on track with the synopsis for each class. Through the course, I could be introduced to an overall view to sound design and critical listening. David is very articulative and makes the knowledge very accessible for someone who has never had any experience in sound deign and instrumentation.",
    "This was an extremely valuable introduction to the more conceptual and aesthetic aspects of sound design. Some things were a bit basic but it was really nice to put terminology to some of the concepts and practices we might take for granted.",
    "Probably the only design class that offers us a syllabus. A syllabus is like a unicorn in the design department, so we were all EXTREMELY grateful when David had definite deadlines for all the assignments. David also creates a very comfortable and neutral environment. Everyone's opinions are valuable and heard.",
    "The course is well structured. Having a concrete course outline allows both the lecturer and student to anticipate learning outcome. Listening based learning also broaden student's hearing experience for both various kind of sound and music from different culture.",
    "the teaching style was especially valuable in Introduction to Sound Design. By serving as sort of a round robin setting, where each individual student had the opportunity to show their work with their peers provided both helpful critiques and new perspectives on the subject matter at hand.",
    "I think the class is very well structured and the syllabus helps a lot. I think the content is very interesting and I learnt a lot from David and from my classmates",
    "I loved that this course allowed some breathing room, a pause for creativity in an otherwise often too- crammed daily routine. The homework assignments were fun and promoted play and engagement with the subject matter. Also appreciated that information was shared in verbal and written form. Appreciated the sharing of projects and the chance to learn about classmates through this very personal medium. Also was grateful for the chance to open up my listening process. Not just take music for granted, but begin to see how deeply we are embedded and have a stake in the aural environment of a piece and how much it affects storytelling."

   "question_text": "Are there adjustments, additions or deletions that might be beneficial?",
   "comments": [
    "Maybe more guide from the teacher? Also because it is a big class, it takes a majority of time to talk with class, which is good but not helpful for personal improvement.",
    "I would be great if, besides what is already in the course, to spend one or two classes introducing the class to each theatre space at the school, from a sound perspective. As we would all be working in these spaces for productions, some knowledge about the nature of each space and how it influences the perception of sound in different configurations would be really helpful.",
    "Nope.",
    "I think the content of the course was appropriate.",
    "Possibly meeting twice a week instead of once a week.",
    "I feel like this semester was great and I think it will be exiting if we could try to do next semester something that involves creating our original sound",
    "An initial tutorial on how to use some of the sound recording equipment that could be available to us might have been really fun and useful. Technical challenges can be frustrating barriers to creativity."

    "The construction outside is very present, and the noise becomes very interrupting for this particular course",
    "Nope.",

   "comments": [
    "The teaching\/learning environment is very positive and participative.",
    "I really value David's insight and generosity. His passion for the subject matter is extraordinarily inspiring and his encouragement and individualized attention really mean a lot.",
    "A+ I'm going to miss this class a lot. David was great, and it was also a great group of students. I learned a lot and also had a lot of fun.",
    "Sound isolation of the room could be improved.",
    "I appreciate the environment for both myself and my peers to learn more about sound design as a society as well as individually.",
    "I think David is a great teacher. He makes all the students involved in the class and the conversations are always interesting. David is very coherent and I think the assignments are also clear and not too hard(in a good way). I'm very happy to take part in this class.",
    "I thought it was an open and engaging learning environment with a professor who is eager to listen and explore what we bring to the table. I looked forward to this class every week. As is true with sound design, the silence between elements is as critical to the whole as musical notes. David offered us some quietude to contemplate and appreciate things more fully. I thank him for that."

    "David Budries is a great and enthusiastic teacher, and the class was always interesting and enjoyable, and there's nothing I would change about the format. But as a costume designer I wonder, when our time is so overbooked this year with productions, if it's really necessary? I just felt stretched too thin this year and like I unfortunately couldn't give my full effort to the class.",
    "Good class. Don't change it!"
