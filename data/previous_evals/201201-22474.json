   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you're willing to devote time. It can be challenging for biology majors without background in Matlab. A lot of time went into understanding how to program rather than learning about how to link the biology to the equations. A background in math helps a lot.I would start it credit\/D\/Fail first.",
    "I would recommend the class. It's interesting, and most of the work is problem sets which is nice.",
    "If you have interests in both applied math, physics, and biology, you should definitely take this class. It opened me up to an entirely new discipline that I had only known about via the buzzwords of \"systems biology\" and \"systems medicine.\" This class is probably one of the only ones at Yale that actually made me seriously reconsider the direction of my career. Be prepared for long problem sets, and a somewhat unorganized class structure, but you will learn a ton and it will be worth it.",
    "Do not take this class just for fun. Everyone seemed to be generally pretty confused the entire semester, as the lectures did not relate to the problem sets very often. One problem set per week, usually involving MatLab. Some of the coding was fairly complicated, so make sure to learn MatLab well in the first few weeks. Project at the end of the semester was a pain and the assignment was vague. Lectures were pretty bad and confusing, but since they didn't really relate to the problem sets, attendance was not necessary.",
    "It's a good course to take if you're interested in learning about how to use Matlab in a biological context. You may end up learning more matlab than actual biology though.",
    "This course is a survey of the methods of systems biology, with an emphasis on computational techniques. Pretty good if you want to do research in that direction. Otherwise, still fairly interesting, and the professors are decent.",
    "If you have a math\/physics\/compsci background, most of the course will seem pretty easy, especially the HW. The week-to-week demands are small, outside of one bad HW assignment. The final project, however, is very open ended and takes up a LARGE amount of time during the last 2 weeks of the semester. I feel like the course would be better served if physicists and biologists were taught separately, since the math involved in it is trivial for physics students, and the biological terminology is probably trivial for biology students. A good course to take if you're interested in the material, but realize that the course is essentially a survey of the key papers for the field of Systems Biology. No textbook is officially used, very basic MATLAB programming involved."
