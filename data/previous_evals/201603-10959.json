   "comments": [
    "I learned how to do data management on Stata, which is incredibly useful. Professor Thomas teaches you what you will not see in other undergraduate classes, including how to program. This is a very useful class for anyone who will be working with Stata post-graduation.",
    "I learned a lot about data management that I will never see in any of my other coursework, and of course, I now have an incredible knowledge of STATA and its capabilities.",
    "I became very proficient with foundational Stata knowledge and feel that I am now ready to use these skills for a career. This course is one of the few at Yale where I believe the skills learned would have been nearly impossible to learn anywhere else; as JT always said, there isn't any single textbook that could teach us what we learned in the class.",
    "Deep understanding of Stata as a data analytical program. Far more nuanced understanding of programs capabilities and nuances compared to Applied Quantitative Analysis or even Econometrics. Considerable experience applying lessons to real data and real world problems.",
    "Tons of data management, stats analysis, and general Stata skills that are incredibly relevant & useful",
    "I really feel like I learned the basics of coding in STATA. This course made me want to learn everything about coding!",
    "GLBL191 is hands down the most practical, well-taught statistics course offered at Yale. A lot of time will be spent figuring out why your code isn't running, but the questions that you explore throughout the course are real research questions with applications to solving real world problems, which is going to be immensely helpful for senior theses and the like.",
    "This is one of the most useful classes I've taken at Yale. It taught me everything I need to know about stata, and I wouldn't have been able to do half of my capstone work without it. It's even going to help me tremendously with thesis.",
    "Learned so many tools for data processing and analysis. Easily one of the most useful courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Advanced stata work, mainly."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "We did not finish all of the material. We could have moved more quickly. This class would also likely be better if we met twice a week for a shorter amount of time. It is difficult to focus for such a long block, especially when each student is staring at his\/her own computer.",
    "This course does an excellent job of teaching a broad basket of essential Stata skills that are very useful in a variety of applications. Furthermore, the final research project gives excellent hands on experience using the tools learned in class. The only potential weakness of the course would be that we didn't get though all the material we had planned.",
    "Deep understanding of Stata as a data analytical program. Far more nuanced understanding of programs capabilities and nuances compared to Applied Quantitative Analysis or even Econometrics. Considerable experience applying lessons to real data and real world problems. Found the flexibility and depth of the final project to be one of the great strengths of the class, especially given how invested JT is in making the project meaningful for every student. Additionally, the problem sets were creative and challenging without being pedantic or unnecessarily confusing. Everything about this class was intentionally applicable, intuitive, and tailored to the real world. The only improvement would be getting more regular feedback on assignments. Sometimes it would take over a month to receive problem set corrections, which made it tough to know if you were on top of the material. Relatively minor issue though given how invested JT is in his students.",
    "Amazing, unique class that teaches data management and stats analysis in a practical, hands-on approach. The small class size and opportunities for one-on-one learning are great. Wish we spent more time on regressions, though, since it would've been helpful going into the final paper (although the one-on-one meetings during reading period definitely made up for it).",
    "This course is excellent! The greatest strength of this course is the professor, Justin Thomas. The professor provides all the material you could ever want to learn. His notes are excellent. He provides all the feedback you could want and goes out of his way to help you understand the material. I really wish he taught more graduate classes.",
    "It's pretty fantastic as is, but it would benefit from quicker turnover in feedback regarding previous problem sets and assignments.",
    "Very clearly taught, very fair, very useful, very manageable workload. Prof Thomas is amazing. Honestly zero weaknesses.",
    "I didn't feel like two hours a week was enough; the course moved slowly for most of the time and then super quickly at the end.",
    "weaknesses: could have been more on regression, which was needed intensely for the final project but not covered extensively in the course."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, this is great for anyone who wants to develop technical, practical Stata skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if that student is coming in with a more quantitive background, but has interests in the social sciences. For me, it didn't provide a trove of brand new information in terms of statistical methods, but it altered my perspective on data and has given me a lot more things to consider in terms of conducting analyses.",
    "Yes, anyone who intends to use any form of statistics in the future should take this course; there aren't many other opportunities to learn this broad of a cross section of high-level Stata material, so this course is a rare find.",
    "Absolutely phenomenal class. I somewhat grudgingly took this requirement for Global Affairs, and honestly it became one of my favorite classes (and Im not a big quant person). JT is one of the best professors Ive encountered at Yale. He has a gift for turning complex topics into intuitive, applicable, digestible lessons, and he is incredibly invested in making sure students get the most out of the class. He is super supportive and understanding, and I feel like I can go to him with literally any question. The material itself is actually super engaging when it's coming from a great professor and organized around real world data sets and a self-driven final project, so I actually enjoyed doing the work far more than expected. If you want a better understanding of statistics and honestly the best practicum in Stata, take this class!",
    "Great way to learn STATA. JT is AWESOME",
    "Absolutely! Take this after you've taken AQA. Doesn't require a ton of stats knowledge (just the basics). If you're thinking of actually going into research or doing real social science, this is the way to go.",
    "Most definitely! JT breaks down the material in a way that even the most technologically challenged students can understand and learn.",
    "Most definitely - this should just be an additional global requirement, because I learnt more from this class than approaches to international development, and the skills picked up through this course would have been enormously useful in that too.",
    "For sure. If you're writing a thesis, or if your capstone involves stata, this course will be so useful. My capstone needed a lot of stata work, and this class taught me all the essentials (keeping in mind I'd already taken econometrics, glbl121, and glbl225.) Prof Thomas is very helpful, gives you a lot of his time, and is extremely clear and fair as a professor. The workload is very manageable. It's not a fun course, but prof Thomas makes it good. I defintely recommend.",
    "Definitely!",
    "yes, any chance to learn with professor thomas is a good one."
