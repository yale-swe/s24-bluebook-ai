    "This is the best course I have taken at Yale. I learned so much about microeconomics and how firms interact with each other. The title of this course sounds boring, but the course is actually incredibly interesting and engaging.",
    "different models of imperfect competition, including monopolies, duopolies (Cournot, Bertrand, with modifications), auctions, markets with asymmetric informations. learned how to work through and evaluate different models, how conclusions follow from assumptions and framework",
    "I learned about industrial organization, through duopoly\/oligopoly models, other product models, investment strategies\/mergers and some game theory.",
    "The most important thing I learned is how to used math to frame decision making in business. We face a different business scenario in each lecture, from auctions to duopoly to durable goods. This is probably the most mathy econ class I've taken. If you like multivariable calculus, you will love this class! Each lecture is excellent and you walk away with something new and stimulating.",
    "I learned a lot about some of the key theoretical models in the field of industrial organisation."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "All strengths, no weaknesses!",
    "The clarity and style of the lectures is definitely the one of the biggest strength of this course. Professor Haile explains the material extremely clearly. The format of the course (all on the chalkboard with no slides) makes the course really easy to follow, and in the rare times when something is not clear, makes it easy to pinpoint what you don't understand. Problem sets are also clear and the exams are very fair.",
    "Strengths: Prof Haile is a very good lecturer, very clear, lectures tied to psets and to exams very explicitly, what we learned in class was covered on assignments and exams, and vice versa Weaknesses: none",
    "Prof. Haile is the best lecturer I've had in the Econ dept. thus far. He's very clear, and gives great intuitive explanations for what he's doing. The fact I could do psets just using his notes speaks to how good of a lecturer he was. I think having some sort of textbook more in line with what we do could be nice though, but I'm not sure if that's even possible.",
    "In my mind this class is absolutely perfect. Prof. Haile is very smart, clear, well-paced and eloquent. He is always willing to take students' questions in class. Go to his office hours!",
    "The strengths of this course are the instructor and the course material -- Philip Haille has been the best Prof. I have had at Yale by a long shot. He is incredibly clear, provides a TON of intuition for all of the contents, is a fair grader and is incredibly organized. I think this is the first time I've not had to be on the other end of a mad dash at the end of semester because the instructor didn't pace things properly! The material is super interesting as well: game theory is an incredibly powerful tool, and it was great to see it presented formally before taking 351 next semester.",
    "I think this course was hard to keep up with during the course of the class. The information is tough to digest and learn in order to complete the psets."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! If you are an econ major you need to take this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other Yale students. It was undoubtedly the best economics course I've taken at Yale so would highly recommend for econ majors. Even for non-econ majors who've taken intermediate micro, it makes that class worth it because it allows you to see all the really cool applications of what you learn in that course. If you're at all interested in management consulting, corporate strategy, markets, how to think strategically, etc., you would find this course very interesting.",
    "absolutely, a very good follow-up to 121, useful as a theoretical introduction to the more exciting models that examine more realistic market structures\/conditions than 121 does",
    "Yes! You learn from a great professor, build understanding in a very cool field of economics, and I even made money directly from this class when we discussed auctions! What other econ classes can you say you made money off of??",
    "Take this class! It's like intermediate micro but with real math. You gain insights about game theory and much more. It's the best econ class I've taken so far (I'm a junior).",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student provided it is with Philip Haille."
