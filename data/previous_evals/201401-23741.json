    "artist recreation was fun",
    "This is a very useful class for students who have little to no experience with theatrical scenic painting",
    "Generally it is a very good class learning from yourself and fr others. Yet I wonder if it is necessary for the two consequent class requirement",
    "The class was excellent. I could learn different skills and technique in each class that would definitely useful for production. Not only I could improve my own skills of painting, but also I got a better time-estimate of finishing works with a particular paint treatment. I believe it is very useful to know when we design set and communicate with scenic artists. It was also a great opportunity to paint in a large scale and see how it looks from the distance, which I tend to forget to do since I am dealing with tiny tiny scale model everyday. I believe that set designers and scenic artists should have a good collaboration, and i think it is important that the set designer understand better about \"scenic painting\" (- not just \"painting\" ). By that means, Ru's scenic painting class was very good because we could work on assignment from a perspective of scenic painter's eyes. The class was also enjoyable because we could work with other set designers. There were always new and interesting things to share during the critique."
