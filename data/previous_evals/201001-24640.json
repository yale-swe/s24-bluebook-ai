    "amazing class. really cements your knowledge of hebrew. plus it's great to have been with the same teacher and students for 4 semesters! this class contains lots of poetry, songs, tv shows, films, etc. that supplemented the grammar in a fantastic way that brought the material to life and helped connect us with israeli culture.plus ayala is incredible. at this point she knows all of us so well and can really plan stuff that she knows we'll like and will help us. she cares so much and puts so much into designing a personalized class. i would definitely recommend sticking with hebrew long enough to complete L4!",
    "Take it, it will effortlessly improve your Hebrew. There is a fair amount of work though. If you made it through Hebrew 3 then this will be straightforward.",
    "Take this class! It is the natural continuation of L3 and you want to stay in Hebrew until you learn all the binyanim. While I am not fluent, I am much more confident in my Hebrew skills than I was after L3. The class is a lot of fun and you learn a lot. Ayala is amazing.",
    "A good continuation of the Modern Hebrew track. A lot more reading and writing than previous semesters, and the grammar moves much more quickly. You learn a lot though, and it is definitely worth it!",
    "L4 Hebrew is a great class, definitely take it, especially with Ayala!",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone who wants to fulfill their language requirement without ruining their GPAs. These are the professors you'll want to write your recommendations because you'll really get to know them.",
    "I would highly recommend L4 to any student who has completed L3. It is a good mix of topics and though difficult, Ayala makes it possible for every student to do his or her best.",
    "I would recommend it if you have a strong basis in Hebrew and are ready to work hard."
