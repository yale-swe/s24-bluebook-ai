   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Professor Harries highly, as the course will not run again it wouldn't do me any good to recommend it! Professor Harries investigates a subject from his own and opposing perspectives, supporting either argument within the discourse of philosophy.",
    "The course is a rigorous survey of the philosophy of art. I would recommend the class, but with the caveat that Professor Harries pursues his own agenda in the course and often refers to the readings only to support his own project.",
    "What it says on the tin.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the importance of art's relationship to philosophy and religion.",
    "This is a small (20 person) course with more of a lecture than seminar format. The course reads works of philosophy that deal with art and \"the sacred,\" and looks at churches, pieces of art both antique and modern, and delves into a conversation around what art is and how it is, or is not, related to transcendence. Very interesting for people interested in philosophy, art theory, architecture, or theology. Heavy reading, FANTASTIC 2 hour once a week class meetings, and one substantial paper at the end of the course. Great great great.",
    "I would highly recommend Philosophy 700.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Harries' class was my favorite of the semester, and I looked forward to it each week. The issues and ideas raised in the class were fascinating. It was great to hear someone talk about art the way Professor Harries does.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. I am from a different department and felt that it was a great exposure to philosophies pertaining to art and sacred. Ifeither of those topics are of interest, then this is definitely a worthwhile course."

   "comments": [
    "This course had nothing to do with my discipline.",
    "\"Art and the Sacred\" helped me articulate one of my fundamentalquestions about aesthetic experience, which may yet become the subjectof my thesis.",
    "I found Dr. Harries welcoming to my final paper topic, which allowed me to think through a few important issues that I thought were raised by the course. New intellectual vistas have opened for me because of taking this course.",
    "This course gave a fantastic look into philosophical thinking surrounding art and transcendence. I read works I had never been exposed to before. Course lectures were some of the best at Yale. The paper I wrote for this course was a preparation for my thesis.",
    "This was the first course I've taken that really emphasized the study of German art, which is the field I hope to pursue. Professor Harries introduced me to artists and works I had not seen before, and I am immensely grateful for this!"
