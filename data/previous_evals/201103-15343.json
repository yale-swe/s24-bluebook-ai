    "Learn basic Portuguese. Present tense, Past tense, simple future, and some conversation-simple words.",
    "(1) If you're looking at these reviews because you're trying to decide what unusual language to take, then by all means, CHOOSE PORTUGUESE! Brazil is the future: the party-throwing, literature-writing, money-making future. Portuguese won't kill you like Arabic or Chinese, and I bet it will secretly end up being way more useful, too. Brazil has...- beaches that look like screensavers- the most danceable music ever- great literature (look up Machado de Assis)- the Amazon River and enormous plateaus like the ones from the movie \"Up\"- cities like Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paolo, and SalvadorDO IT!(2) If you're looking at these reviews because you're trying to decide what teacher to take, then TAKE IT WITH PAOLO MOREIRA! He is a gentleman and a scholar. He's really smart and funny, and he never talks down to you the way some L1 instructors will. Paolo also made us Brazilian candy one time. What a boss.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "Portuguese 110 is a fun L1 class with a relatively light workload. I even wanted more homework sometimes because I didn't always have the discipline to study on my own and tests could come as a shock. However, if you can get Paulo, going to class will be incredibly fun. He's entertaining, engaging, and teaches you to speak. His tests are also easier than Marta's. Just make sure you practice writing and reading on your own (honestly no homework compared to other L1 courses)",
    "I really enjoyed the course, but I won't know until next semester whether I actually learned anything. Professor Moreira is a really good teacher, and Portuguese is a fun language.",
    "I would highly recommend it."
