   "comments": [
    "Yes, it's the must-take course for those interested in critical theory and\/or taking the qualifying exam.",
    "It is an in-depth study of a narrow selection of texts. It requires drive on the part of the individual student to benefit from the class in full, and there are some glaring omissions from the syllabus (and certain things are dealt with very summarily, whereas others are dealt with in much greater depth), but the class is a rare chance to study in such close proximity to a professor of such incredible regard and high-standing.",
    "Philosophy 701, From Weber to Derrida, is a rigorous overview of European political thought in the 20th century. The course examines, in particular, the meaning of rationality in the political and philosophical sense, as well as themes such as historiography and the public sphere. I would highly recommend this course to students who seek an intermediate to advanced survey of contemporary political theory."

   "comments": [
    "It deepens my understanding of critical theory and helps my dissertation\/research profoundly.",
    "This course does not directly contribute to my dissertation research, but I had not taken a great many political philosophy classes in the past, and, as such, to take a class of such calibre was both a daunting but simultaneously rewarding 'induction.'",
    "This course provided an extremely important contribution to preparations for my doctoral research. I have a much better sense and familiarity with the significant themes of political theory and philosophy in continental philosophy."
