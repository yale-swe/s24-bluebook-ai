    "The intersectionality of movement and the vast areas of research that it covers",
    "I learned how to look at the body as a form of research and analyzed its connection to technology and history.",
    "The class was a useful introduction to various approaches to movement research, ranging from attempts at photographing movement, to techniques of inscription, to ways of writing about movement, and more.",
    "I have learned so much in this course about how to talk about and think through movement.",
    "I learned a lot about different methods of looking at, thinking about, and analyzing movement.",
    "This class was incredible - we managed to cover a great breadth of material without it feeling shallow, partly because everything we were learning was really rooted to embodied experience and embodied knowledge."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was a natural discussion environment and the movement aspect helped the class understand the research from a more hands on perspective. However, there was little guidance about the work expected and at times the discussions felt confusing even though I did the readings.",
    "The structure of the class time itself is great. The movement exercises were a great way to start class and led to good discussions afterward.",
    "I loved doing the readings for the course, and having the chance to reflect upon them in as free a manner as the class responses. I appreciated also that we were able to read each other's responses and, in doing so, get a better sense of how everyone in the class was thinking through the material. Beginning the class with a movement exercise each time also helped us get into the material much better. As a small note, I also really enjoyed that we did the first sharing about our final projects in little groups instead of with the whole class because it pushed us each to have more of a conversation about the work, instead of it being more of a one-way exchange due to the limits of time.",
    "The course is solid. Very strong course with clear ends.",
    "It was really interesting to look at the different ways to conduct movement research; however, for the final project, you get minimal feedback and instruction of what the professor is actually looking for. She then grades like you had this information - which is unfair."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, its a great course to take because of the movement aspect. I had never taken a course that consisted of moving for half the class",
    "I would, this class is great if youre interested in how dance, art, research and technology can intersect.",
    "I would! I think the class really helped me think through questions related to movement research that have been on my mind. It also gave me an opportunity to be acquainted with a wide variety of writers\/ artists\/ scientists who were doing related work that I might not otherwise have encountered in the way that I was approaching my research. The final project for the class is really open-ended, which is great if you have a project already in mind but might be a little more confusing\/ harder if you would prefer to have more guidance or more parameters within which to work and imagine.",
    "Yes. I think movement research is foundational research.",
    "Definitely! Professor Coates is an amazing instructor, and the things we cover in this class are relevant to any student."
