    "a great and unique course for CS people where you learn more practical details about how things work rather than abstract ideas about how something -could- work. The assignments and projects let you explore ideas you like from the course (though if you don't like the assignment topics, too bad,) which is awesome.Prof. Yang has high standards and expects students to put in a lot of work into the course. The assignments are long. That said, he is aware of this and is reasonable his assessments.",
    "This course was disorganized and featured a massive workload, but it also covered all of the topics on the syllabus. Professor Yang will push you to understand new technology and actually work with them. It's not easy or pretty, but if you know what you're getting into, it is rewarding.",
    "Internet-Scale Applications is a lot like Newtorks, but with more work and ambiguity. You have to be able to learn how to use Amazon EC2 and Hadoop independently, since the problems sets use them extensively but they're covered only superficially in class. Although there's no doubt that working on the Amazon cloud is cool, it also takes a lot more effort than writing code for the Zoo does. And you have to figure it out on your own. The class lectures mainly focus on how to design large-scale systems, rather than on how to do the problem sets specifically. The can be a lot of fun, because the lectures are very interesting. It can also be very frustrating when you're trying to figure out some poorly-documented technology just in order to do a problem set.",
    "The topics that were covered in this class were very interesting and well-discussed in class and through excellent notes made available on classesv2. Unfortunately, this class is a bit too ambitious for a single semester. The purported objective: to teach students how to build something on the scale of Google, was probably not realistic. Nonetheless, what we did learn about server\/client interactions and strategies, networking challenges and potential solutions, and using amazon EC2 was enlightening and 100% practical. Expect this class to be a lot of work.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to other students. It was very challenging, and it wasn't rewarding enough--I got a lot of hands on experience working with particular problems in internet scale programming, but I don't feel like I've gotten a good overall understanding of the field, and a lot of the time I felt like we were wasting time doing nitty-gritty busy work that wasn't helpful, whether it was memorizing facts for the midterm or performing benchmarks on different servers and navigating Amazon's EC2 Compute Cloud."
