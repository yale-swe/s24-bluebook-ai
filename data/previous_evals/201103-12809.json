   "comments": [
    "Milton is fabulous. If you care at all about English literature, take this course. He's a genius. And John Rogers is too.",
    "John Rogers is wonderful, engaging, and tries to make Milton interesting. Milton isn't interesting, so that's too bad, but I thought his lectures integrated material very well into a narrative about Milton's work as a whole and about English literature in general. As good as it could have been, I think. Papers are standard.",
    "This class is... Milton. Professor Rogers is engaging, smart, and passionate, but it's still Milton. There's a lot more to him than Paradise Lost, and a lot of it is pretty boring. But you will definitely leave the class with a better understanding of Milton as a man and a writer, which as an English major (I'm assuming 90% of people shopping this class are) can only be a good thing.",
    "Take it. Even if you're not an English major. I'm an EPE major, but I took this Credit\/D, and it was a great decision. Prof. Rogers is an awesome lecture, and Milton is really interesting.",
    "Yes, definitely. Not too much work, pleasant reading, great lectures. A must.",
    "If you have any inkling of an interest in Milton, this class is a must-take. John Rogers is actually one of the best lecturers in the English department and provides really interesting readings of the texts. He does a great job in providing overview for Milton's career as a poet while offering illuminating points about the works themselves. Section was fun (we often went over because the discussion was so interesting)! The TAs all seemed to be on top of their game, and the reading was not too bad at all. For an English lecture, it's a very reasonable amount of reading and writing (2short papers and a final... AND IT'S A WR!!). If you need pre-1800, take this. If you like Milton, take this. If you want to take something offered by Yale's phenomenal English department, this class is not a bad choice.",
    "If you want to learn about Milton, take it. You get a really good understanding of Paradise Lost, both as it stands on its own but also within the larger realm of Milton's work.",
    "Extensive reading list from Milton's poetry and prose. Good overview of Milton from biographical, political, theological perspectives. There is a significant amount of reading, which means more breadth than depth, but it was very satisfying to see how it came together at the end of the semester. Professor Rogers does a good job of making connections between works, and you end up with a fairly complete picture of Milton and his legacy. Lectures were consistently good and insightful. A very solid english lecture course.",
    "This was, without any question, the best class I've taken at Yale. Every lecture will leave you absolutely astounded.",
    "Although I'm not a big fan of Milton, I shopped the class and immediately decided to take it because of Professor Rogers. The reading was a bit difficult to get through (that might just be me), but the lectures made it worth it.",
    "A must take! If for no other reason than for Rogers' brilliance.",
    "I would recommend this class, but take it early, around the time you take Kastan's lecture on Shakespeare, rather than in your senior year.",
    "A thorough and engaging immersion in the Milton world. Prof. Rogers is an excellent lecturer -- you'll find your head swimming with awesome ideas after lecture, after section, writing papers (there are just two), and (especially) studying for the final, which was really not bad at all.",
    "Take it if you have to for the pre-1800\/Major English Poets substitution-- I love Rogers and the TAs and Milton is bearable with him. Exam is REALLY hard though",
    "Excellent lecture. Sufficiently broad in scope yet sharp in focus. Covers all the important Milton poetry and some significant prose.Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in reading one of the greatest, sharpest minds of the English language. Expect a great deal of reading, especially if you have not read Paradise Lost before.",
    "The lectures are delightful, the reading worthwhile, and the workload manageable. This functions very much as a single-author class, with biography, history, and textual analysis all together -- I enjoyed the combination very much, but if in theory or in practice this model doesn't appeal to you, that's the only reason I can think of not to take the course. Highly recommended.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because it's great stuff to read and Professor Rogers makes it amazing. If he wasn't teaching it I'm not sure I would take it. He is outstanding.",
    "If you don't like Milton, obviously look elsewhere. But if you took Major English Poets and feel anything more than dislike for him, you might consider this course. Professor Rogers has a way of making Milton worthwhile to 21-year-olds. We all know Milton is one of the finest poets of the English language, that his political pamphlets contain germs of important arguments about modern issues, that there's a reason he should be important to us. But Rogers's lectures are so engaging, so lively, so funny--and so honest about when something of Milton's is kind of a drag to read--that when Rogers IS excited about something Milton's written, the enthusiasm is infectious.",
    "TAKE THIS IT'S WONDERFUL. Seriously, I stopped by this class during shopping period on a whim, was convinced by the first lecture, and it ended up being my favorite class of the term. Milton is one of the most fascinating writers and thinkers in the English language and Prof. Rogers is a phenomenal lecturer. You'll learn a lot about Milton and about the relationship between politics and art. You won't regret it.",
    "Whether it's to fulfill a requirement or for your own pleasure, take this course! The material is beautiful and Professor Roger's lectures are fantastic. The reading is light, the sections fun.",
    "If you are only going to take one English lecture at Yale, I would highly recommend this one. You will grow to love works that most people would never pick up on their own. John Rogers is amazing and lectures were always enjoyable - fast paced, enthusiastic and engaging. It starts off a bit slow because it begin with the more obscure pieces of poetry but you will later appreciate how the early works are relevant to the later masterpieces.",
    "Do you like Milton? He really wore on me as the semester went by, though he's a great story teller, his digressions annoyed me by the end of the semester. The man really knows the music of poetry though, I'd recommend reading him just for that. Read aloud!",
    "This is one of the best lecture classes I've taken at Yale. The lectures made me think about the development of English literature in a totally new way -- this should be mandatory for all English majors.",
    "This is a great course in which to explore a fascinating author. The reading is tough but rewarding. The workload is great -- the papers challenge you, but the amount of work is manageable enough that you have time to enjoy it and really think."
