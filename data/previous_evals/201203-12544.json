    "I would definitely recommend this class if it is ever offered again.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. You'll learn things that not every American should understand.",
    "It's a class that overviews theories of empire and its unravelling in the 20th century.",
    "Yes, if the subject is interesting to you.",
    "An intellectual journey through the late 19th-mid 20th century. Basically reading a bunch of primary and some secondary sources about colonization\/decolonization. I couldn't actually tell you a timeline of these events because it was a lot more existential and theoretical, \"what is empire\" \"is_____ just a new version of the imperial system\" etc. Irwin is leaving Yale so I don't know if this class will be taught again but if so, take if you like reading political theory, don't take if you like knowing hard facts.",
    "Decolonization is a great class. Ryan Irwin is really great to work with. Leads great discussions and has wonderful feedback. If you're a European or American centered history person and looking for a really interesting rest of the world course, this is it.",
    "A great class, one of the best things is the way it looked at world events today or in the recent past through the lens of decolonization in the 20th century."
