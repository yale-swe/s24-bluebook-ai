   "comments": [
    "Amazing. But be warned: if you're a native speaker or really good at Spanish through instruction, you will feel like you're being stabbed every time some of the lesser capable people say things like \"la poema\" over and over again. It's still worth it because the professor is absolutely wonderful and gregarious.",
    "SPAN 227 is a creative writing course in Spanish where you explore different genres and styles of creative writing in prose and verse, and do lots of your own. You also read a lot of influential (and more contemporary) Spanish writers to help with your work. I would definitely recommend this course to another student if you want a more unconventional Spanish class that's not so focused on technicalities. My writing definitely improved, and I always had fun working on the assignments. The work can be a bit more than you anticipate, as each piece requires multiple drafts and revisions, but you get into a groove and it's worth the time. Take it, and give Maria lots of hugs.",
    "The reading choices were excellent and very pertinent. The teacher gave very interesting \"lectures\" and writing assignments about the reading, and forced us to write a lot.One would expect a creative writing workshop in another language to be somewhat more lenient than one in English, but the lack of criticism was underwhelming. I did not feel like my writing improved very much, although my Spanish writing did.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. Maria create a fantastic classroom environment. I learned a lot more Spanish vocabulary and thoroughly enjoyed analyzing texts that we read. I also enhanced my creative writing skills.",
    "It's a great class to explore your writing in Spanish while engaging in literary conversations. The professor is amazing and is always willing to talk or schedule a meeting.",
    "It was a fun class that significantly develops Spanish creative writing skills.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! Professor Mar\u00c3\u00ada is the best--she is so kind and understanding. She is one of those professors that actually cares about her students. The class itself is really good as well; the workload isn't that bad and most of the assignments are enjoyable, and they help you develop your own style of writing. It is a great course to take Freshman year since I learned more about myself as well as I developed stronger writing and critical thinking skills. If you are looking for a great Spanish L5 class, this is the class to take.",
    "Yes!!! Take it if you can. Definitely best L5 Spanish class."
