As someone without a strong background in economics, I often did not understand the economic models associated with the presentations. That said, it was extremely valuable to be a part of the larger discussion on the implications of any given analysis and set of conclusions."

It offers PhD students the opportunity to present and share their work with Master's and PhD students. Although sometimes it is challenging to follow the ideas, and I feel there is definitely a greater payoff for PhD students in the course, I think it is helpful for Master's students who are trying to grasp research ideas and topics in this relatively new and interdisciplinary field.",
