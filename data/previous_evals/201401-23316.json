   "comments": [
    "A great way to write about your travel experiences.",
    "Yes! It's an awesome class.",
    "It is similar to ENG 120, except for an emphasis on place writing. The best time to take this course is during a semester in which you will be traveling to somewhere exciting, so as to give you a good amount of inspiration for the largest essay undertaking. I would recommend this class to anyone, but especially those interested in gaining an understanding in how to portray places.",
    "A lot of work, but more than worth it.",
    "Fantastic class to learn about the writing of place. If you want to write, take it! Kinder will support you and help your writing get better.",
    "Yes. It's fun and really helpful in improving my writing - but it's NOT easy.",
    "Prof. Kinder is one of the best ENGL 120 and ENGL 121 teachers you will get! I took both with her and am so happy I did! If you have taken ENGL 120, this class is basically the \"place\" essay but explored in detail and more nuance. If you haven't taken ENGL 120, then this class is not about \"how to write about my awesome trip to __blank____\". The class is about how to use place as a foundation to explore a higher argument, theme or idea. It is about using place as a vehicle to narrate, just as you would use a main character in a novel. It is truly a wonderful class and my writing has improved so much in just a semester! This is also Prof. Kinder's forte style of writing, so you get a ton of very detailed and poignant comments during her office hours on how to improve your writing. Some people take easy classes to fulfill writing credits, but honestly, taking a full on ENGL 121 class for WR has been one of the best decisions I have made at Yale. Your writing, even if you are a science major, will improve by leaps and bounds!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It wasn't my favorite English class of all time, but I did really like Prof. Kinder, and the class discussions were usually interesting.",
    "Travel Writing: read and discuss many place essays and try your hand at a good variety of different pieces of writing about places and experiences, your surroundings. I would recommend this to a student who enjoys reading travel literature or traveling. If you don't have much writing experience, it may be challenging because I think it is assumed that many people know the basics and have experience, so the discussion is meant to help refine your writing and help you uncover your particular style.",
    "Take it if you want to read a lot of neat travel writing pieces and develop your own writing style! It would be a bummer to take it and not put in the work though, so not a class to sluff through. I would absolutely recommend it!!",
    "If you've taken ENGL 120, it's pretty much a deeper look into the place essay (and if you liked 120 you'll love this class). Otherwise, it's a great way to learn how to write personal narratives focusing on place, and will really improve your writing in all subjects."
