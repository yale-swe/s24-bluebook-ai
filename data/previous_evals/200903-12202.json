    "I would recommend this course for ENVE's. It's really easy but you learn a lot about the big picture. Our other classes are very specialized, so it's nice to see the different kinds of industries that benefit from our field. You dread the field trips when you have to get up on Friday mornings, but you never regret going in the end, because they're all fascinating. Lectures can be boring, but readings and topics are great.",
    "It's a good class to take if you're trying to get an engineering elective class. There isn't a lot of work, although it's concentrated very heavily at the beginning and at the end of the semester. All of the problem sets were due within two weeks of each other (there were three), along with one or two of the facility visit reports (there were four). The end of the course is heavy on the industry project, which wasn't handled very well - the projects had very different requirements and degrees of difficulty, and didn't necessarily relate well to the material covered in class. However, there wasn't a final or any other tests, so if you're taking a lot of science classes it's sort of a break.",
    "Interesting material, but the classes aren't very engaging. The facility visits are cool, though.",
    "Make sure if you take this class that you do not have any classes on Friday before 1. Field trips are necessary and always on Friday mornings.",
    "I would recommend this class. You have to leave your Fridays open for the facility visits, but they are well worth it."
