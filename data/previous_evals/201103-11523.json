    "WORST ENGINEERING CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT YALE. Do not even think of taking this class unless it's a requirement, if it is taught by the same professor (Miller Jensen). There was no redeeming quality to this class. The professor appeared to be continually confused over what she taught and kept introducing (yet never completing) concepts without pointing out the relevance. Each class consisted of her writing down exactly what was in the text book. The text book was terrible as well; it only served to confuse the reader. Of course, given a professor who repeated the textbook, it is no wonder this class was incredibly unhelpful in teaching students the fundamentals of biotransport and kinetics. Moving on to the two TAs, I have never had such apathetic, unhelpful TAs for any other class at Yale. They had no problem flat out refusing to help students with the problem sets. As a class we were convinced that most of us knew what was going on in the class more than one of the TAs. Next come the problem sets. Again, ridiculously long problem sets. Even with most of the class working together, we would take much more time to complete these weekly problem sets than for any other class (including many core engineering classes). To add to the work load + 2 midterms + final, this class has a final project (presentation + paper) that might seem to be fun, but is not! Oh, about the exams: the professor apologized more than once after she saw the students' reaction post-exam. That should give you a picture of what to expect. The class was such a disappointment compared to the previous years it was taught by Professor Fahmy. I do NOT recommend this class to anyone.",
    "If you're taking this class, you are more than likely a junior BME and this is a required class. Hopefully, by the time you take it, they will have fixed the problems. It hopefully will be a different class for you than it was for us, but if not, then be warned. Prof. Miller-Jensen is a very nice person, but she was a terrible lecturer. She made a pretty significant error in derivations\/explanations of equations basically every day. However, the best part is that the book we used also had errors in it, so you never knew if the equation you were using was actually correct. Additionally, she tended to use different notation than the book, just adding to the confusion. Some of the psets were extremely difficult, to the point that she would send outan email (the night before the pset was due) saying not to worry about certain parts of problems because she hadn't realized how difficult they were or that she had given us inaccurate information and so the problem was impossible to do. The workload was more difficult than it needed to be. Also, LOOK OVER DIFF EQS before you take the class, because they come up basically in everything we do and she never reviews how to solve the equations. Like I said, hopefully they will be making some changes to the class before you take it since this was her 1st year teaching it, but if not, then good luck.",
    "This class, when taught by Miller-Jensen, absolutely sucks. It's a shame, because when it was taught by Fahmy, this was supposed to be one of the highlights of the major and really brought together your study of physics and chemistry and physiology. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. Get ready for horrible 6-7 hour problem sets, exams that you probably won't finish, and just a horrible semester in general. Sorry. Pray that it gets better, because that's what I'm doing after having finished this class.",
    "This was a really hard and bad class. The textbook was full of typos, and the professor also made a lot of mistakes while teaching us, so it was really hard to learn anything. There was a problem set a week, 2 midterms, a project (presentation + paper), and a final. The problem sets were too long some weeks, and it seems that the professor nor the TAs tried to do them before assigning them to us. If you are looking into this class, you probably need to take it. Just maybe wait until someone other than Miller-Jensen is teaching it.",
    "This class blows. I had a great schedule - and then there was this class. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU ARE REQUIRED (IF ITS TAUGHT BY KATHRYN MILLER-JENSEN). She is likely going to be ripped apart by everyone's reviews so there is a good chance that she will be better than this year - but I wouldn't bet money on it. I do sort of feel bad because it was her first year teaching - but this was also our lives, which were made hellish by this class this semester. If you are going to be bad at least realize it and be nice to us - comfort our worries by at least telling us you are going to curve to an A- or that we aren't all gonna fail. Geez.",
    "The material is really interesting, and I feel like I learned so much. The material makes me know that I'm happy to be majoring in BME. Professor Miller-Jensen was not a good professor, though. It was her first semester, so she'll probably be better in the future, but a lot of the material you'll be teaching yourself.",
