    "Recommend to other students. Good breadth of psychiatric disorders using PET and fMRI techniques.",
    "NSCI 521 is a seminar course covering topics in neuroimaging of psychiatric disorders. Each week, we read papers with an expert in the field, usually focusing on results from a single imaging method. This course would be great as an introduction to neuropsychiatry and\/or neuroimaging, but is also well-suited for specialists because of the opportunity to do close reading of current literature. I would particularly recommend this course to biomedical scientists wishing to do translational work, because it provided valuable insight into the brain processes underlying psychiatric conditions in humans. It would also be great for medical students or clinicians wishing to enhance their knowledge of the basic science.",
