    "Amazing class that delves deep into many current bioethics concerns.",
    "Read about current bioethical issues, mostly related to reproductive technology. A fair amount of reading, grade mostly determined by weekly responses and class participation. A great way to fulfill the writing requirement.",
    "It was great! Dov is amazing and the topics are interesting. It's not a lot of work. It is worth it and really interesting.",
    "This class is amazing. If you have any interest in bioethics (no background knowledge necessary at all) take this class if you can. The \"law\" part never really factors in, but the discussions are amazing and, as a senior who has taken numerous seminars at Yale, I can say with confidence that Dov Fox is by far the best discussion leader I have ever had. I cannot recommend this class highly enough to do it justice.",
    "A superb introduction to bioethics, and a great chance to improve your writing, reasoning, and debating skills. Between the excellent teaching and mind-bending topics, discussion is always lively, and I actually enjoyed writing the weekly papers. Highly recommended."
