   "comments": [
    "An introductory art course that focuses on improving one's composition by reducing artwork to its simplest elements. Throughout the semester you will work primarily on 2d and 3d collage. I highly recommend the course to arts students, and I strongly suggest that even non-art students shop the class.",
    "Yes, good class if you are interested in composition. The class can be as intense as you want it to be and students at all levels can benefit from the projects.",
    "This course is so much more fun if you don't take yourself too seriously, especially since much of it is group work. Relax and just enjoy it",
    "it's a pretty painless requirement. it's not the best class i've taken, but it's pretty helpful in terms seeing how other people think and helping you get started thinking about how you like making stuff.",
    "yes. its a good way to learn the basic concepts of aesthetics in an experiential way.",
    "It's hard to explain this class to someone else; the subject of it is a bit ambiguous. I suppose I would just say that it's mostly about composition and looking at things with an analytical visual eye, but I understand that that's pretty vague. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, though, as long as they had an interest of some sort in art!",
    "A great class for art majors",
    "Anahita's class was seemingly unplanned and syllabusless. We did collage for the first half of the course and sculpture for the second half. She's perfectly nice. Take it with her if you want a typically low workload and enjoy these two media but otherwise look for another instructor.",
    "Visual Thinking is very much an introductory class. I took it as a freshman, and I think it was helpful, but because I came to Yale with a lot of experience in art already, I still felt like I was being taught a lot of things that I already knew. Definitely try to take the class as early as you can!Otherwise, I did enjoy the class. It's required for the major, so all art majors have to take it. But if you're not an art major and are considering an introductory level art class, I'd recommend taking, say, Basic Drawing or another more specific class."
