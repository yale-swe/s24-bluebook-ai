   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it for people interested in digging deeper into what capitalism is all about, and for those curious about anthropology. There are some pretty dope subversive ideas happening in this class, but they aren't able to be fully developed, unfortunately. Readings are super fascinating and great if you have time, but really dense.",
    "great class. extremely discussion based. a good amount of reading to do, but makes you think about capitalism (and other types of economies) from very different perspectives. the papers we wrote (and anthropology in general) were thought provoking and quite different from what I previously done here at Yale. Rogers is a great professor.",
    "Yes! Anthro Capitalism presents a valuable alternative view to economists'\/philosophers' disembedded theories on capitalism. Professor Rogers is a friendly facilitator who lets students run the discussions, while driving home some key anthropological concepts (ex. personhood, time-space, habitus). The workload is pretty light - a take-home midterm essay, a scholarship review, & the group ethnography; all the written work is given bare guidelines, so you do what you want with it... The seminar's reading is focused (maybe because it's a sophomore seminar, but all seminars should be like this!) so the reading's manageable, too.",
    "This seminar is great! The reading can be intense at times, but seminar discussions make everything clearer. Doug Rogers is a fantastic professor: he is an expert in the field yet let us take control over each week's discussion. The fieldwork project is the best part of the class because you get to do real research like a real anthropologist. Even if you're not totally into anthropology, the experience of acting like an anthropologist is eye-opening. Take this seminar if you can get in!",
    "ANTH 346 is a great course overall! The syllabus is really well thought out, really well selected, really really just great! Accessible enough for sophomores with no exposure to anthropoogy\/sociology and still high-level enough to be fascinating and advanced enough for individuals with some prior experience. The assignments: 1 midterm paper on a NYT article which you are asked to analyze, using the readings. Really cool assignment. Aside from that: 1 final paper for which there are multiple steps. 1 3pg scholarship review, 1 4 page fieldwork self-evaluation (you do your own fieldwork\/ethnography for the final project which is an 20 pg group (3-4person) essay about some aspect of capitalism), and then the final paper. Group paper sounds scary, but its not. Prof Rogers is really very supportive, available, helpful. Prof Rogers is an EXTREMELY approachable, responsive, responsible professor. He is very very smart and well spoken. He makes himself available and is very supportive. He picked incredible readings for the course and organized a Skype session and personal interview with two of the authors, which were wonderful! Prof Rogers really put what seemed like a health amount of time and enthusiasm and energy into the course, which the entire class really appreciated. One weakness: Aside from the first few classes, which were quite well-run, Prof Rogers ought to come to class with more of a plan for discussing the readings. He would often just \"open it up to the class\" and ask us what we \"found interesting\" which was not very effective, and led to a kind of unproductive, undisciplined, meandering discussion which sometimes never really got anywhere. Sometimes his (expressed) expectations for class discussion or individual comments were quite low.",
    "It is one of the hidden gems of Yale - A SOPHOMORE SEMINAR!",
    "I really really liked this class. I was not IN LOVE with it, but I really liked it. I think it was amazing to take an anthropology class as someone who had never taken one because anthropology is a really specific lens through which to view the world and it makes you think a lot. I thought the capitalism part was also really interesting and thought provoking. If you do all your reading it will be a LOT of work, but if you do most of it you'll probably still get a lot out of the class and I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend ANTh 346 to anyone who is interested in the study of capitalism and in anthropological methods. Reviews that say that this class is life-changing is overblown it is an interesting seminal with fun readings that is not too much work.",
    "I would definitely recommend ANTH 346 to other students. No matter what your background, I think everyone has something to contribute to and gain from this course. It's about a very relatable topic, but through a unique lens. The readings were really interesting, but long. Professor Rogers is a great professor to get to know. The discussion will depend on the types of people in the class the class was pretty homogenous this year, so there weren't diverse views\/opinions, but you can definitely still get a lot out of this seminar. It's also great because it's a sophomore seminar!",
    "Yes- I would recommend this course to anyone new to anthropology. The material is accessible and thought-provoking, and there is real opportunity to engage the Yale community and beyond in ethnographic work.",
    "A good course. Readings are good, though I wish Prof Rogers wouldn't focus on energy capitalism (even though this is his area of expertise). It was much less exciting for me than other parts of the course. While I understand the value of a focus, too much of the class centered around it. The energy focus for final ethnographical also felt very limiting. Discussions could be better facilitated so that people don't talk just for its own sake. Maybe this is the nature of a sophomore seminar, but I still hoped we would do more to build toward ideas rather than collect unrelated insight. This course is only worth taking if one seriously commits to doing all the reading. It is a course that you can get by skimming, but that makes it much less valuable",
    "ANTH 346 is a great introduction to what studying anthropology is like. You read a range of scholarship (pure theory, ethnography) and the final project is to do an ethnography of your own. The subject, the anthropology of capitalism, is, I think, fascinating and relevant. Professor Rogers is great. It's a sophomore seminar, which is pretty great--good discussions, interesting people, etc. I'm happy I took it for the sake of learning what kinds of things you can study in anthropology, reading some interesting things about capitalism, and having good discussions. I did find a bunch of the readings pretty dry and abstruse, but I'm basically glad I slogged through them."
