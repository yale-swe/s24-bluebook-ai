    "Complex analysis is pretty awesome and Prof. Margulis is brilliant, but the class was overall quite absurd. Prof. Margulis is almost too smart, and sometimes it's hard for him to realize that we mere students are not as intelligent as he and need more time and explanation to understand concepts. We would ask questions during class, and he would answer completely different questions because the questions that we did ask were seemingly too simple for him to think that we would truly ask them; however, I think he caught on that we weren't that smart about halfway through the semester (and after the first midterm...), and then things were better in class.Also, this class is a lot of work. At least for me. Maybe it's because I'm stupid, but problem sets could easily take over 10 hours a week, even when working with other people. But the math is interesting, and the results are interesting, and you learn some cool stuff. It's also good bonding with other masochists who decide to take this course.",
    "The topic is actually really interesting, and Margulis is so cute and funny. But really, take it if you have to or if you're a math major, since you're used to this kind of thing by now.",
    "Math 310 is exactly what it's name says it is: an introduction to complex analysis. It is much cleaner, and in my view, more elegant, than real analysis. It goes without saying that every math major should take it, as should the mathematically inclined who like interesting material and good instruction.",
    "It's a great class, and definitely take it with Margulis if you can. You'll learn a lot of different methods for calculating definite integrals in the second half, and many elegant proofs in the first. Real analysis is very helpful in understanding the concepts, though, so I definitely suggest you take it before 310 if you want to have a smoother ride, though from someone who took the two concurrently, I found that looking ahead in my 301 books were enough to get me through."
