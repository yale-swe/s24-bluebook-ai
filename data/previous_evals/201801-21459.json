    "The professor did not explain the material very well and rushed through the course.",
    "Its just a difficult class to teach because the content is hard. The classes should be more standardized and more worksheets should be provided.",
    "not good teachers except for sudesh, too fast, too confusing, too easy problem sets, too hard tests",
    "This course was extremely difficult and confusing.",
    "This course had a coaching group that was great at solidifying concepts but overall teaching was unfortunately lacking. I would have preferred explanations that incorporated more conceptual definitions of the mathematical calculations we carried out.",
    "The content of this course was relatively interesting and I find the problems presented to be very good mental exercises when solving. However, I do find the course to move very quickly. So it was difficult to absorb the information. I feel that giving homework involving what was learned during the week at the beginning of the week, on Monday for example, instead of towards the end (on Friday) would be more helpful. During the week, as students are learning the material, they would be able to practice through the homework and assess what they know and don't know. That would make it harder for students to fall behind."

    "No.",
    "No I think this course was hard to follow and graded harshly",
