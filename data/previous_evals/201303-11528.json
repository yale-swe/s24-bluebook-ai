   "comments": [
    "As someone who studies international development, this was a great science course. Here's the kicker though: 30% of the class gets an A, 40% gets a B, and 19% get a C (there are no + or - grades). Pretty dumb grading scheme that produces a lot of stress. That being said, I studied a lot for each exam and it doesn't seem like it's too difficult to do well in the course.",
    "An engaging class that doesn't take a lot of work or thought.",
    "There are no plus\/minus grades. Don't risk it or you'll end up regretting it like me. The first half is taught by Powell and he's a bit of a jerk (his test was ridiculously long and unfair). The second half is taught by Puth and she was terribly dull. Save yourself the regret and find another class.",
    "Loved the course! Really embodies what I want to do with my life. Not sure if I'd recommend it unless you are interested in ConBio or wildlife but hey it's worth a shot! Take it!",
    "Not a complete gut, some people get screwed on the grading.",
    "Take it if you don't want to do work and\/or you don't mind being graded unfairly",
    "I would summarize this class as an evolutionary introduction to life on earth, and then the destruction and possible conservation of such life and everything interconnected with it; study of species, populations, ecosystems, preserves, wildlife preservation, habitat degradation, fragmentation, and climate change. I would recommend it as a generally stress-free science course and something very interesting for environmentalists or those interested in conservation efforts.",
    "Strengths: Very interesting lectures, its very easy to pay attention because the subject matter is interestingWeakness: The subject matter can get a bit repetitive at timesI would recommend it if you find animals and animal population dynamics fascinatingBe careful though, because they only give A's B's and C's, no pluses or minuses. however a good proportion of the class gets A's.",
    "tl;dr: humans are really awful to the environment because of various reasons (aesthetics, economic, desire), and we are not doing much to help it. We're also destroying habitats at alarming rates, which is a bad thing because many organisms have huge land needs (especially, it seems, the cuddly-looking ones).Definitely recommend it for people who need science credits. Its easy enough if you go to class and pay attention (and maybe skim some readings). Also a good intro if you are thinking you might want to major in EEB but dont know yet.",
    "This is a great class! A really important, timely topic and a reasonable amount of work. Both professors are great, the lectures are really interesting, and you get to work through real scientific papers in section. I always looked forward to going to lecture and learned a lot. I am much more aware of conservation issues now and am glad that I am.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The topicsare very interesting and highly relevant so you'll get something important out of it. The workload is pretty light, and it's not extremely difficult to understand the concepts. It does require studying, but nothing that will frustrate you too much.",
    "Good course,very informational and world-applicable. Would recommend if you are interested in Conservation in general. If you are taking this class as perhaps a GUT science think about a different science suited to your interests. Those who aren't really interested in Conservation Biology didn't really enjoy this course. Of course I think that all the information is important for students to know just in general.",
    "Lots of people take this class as a gut--it's a nice introduction to ecology and evolution for someone who doesn't have a science background! If you are interested in conservation, I'd advise taking an(other) FES class.",
    "The first half of the semester consists of basic genetics and the latter consists of ecology. You'll spend the first half feeling like there isn't enough material and the second feeling like there's too much. Two very fair exams that test the concepts well, one write-up on an event, and participation in section. Overall an easy but not especially engaging class with a few interesting concepts and a lot of examples.",
    "It's for non-science majors, but I wouldn't say it was a gut.",
    "I don't know why everyone looking to knock out a science requirement takes the massive 'for non-science majors' courses (the intro astronomy classes, the intro geology classes, or natural disasters). This course is far easier, has far fewer students, and does not have weekly assignments. The only downside is that most of the class grade is based on two exams (midterm and final are worth 40% each), but it's well worth the effort.",
    "Don't take this unless you're a senior looking for a science credit. Totally fine for that -- it's definitely not a piece of cake (time pressure on exams for sure), but it turns out you don't have to read the textbook at all (so don't), and the supplementary journal articles are only necessary to sort of discuss in section or to use as examples on your midterm and final. The lectures are very boring and are filled with so many examples that it gets overwhelming and seems pointless, but it turns out examples are necessary for the exams, so try to remember one example for every key point."
