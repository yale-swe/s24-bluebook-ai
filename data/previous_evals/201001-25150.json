    "Professor Smith is the best professor I've had at Yale. He genuinely cares about teaching and his students, and really takes the time to get to know us. He even attended some of our extracurricular performances. He's very knowledgeable and presents his thoughts on the material clearly while also allowing you to develop your own opinion on some fascinating topics. I feel like this seminar helped me grow so much. If you can get into his seminar, you have to take it.",
    "It was a good course. Professor Smith is top-notch and incredibly dedicated and accessible to his students. Take everything he teaches!",
    "Yes.",
    "This class is amazing, if you are interested in the material. It makes you think about ethics in a really different way, and I at least thought about the course material a lot outside of class. Professor Smith is super nice and helpful and makes this class so pleasant. Definitely, definitely consider it, even if you aren't an expert on material (I wasn't and I feel like I learned a whole lot).",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. Professor Smith is phenomenal, and the topics lend to fantastic class discussion.",
    "This seminar was a good opportunity to read and respond to contemporary works on bioethics. The course was designed to allow students to present their own ideas and interpretations to each other, and fostered vigorous discussion. Requiring that only about half the students write a response paper for a given session made the large (~22) seminar feel more intimate. The syllabus seemed to lack structure, however, and it was hard to tell what the underlying theme of the class was. We covered neuroethics, dementia, and end-of-life issues, but they did not seem to relate to each other very much. There are five 2-page response papers due during the semester (about every other week), a 15-page final paper on a reading from the syllabus (not too long for a seminar, as I understand it, and a pretty heavy, dense amount of reading each week.",
    "Take this course! It's an involved journey into complex and relevant bioethical issues, guided by one of the best professor's at Yale, who is also a leader in the field. It would help to have some basic familiarity with bioethics (such as from a previous course), but you don't to.",
    "I would recommend this or any other seminar with Professor Smith very highly. This course did a good job of covering a wide area of issues, although there was some slight disconnect between the earlier theological readings and later issue-specific readings. Having said that, I really enjoyed getting a good set of philosophical readings in a polisci class.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Smith is warm and encouraging while still maintaining the ability to challenge students on their positions. The readings are interesting and the discussion were generally excellent. Would recommend to anyone with even the slightest interest in bioethics.",
    "Prof. Smith is the absolute best. He is genuinely interested in the material he teaches as well as all of his students, and it shows. This seminar was so well organized for students who have taken bioethics classes with him or other professors before, as there was almost no overlap. The topics covered were all interesting, the readings always fascinating, and the biweekly assignments are fun and helpful for discussions. Plus, the people who are taking the class will most likely end up being students who have done bioethics before and have very intelligent, provoking things to say in seminar. Discussion will never be boring. Take the class."
