    "A course with well structured homework assignments and relatively unstructured class time. One composition assignment (Greek sentences based on grammar rules) and one quiz (one some grammar paradigm) each week. In class you go over short prepared readings of Attic prose to translate and learn about style. Class can be frustrating at times when discussion gets off track. Do the readings.",
    "Take this class for a way of reading Greek that is new, and not often taught.",
    "This class should be taken at the end of a Greek language sequence, since it assumes a command of grammar as the basis of discussions about style. There are quizzes and compositions each week, in addition to selected readings in Greek. Classes are mostly devoted to going over the readings, and Professor Bers will make occasional comments about words or phrases; if you take the class, you should record these carefully for exam preparation. Overall, the class is very rewarding to Greek reading ability. You might feel on tenterhooks trying to keep up (and the system of grading doesn't always make it clear where you stand), but the pressure really does force you to spend a lot of time reviewing and learning Greek."
