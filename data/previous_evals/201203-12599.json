   "comments": [
    "Math 120 is a good introduction to multivariable calculus, although it only goes as far as four dimensions, without any generalizations. The class can be boring at times because it isn't proof-oriented, but simply involves a lot of computations and application of the same formulas many times. The P-sets may take some time if you're not particularly good at math; otherwise, they're a breeze (unless you get computations wrong, which happens inadvertently). Alas, I would suggest taking it especially if you plan to major in the STEM area. Your experience with the class will depend greatly on the instructor you have. Take it with Michal for an excellent experience!",
    "I always thought I was good at math until taking this class - it's really hard. But if you put in the work (CONSISTENTLY throughout the semester), it's manageable. Interesting material, though, since up till now calculus is primarily single variable, so if you're interested in going into higher level math, this is an interesting introduction to that. But it's seriously really hard (especially the content after the second midterm, which will take up 40% of your final grade - so be prepared).",
    "This course is challenging, rewarding, and enjoyable. You learn a lot of really interesting topics that are quite useful in other fields- plus, it's pretty cool to realize you know how to do calculus in three dimensions by the time you're done with the course. I was lucky to have Michal Tryniecki as my teacher- he's a wonderful teacher who knows how to explain concepts well. He is very dedicated to his students, always happy toanswer questions in office hours or in individual appointments. He is also a genuinely nice person. I definitely recommend this course, particularly if you have the opportunity to take it with Tryniecki.",
    "If you like math, take it. If you don't like math, stay away. If you're not sure if you like math, take this class and you'll probably realize you don't.",
    "All about multi-variable calculus. Take the class, but be willing to put in a lot of work, and do not put off problem sets until the last minute. That will ultimately hurt you. A lot.",
    "Math 120 is an great math class. The teacher IS KEY to your success. Take the class with Michal Tryniecki if possible. Go to office hours. The workload is manageable, but be prepared to do practice problems by yourself.",
    "It's a lot of integral calculus - you don't learn a ton of entirely new concepts, but you need to be able to apply these new concepts in a very wide variety of ways.",
    "You're probably taking 120 for something else, but if you take it, take it with Michal!",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. It is full of ambitious science majors so the curve can screw you a bit. If you are good at math, then I highly recommend it but only if you got a 4 or 5 on calc bc. Otherwise, take fractals or something as your qr.",
    "Good class, you will probably get confused and lost somewhere along the way but there is help for you. Homework grades are worth almost nothing so you can practice risk-free."
