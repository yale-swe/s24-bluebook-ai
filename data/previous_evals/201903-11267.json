    "Multivariable calculus",
    "I now understand calculus to a greater extent and developed a better grasp on the intricacies of math.",
    "Solid grasp of vectors, vector fields, 3D surfaces and solids, and integration\/differentiation in 3D.",
    "In this course, we covered the entirety of the topics and concepts of Multivariable calculus. It was a great problem solving course and it was great for learning to work better with my peers.",
    "Integration! I really learned a lot about math in 120!",
    "From this course, not only did I learn the foundations of multivariable calculus, but it also helped me hone my study skills in higher level mathematics and helped me to reevaluate my work ethic.",
    "I learned how to study correctly for mathematics exams and acquired insights into mathematics at a higher level.",
    "We learned about multiple integrals, partial derivatives, and different methods of evaluating surface and line integrals.",
    "All the main theorems of multivariable calculus that are so helpful for physics (vector line integrals and vector surface integrals especially). Best way to approach those integrals problems, a thinking process.",
    "I gained knowledge of analytical geometry and how to approach complex math problems, by tying together all of my previous math knowledge.",
    "Learned analytical and mathematical skills, as well as insights into the real-world applications of the topics we were covering in multivariable calculus.",
    "Gained problem-solving skills using multi-variable calculus. This class teaches the fundamentals of multi-variable calculus in a logical order along with many theorems.",
    "My knowledge of multi concepts was greatly increased. I have deepened my understanding of different theorems, including FTLI, Green's Theorem, and Stokes' Theorem.",
    "We learned multivariable calculus. From Sudesh's great teaching, we learned how to approach problems with clear step by step methods.",
    "It was a good class. Learned Multi.",
    "An in-depth knowledge and understanding of multivariable calculus. As the course progressed, I also learnt to be regular and methodical with my work- a trait demanded by this course, which it helped inculcate over time.",
    "I greatly developed my skill in calculus over the course of this class.",
    "Multivariable calculus.",
    "I learned a lot of advanced calculus principles and concepts. Due to the course's relatively difficult material, I learned how to study and manage my time more efficiently as well. I also learned how to better use resources and ask for help when the material was too difficult to understand alone.",
    "I learned to think critically about the problems I was solving and how to choose which method would be most applicable to the problem at hand. I learned the equations and formulas behind much of multivariable calculus."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: SUDESH, Ximera modules; weaknesses: the content is very challenging",
    "The professor, Sudesh, is amazing. He makes this class great. The material itself is pretty challenging but Sudesh is one of the most dedicated professors I have had so far. He makes the class completely manageable.",
    "The content was incredibly dull by no fault of the professor. I felt the speed of the course was fast but the amount of content that needed to be covered was absurdly high. Also, the people who had taken multivariable back in high school had a significant advantage over those of us who hadn't seen the material before. Maybe subdivide the course as such.",
    "Course is very well organized, well at least if you get Sudesh. Lots of review tools (i.e. Ximera modules, practice exams, office hours, etc.) to prepare you for exams. It doesn't make sense that the tests are worth so much of our grade though. I wish each test was worth a certain percentage, instead of midterms 40% and finals 50%; these percentages are interchangeable depending on which yielded a higher average in the end. Psets\/class participation should be count as well. Also, I wish there were smaller sections, so that there was time during class to ask questions because it is easy to get lost at one point of lecture and have that confusion just snowball throughout the lecture. The way the lectures are set up are pretty comprehensive but fast-paced, so be prepared to review your notes every week. It would be good to include discussion sections or MWT instead of TTh classes.",
    "The course is designed well to build on the topics covered in AP Calc BC. I felt well prepared with that background. The course covers many topics quickly but there are great resources, such as teachers, Ximera, and practice problems, to help with the faster pace. With all these resources, I never felt as if there was nothing I could do. For each exam, there were two practice exams and many practice problems, giving students sufficient resources with which to prepare. One thing that could be improved was the choice of textbook problems for the problem sets. Perhaps this is the fault of the textbook but often it felt as though the pset problems were testing algebra and more trivial applications of double angle formula than the topics covered in the course.",
    "This course is hard. That being said, Sudesh does a really good job as the course director in making this course as accessible as possible. The course provides students with PLENTY of materials and resources to do extra work to really learn and internalize the material.",
    "The notebooks provided to us by the professor were a great help during in class lectures, and the department was very helpful in creating review sessions and coaching before exams.",
    "This course was very well formatted, but the material moved quickly.",
    "Strengths: the teacher (Sudesh)",
    "Sudesh is the strength! If you can, too, buy the notebook.",
    "Strength is Sudesh, weakness is what I've heard from other sections about their instructors being confusing.",
    "Letting Sudesh teach more sections would improve the course.",
    "Strengths were definitely the teaching style and the relevancy of prep material\/HW. However, I thought the course could have been more engaging if it was slightly less fast-paced, as well as if more real-world applications\/examples were given.",
    "Strengths: Wonderful instructor, Sudesh is great! Interesting material at times, great notebook. Weaknesses: Class is super fast, and every lecture goes quite quickly so you really need to be paying attention to keep up. Lots of material covered, and thus it is very difficult to keep up.",
    "This course was fantastic. Sudesh is excellent at explaining abstract concepts and his course book was extremely helpful. I have no complaints.",
    "The course was a little too fast-paced, especially towards the beginning of the semester. The recaps at the beginning of each class and Ximera helped a lot, but I wish while the topic was being covered the teacher could sometimes reiterate more often the important parts.",
    "Sudesh makes the class extremely accessible and intelligible. The course material is clear and organization is great.",
    "If you get Sudesh, than the course has many strengths. He is very good at teaching and truly cares. However, this means that students not in his class are at a disadvantage.",
    "Tonssss of extra problems to do to study for tests. Really unique and helpful.",
    "For a course which was extremely complex and had to be taught in a very short period of time, it was laid in a very organised way, which made studying extremely easy. Considering the lack of time, I think it might be a good idea to go over the topics in the beginning a bit faster and spend more time on the more complex topics.",
    "A strength of the course is that the smaller class sizes allow for a lot more engagement between student and instructor, which was really important for me in excelling in the course. The note packet should be given throughout all sections, however.",
    "Strengths: many resources (office hours, pre-printed notes, peer tutors, Ximera) Weaknesses: a lot of material for one semester",
    "I think this course was very good at trying to get students to understand the core principles and apply them to different problems.",
    "The course taught the equations and formulas that governed how to solve certain problems but did not go into the 'whys' and did not explore how these equations were derived or proved. This made the course feel mostly like it was mostly composed of brute calculation rather than thought and true engagement in how calculus works."

   "comments": [
    "only if it's absolutely necessary for your major and if so, then make sure to get Sudesh!",
    "If you have to do engineering or this is a prerequisite, have fun. I have previously never taken multivariable before and did not enjoy it a lot. Please divide the course between people who had and had not taken multivariable in high school. The gap between the groups were noticeable.",
    "Yes, if it's either a prerequisite or if you like math and enjoyed one-variable calc.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Having Sudesh, an excellent teacher, most likely contributed to my excellent experience with this course. I loved how the topics built on each other and never felt that we were learning anything trivial or out of place. We always had enough practice problems to ground more abstract concepts. I thought Math 120 was a very well taught and designed course.",
    "10\/10 would recommend, but definitely take it with Sudesh.",
    "Yes, provides a strong understanding of multi variable calculus.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in mathematics only.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student that is willing to challenge themselves and extremely interested in mathematics.",
    "Yes, if you have Sudesh, he explains everything so much better than anyone Of the other professors I had, has many office hours, and during finals is always available every day. becareful of the workload, especially if you have other hard classes , takes about 3-4 hours a week at least if you havent taken this class before.",
    "Yes, but the course is heavily dependent on who your professor is.",
    "Yes if they need to.",
    "Yes. It was my favorite class. I learned a lot and enjoyed coming to class everyday.",
    "Yes, as although it was challenging, I learned a lot about multivariable calculus in an accessible way--also the exams drew strongly from conceptual knowledge, which reaffirmed my learning in-class.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in math and want to continue. I would caution that if its the first math class taken at Yale, you might want to take it with a lighter course load and attend office hours.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I found it to be much easier that Calc 2 in high school. I think it is relatively simple conceptually and easy to follow, as the majority of the course is spent on different types of integrals. It is one of my favorite math classes ever. The workload was never too overwhelming. The pset once a week was not too difficult, especially when using Sudesh's office hours. The exams were a fair assessment of the material learned in class, and Sudesh's review sessions were a great way to prepare.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course with Sudesh! Even though I had already taken multi variable calculus earlier, Sudesh managed to explain topics in a much clearer way than my previous course did.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student is passionate about math. It is a great starting point for mathematicians.",
    "Only if you have it as a requirement",
    "Yes, take the course. It's a pretty common pre-req and does teach useful information.",
    "Yes",
    "I think it depends on the interests of the student. If they are genuinely interested in Math and want to learn more about the subject, despite the complexity of this course they will really enjoy it. However, if this course is considered as a pre-requisite, it's complexity can be dissuading.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even though the content was rather difficult, the instructor presented the material in a very digestible manner and provided a lot of resources for students to better prepare for exams.",
    "Yes, the course was well taught and provided a great foundation of multivariable calculus.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for any student interested in advanced mathematics and calculus.",
    "This course has such a terrible rap but because I had Sudesh my opinion is immediately outside the norm so take what you want form what I say. I enjoyed the class and found it not to be extremely challenging but just challenging enough. There are topics that are way harder than others but there are many resources and help that is provided so it was never solely up to me and that was very nice. The workload was not bad at all and I liked the topics learned.",
    "I would recommend the course if it is needed as a requisite, but would recommend Math 230 as an alternative if the student is truly interested in understanding how and why certain applications and formulas work, and in understanding the intricacies of calculus. Math 120 is a great class if a student needs to take multi and it definitely teaches you how to solve a number of different problems effectively."
