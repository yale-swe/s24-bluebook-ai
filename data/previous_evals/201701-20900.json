    "We learned a lot of different things about biology and the issues surrounding them.",

    "Many regarding important issues in today's world.",
    "I gained a broad understanding of issues in biology.",
    "I learned how to think about political issues through a more scientific lens.",
    "The course gave me a better understanding of some of the specific biological processes that we hear so much about in the news",
    "The ability to sift through scientific claim,s and evaluate them based on the literature. Also the ability to discriminate between science and media hype."

   "comments": [
    "This course is very well done.",
    "It was interesting that there were different professors and they all had different perspective however there was a lot of overlap.",
    "having four different teachers proves beneficial in exposing students to different teaching styles, but it feels disjointed and many of the professors do not feed of eachother. i also find that somethimes too much detail is said without proper explanation.",
    "The strength is the structure of the class.",
    "Some of the professors are fantastic; others are not very engaging. The sections are filled with students who do not care about the material and it can be painful to sit through if you are actually passionate about the material and want to discuss\/learn more about it.",
    "There was too great a focus on the hard science aspects of the course on the exams.",
    "This class offers its students a wide array of knowledge on various scientific topics and, in this way, is very beneficial for non-science majors looking for a survey biology course. Its weakness, however, lies in the fact that, in its attempt to cover so many topics, it often fails to offer students a comprehensive scientific explanation of any one topic. In this way, studying for the exams or writing the paper often required memorizing explanations without fully understanding them.",
    "More focus on the science that will be tested on. Instead of 20 minutes per section on science and 30 on issues I think a more effective way would be to alternate week by week from full scientific section discussions for the entire 50 minutes to a session with 10 minutes science review and a full 40 minutes of issues.",
    "Adjusting to a new professor and a new teaching style every couple of days was rather unsettling and a little hard for me to adjust to."

   "comments": [
    "I loved this class, I would definitely recommend taking it.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course because it is a science credit without really learning too much difficult science.",
    "I would reccomend this class to anyone who wants a broad understanding of biology concepts. I would however encourage that lectures be made more engaging and easy to follow.",
    "Yes. Really engaging topics.",
    "I would if you desperately need a science credit.",
    "Yes, as a non-STEM major, I learned a lot of practical biology that I wouldn't have had I not taken the class.",
    "Yes, it's a good science credit and fairly interesting",
    "I would recommend this to any non-stem major looking for a relatively easy science credit. The class is definitely not a \"gut\" as some people would say, but I did not find it any harder than a high school biology class."
