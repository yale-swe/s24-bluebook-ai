    "10. I really liked the intellectual exercise of this course. It let me think and write about things I really care about. I think it's useful for someone who plans on writing about environmental issues from a less scientific perspective.",
    "I had high expectations for this course. However, it was not what I expected. I would have appreciated a little more direction, especially since this was my first course in policy. The use of a few case studies could have provided a good framework for the course. For the first half of the semester, discussion sections were not structured, and I don't feel like it helped me to reinforce the material I learned in class.",
    "Q1. The textbooks were not useful -- I only referred them to when I needed to for the paper. The Bardach reading was much better than Hill, however the benefits of the book were not well integrated into the course material. We might as well not have had any textbooks -- I would have preferred highly relevant excerpts from a variety of sources.Q6. The pace of the lectures seemed really slow, and I thought we spent a lot of time on concepts that in the broad picture of things were really not that meaningful. The \"Analysis of\" part of the course could be dramatically shortened -- I don't think there was a need to spend a full day's lecture on each of the different macro policy theories we studied.Q8. I liked the academic exercise of dissecting different ways of thinking about and through policy. I didn't like the fact that by the end of the course, that analytical academic exercise had all but stripped away any concrete skills that might be applicable in the real world.Q10. I want to go into policy work, and have worked in policy before. I took the course because it was Foundations and I felt I couldn't legitimately pass out of it because I hadn't taken a lot of formal policy class. I should have, because aside from a bit of new academic poli-sci terminology, I don't think I got a lot of valuable new skills out of the course.",
    "(all my answers were just erased due to the site timing out, so these responses may be harsher than before and not very clear) Responding to question 7: Michael was a great TA, kept discussion going and helped us form cogent arguments for the class assignments. Went off on tangents and rants sometimes, but kept us engaged in the class and talking about ideas we did not cover very much in class.",
    "The first half of the course was least helpful, as it was very theoretical and confusing. The second half became much more interesting, as we looked at environmental case studies and learned to how to write a policy evaluation memo. It would have been nice to have practitionner speakers come in to tell us how class material relates to real life work settings.",
    "N\/A",
    "The TA sessions were not very valuable to this course. They seemed very unorganized and unplanned.The concepts behind the class were well thought out, but in practice, the course was poorly executed. Overall I felt it was very unorganized.As a foundation course, I do not feel like I learned as much as I should have about the policy process. In addition, the readings were not very helpful.I really enjoyed listening to the professors stories and examples. Although some of his lectures were scattered, it was obvious that he put a lot of effort into developing this course. He is very animated and passionate about his job, which is refreshing.",
    "My overall comment on this class is that the mid-course changes to the class and syllabus were good ones. Keep going in that direction I say.I also felt that the policy memo part of the class should be reconsidered in how it is taught to us. Those lectures and classes seemed a bit scattered in terms of seemingly mixed information that we were receiving about how to construct. More attention to developing specific reading or in-house material that is composed for this class's specific policy memo is urged.Otherwise, I gave my ideas for future additions\/considerations at our end-of-semester class discussion.",
    "Question 1: I was very disappointed in the readings assigned for this course. Rather than relating abstract political science concepts to environmental issues, particularly those of interest to the students, the vast majority of the readings were aimed at scholars in the political science field and failed to capture my interest.Question 2: The professor often seemed scattered and unprepared to cohesively present the material in an introductory manner. I found two of the three TAs were the best at actually explaining and illustrating the conceptual material comprehensively.Question 3: The policy memo was too structured, requiring me to bend my subject to the extreme to fit the assignment. The students and the TAs perceived the cost-benefit paper as merely busy work. The final future classes memo was an unconstructive use of everyone\u0092s time.Question 7: The professor was highly regarded and thus I thought this class had much promise. Instead, I was very disappointed with the obvious disorganization and lack of cohesion in his teaching throughout the semester.Question 8: I would not recommend any other student to take this course if they intend to pursue a non-academic career.Question 9: More guest lecturers would have been very beneficial.Question 10: Although politics are a factor in my career sector, this class failed to cohesively connect academia and theory to real-world change and practice.",
    "I audited this course, and so did not do the out-of-class assignments (or, for that matter, many of the readings). The first half of the semester was great to audit, with well-paced lectures and discussions of theoretical ideas in political science that apply well to natural resource issues. The second half was much more about the specific type of policy memo\/problem solving format we were learning, focused on two significant out-of-class assignments. Since I wasn't doing those assignments, I lost interest somewhat at this point.",
    "Re: 1)Initial reading load was too heavy and much of the reading was irrelevant; this was quickly corrected in the course of the class, and the 'streamlined' reading assignments thereafter were overall much more manageable and helpful."

    "combining theory and practice into a unified framework through which policy analysis can be performed.",
    "Discussion sections were a nice way to break into smaller groups to discuss topics; the papers were well-designed to enhance the learning that was occurring in the classroom",
    "I was able to shape assignments around my interests. I really appreciated this! It gave me the opportunity to explore the issues most important to me in a policy context.",

    "The ideas about the history of the policy-making process and the basic structure of the class are quite logical and make sense.",

    "- Shimi went above and beyond when it came to office hours and making sure that students understood course material. He would hold his own open office hours sessions every week in addition to the TA office hours which was awesome. He was very patient with those of us who didn't have a strong background in physical science, and always answered any questions we had.- I learned a lot in this class. It was a great way to learn about a variety of disciplines (chemistry, hydrology, geology, atmospheric science) in a short amount of time.- Very clear powerpoints and slides, we got printouts every class which was very helpful for us to follow along and take notes on.",
    "I think the policy memo was an interesting exercise and I learned a lot doing it. However, the classes that were meant to guide us through the thought process, were very unhelpful. We never made it past the problem definition, objectives, and goals, so I felt less prepared for the second half of the paper.",
    "The written assignments were especially helpful in applying the concepts",
    "I enjoyed the opportunity to select a topic of my choice for the policy memo.",

    "The final memo assignment. I worked very hard and learned a great deal about my chosen subject. This was challenging and informative.",

   "comments": [
    "Clearer PPT.",
    "We spent too much time talking about the memo, laboring through everyone's questions about how they should do it. Maybe all the questions were useful for others but they wasted several classes for me.",
    "Some lectures, especially towards the beginning were very hard to follow. To his credit, the instructor mentioned that this would be the case, but I think the lectures could be clarified somewhat and the assignment requirements could be better organized. It would be nice to have a very clear assignment description from the beginning, although it worked out as is.",
    "A clearer framework from the beginning might offer a better experience as it would be clear where we were heading.",
    "Lecture style and content. More depth and more structure would be helpful.",
    "The content of lecture material: This course should decide whether it wants to be a theory course or a skills-based course. Right now, it tries to be both and doesn't do either justice. If it's going to be a theory course, I recommend turning it into a more discussion-focused seminar course (which I think really would have made the class more engaging), and bumping it from required foundations.If it's going to be skills based, which I think I would have found more helpful and relevant, I would dramatically reduce the scale of the \"analysis of\" material and focus primarily throughout the year on \"analysis for.\" I would have students start the policy analysis earlier in the semester, and create various \"sub deadlines\" so that people would really have the time to make it truly \"iterative\" (as was the goal). I suggest allowing students more opportunity to discuss their memos with fellow students (either in class or in discussion section), as I think there is a lot of collective expertise and perspective in classmates that we were unable to tap into. I would use lectures to give students tools for (or at least more practice in) various \"analysis for\" skills such as: Thinking through implications of action (those that we came up with for our memos and case studies seemed to be pretty anecdotal); Identifying and engaging the full realm of stakeholders; Reasons for choosing between voluntary, combined, and command-control policy options; and Writing for \"clients.\"I thought that the case studies used in class needed to cover three different levels of governance and three different \"Scopes\" of problems. I also think it would have been very helpful to see more case studies of existing policies, and work through class material thinking about those in retrospect.",
    "To answer the students' questions is a good aspect of the instructor, but sometimes he digresses and cannot cover what he should teach. So, time management against what he should taught should be improved.",
    "Overall I was disappointed that Prof Cashore did not seem to put a lot of time into providing structured, organized lectures that had enough intellectual meat to keep us busy, thinking, and to grapple with. Lots of lectures were disorganized, they had mostly recycled material from previous lectures, he would spend ridiculous amounts of time talking about irrelevant things, and did not make it clear that he was an expert in this field, even though he clearly is. Too much student participation and input also negatively affected the class, because Cashore appeared unwilling to direct the class toward the topics that were to be covered. The case studies, which were selected loosely based on some student input, were never clearly fleshed out and were decided quite after the fact. Only several weeks later were we given some background information on the cases, but there was no time to take this anywhere. Cases were presented as cartoons onto which we could project whatever preconceived biases we already had. They were certainly not treated seriously as environmental issues to be approached practically from the discipline of political science. It wasn't even clear what the approach of political science is supposed to be in an environmental and resource issue, and this is because a strong case for it was never made.Finally, the constantly changing requirements and reading assignments kept surprising us, which as students is simply not appreciated. We never knew what was coming up, and the syllabus was not clearly laid out ahead of time in order to give us any opportunity to plan. It just seemed we were blindly stumbling from one week to the next, with no connection between topics or classes. This is not written out of bitterness, because I'm pretty sure I did quite well in the class. Rather it is the feeling that at a place like Yale, we want to feel like we are receiving the best effort of the instructor and being treated like colleagues if we are also expected to offer our best effort.",
    "Less theory, a more visible connection to real life practical\/professional settings.",
    "- People who have strong backgrounds in physical science should not be in this class. There were several students who were very comfortable with the material (i.e. had majored in it for undergrad, or had been using it for a job) and then a large portion of the class that was really struggling with the material. If this is truly going to be an intro course, then it should not be assumed that all students are familiar with the equations and techniques discussed in class.- Although problem sets were helpful for understanding the material, they were difficult to do if you did not have a background in physical science and required a lot of extra help\/going to office hours to try and figure out how to complete the problems.",
    "I like how we started with theory; however, we did not go in very much depth and I felt like I had limited background on some of the more important theories. In addition, the second half of the course could have been very interesting and useful, but our discussions were frustrating and limited. I would have preferred more of a lecture style as opposed to a class discussion. The discussion could have been left up to our TA discussion groups.THe final paper (future class memo) was not helpful.",
    "The course needs better organization and cohesion, as well as more of a connection to the underlying F&ES curriculum if the course is supposed to meet an MEM requirement.",
    "Overall organisation of the course could be improved, with perhaps more structure around the case studies - not focusing the entire course on them, but integrating them more thoroughly into the two main parts of the course.For the first half of the class, a clearer emphasis on the importance (or lack thereof) of terminology, specifically a clear acknowledgment of which terminology is well-defined and important and which is less so, would be immensely helpful, particularly for all the scientists in the class.In addition, I think an even greater attempt to explain the structure of the class from the outset would help reduce frustration significantly.",
    "Professor Cashore seemed to be making each day up as he went. There were terrible redundancies across lessons and an insane amount of time was spent \"chatting\" about our already over-described assignments. I found the reduction of large, complicated ideas into phrases and sound-bites basically a useless endeavor. I found both the readings and the lectures to be too cursory and superficial to really add value Despite doing well in class, I feel that I have little understanding of or appreciation for the methods or concepts we studied.Next time, pick a few important concepts (not two dozen) and really dig into them in-depth. Use a different, smaller room and call on students to explain or discuss the readings, which should be more primary literature. Additionally, having several smaller assignments dealing with each concept would have forced us to grapple with concepts earlier on and with greater attention. Please dont spend an entire class discussing an assignment! Some of us came to Yale prepared to do graduate level work and do not need to be coddled.It would be beneficial, however, to write other sections of the memo before our final. Specifically the Policy Evaluation section. I basically winged it and felt like I was just making things up. Maybe that's how it is done but I would like to learn some real tools for policy evaluation...",
    "Although Professor Cashore is energetic and enthusiastic, his lectures were often (not always) disorganized and lacked clarity. In particular, his powerpoint presentations were a mess- not only were they often impossible to follow, they frequently obfuscated the point he was trying to make. The course needs a stronger anchor in a couple of case studies to be used for the duration of the course."

    "This class covers a lot of information and has homework assignments that are technical\/confusing at times. However, if you get confused you should definitely go to office hours where the TAs and professor will walk you through how to do everything and offer you more explanation.",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "Think about what policy questions \/ problems that you want answered and read up on them in preparation for the final assignment.",
    "I would not advise other students to take this course, unless they were specifically interested in forest policy science.",
    "Be open-minded yet prepared for some frustration in the first half of the course; it may often seem irrelevant but does come together. Use your common sense in dealing with the material, and feel free to question everything. In the second half of the course, be creative."
