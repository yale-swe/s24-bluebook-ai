    "This class challenged me to apply critical thinking and to utilize concepts learned in many of the other classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Benzene rings. Drawing the perfect hexagon and chair structure. Logic puzzles.",
    "This class taught me a lot about how organic molecules interact with each other.",
    "This course covered detailed organic chemistry mechanisms. It was a lot of memorization, but as time went on, patterns emerged and you got a better sense of continuity between topics covered in class.",
    "Literally organic chemistry, that is all.",
    "I think I got a very wide base in organic chemistry and how it applies to biochemistry from this course. I definitely feel like I have a strong grasp on organic chemistry going into more advanced chemistry courses now.",
    "I learned A LOT of organic chemistry reactions and concepts. Because this class has so much material and memorization, I learned a lot of reactions and patterns (and how to apply patterns in orgo reactions).",
    "I learned more complex reactions in organic chemistry and gained a deeper understanding of how mechanisms work chemically. I also learned about different biological molecules and the chemical reactions they can undergo in the context of the other mechanisms we were covering.",
    "I gained an increased understanding of Organic Chemistry and the patterns\/ reactivity of certain chemical functional groups. I also increased understanding of resonance and had more contact with topics relating to biochemistry.",
    "Second level organic chemistry, fairly straightforward in terms of content",
    "I learned a lot about the general patterns of organic chemistry this semester. While first semester I learned a lot of reactions and memorized reagants, this semester I feel like I learned a lot more about what drives reactions to occur and why some molecules are more reactive than others.",

    "I actually gained the beginnings of chemical intuition from this course. It is impossible to memorize certain reactions (in the time frame that we have for the course), so it is necessary to do so. The fact that I can actually now predict a mechanism is something I never thought I'd be able to do. Very cool.",
    "I learnt a lot in this course. Initially, I found the concepts of the class slightly difficult. But it was extremely satisfying at the end when it all clicked and I was able to answer questions comfortably - it was enjoyable!",
    "This course was a good continuation of CHEM 220. I thought that it reinforced a lot of common organic chemistry concepts and it was really useful in strengthening my logic. It was a good amount of memorization as well, especially when it came to the final exam, but in general I felt it was very useful to me. I also felt that it was interesting to learn about biological molecules that I have heard about in MCDB courses, simply because it was relevant to what I am studying in other classes. For example, fatty acid synthesis and phosphate chemistry was particularly relevant to other subjects I am studying.",

The information was extremely interesting and the class was fairly engaging as well! I enjoyed the challenge of the material and really enjoyed the teaching of Professor Crawford and my TF as well.",
    "This course builds upon conceptual knowledge developed in CHEM 220, with a strong emphasis on mechanistic problem-solving. As someone who is not particularly interested in biological systems (and most people taking the course are without a doubt pre-med, so I was in the minority), much of the biological tie-ins flew over my head, but I really enjoy the mechanistic problem-solving approach and I think the design of this course forces you to use problem-solving skills in a unique way by looking at problems from multiple angles, simulating solutions in your head, etc.",
    "In depth knowledge of organic chemistry reactions and mechanisms, with biological applications.",
    "I loved orgo 2 (Chem 221) with Professor Crawford! A lot of people will say that it's a downer to have to move on from Professor Ellman (the incredible orgo 1 professor of this sequence), but I honestly enjoyed learning from Crawford and felt that orgo 2 was much more engaging and applicable than orgo 1. There's a greater sense of problem-solving involved in orgo 2, which is a nice change from the huge amount of memorization required in orgo 1. While orgo 2 was more challenging, it was a highly worthwhile experience and made me really love orgo.",

    "I learned more Organic Chemistry.",

    "I continued to learn mechanisms for organic reactions.",
    "Learned more orgo reactions and about organic molecules.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This was a decent course that I really liked for some reason. Lecture wasn't super helpful, but Jason Crawford was pretty entertaining. He made lots of bad (sometimes offensive) chemistry jokes that had us on the edge of our seats.",
    "I could already tell that this course was improved from last year. I liked how transparent the midterm topics were and felt that it was fair. However, I wish that there was more structured reading assignments and homework questions like in Ellman's class. I was glad throughout the course to be able to reference the textbook when I didn't catch something in class.",
    "Solid course with interesting material, just seemed a little disorganized.",
    "Strengths were that lecture was helpful in providing good notes. Weaknesses were that there was little help outside of class to prepare for tests - we got 3 worksheets to go off of and some problems but they weren't enough. For midterm 3, I felt like we had very little resources to prepare.",
    "The strength of this course was the material. I really grew to love organic chemistry over the course of the semester, which surprised me. The course could be improved if the teaching fellows were asked to review what we had covered in lecture, like a \"summary\" of sorts, to help make sure all the students in each section were generally on the same page, instead of only doing a set of practice problems given each week. My TF, Julie Sinclair, did this, and it was extremely helpful when it came to reviewing concepts for an exam or even just to generally reinforce what we had learned in class. I know that other TF's didn't necessarily do this, however, and according to some of my friends who were also in the course, it would have been really helpful for them if they had.",
    "strengths: i happened to have a good TA weaknesses: few people understood what was going on until midterms rolled around",
    "The material is difficult and was not presented in a very engaging or organized way.",
    "The lectures were unorganized and I think the biological examples that Professor Crawford used were too complicated. There was a TA who substituted in for him one day and he never used large biological molecules to explain concepts. That was the first time I felt like I understood what was going on during class.",
    "Very goo class.",
    "A major weakness of the course is the lack of adequate review material. Review lectures are helpful, but a lack of practice exams was detrimental, and review sessions were poorly-run and too short.",
    "It was taught fairly well. The discussion section material could have been shorter so it could be covered in more detail.",
    "Practice tests.",
    "Pros: Class lecture is quite informative, both for understanding the concepts and for the various exam hints dropped in the lecture. Meets only twice a week compared to the other chem classes of 3x\/week. Cons: Very time and energy intensive. Meets very early in the morning (900-1015) and the walk to science hill is quite long. do not fall behind in this class!",
    "Improve this by getting better TAs. They need to actually help us learn concepts that we struggle with in class. Not provide examples about concepts that we'll learn later, or provide super super hard examples and only give us minimal help during discussion section. Why were they like this. have worksheets that give us a number of APPROPRIATE examples please please please please give us practice tests. we have no idea what we're going into and we dont have that many practice problems to go through. i ended up having to look up examples online. please give us practice tests. why were there literally no practice tests. please book problems weren't really similar enough to the problems that we do in class. or it felt like disproportionately hard and daunting because there were so many of them.",
    "I think there should be problem sets assigned and graded for the class each week.",
    "Exam review sessions were very helpful when the TAs knew what they were doing.",
    "Strengths: good examples, interesting material, material builds on each other, cohesive, amazing Teaching Fellow staff Weaknesses: poorly organized lectures, no practice exams",
    "Lecture was pretty straight forward, and I enjoyed working in groups on problems in section. The strengths were that, unlike first semester orgo, all the material built on itself and at the end I felt like I had a cohesive view of the class. The major weakness was that the TA's wrote the exams. There was no consistency among TAs in the specifics of how to do things, so one TA would tell us to do a problem one way and we'd get it wrong on the exam because the TA who wrote the question or graded the question disagreed. The questions also rarely had to do with textbook problems. I would have preferred going into exams knowing that the questions would cover stuff stated in lectures\/practice problems rather than having no idea each time. That being said, the exams were fair just stressful in my opinion.",
    "The course was largely mechanism based and the topics connected to each other, making it interesting to see how everything fit together by the end of the course. However, during the process, a lot of the information seemed to be isolated and it wasn't until much later that the connections between topics could be made studying on your own outside of class.",
    "No psets means a lot of emphasis on midterms and finals, but you can work at your own pace which is nice",
    "The course was incredibly disorganized and relied too heavily on the TAs. For starters, the first third and last third of the course felt very random and disorganized. In the first third of the class, we covered topics that didn't make sense because of an inadequate foundation in chemistry and we only learned the material necessary to understand those topics towards the middle of the semester. Leaving those topics for the end of the semester would have thus made more sense. It was also very unclear as to what we were expected to know about each topic since the topics on the exam were only listed the week before the exam and usually we'd covered a lot more material than what ended up being tested. I also wish the course followed the book more closely because the textbook problems assigned were very very very different from the kinds of problems we were tested on, down to the very logic and thought processes of the problems. This made it really hard to study for the course because the TAs\/the professor didn't make enough supplementary problems to practice the concepts outside of the book problems.",
    "Strengths include the focus on the most important subjects from the textbook. Weaknesses include the lack of engagement from all the faculty.",
    "Pretty interesting course with reasonable expectations of the students.",
    "This course had a lot of interesting information in it and I definitely feel like I left with a much better grasp of how organic chemical reactions work. At the same time, I wish that the course had been organized in a slightly more accessible way. We went over some reactions multiple times at different times in the year without a distinct reason for placing those reactions in each unit very clearly designated. For instance, I think we started learning aldol reactions before the first exam, but they didn't really start making sense until the end of the year, after we learned more carbonyl chemistry. I think it would have made more sense to cover reactions only once but with clear reasoning for why those reactions are being contextualized in that way. I think it would also have helped me a lot to receive notes in a clearer way. Especially at the beginning of the year, I was frequently confused about what the names of the reactions being covered were and how they related to each other. It would have made a huge difference if we received outlines for the different conceptual areas being covered in each chunk of classes so that we could have a mental framework for organizing the information being taught. Similarly, I would have really liked learning more generalized mechanisms rather than starting with specific examples because that would have been easier to extrapolate to other molecules -- for instance, being told that an electrophilic aromatic substitution is between an aromatic ring and an electrophile, then running through the reaction with extremely generalized molecules, then being given specific examples of kinds of electrophiles and kinds of aromatic substances that would react together in the same way.",
    "The course is quite good, however there was much content that was covered in lecture that ultimately didn't prove to be relevant to topics that we needed to master. Section really helped provide clarity in this regard.",
    "The course offers very little in terms of Student Resources. Lecture Notes are poorly formatted and difficult to comprehend. Discussion section worksheets do not provide enough information about the mechanisms at hand, often leaving out the names of the topics, and answer keys posted for discussion section worksheets and midterm exams are fairly unhelpful because of the lazy refusal to include the mechanisms, rendering them ineffective for any student who is actually using them to check his\/her work. Overall, very inexcusable resources for a Yale course, especially compared to other STEM departments like Computer Science.",
    "I had heard pretty bad reviews about Orgo II with Crawford, but I think that he did a good job incorporating past feedback in order to improve the course. Though sometimes the lectures felt like they went off into tangents, he was overall upfront and clear about the topics we were supposed to be covering, making it easy to go back to the textbook to clarify any points. Overall, not the horrible experience I was expecting, and thought that the class was interesting and fair.",
    "While I ended up learning a lot of the general principles for organic chemistry, a lot of it happened on my own outside of class or from the TA's. In class, Professor Crawford mostly showed us different reactions, but on the exam he expected us to be able to apply principles rather than show memorized reactions. I wish he had gone over trends in class because I think that would have made it easier to understand all of the reactions he threw at us.",
    "This course suffers because there is a very large amount of material to cover, and most of it is difficult to understand. The course gets a bad reputation for this that at times isn't necessarily deserved. Professor Crawford helped us out a lot with the structure of his exams, and by telling us what would be on the exam beforehand.",
    "The set-up of the sections was great. Working through problems in small groups under the supervision of the TA was very conducive to learning.",
    "Given that the exam questions are quite different from those in the textbook, it might help to have some sort of practice exam prior to midterms and finals.",
    "Sort of disorganized. Class doesn't really parallel textbook at all. TFs make exams, and made the first one way too difficult.",
    "I love the format of orgo, I think that the grading is fair and the ability to drop an exam reduces my anxiety by so much and allows me to actually perform better. Contrary to popular belief, I think the ability to drop an exam makes me study for each of them so much harder. I do not find that if I do well on the first two, I don't study for the last, instead I find that I study even harder. I do think however, that 50% of your grade resting on a final is pretty ridiculous, I think it should be more so like 30% 30% 40% or 25% 25% 40% and 10% based on clicker questions or something.",
    "Weaknesses: There are no practice exams, so it can be hard to gauge how much you know before heading into the exam. Lecture was not as organized as Orgo 1.",
    "A strength is that there is a lot of help available if you need trouble, and the information is repetitive so when you understand a concept it is repeatedly used. A weakness is the quality fo help you get, sometimes the professor or TA would not put a lot of effort into helping the students understand the material, or presenting it in an unclear way.",
    "Lectures could be greatly benefited by labeling specific examples with the broader theme they cover (like actually write it on the board before you start the problem.) This would work really well with the system of giving us broad themes to study before the midterms. The big themes given to us before exams are extremely helpful in organizing our studying.",
    "Lectures were hard to follow, the professor came across as unfriendly and condescending towards students who did not understand the material, and students did not always receive the support or resources necessary to adequately prepare for the exams",
    "Strengths: interesting material, exams were very fair, well organized, well taught Weaknesses: Practice problems on worksheets for section were too challenging considering we had just learned the concepts and had no previous easier practice problems to work off of.",
    "Things that we were learning were not always clear. Ungraded problem sets (more extensive than those in section) would be very helpful.",
    "Section was very useful - had a great TA! Professor was great! Sometimes his notes on the board were a bit scattered so my lecture notes were slightly difficult to study from, but he was great overall!",
    "The strengths of this class are the TAs and the lecturer. The TAs are very patient and genuinely put in a lot of effort into teaching their sections. Professor Crawford is also a great lecturer, however he could work on making his lectures more organized.",
    "I thought the course was very good at introducing biological molecules into the world of Yale's intro organic chemistry. However, I thought the organization of the class could be improved, particularly with regard to the way things were introduced in lecture (for example, explaining what terms meant before using them. Like something as simple as saying that an amine is an -RNH2 group, etc). Finally, I think feedback after exams and from TAs was sparse and difficult to understand. Sometimes the exam graders would mark points off on an exam problem but not write exactly what was wrong or what to fix.",
    "The weakness of this class was the lack of clear organization of the material and the lack of practice exams and questions.",
    "With Crawford it's less synthesis focused and more bio molecule focused. That was fine, but I really did not like that the TAs wrote the tests. Many questions were unclear, and several times (I count 5) I went to my TA to ask why I received points off only to have him say, \"Oh yeah, that question wasn't really fair.\" Which I don't think is acceptable.",
    "Not great. Professor Crawford did not provide practice exams like Ellman did the previous semester, which was a huge fault. The TAs seemed to do all of the work, from designing tests to practice problems to teaching to a large degree.",
    "The course is great as there are no assignments but the tests. This is a blessing and a curse because all the learning and studying is up to you. I think some people struggled with this, but i like only having optional homework.",
    "There's a lot of material in the class and because of the speed of lectures, I had to learn a lot of it at home.",
    "The course can be structured a bit better for the students.",
    "A strength of this course is the awesome job Professor Crawford does with lecturing in an all-encompassing manner. He seems to cover everything in the book in record time. Section is also helpful in that working together to complete practice problems provides a great environment to learn and for the TF to answer students' questions. A weakness of this course is that not all of the practice problem answer keys had the entire mechanism written out, so sometimes it was difficult to figure out in what part of the mechanism the error was made.",
    "Strengths: you learn a LOT of orgo, the class is interesting with lots of outside research integrated into it Weaknesses: sometimes the prof and the TAs say different things, so you really need to clarify what is going on",
    "I think assigning P-sets for a portion of the grade would be very helpful; not only would it essentially force students to engage with the material more critically, but it would also soften the blow of a poor midterm grade as the grade breakdown would not solely rely on exam scores.",
    "This course's strengths were definitely the assessment structure and TF's. The instructor and teaching fellows very explicitly outline what will be on each midterm exam (of which there are 3), and the problems on the exam explicitly state which concept they are testing. This really facilitated studying for the exams, which were very fair and accurate in terms of testing material we had learned. My only criticism is that Prof. Crawford's teaching differed heavily from the textbook in terms of his preference for mechanisms, and his notes are often disorganized (particularly those put online) such that it is difficult to ascertain where he is going with a particular subject. Additionally, the worksheets done in section often brought little to bear on the actual material we were learning or being tested on, which made section seem like a waste of time at times even though TF's are an invaluable resource.",
    "The course covers a broad range of material and does a good job relating it to biological concepts. However it is a failure on the department to have this taught by Crawford after almost everyone in the class had John Ellman first semester. Ellman does such an excellent job of organizing the class and explaining the material that the course seems very poorly explained in the second semester. To understand organic chemistry you MUST have good practice problems and we almost NEVER did. The book problems did not match the difficulty on the exams or the content in class and many times neither did the discussion section problems. Thus it was VERY difficult to fully understand the material because you could not practice it! Better practice problems must be designed and assigned. It also made me very uncomfortable that the TAs wrote the exams. These exams determine our grade and it is absurd that we go to Yale and the professor does not even write the exams or grade them himself.",
    "Crawford doesn't provide practice exams for the midterms, but he does go over a succinct list of topics that will be on the midterm two classes before every midterm. These \"mini reviews\" are always really helpful, as he also allots time to answer any student questions, so definitely pay attention during these and take advantage of asking blatant questions like \"Will [this topic] be on the exam?\" - Crawford will answer them. The TA's are also a godsend; they might give out incredibly hard \"challenge\" problems for section every week, but the exam questions are definitely more reasonable and fair to the material Crawford covers directly in class. My TA answered emails really quickly and would draw out whole mechanisms for me every time I was confused, so I'd say to really take advantage of the TA's and their willingness to help! A note: Crawford is definitely more disorganized than Ellman - he doesn't always include headers for the material he covers in class, so you might be confused about what topic you're even learning and how it relates to the previous or following topics. But this can be remedied by just looking over your notes after class and reasoning how everything fits together. The book is helpful in organization, but isn't necessary (nor are the book problems Crawford suggests) to your success!",
    "I wish it focused more on the processes and underlying reasons that drive mechanisms, rather than just teaching a few dozen patterns.",
    "The professor could've been much more engaged in teaching the material and in helping the students.",
    "This course was actually not as difficult as I thought it would be; however I have a few recommendations to make. Professor Crawford might want to consider teaching by showing first the basic structure of the reaction, and then using a more complicated example rather than vise versa. While showing that the chemistry we learn in class applies to the real world is very interesting and insightful, showing the real world application first makes it harder to learn how exactly the reactions function.",
    "I really liked that Prof. Crawford based the class off of Loudon's textbook so that there was continuity between CHEM220 and CHEM221. Lecture often felt disorganized and I found myself going back post-lecture to re-organize my notes.",
    "This course does not provide enough opportunities to practice the material you are learning..there are 3 midterms and 1 final. The final exam is half your grade. TAs, not the professor, write the exam.",
    "The course material was interesting but the lecture was disorganized and a clear logical flow to the concepts was not established.",
    "The course was organized very well and ample feedback was provided for exams and questions. However, the grading scale could be improved. A final exam worth 50% of the grade is heavy when considering that one day determines half of the overall grade.",
    "A standard lecture course. Prof Crawford is not the best professor, but at least it's clear (enough) what he wants you to learn. It'd be nice if he would stop talking about how easy orgo is though, and spend that time teaching in a more organized and straightforward manner.",
    "Overall very good but potentially adding in P Sets would be good because 50% of your grade relying on the final is a lot",
    "I found the material extremely interesting when I was studying for tests and understanding the mechanisms was very rewarding. However, I really think that the material could be better presented in lecture - Prof. Crawford went on so many biological tangents that were not covered at all on the exams and made studying much more difficult. I wish he had focused on the important mechanisms and went over more practice problems. I also found the book itself and problems very unhelpful.",
    "The setup of the course (lectures twice a week, optional homework, and 3 midterms with one that you can drop) was the course's biggest strength. This setup allowed students to have more control over their level of engagement with the class while still requiring the effort be put into it.",
    "The course does a good job on building on previous material, while also introducing new concepts, reactions, mechanisms, and applications. The set up of the course, however, could be a bit better. Although it can be annoying to do homework, I think it could be a way to allow students to prove their dedication to the course and gain better practice with the material before being assessed on examinations.",
    "Crawford needs to start usijg TRANSITION SENTENCES.",
    "The course is not taught well. The professor is condescending and the format of the class is not conducive to learning.",
    "The strength of this course is that the professor and TFs are highly knowledgeable. The weaknesses lie in the lack of resources provided to us in this course. In CHEM220, the TFs would provide us with sheets that summarized major topics and \"cheats\" for understanding major concepts, but we simply did problems during the discussion sections for CHEM221.",
    "Just don't take it",
    "This class felt like a large step down from Professor Ellman in 220. Professor Crawford is a very smart, likable professor, but the way the course is run, it feels very disorganized and like the teaching staff do not care at all. To improve, the class should have smaller quizzes like in 220, but most importantly, practice exams. TA's only started making answer keys for worksheets with mechanisms drawn out late into the semester. Overall, it felt like very little effort was put into caring for the students. The material itself is interesting enough, but much more organization and care is needed.",
    "Well taught and structured.",
    "Lavk of practice midterms and finals, bad professor and boring material made this one of the worst classes of my Yale career.",
    "This course is very bad. The lecturer was terrible. The TAs were also not good.",
    "The fact that the TAs created the exams really showed through, particularly on the first midterm. The problems were not entirely relevant to the material that had been most emphasized in lecture, and were far too difficult. Similarly, the worksheets from section often had completely irrelevant or ridiculously difficult problems, which made them impossible to use while studying for the exams and final. It seemed as though the TAs had no gauge of what level the students were actually at -- to be fair, this improved by the third midterm.",
    "The course was not that engaging, but very informational. The strengths were in section where students could participate and practice what they learned. The weakness was that there weren't really any opportunities to check any if we knew what was happening in the class until the midterm.",
    "I think that this class did not have enough support for the students to do well in the class. There weren't any practice exams, the lectures were confusing, the book did not line up with lecture very well, and there were hardly any review sessions.",
    "Strengths - My TA Suzanne was fantastic. Weaknesses - Lectures could be much more organized and the professor was uninspiring.",
    "This course was a little disorganized. Often it was difficult to determine what material was relevant and what was not relevant to study, and the notes often prematurely covered chapters we wouldn't discuss for weeks.",
    "This class was very difficult. The subject material is somewhat straight forward, however the major problem was that we were rarely given assignments or shown examples on the level to which we would be tested, which made assessments very difficult. I think that this class would be greatly improved by having problem sets that would allow students to apply what they know and see ad do problems on the level of what they will see on assessments.",
    "I think small graded psets worth a small part of the grade would be nice, just to receive more feedback on our work before the exams.",
    "This course was well organized and the material by laying a good foundation allowed for interesting problem-solving. I would have liked more extension problems as many of the test problems were largely reiterations of basic mechanisms. This was particularly apparent for the biological applications. As we did not go into very much depth for these applications, test questions only required memorization.",
    "It is not a particularly interesting class. We got through a lot of material and I learned a lot, but there was just too much to remember. At points it makes sense to just memorize things rather than take the time to actually learn about the reaction and why\/how they happen.",
    "The weakness of the course is that the exams were written by the TAs, which resulted in a few unexpectedly difficult problems. The TAs as a group did not seem to have a good grasp on what we understood and didn't. The haphazardness of the topics we were assigned was also a little confusing sometimes."

   "comments": [
    "You are probably taking orgo II because you have to take it. It's not horrible. Definitely not as much of a well oiled machine as orgo I, but not horrible by any means.",
    "I would recommend it only if you have to take it...",
    "You're probably taking this class cause you're pre-med or ChemE. A decent class as long as you put the work into it.",
    "it's a no from me",
    "take it if you have to",
    "Recommended for anyone who needs the class for their major or for medical school. Try to take it when someone other than Professor Crawford is teaching; I've heard good things about the other professors.",
    "It is an ok course. If you are interested in organic chemistry or you have to take this course for your major or for pre-med requirements, then it really isn't all that bad. However, I would never tell someone to take this course for fun. If you want an entertaining organic chemistry course, take Chem 220 with Jonathan Ellman",
    "I would recommend this course. It is not as bad as everyone thinks or says it is. It is interesting material especially if you are pre med.",
    "Nope. This is the bio version of Orgo II and the only one offered this semester. Standard review of dienes, alcohols, carboxylic acids, enols and some random topics, but no synthesis and generally bad. Crawford is disorganized and calls students stupid pretty often. Don't take if normal orgo 2 is offered. Otherwise, you don't really have a choice.",
    "Take it if you have to--it doesn't measure up to orgo 1 with Ellman by any standards so the difference is a little disappointing. Helpful if necessary but not glowing by any means.",
    "it's a must for some majors and\/or premed",
    "It's fine. It's not great. If you can take it with Ellman instead, do it. There's nothing wrong with Crawford. The class just feels like it lacks structure. Also, there aren't any practice tests, which is kinda cruel. The book questions are a waste of time. Hope you get a good TA. as always, KhanAcademy is great, but two new ones for me were Leah4Sci and ProfessorDaveExplains, and they were really helpful. You can def get through it, but it won't be as easy breezy beautiful as orgo I.",
    "This class was not the best. Especially compared to first semester orgo with Ellman. The exams were much harder, and the grade is entirely exam based. Would not recommend unless you're absolutely sure it's necessary.",
    "Only take this class if required for your major, or if you are pre-med. this class will suck up a lot of your free time, and will also need additional work to understand the concepts.",
    "don't take this unless you absolutely have to",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "Compared to what I had heard about this class before taking it, it was a lot less impossible and frustrating. Very doable.",
    "Recommended-- enjoyable logical puzzle-like class.",
    "Orgo is definitely a great class for any stem major where you get to learn why molecules interact in the ways they do. I loved it!",
    "If you are interested in specific mechanisms between biochemical processes, then take this class.",
    "I mean it's organic chemistry 2, you know what you're getting yourself into!",
    "This course is only worth taking if you like chemistry or you need it for your major.",
    "I would only recommend this course to premeds because the faculty is not prime for an orgo 2 learning environment. While you can learn everything by yourself and succeed in the course on your own learning time, Professor Crawford was very removed from the students, did not provide good answer keys to his exams, and made me feel like I was on my own. He was a fine lecturer and his outlines before exams were great. However, most people spent this class learning reactions and concepts from the textbook or on their own.",
    "A fascinating class once everything starts to click, and having more familiarity with reactions and mechanisms actually allows that to start to happen in this class much more than it did for me in orgo 1. Notes can be a little confusing or out of order, but if you make sure you can generalize the reaction mechanisms before each exam and understand why everything is happening, you should be fine.",
    "Definitely take Orgo 2, it was much more interesting than Orgo 1.",
    "Not in the way that is is taught at Yale, No. Never.",
    "If you have to take orgo, then you have to take orgo and there is not much you can do about it. Taking it with Crawford is a fairly good experience, definitely not as painful as people in previous years have made it out to be",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because I definitely learned a lot. I can't say if it would be better to take it with another Professor, but I definitely think this class is worthwhile if you're interested in biology or chemistry at all.",
    "No. I would never recommend this course to my worst enemy (unless this person had chosen a major which required it, then I would suggest a change of major).",
    "I truly believe orgo can be a fascinating course matter. It's logical and it's extremely visual for those learners who thrive on that. As a case in point, I think a lot of people really enjoyed the first semester Orgo 1, taught by Professor Ellman. Unfortunately, this course fell short of all my expectations. Two main problems that led to a lot of frustration during the semester: 1) The professor seemed very disengaged from the course: did not write the exams; did not provide ANY practice exams; did not show up for the proctoring of the exams; (the TAs also did not have office hours). There were no assessments besides the exams, and even then your score could not tell you exactly how well you were doing, because you had no idea how the curve would work out. 2) The professor was extremely disorganized. Perhaps it is hard to be compared to Professor Ellman who seemed so experienced with this curriculum, but Professor Crawford wrote randomly on different corners of one chalkboard; he started going through parts of a problem without introducing it, or even systematically building up the required background knowledge to understand it. Everyone in my section would have to go back through their notes with a TA asking, what was going on here? and what was this reaction called? and what was this an example of? I would recommend working as much as possible with the peer tutors so the big themes will \"click\" as early on as possible.",
    "You probably don't have a choice if you are taking this class. My advice would be try to see the large picture of the reactions covered in class before you dig into the nitty gritty of the mechanisms. The workload is fair as long as you keep up with the class.",
    "Chances are, if you're taking this course, it's because you have to. It's much harder than first semester orgo, so be prepared.",
    "Do not take this course unless you have to- very difficult.",
    "This class is difficult in that even if you put in the time to learn the material, you might not get the desired results.",
    "Take this course only if it is a pre-req, otherwise stay away.",
    "Orgo is very interesting but it really is a lot of work. There are no psets or work besides the 3 midterms and a final. That being said, it's important to stay on top of the work so that you're not cramming the week before the exam. If you're willing to put the effort in then this class is very rewarding and you will feel like you learned a lot after it all.",
    "If possible, don't take it with Professor Crawford",
    "Yes! You learn so much more about how organic chemistry plays out in biology and pharmaceuticals, and is much more interesting and engaging, though challenging, than first semester.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is more relevant to those who are pre-med and interested in how organic chemistry applies in a biological setting. It makes me more excited for biochem. You will leave with way more chemical intuition than that with which you came in.",
    "Definitely recommend this course! Especially to pre-med students who debate whether to take 2nd semester orgo, as it really builds off the first semester and is enjoyable!",
    "Organic Chemistry II with Jason Crawford is a great class. Just make sure you pay attention during lectures since they aren't very organized. Other than that, it is a very great class.",
    "I think this class is interesting if you would like to go into biochemistry down the road. It is a good introduction to biological molecules in the context of organic chemistry. However, I found it fairly disorganized in teaching style. It also required a lot of work on your own outside of class, especially reading the textbook and doing the optional practice problems, in order to excel on the exams.",
    "It's perfectly fine with Crawford.",
    "Not unless you have to take it. Really difficult, not taught well, and not applicable to other areas.",
    "Really really if you don't have to take this for a prereq don't take it.",
    "I would recommend to anyone that has first semester organic chemistry or some science background just because it goes into so much detail.",
    "Honestly, the material is very exciting once you get a hang of it, but I'm not sure the course was very well taught or organized. I guess it's hard to get all that material into just one semester of organic chemistry, but I would have loved more examples in class (starting out simple, escalating in difficulty) to help me get a hang of it each step of the way.",
    "A lot of people you talk to people don't like Crawford and I don't quite get why. The one thing that is really wrong is that he just is not as organized as a John Ellman, but really no one ever is. Perhaps there is validity to the organization claim, but going through crawford orgo really made me a better critical thinker in having to abstract what I need to personally understand the bigger picture of chemical reactions. I just felt that I was learning more in orgo 2 because I came to terms with the mess and made use of it to help me study. Sure, he's got a funny sense of humor. Sure, he's kind of a nerd. Sure, he's a bit tough at first. But honestly, I found this the most rewarding class when it came to exam time. (although I will say, those are pretty intense and require like 90 minutes for the whole class to actually finish rather than the allotted 75)",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course was my favorite within the chemistry department at Yale, and I found it extremely rewarding as well. The instructor and teaching staff are all very knowledgeable and willing to help. The exams are pretty fair, although rather difficult! I learned so much in this class that I am sure I will take with me as I continue my schooling and vocational plans.",
    "I really really loved orgo! (However, I'm not sure if I just thought that the material was really fun or if the class was actually well-taught.) In general, you have do quite a bit a work on your own. There are no problem sets (just suggested practice problems and problems from section), which means that you HAVE TO keep up on your own. Other than that, I learned quite a bit and really enjoyed it as well! Also, this class does kind of take over your life.",
    "Obviously, I would not recommend this course to a student to fulfill their science distributional requirement. But, if you are trying to decide on whether or not you should take a second semester of organic chemistry, I would recommend it. You will find the second semester far more challenging, but I do think the information is valuable and relevant. If you plan to take any upper level biology courses (i.e. biochem, cell bio, etc), the second semester of orgo is very helpful.",
    "If you enjoy mechanisms, definitely take this course. But, you're probably not going to take this course unless you have to.",
    "This course is only something that you take because you have to (due to pre-med or your major.) The subject material is very important and interesting but without proper practice problems or any importance placed on homework it is almost impossible to receive the practice and support needed to learn the material. Toward the end of the semester Crawford got much much better at organizing the lectures and teaching the material, but still for the majority of the course there was a dearth of appropriate practice problems and it was difficult to reinforce the material learned in class.",
    "Definitely would recommend! Orgo 2 (Chem 221) was a lot more fun than orgo 1, in my opinion, and it's a worthwhile course to have under your belt if you're at all interested in it! (Pre-meds will probably enjoy this required course, too, as I did.)",
    "Only take this course if it is required.",
    "If this class is not required for your major, I recommend taking Biochemistry instead.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to, this class sucks",
    "Yes, it's not as bad as everyone says it is, I think largely because Crawford chose to use Loudon this semester.",
    "I would take it off schedule, if you can.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class just for fun because it is hard and poorly taught but take it if you have to.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who needs this as a requirement.",
    "You probably have to take it; if you don't, I don't see why you'd willingly take this class.",
    "For anybody Interested in STEM, absolutely. It was run much better than freshman Orgo 1 and though difficult, I learned much more",
    "I would actually recommend this course if you enjoyed Orgo I - it is not nearly as bad as it's reputation and the material is actually interesting. However, prepare to do a lot of studying on your own because lectures are quite confusing.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Although a lot of material is covered in one semester, the setup of the class makes it reasonable. You take 3 midterms but can drop one and homework is optional so you can choose your level of engagement of the class (but I will still recommend doing the homework problems and going to lecture and section as this will make studying for the tests much easier and less stressful!!) Overall, I would say this course has very interesting material and has about the same workload level as other STEM classes at Yale.",
    "Don't read the reviews. You'll be fine.",
    "Personally, I wouldn't recommend this course to another student unless they are pre-med or really like chemistry.",
    "Crawford is not a clear lecturer, but he does post his notes. His enthusiasm about the material and willingness to engage with biological application are commendable and even at times engaging, but his explanations are opaque and don't actually provide detailed understanding of the mechanisms for reactions, which I actually missed.",
    "Don't Take it !! Honestly, I wish I had of waited until Summer to take this.",
    "If it is not required, I would not take it. Outside of the few applications to biological processes Professor Crawford discussed, I could not really get into the material he was teaching. I think organic chemistry is just not for me! Perhaps it depends on the person.",
    "It was fine. The class was a bit more disorganized compared to when Ellman taught, but focus on memorizing the reactions Crawford lists before each exam. I didn't do as many problems from the book as in Chem 2.",
    "no",
    "This class feels like a big step down from Ellman. I never felt like the teaching staff cared about my learning or who I was as a student. Crawford's lectures have interesting enough material but are disorganized. There are no practice exams, no detailed answer keys for worksheets, or personalized sections. You will need to keep up yourself with studying because the class is entirely dependent on 2\/3 midterms and the final exam. That being said, the workload (IF YOU ARE GOOD AT KEEPING YOURSELF MOTIVATED AND DO NOT NEED TEACHING STAFF SUPPORT) is not very big because there are no psets. I only recommend if you need for a prerequisite.",
    "If you have to for pre-med.",
    "Don't take unless you absolutely have to. If you're pre-med try to get out of it. One of the worst classes of my Yale career.",
    "No! If it's not required for your major, avoid at all costs! Attending lectures and sections will actually worsen your understanding of the material.",
    "From what I've heard, there are worse things than taking second semester orgo with Crawford, but after having Jonathan Ellman for the first semester (10\/10) I was somewhat disappointed with the organization of the course. Crawford is nice and definitely cares that his students learn the material well, but unfortunately the lectures were still very often confusing and disorganized. I only realized while studying for the final that I actually find the information we covered in class pretty interesting -- somehow the lectures made me really dislike it. Oh, and the tests (especially the first two midterms) and worksheets from section often had problems that were far beyond the difficulty level of the material covered in lecture.",
    "This is a required course and the subject can be interesting. I would recommend it if you need it.",
    "If you take this course, find lecture notes\/review sheets online that correspond to Loudon textbook! This helped a lot in understanding the lecture material. Definitely not the most fun course, but it kind of becomes fun in a disturbing way once the material starts to click.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Crawford was a good professor and section was very useful.",
    "Yes, an awesome class that is very interesting!!! Highly recommend if you like chemistry or biochemistry.",
    "I definitely would not take this if you didn't have to, but most likely you do have to if you're even considering Organic Chemistry.",
    "You probably need to take this class for your major. I think the way to do well in this class is to do the practice problems that are assigned each class (they are not graded, they are just for practice), or at least some of them to keep engaging with the material before it builds up and you have o study a lot right before the midterms. I also found that watching videos online for each reaction HELPS SO MUCH. I never did the practice problems and would read the text book instead which was not helpful at all because you don't practice when you read. Videos saved my grade.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. I believe it was poorly taught and the level at which we were tested was too high.",
    "This course is well taught and the material is engaging. The material allows students to understand the chemistry that underlies many biological processes and to use their knowledge to solve extension problems. I would recommend this course on the basis of the problem solving alone. Also, this course does not have a great amount of work, so it's not a huge burden.",
    "This course is not fun, but you probably have to take it. My condolences. It is not fun, you will be miserable, but it is a necessary evil. Do not fall behind. Be prepared for a lot of studying."
