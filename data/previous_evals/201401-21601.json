    "I took this class as an elective for the physics major. I hadn't taken any G&G classes before. That was probably not the best idea, but it's doable. The class is really not a lot of work (6 psets and a take-home final), but some of it took me a really long time because I wasn't familiar with the material. It's not an intro class, but it's doable if you have a physics background. Professor Federov assumes that you have a background, but will review nearly everything (but really, really briefly). As a heads-up: at least two of the homework assignments involved working in Matlab. Which was interesting and useful, but caught me by surprise.",
    "Gives a broad view of climate dynamics. Interesting course and you will learn a lot. It would probably be helpful to have taken differential equations and fluid mechanics and\/or geophysical fluid dynamics prior to taking this course."
