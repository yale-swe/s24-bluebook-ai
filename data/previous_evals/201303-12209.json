    "Content wise this is not the most transformative or intellectually provocative class I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken. However, courses like this are necessary, informative, and are effective. Students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 leave this course with a solid foundation of the formative texts and methodological approaches of Anthropology as discipline.",
    "This course is central to the education of any aspiring anthropologist.",
    "Development of the Discipline exposes the nascent anthropologist to the legends of anthropology and their place in history. Celebrated monographs and illustrious figures will become familiar and become a touchstone for future reading, writing, and (hopefully) teaching. This course is a necessity, but it should not be approached as a \"requirement\" in the sense of an obligation. If the student approaches the course as a duty to their own self-development, they will be rewarded.",
    "This first-year graduate anthropology course provides students with insights into the historical contexts of early ethnographic works in the discipline. The class also gears students toward professional development."

   "comments": [
    "Considering that my background in anthropology was near to none, I feel like I have a good grasp on the fundamental concepts of ethnographic writing from the history of how people wrote.",
    "This course offered a solid foundation of the formative texts and practices of Anthropology as a profession. Students have a better understanding of the historical trajectory of the discipline and the paper presentation, the random journal suggestions, the tutorials on how to navigate endnote, these were all skills that were also helpful as professional training.",
    "While the material we covered in this course may not be directly related to my dissertation research, the practical skills in reading and appreciating ethnographic monographs will be useful generally for my career.",
    "As a consequence of this course I feel grounded in my discipline. I have an improved sense of the trajectories anthropology has traveled and the people who have influenced its journeys. When I read for other courses or my personal research interests, I am able to place these works in conversation with lineages of anthropologists, topics, and themes in my discipline. This course has renewed my appreciation for early anthropology and introduced me to scholars whose writings will no doubt feature in my qualifying exams and dissertation.",
    "This course provided a solid foundation for understanding the historical development of the discipline of anthropology as well as theoretical and methodological genealogies."
