   "comments": [
    "Learned great and neat new things about linguistics, and can view many aspects of everyday conversation from a new, more analytical perspective.",
    "In this interesting intro to linguistics class, I learned the basics of phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax, and psycholinguistics. This was a subject I'd never taken a class in before - so every skill, insight, and piece of knowledge was entirely new to me.",
    "I learned a solid introduction to Lingustics (e.g. morphology, syntax trees, semantics), while also learning about common myths and misunderstandings related to language (e.g. African American dialect, women's speech, etc.).",
    "I have been able to examine different languages with a revealing analytical lens at different levels, from sounds to sentences-- which I easily brought outside the classroom and have had plenty of fun with.",
    "This was a great introduction to linguistics concepts!",
    "This was an introductory linguistics class covering material from phonology, morphology, and syntax to social and historical linguistics.",
    "A solid intro linguistics course! It covers phonetics, syntax, semantics, and morphology. It also covers lots of linguistic theories, application, and misconceptions.",
    "This course was a proper survey to the basics of many different subfields of linguistics. At times it was a bit cursory, but that is to be expected from a survey course. It proved illuminating and was just the level that I wanted in order to dive into linguistics without committing too much.",
    "I learned about the basics of most of the main sub-fields within linguistics. I also learned a lot of really cool facts about the English language in particular that totally changed the way I look at how people speak.",
    "This was a wonderful introduction to the basics of linguistics, as well as a survey of some social and psychological applications. I came in knowing pretty much nothing (except the phonetics information I'd picked up from singing), and I now feel that I have the tools to understand phonetics, syntax, semantics, and other areas of linguistics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "All strengths - I loved the small class size (~18 I think) and teaching style. It was a great mix of the different branches of linguistics and look at how it functions in society.",
    "I believe this course was a very strong introductory course, and I'm overall immensely happy with the way it was structured, especially with half of course focusing on assignments when we studied intro linguistics, and the other half on blog posts when we transitioned into illusions. I thought I wouldn't have enough to say for the blog posts and the final essay, but there's so much to talk about! I sincerely appreciated having a final paper rather than an exam because I think it made more sense with the course structure, and also that we had two discussion section days and whatnot. This course was honestly very well facilitated by both Hadas and Josh. My only wish is that we had more time to talk about illusions and semantics, and even special topics like the one on lying -- very, very interesting. I also think some of the assignments were much harder than what we learned in class and it was hard to make the jump between them, but Josh was extremely helpful in those situations. Overall, I absolutely loved this class.",
    "The course featured many helpful examples from a large variety of languages, showing the universality as well as nuances of the principles taught. It also encouraged plenty of guided self-exploration, which were all very fruitful and kept us thoroughly engaged. The flow and structure of some of the materials were a little hard to keep track of, e.g. the sequence of concepts covered within each lecture. Some of the lectures e.g. pragmatics and the guest lecture, felt largely out of place in the course flow. There was also no direct feedback on any of the psets and the writings; this made it hard to self-assess during the semester.",
    "The only change I would suggest is more time for illusions! The last couple of weeks were very interesting.",
    "This was an extremely enjoyable class, easy but still informative. Professor Kotek and TA Josh were friendly and entertaining. The only weakness I think would be the pacing. Since the material is completely new to most of the class, we spent a lot of time asking questions and so we couldn't get through the material as quickly as planned.",
    "This course is very well-structured. It flows very nicely from topic to topic in an order that makes sense.",
    "The instructor-TA combo of Prof. Kotek and Josh was fantastic. It kept the course light and fun. The course also had a very much exploratory and flexible feel to it, which made things fun and exciting.",
    "I loved everything about this course. The lectures were extremely interesting and we got to discuss some really cool things about language. It does a very good job of covering all the most important basics of linguistics, making it an effective introductory course. It would be nice if the work were more evenly spread out over the course of the semester. The beginning was pretty light, but it felt like the course went 0-100 in terms of work after spring break. Also, more transparency in the grading of the homework would be nice.",
    "This course was a wonderful experience! Professor Kotek and Josh Phillips are excellent instructors--very approachable and fun, and they took the time to walk us through the concepts, and speed ahead when people understood it. They were great at reading the class, and engaging with student interests. I haven't been in such a fun, happy, interactive seminar since I've come to Yale! The weaknesses mainly had to do with the fact that this was the first time the course was offered--that is, they had to do with pacing (e.g. we spent a long time on phonetics). I really wish that the \"illusions\" and social\/psychological\/political implications of linguistics had been incorporated throughout the semester, rather than mainly dealt with in the last few weeks of the course. But despite these pacing issues, I always enjoyed every seminar. I'm so happy I took this course!!!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Low workload, but the material is very interesting.",
    "Yes, this is a good introductory\/survey course for linguistics. Very clear expectations. Organized and concise lectures",
    "YES, 100%! An awesome class that is an intro to linguistics yet also a small seminar and also is unique in its approach.",
    "IF THIS COURSE IS EVER OFFERED, DEFINITELY TAKE IT!",
    "A fascinating class teaching insights that you can really bring outside the classroom. It's been fun, inspiring, and exciting. It also encourages a lot of self-exploration while making sure you are adhering to sensible and logical analysis. Awesome class for linguists and non-linguists alike!",
    "An interesting class overall. Not a super useful one, but I'm glad I took it.",
    "Yes! Hadas is great and very knowledgeable.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone with any interest in linguistics. If you're not sure if you would like linguistics, shop it and then decide.",
    "One of the most interesting and rewarding classes I've taken at Yale. It amazes me how much linguistics I've learned from an intro-level class, and how many things I didn't know that I already knew. Very fun and interactive course. Definitely a must for linguistics enthusiasts or someone just mildly interested in language.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any student who is remotely interested in Linguistics but has not had any formal treatment of the subject before. The course is light, but intriguing and fun. There was never a boring day.",
    "Absolutely! It was my favorite class this semester. I've never been so consistently interested in a subject, and besides just learning about the sub-fields of linguistics, the class dives into some cool misconceptions people have about language and English, which changed my views on a lot of things!",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student. This was the perfect introduction to a field that isn't normally encountered until college. Professor Kotek and Joshua Phillips led the most fun, interactive seminar I've taken at Yale, and they were incredibly responsive to student needs and interests. I came in with no knowledge of linguistics, and am walking away with a solid understanding of phonetics, syntax, and semantics, a good grounding to pursue future studies, and some knowledge of social\/psychological\/political implications of linguistics. This was one of the most enjoyable and informative classes I've taken at Yale!"
