    "Great workshop course, excellent assignments and group feedback. Helpful to have some weeks off for research and writing.",
    "The workshop style is a fantastic model since it truly fulfills the goal a research course. It inspires a sense of comradery and cooperation and allows you to see how other students approach writing. Rather than assigning both working on the research paper and a lot of reading each week that student will likely not get to, Joanne makes the research and research paper the clear focus of the course. What an amazing chance to receive feedback on your writing from so many other students as well as a professor."
