   "comments": [
    "It's an amazing class, taught very well, really fascinating to learn, and by the end of the semester you'll already feel like you can express yourself fairly well in Hebrew (Yes, in a basic way. It is L1, but by the end of the semester you are expected to speak almost exclusively in Hebrew and write 150-word journal entries). I never thought at the beginning of the semester that I would know this much already after just a few months. And Ayala is one of the best teachers I've had. She is flexible and understanding, cares a lot about all her students, and clearly understands the language and its history extremely well. Her lessons about grammar and vocab always include the reasons that a certain concept or word developed the way it did throughout history, and it really helps you understand and remember everything. I cannot say enough good things about Ayala--she's just fantastic no matter which way you look at it. I'm definitely taking more classes with her in the future.",
    "Great class. If you want to learn Hebrew take it from Ayala. You won't regret it.",
    "Hebrew is, for the most part, really fun. Take it with Ayala! She is a sweetheart and really connects the language to its etymological and biblical history. Be prepared for a lot of work though (as 1.5 credits merit), maybe 2 - 3 hours a night. Most of it is useful, some of it is busy work. The class moves quickly, though, and you will learn a lot.",
    "Take the class!",
    "This class gave very good basis for learning the hebrew language. If you put in the effort you not only will get an A very easily, but you will gain a very broad knowledge of the hebrew language and you will be able to speak hebrew quite well.",
    "I strongly recommend this course to anyone wishing to get an introduction into modern Hebrew whether trying to add one more language into your lingo-bag, fulfill the language requirement or specifically targeting Hebrew for whatever reason. It's a thrill.",
    "Hebrew is a pretty chill language class. There's a good mix of culture in with the language instruction, and the instructors are all great (if you're trying to decide between Ayala and Dina, keep in mind that Dina keeps closer to the book and Ayala does more random fun stuff). If you're good with languages you probably won't find it very difficult, different alphabet notwithstanding."
