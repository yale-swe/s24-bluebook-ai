    "I would summarize this class as a course for seriously analyzing one's own approach to teaching; I would recommend it to anyone considering teaching at all, as it provides an expanded perception of what teaching aims at as well as materials to reach those goals.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Physics 530 for any students who are interested in teaching after and\/or during graduate school. This class gives you a great toolkit from which to become a more confident and more effective teacher.",
    "I strongly recommend this course.",
    "It's a good class to introduce someone to scientific teaching and also opens the doors to network with a community of scholars in education.",
    "It is a great course if you are interested in pursuing a teaching career in the hard sciences. It provides a good foundation that will help one understand the current environment of the field. I imagine the education would make applying to teaching positions, particularly writing a teaching statement, more effective."

    "It provided an interesting perspective of how to improve teaching. While the course is not related to my researchat all, it has motivated me to explore teaching more seriously as an alternate career option."
