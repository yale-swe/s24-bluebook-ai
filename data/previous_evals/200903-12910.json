   "comments": [
    "It's an intro calc class...it moves pretty quickly through computations that aren't very hard, and most of the class has already taken an equivalent in high school. The curve is unforgiving, and the theory gets difficult all of a sudden towards the end of the class. The final is absurdly hard.",
    "I would recommend it, if you are thinking about any field that involves mathematics. It is a good introduction to calculus, which is very useful for many things. It's also not too hard, a good medium between 112 and 120.",
    "Math 115 is a necessary evil for most, I suppose. I actually enjoyed this class, but only because I had the best TA in the math department. If you can get MICHAL TRYNIECKI then you should. Because he is actually AWESOME. Otherwise, you should probably only take this if you have to for some reason.",
    "Not a tedious course, though expect the tests to be difficult.",
    "Hard, fast-paced, hard tests. I would recommend this course if the person was fairly confident in their math abilities.",
    "A terrible version of calc BC. Most people have taken BC already for some reason. The instructors are lazy and\/or confused and not good at teaching. The tests are more like a mensa exam than a calculus exam. And the textbook is awful. I used to love math, now I am confused and filled with anger and frustration, and feel as though I am terrible at what used to be my strongest subject.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who wants to further their math knowledge and hasn't already taken the equivalent of this course.",
    "It is hard and you need to pay attention - if you enjoy math, and like to be challanged takeit. It isnt that difficult if youre taking it only to fill a requirement, but if you will never have anything to do with calculus in the future, then taking this course is pointless."
