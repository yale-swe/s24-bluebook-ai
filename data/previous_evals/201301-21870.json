    "If you've taken 110, definitely continue with 120.",
    "French 120 was a phenomenal class! We learned a lot of new French, conjugations and new tenses. The style - a continuation of French 110 - was great because of the consistency it afforded in the learning style as we acquired a huge amount of new French knowledge over both semesters. You have to work pretty hard and consistently throughout the semester to keep your French skills sharp and to keep on top of the material, but the class is very enjoyable (particularly because of the small group environment)!I highly recommend you take the class with Professor Ngame if possible! Professor Ngame was a phenomenal French professor. He has great command of his classroom, but is also very kind, humorous, and is willing to do a lot (work very hard, and go way out of his way) for his students. His command of the French language and its most difficult intricacies is stellar - Professor Ngame has the proficiency of a very sophisticated and educated native speaker. Professor Ngame expects his students to work hard, but also acknowledges and rewards hard work in his class.",
    "It's really engaging and easier than 110 because you're already familiar with the format of the class (FIA, weekly tests, etc). Ngame is sweet! He gives us extra material and summarizes things helpfully for us.",
    "Probably the toughest language at Yale, don't take it. If you do get Ngame, he's awesome",
    "I would definitely recommend French 120 to everyone. It is a lot of work, but you get into a routine and the amount of french you learn is worth it.",
    "Please never get tired of doing the workbook, because it will really enhance your understudying of French. Take it with Ngame. His jokes are entertaining and enliven your French learning experience.",
    "It is not an easy course, but it is worthwhile if you seriously want to learn how to speak French. I would not take it as an upperclassmen looking for a few extra credits. I would take it if you want to continue to study French at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone. And if you take it, take it with Monsieur Ngame!",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend French 120 to another student. This class is a step up from L1, but by now you're already used to the rhythm. You will continue with French in Action, but plunge deeper into more advanced grammar. For me, the class was awesome and that was definitely because of M. Ngame. He loves French (and it shows), genuinely cares about students, and makes class fun and entertaining. Even if you can't get him, this is a rewarding class in which you'll see concrete results if you put in the work.",
    "I would recommend Professor Ngame's class to anyone on the French track."
