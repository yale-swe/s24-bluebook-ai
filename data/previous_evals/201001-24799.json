    "Excellent course, but way too much reading to possibly do it all. Also, having the first course grade (the paper, for 50% of the grade) so late in the semester was stressful. The class would be better with a few smaller assignments as well.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is extremely interesting and I enjoyed the course.",
    "Simply wonderful. Professor Schell is one of the most prominent abolitionist voices of the nuclear era and his lectures must be heard. It's a shame that this course is blown off by so many people that take it, because it addresses one of the most important issues that humanity will ever face.",
    "I fully intended to go to this class regularly, but despite Schell's clear mastery of the material at hand, his lectures, while well crafted on paper, were invariably dry in delivery. Thus, I haven't really gone to class in months and I haven't done the readings, so I can't say much about the objective quality of the course. I went in expecting a true gut, but despite my best efforts, I got a grade on the term paper that was mediocre at best. I've heard a lot of dissatisfaction about paper grades; the class may not be as gutty these days as it was purported to be. Oops.",
    "Don't take this class.",
    "Yes; great overview of the nuclear history of the world; good class.",
    "I would recommend this course for an easy A.",
    "Long and not that informative",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. There's a very limited amount of work and it's pretty interesting\/relevant information. Very easy to follow since a lot of it is common history knowledge and then details are added from there.",
    "This class had some interesting parts and changed the way I think about nuclear weapons. The lectures were quite boring at times and I stopped attending. The books were all very interesting and easy to read, but the 2000 page course packet of blurry pdf files was impossible to read without falling asleep.I probably wouldn't recommend this course unless you were really interested in the history of nuclear development. The only main draw is that there is one paper and one final, no other work. However the papers were graded pretty harshly.",
    "i you take it for credit, you will do very little over the semester.",
    "A must-take for anyone interested in nuclear politics and weapons. The course load is not bad.",
    "not too much work, but can learn a lot.",
    "You will learn EVERYTHING that there is to know about the nuclear bomb and the repercussions around it.",
    "If I do well on the final, this is a phenomenal class. Make sure you write a good paper.",
    "Take it.",
    "Great history lesson.",
    "The content of this class is very interesting. However, Professor Schell mainly reads from his notes. If you had his notes, you wouldn't need to go to class.",
    "This class is on an interesting subject and professor Schell clearly knows the material. However the lectures can sometimes be hard to follow. Also the TA grading system for the papers (which are 50%) of your grade is terrible it is literally the luck of the draw as to who grades your paper in regards to if you get a good or bad grade.",
    "Good class, low work load, but definitely not an easy one. The material is interesting and really not that tedious.",
    "This course should be required. Schell can be a repetitive lecturer but the course and readings are great.",
    "Boring lecture, but really easy A. Only a 10-12 page paper and a final exam, both of which were easy. I finished the exam in an hour. You should definitely take this class for a grade, not Credit\/D. Readings are definitely not necessary.",
    "Dilemmas of a nuclear age is interesting, as nuclear weapons continue and will forever be a factor in our human history. We cannot unlearn the science that discovered the atomic bomb. The lectures started off very interesting, but it may be difficult to get used to this class. Is it trying to be a history class? A philosophy class? A political science class? People may get set on being receptive to only the historical aspect that they miss the value of the philosophical aspect of the course. The course is also risky in terms of grades. Half of your grade is a paper and the other half is the final. In my opinion, the finalwas very poorly written. The questions on the IDs were misleading. I ended up writing paragraphs to answer an ID intended to need a one sentence answer. The essay questions also had me wondering....so WHAT exactly are they asking again?",
    "The class gives an in-depth look at the arms race, nuclear policies and the dangers of nuclear weapons. I would recommend it to another student because the material is very interesting and it is not a big time commitment.",
    "Super-GUT. That is all.",
    "Great class. Not a stressful work load. Schell is extremely knowledgeable. It could have been more interesting if he included slides or something for his lectures so most people don't go to class. One 12-15 pg midterm paper and fairly not too hard final. You don't have to go to class... can't beat that. Perfect 5th class or C\/D",
    "Overview of the introduction and impact of nuclear weapons and power into the world. Light workload (1 paper and 1 final) and no section. Lectures are interesting and worth attending; you can definitely learn a good deal and Schell is a great mind in this field.",
    "Fairly interesting subject, but professor isn't a great lecturer. On the other hand, workload is easy (readings are redundant with lectures, skim or ignore them), and it is a paper and a final. Curve was fairly nice.",
    "Pretty big gut - only 1 paper and a final.",
    "This course is helpful in learning how the atomic bomb was discovered, developed, and led to an international agreement to decrease and protect the amount of nuclear weapons available. I would recommend this course only if you are really really really interested in learning about the atomic bomb and the connection that every government has with it.",
    "Interesting course material, although lectures can sometimes be dry. I would recommend it if you're interested in the topic.",
    "FOUR WORDS: Pay attention in class!! I really didn't give this class a chance...and I'm still kicking myself over it. Please, disable your internet, don't even bring a laptop - just do what you have to do in order to stay focused. It's worth it.",
    "Take it if you want to learn about a very interesting subject. The concept of proliferation is one that will never vanish. Because as Schell explains, once invented, humans can never un-invent an object or an idea.",
    "Do not take this class. Really, it's NOT good. If you like nuclear weapons and want to learn more about their history, read the materials on your own. The lecture is incredibly boring, to the point where going at all becomes a chore. Definitely, definitely DO NOT TAKE.",
    "OK for a 5th class.",
    "This is a nice, easy class, with interesting material. I didn't do much reading, but please do it - you'll get so much more out of the class if you do. I very strongly regret not doing the reading, for reasons other than my grade - which I'm sure was fine.",
    "It was a great class and you learn a lot if you do the readings.",
    "eh - if youve taken cold war or any other related class this should be a breeze. Paper and a final - this class screams for second semester seniors",
    "All in all, I would definitely suggest this class. The level of time commitment is truly what you make of it and you can decide how much you want to get out of the course. The lectures can be somewhat dull, but the readings are interesting. Furthermore, Prof. Schell is a very well-respected and well-known writer\/advocate in the nuclear disarmament realm, so he provides a very insightful perspective on contemporary nuclear issues.",
    "Survey history of the nuclear age (i.e 1945 to now) chronologically. Also implications of the nuclear age and a little bit of science. Would recommend if you have no knowledge really about the nuclear situation today and would like to (it's really stuff everyone should know). You literally have to do no work unless you take it upon yourself to do the readings, which are interesting if you have time but otherwise not necessary.",
    "Overview of Nuclear weapons and the moral\/strategic dilemma. good class and it complements cold war well",
    "Lectures for this class can get pretty boring at time. Schell goes through a lot of material and its hard to tell what is important. I would not recommend the course for someone looking for a deep investigation of the nuclear dilemma. I would recommend it as a gut course though.",
    "I would recommend Dilemmas of the Nuclear Age. The lectures themselves are very interesting, and if you go to all the lectures and take good notes, then the readings are not entirely necessary. The only thing I didn't like about the class was how many students treated it as a blow-off class, which created an unappealing atmosphere. And Schell is obviously an amazing professor.",
    "This course is an overview of primarily Cold War events with emphasis on the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons at each stage of the Cold War. I would recommend the class because of the abstract way it makes you think about the use, or the possible use, of the nuclear bomb.",
    "I would recommend.Interesting material that is very relevant to the world we are living in.Not much workload.",
    "Overview of history of nuclear weapons from their inception until now. Very interesting material. Ridiculous amounts of reading, which are largely unnecessary. One paper and a final, which was fairly straightforward.",
    "Nuke Dilemmas is a great class to supplement a busy schedule of other courses. Its interesting, the lectures aren't bad, and the paper\/final are \"easy\" if you at least come to class. Take this!",
    "It's a gut in that you dont really have to do any reading at all, but definitely go to class, or at least get some notes because you'll definitely need them for the final.",
    "I'm not quite sure what to say about this class. On the one hand lecture was boring, and the subject matter was all over the map, so you don't feel like you have command of any of the themes or a coherent picture of what you're supposed to have gotten out of the class. Also there is WAY more reading than you could ever physically do, and the final is hard to study for (and surprisingly difficult). On the other hand, Prof Schell is a cool guy, some of the material is really good if you're into Cold War, there are no sections, and the paper is really easy. My overall assessment is that it's probably a class best taken Credit\/D.",
    "It's an interesting history class. Readings are not needed, and classes become really redundant after the second half. Professor Schell is a great person to talk to and I recommend meeting him one-on-one. Final was easy, just know what to study for",
    "This course is very interesting and provides both a historical and present day perspective on the nuclear dilemma. Professor Schell is sometimes confusing during lecture, but overall he is an interesting man. Sometimes the class is a bit boring, but taking notes is key for the exam. You don't really need to do the reading to do well, just have a good set of notes. You really learn a lot about the US's role in the world's nuclear dilemma.",
    "If you are interested in the material and spend the time on it, you will get more out of this class, but this is by no means necessary. Just go to lecture and take notes, the reading load is way too high and absolutely none of it is necessary. 50% 15 page paper, 50% final, neither of which is difficult. This is possibly the biggest gut class at Yale.",
    "Easy, but be careful because it might not be a gut next year. The paper was my favorite project of any throughout the semester because it allowed me to focus on what I wanted. That being said, you can find a more engaging class with a low workload because nobody does the readings for this class (a real waste).",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is willing to be self-disciplined to go to class and take good notes. It is interesting in that it is a history class that applies to our lives now.",
    "It's sometimes very similar to the Cold War, so if you've taken that, I'm not sure it's necessary. However, it is different in that it is entirely focused on the nuclear dilemma and nuclear issues. The readings are similar to lectures, but there are a lot of readings. The grading scheme of 50% essay, 50% final exam is also kind of scary.",
    "if you care about the future of international politics warfare or anything like that take this verey eye opening",
    "I would take it, as much as it would benefit from having Gaddis do a guest lecture or two, I actually learned a bunch.",
    "Yes, I will.",
    "Strong recommendation",
    "Take this class. Super interesting\/ not too much work.",
    "Dilemmas of the Nuclear Age is an awesome class. It's taught by Jonathan Schell so that in itself is cool. And there's only one paper (50% of your grade) and one final exam (the other 50%) with no section so if you're the kind of student that doesn't mind\/likes classes of this nature, take it. You find out very early on that it's impossible to do all the reading so strategically do the readings. Lecture isn't too engaging but make sure to go to the lectures toward the end of the semester because he goes over current events--which appeared several times on the final.",
    "It's a good course to take to balance out a tough workload. It's interesting, not a lot of work, and a fairly important topic to know something about.",
    "Take it credit\/d. It is the perfect class to take credit\/d",
    "It's an interesting class with a light workload (only a 12-15 page midterm paper and a final), but the lectures can get slightly redundant after a while. If you're interested in the subject, I highly recommend it, but it won't be a fun class if you aren't.",
    "Good if you're independently motivated or interested in the subject. I would recommend it, because it's a pertinent current issue. But I think I would have preferred a seminar format. I took it to help with a senior essay.",
    "you can get away without doing any work",
    "I would not recommend this course. It's honestly a letdown from the description; the lectures are incredibly repetitive and boring. The lectures basically provide a very brief overview of the Cold War and then focus on some abstract moral issues (or really just one moral issue that he keeps lecturing about). It's a pretty easy class, but I don't know if the easy grading is worth the semester of boredom.",
    "If you're interested in this topic, I would recommend the course. Professor Schell is an expert in his field, and therefore is a very interesting lecturer. Since this class has some overlap with \"The Cold War\" (John Gaddis's class), it's a good class to take if you've taken that or are planning on taking it, since you'll already be familiar with some of the material. This class really goes in depth into the dilemmas caused by the creation of the nuclear bomb. It doesn't have a ton of work, just the 12-15 page paper and the final, which was pretty fair in terms of the material we were required to know for it. There's a ton of reading, but you don't have to do all of it, just focus on the readings that you feel are important.",
    "It's interesting, somewhat. It's easy. You don't get a lot out of the class though. I probably wouldn't take it if I had the choice looking back.",
    "It is a great class and would definitely recommend it to everyone! It provides a tremendous analysis of the nuclear question facing statesmen and the worries the U.S. and the world face in the 21st century. After the Cold War ended, many felt that the U.S. and Russia would greatly reduce their nuclear stockpiles, but Schell illustrates how history has suggested otherwise and how nuclear weapons have in a way hijacked international relations and the obsessions of dominant and aspiring powers. To use Lord of the Rings lingo, nuclear weapons are the \"precious\" of statesmen, although the course demonstrates how futile they have actually been as diplomatic instruments.",
    "I'm really not sure why this course is rated so highly. It's ridiculously easy, but it's by no means a good course. The lectures are extremely dull and largely philosophical, rather than filled with any actual information. The main point of the class seemed to be that nuclear weapons are bad, and now that we've invented them, we're doomed to be destroyed by them.There is an enormous amount of reading assigned. I would highly suggest that you don't invest in the books, or really any of the course materials. There's an absurd amount of books, and none of them are necessary reading.The whole class is just a paper and a final. If you take it credit\/d, it's probably the course with the least amount of work you could take credit\/d. Most people don't even attend lectures after the first two weeks.I would not recommend this course unless you have a credit\/d and you don't actually want to have to attend or do any work for this class.",
    "Although people at times say it's boring, I thought it was an incredibly enjoyable class. Professor Schell is adorable! He is also THE expert on nuclear issues... just google his name. Not a very hard class either. Yes, take it!",
    "This class has a very nice, light workload, and fairly interesting subject matter. Unfortunately, Schell's lectures can get pretty boring, as he's not animated at all. It's a trade-off.",
    "take it",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. Not much work and interesting material.",
    "yes, good class",
    "Yes. You don't have to do the readings, but your experience in the class will be better if you do. But all in all, you will learn a good amount on the nuclear dilemma if you take this class.",
    "It's an interesting lecture course on a topic most people don't know about. I would absolutely recommend it to another student. Definitely meet with Schell outside of class, he's great.",
    "INTS 345 is an interesting and informative course. Professor Schell is well-informed and an expert on the nuclear issue. For these reasons I would recommend this course.",
    "Don't take this class. Really -- while it is a gut, the fact that the first assignment is only due in april and is 50% of your grade is weirdly stressful... it's a shame that there's no accountability in this class because I think it would be better for it. If you do decide to take the class, do the reading. Unfortunately, Schell is a bit dry in lecture and I had trouble paying attention... The material is fascinating though.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student because it provides an outlook on a problem that still exists today.",
    "I would summarize History 133 as an eye-opening class that really changes your perspective on the world. You learn so much about the nuclear dilemma, ranging from the dropping of the atomic bomb to Obama's current policies. Professor Schell offers a very balanced view on nuclear policy and what must be done to solve this dilemma. Though he strongly believes in abolishment, he exposes all sides of this very complex story. The course is not much work and the readings are not necessary, though I would highly recommend reading these great books and articles. However, this course should not be taken for its low workload but for the profound insight that is offered throughout. Overall, an awesome course!",
    "First, a warning: this material is depressing. That said, it was presented in an engaging manner and is essential for anyone pursuing or thinking of a career in politics or public policy.",
    "I would recommend Nuclear Dilemmas as an interesting 5th course to be taken credit\/d\/fail if you are afraid of having a schedule that is too busy but need to take 5 courses. It definitely was an interesting course--but if you take it you should really make an effort to come to class and pay attention during it as well as stay relatively on top of the reading. I might also suggest as a substitute taking Cold War because they seem to be similar classes if taking Nuclear Dilemmas does not work out. Taking it for credit is hard because both assignments are 50% of your grade so there is no room for error.",
    "This class has very minimal work. There is a fair amount of reading but you only need to read some of it to understand what is going on. The course only has one paper and a final so there is not too much work during the year.",
    "I\u0092d recommend Dilemmas to a student looking for an easy class, not an intriguing or thought-provoking one. The work load is ridiculously light\u0097the 10-15 page paper and a final\u0097and both are easy (a note of caution on the paper, though \u0096 one TA graded irrationally hard, but overall the graders gave A grades away like candy). It is definitely a class you can get a good mark in without attending, and thus makes for a excellent fifth course, easy distributional credits (if you aren\u0092t humanities inclined), or good GPA boost. With that said, if you are looking for an interesting class on the nuclear era, you won\u0092t find it. Schell\u0092s lecturing ability is overrated, and he is stuck obdurately in his belief regarding the horrors of nuclear weapons. While there is some semblance of nuanced thought in the contents of the lectures, the terminology and tone used to convey them try to establish Schell\u0092s perspective as fact. Unfortunately, there is no section (a positive in the easy class category, but certainly a negative for a rewarding academic experience), which means we can\u0092t discuss or hash out more critically what we think of the lectures. Schell deserves credit for admitting his biases at the beginning of the course, but nonetheless, Dilemmas is essentially a survey history course taught subjectively. If you don\u0092t agree with every facet of Schell\u0092s incessant hatred for atomic weaponry, you\u0092ll find yourself hating the class and skipping it to sleep or finish work for other subjects. Some of the material is interesting by virtue of being nuclear, but it isn\u0092t very deep nor extensive. In essence, take Dilemmas of the Nuclear Age if you want an easy class, but don\u0092t expect it to be an illuminating portrayal of humanity\u0092s history with nuclear weapons.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student at Yale. What you learn from this class--all of the dilemmas surrounding nuclear issues--you will definitely take with you. The lectures and the readings are interesting. I found it impossible to do all of the readings, there were definitely too many to complete for each lecture without feeling burned out on the material, but it is possible to pick and choose what you read and still do well.The assessments this year consisted of a midterm paper and a final exam, so if you are someone who feels they are familiar with the issues of this class, then this would be a good 5th class. If you are a novice, you will find it really interesting.",
    "Take it!!"
