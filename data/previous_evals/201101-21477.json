   "comments": [
    "Only if you're extremely interested in the topic. You'll probably get a lot more out of it if you like economics and are already familiar with the topic of property rights. Also, the class attracts a lot of pre-law people who love hearing themselves talk, so be prepared for that.",
    "Really good class, and an excellent writing credit that let's you be flexible. Be prepared to read.",
    "This class is an overview of an array of property rights - from intellectual property to slavery - over the course of American history. It is not an overview of American history through the lens of property rights, but truly a study of different types of property rights and their evolution. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the law or in history.",
    "A review of property rights covering a wide array of issues like slavery, air rights, and intellectual property. Some focus on economics as well.",
    "Property Rights in US History is perhaps my favorite course taken at Yale. While I was initially a little skeptical of the syllabus for tackling a variety of divergent and seemingly-unconnected topics, Professor Lamoreaux synthesized them into a strong narrative that addressed both the economic and the legal history. She has the right balance between running the class discussion and allowing it to feed on the energy in the room, and when she spoke, it was always to offer insight and redirect the discussion productively. I would recommend both the class and the Professor very highly.",
    "Yes. A dry topic made interesting. That said, readings were quite extensive.",
    "The name of the course suggests that the class is very specific (it did to me) but it actually teaches you a framework of analysis that is applicable to so many things from slavery to intellectual property.Professor Namoreaux is also very approachable and she is very helpful.Overall, it's a hidden gem you should definitely take!",
    "I would only take this course if you wanted to go into law.",
    "It might seem difficult to take a broad topic like \"Property Rights in U.S. History\" and make it coherent, but Professor Lamoreaux was able to do so. The class taught an economically savvy, historically grounded approach to problems in U.S. property rights and brought out very interesting themes. Professor Lamoreaux is also unusually good at leading discussions. She knows how to ask interesting questions, when to challenge students, and when to step back and let them challenge each other. She was also quite supportive and helpful in paper-writing, making this a good first history seminar.",
    "A fantastic class for a student interested in economic history, but also for students interested in legal history\u00a0\u0097 we spent a lot of time looking at and analyzing court cases and decisions. The workload was not burdensome, as I enjoyed the reading and writing the paper was a term-long assignment (though I would not recommend saving it for the end of the class). It was especially helpful that the other assignments in the course were intended as preparation for the final paper. Fantastic teacher, wonderful seminar discussion = a superb class!",
    "This course was a pretty good and wide-ranging introduction to the study of property rights. The focus was definitely on the \"property rights\" part rather than the \"U.S. history\" part since the topics are illustrated with comparative examples and lessons from other countries whenever it's convenient. Taking this course is a great way to kick-start your thinking about property rights; whatever your political point of view, you should probably spend some time thinking about why some property rights are assigned and not others, which ones are essential to prosperity, and how property disputes get resolved. The workload was pretty standard for a seminar; class discussion was a little lackluster at first but picked up as the semester went along."
