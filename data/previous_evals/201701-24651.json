   "comments": [
    "My first experience participating in systematic software design. Programming wise I didn't learn too much, but I learned so much in image and model processing algorithms.",
    "I learned a great deal about the process required to develop and market medical software and was actually able to begin this process and create a product with real world application.",
    "This course covered a lot of the documentation required to begin creating software for medical application. Beyond the coding, we got practice in writing collaborative documents that described the requirements for the software, which paved the way for the programming.",
    "How to develop medial software.",
    "This class was an incredible learning tool for the development of medical software\/devices. Going in, I thought that the hardest part about making medical devices\/software was actually making it, but this class taught us that the regulations and the record keeping and the grant proposals are integral to this process. Before this class I had not been exposed to this process and having learned about it has been very beneficial, particularly for someone interested in going into the medical device field.",
    "It was a cool opportunity to work on an actual programming project over the semester, and I learned about the different steps in the medical software development life cycle.",
    "Learned primarily about the process and logistics of designing and approving a software for medical use.",
    "This course gives an overview of the medical software regulatory environment and gives students some practice writing documents to conform to these kinds of regulations. I gained some knowledge about radiology and clinical imaging technology. Finally, I broadened my understanding of the thought processes of clinicians with regards to new technology and learned about various problems that doctors encounter."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Could benefit by starting work on the actual project earlier in the semester in order to have more time to produce a finished product by the end of the term.",
    "Strengths: an unique experience in software development. Weakness: timeline of the course can be better allocated.",
    "Perhaps it would be beneficial to begin working on the project earlier in the semester.",
    "The course was a good mix of documentation\/FDA regulatory process, as well as the business side of bringing a software product to market (as covered by Professor Khalid).",
    "The material taught in this class is incredibly useful and necessary for students interested in medical devices. This year being the fist time the class was taught, I think the projects and major learning started a bit late as the kinks were being worked out, but I think that with future iterations this class could be even more successful than it already was this year.",
    "The only weakness is students had to work on programming the projects independently which led to some issues if groups were imbalanced in terms of their coding knowledge.",
    "Professor Papademetris and Khalid were very helpful and receptive to students in the course. However, although learning about the process of getting a medical product approved was useful, I would have preferred more information on creating the project itself.",
    "The strengths of the course include the instructors and mentors who are extraordinarily willing to provide all the resources of Yale to students in the course and provide an invaluable opportunity for cooperation between CS students, BENG students and the Yale medical school which should be fruitful for many projects in the future. As a CS major, I think this course should be restructured to start actual work on the project sooner, and deemphasize regulation which could be discussed more briefly. If there is more time for software development and mentor communication teams will be able to produce a more complete prototype. More emphasis should be placed on executing the software versus completing a checklist of regulatory documents. If the class is focused on creating software in the prototype phase I'm not convinced that it makes sense to apply the process of creating specification documents as I believe a more lightweight structure could have served a similar purpose while increasing the amount of time students could devote to software. Some level of spec documents is a helpful skill to have as many students will be involved in writing or comprehending these documents if they go on into the workforce in software, but in a prototype-phase project they are a bit cumbersome. Also, more medical related software content could be added. More in-depth lectures about imaging, patient data formats, EMR interoperability (HL7 CCD, etc.), etc... would be helpful. There are many medical specific software topics that are difficult to get a grasp of without experience in the industry.",
    "I'm a BME major. I have never taken a CS course here and have only really messed around with Matlab through the requirements of the major. I think this class allowed me to dabble in Javascript, CSS, and html, but it was also self-taught. This class focused too much on the paperwork and not enough about the design. BME majors want this class to prioritize the learning of different algorithms and programming languages used in software design, not all of the FDA regulation that goes with it. Understanding how the system works is good, but thats not what employers are going to look for when I describe my software design class."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you like project-based classes! Papademetris is very engaged and invested in helping his students succeed.",
    "This class is awesome. Prof Xenios is brilliant, he can teach you so much. If you ever have the chance to take this class, please do!",
    "Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in medical software or medical devices. It's a project based class that offers a walkthrough of the process required to develop and market medical software and allows you to pair up with a physician from the medical school to actually begin this process. Workload is totally manageable and you wind up with a cool product at the end. No programming experience required!!",
    "BENG 406 is a great introduction to the process of creating medical software, and more generally, teaches the principles behind creating software that is effective and that carries out its intended purpose. There was a heavy emphasis on the documents that form the foundation for the software in the regulatory sphere (including \"system requirements,\" \"software requirements,\" and \"validation plans\"). The course was team-based, with around 3-4 per group working on a project, and was thus highly collaborative in nature. This was great practice and teaches the tenets of effective teamwork in writing and programming.",
    "Yes. I learned a lot.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in medical devices\/software. I learned an incredible amount about the inner working of development and everything that happens behind the scenes to satisfy regulations and get funding. Very good course overall.",
    "Cool opportunity to work on an actual practical programming project that's meaningful!",
    "Absolutely! Although it was certainly a challenge to create a project in the limited time that we had, and certain lectures didn't seem altogether interesting, as a class being conducted for the first time, it has a lot of potential to grow and develop into a really fascinating course with fascinating medical challenges to tackle.",
    "This is a great course if you want to learn more about problems clinicians encounter and have the opportunity to jump start a project with a physician at the medical school. Simply getting access to these resources and people is a great reason to take the course. As far as learning about software skills in the medical sector, the content is minimal so expect to come into the class with the skills necessary to build a prototype of your project. The regulatory stuff covered in the class is likely helpful knowledge but gets a bit dry and detracts from time spent on the project. However, all groups in our class created a meaningful prototype by the end of the semester. This class would be perfect for juniors who have the requisite skills and will have time to continue the project before graduating their senior year if they so desire.",
    "Its cool to be able to have a biomedical project to work on and talk about to interviewers and friends, but skill wise, Im not sure if this class helped much. I guess it introduced me to practical programming knowledge that are commonly used, but Im wondering if it would have been better to take a CS course before this to be able to do more of the programming work. Since Im BME, a lot of the interesting difficult stuff was handed off to the CS majors."
