   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you are genuinely interested in the idea of empire\/imperial history and want a history seminar with a relatively light workload.",
    "I would recommend it to all interested in European history, or any history for that matter.",
    "A great history seminar if you're interested in the time period. You read some theoretical stuff at the beginning (postcolonial\/marxist theory about empires) and then read the works of some really cool historians. You don't have to be an expert in Empires to enjoy the class, but I imagine it would be difficult without at least a solid foundation in European history. Professor Behm is fantastic! She's super knowledgable and engaging. Definitely take advantage of her wealth of knowledge for the final paper! Our meetings really helped me find sources and form a thesis. Class discussions were great for the most part, though sometimes it felt like the weeks didn't come together as well as they could have.Workload is pretty typical of a history seminar. Weekly readings can be longish, but are interesting for the most part. There's a short paper (5 pages), a report on a primary sources, and a final paper (18-20 pages). Overall, I highly recommend the class!",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. Basic junior history seminar. Not an overwhelming amount of reading for a seminar, and most of the material is interesting.",
    "A great introduction to imperial theory with a great professor Take it for sure.",
    "As the title indicates, this seminar focuses on the rise and fall of European empires. I enjoyed this class, but it may have been better to take a class on political theory to understand the concepts associated with these empires before taking this seminar.",
    "This is a great overview of Empire, both theoretical and historical (though there's a little more emphasis on the former, since it is an intellectual history course). The syllabus is incredibly well put together: the readings are phenomenal. Professor Behm is incredibly smart and an expert in this field. While she, like many of the younger professors, is still figuring out how to best moderate discussions--our discussions could sometimes circle around issues a little too much--she's great overall, particularly if you meet her in office hours, which she's always willing to do."
