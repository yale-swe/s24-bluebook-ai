    "Overall a very easy class. Most (my estimate 80%+) of the students don't even attend the class after they realize that they won't learn anything from lecture. It's 3 problem sets, each of which can probably be done in 6 hours or less. No exams, no finals.",
    "Don't need to go to lecture, homework assignments are fairly easy and not time consuming.",
    "If you want a break from the workload of the CS major, go ahead and take it. The class has three problem sets, and no midterm or final, and pretty much no one attends lecture. The problem sets are pretty cool though, although they can definitely be a time consuming, and can be a little stressful. The course is definitely lower stress than the core courses in the major, just don't expect to get a whole lot of out it.",
    "Not the best CS elective if you are looking to learn or get something out of a class.",
    "Yes, it is a very easy way to get a CS credit! Material is not the most interesting, and just be careful on the psets because they determine your grade!",
    "Easiest class in the CS major. Three problem sets, no exams. Oh, and you don't have to go to class.",
    "Do not take this course if you have any respect for your education. CS needs easier classes, but this is beyond a gut."
