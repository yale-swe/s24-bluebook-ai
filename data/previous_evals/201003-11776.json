   "comments": [
    "Basically a big waste of time. You learn very little. But chances are you're taking it because you need to for your language requirements - so it doesn't really matter.",
    "It is a good intermediate level spanish class that introduced more topics than the previous L3 course. I would recommend it because it covered various interesting topics.",
    "No, only if you have to take it",
    "Yes i wish i could have started in L1 and go all the way through L4 but now its over",
    "only take it if you need to fulfill the language requirement, its more challenging than L4",
    "This class is a good way to learn some of the more complex grammar rules in Spanish and practice speaking about literature and current topics after adequate high school preparation. I would recommend this class to another student because the work load is usually not too difficult, but the daily exposure to the language is beneficial.",
    "For a language class I feel that this course was conducted well, but I find the way language courses are taught to be unhelpful and frustrating for my style of learning.",
    "If it is a required course, you just have to take it. Mostly, it is, and it's not bad at all!",
    "This class is more difficult than L3 but revisits many of the same grammar concepts. I would only recommend this class to those who need the language requirement or plan on majoring in the language",
    "Sebastian's Spanish classes are fantastic. Having had him as a Spanish teacher for two years, I can say that he is probably one of the best professors to learn Spanish from here at Yale. He is very understanding and will usually cut you some slack if you're having some trouble elsewhere in your life with homework or other assignments. He's a very agreeable person, always comes to class with enthusiasm and makes an effort to get to know each of the students. As for the class itself, while the workload is understandably a little heavier, the material covered is well structured, the readings and videos are all entertaining and none of them felt like a waste of time personally. Overall, if you're interested in Spanish, Sebastian's the guy to go to!"
