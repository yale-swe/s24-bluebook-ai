    "Tough class for anyone who is just beginning Spanish. Make sure to pick a professor with good reviews. The teacher makes or breaks the class.",
    "This is a pretty good course. There is homework almost every day and class is usually fairly interesting. The difficulty depends a lot on the instructor.",
    "If you need to learn spanish, studying it at Yale is great way to do it.",
    "Juliana is a good professor. Perhaps over-enthusiastic at times, she cares about her students and is always full of energy. She's a good teacher, and you can tell that she puts in a lot of preparation. Otherwise, it's Spanish II. Not hard but not terribly easy. Pick a good time. You have to go everyday.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class as a good second semester beginning Spanish.",
    "If you want to learn Spanish, this is an excellent way to do it. I would summarize this section as pretty intense, not in terms of work, just in terms of classroom environment. But overall I had a good experience with the course and learned a lot.",
    "Yeah, Great course! Get Juliana R-R as your professor; she's really funny and wonderfully interactive!"
