    "A wonderful course, and a wonderful section to be in. Prof. Kastan's style isn't for everyone, and he makes you accept his terms because he's brilliant and he knows it. Just make sure you read carefully on your own, because there were classes in which we hardly opened the books. Section was not for the faint of wit.",
    "If you're brave enough and decide to do the second semester of DS, you'll not regret it. Of course you're never going to finish either DonQuixote or War and Peace, but it's alright, it would still be an extremely meaningful experience. Kastan's great. His sense of humor and energy made this class really exceptional. I deeply enjoyed the sections where we discussed not the specific passages of a book, but the place of the book in the history of literature. I think Kastan asked some appropriate questions about literature, its purpose, and its role that would be completely overlooked in other sections. He was also extremely helpful with writing: this is the only course in DS where I actually thought I was taught in the right way how to write. Rejoice if you're lucky enough and get Kastan next year.",
    "Good books, but very difficult to cover in the allotted time. Kastan focused on either a few pages of the text or not on the text at all, so I didn't feel like I really understood the most important aspects of the works we read.",
    "As to question of DS or no DS: it's true that there're many ex-DSers who have mixed about the program. But I can't imagine a more amazing way to have spent my freshman year: you'll experience wonderful professors and students and an amazing sense of intellectual camaraderie. As you make a decision about DS, do your best to ignore whatever prestige the program has and be wary of the commitment and workload you're making. That said, I imagine DS will be a highlight or perhaps the highlight of my undergraduate experience. It's really special.On Kastan (though I don't think he's teaching the course again): I have very mixed feelings about this section. I'm on the one hand immensely grateful to have been able to spend time around such an important and talented professor. Prof. Kastan has read everything (except maybe Faust...) and knows it all in remarkable detail. It's a privilege to listen to your professor speak about Milton in class while simultaneously reading the same observations in his footnotes.That said, Prof. Kastan is not a good teacher. Part of the issue is that he thinks DS is a very problematic program because it moves so quickly (true!). By the end of the year, he'd decided that the real value of DS lay in teaching us \"how to read.\" Prof. Kastan took this to mean never talking about our readings but instead asking questions about literature as such: what is literature? what is the point? even one day on Proust, how will the Kindle affect literature? While I guess these discussions were fun, they were probably better as dinner-time discussion than a substitute for talking about the text - I image that actually DOING close-readings does more to teach one \"how to read\" than anything else.Beyond DS, I'd add that Prof. Kastan did very little in the way of preparation for class. He seemed most concerned with making class engaging for himself i.e. the classes he called \"terrific\" and \"brilliant\" were those in which he talked his way into conclusions he found interesting. Our growth did not appear to be his first priority.",
    "DS is great, especially second semester. READ AT LEAST HALF OF DON QUIXOTE AND WAR AND PEACE OVER BREAK. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. HALF.Kastan is crazy smart, though he's maybe a bit too aware of that. Some books were really strong, and we had great sections with Paradise Lost, KIng Lear, and The Waste Land. His covering of War and Peace and Swann in Love was not so great--I realize that War and Peace is just impossible to o in four sections, but how much less impossible than Paradise Lost? Despite the above griping, Kastan really made me think about literature as a form, and improved my writing perhaps the most out of all my DS professors. He appreciates rhetoric and demands good writing, but never at the expense of saying exactly, and I mean EXACTLY, what you mean.",
    "You will either love or hate DS Lit with Professor Kastan. If you like listening to a really smart, witty guy talk in general terms about books that he knows a lot about, this is the class for you. Especially if you respond well to sarcasm.If you are looking for a more laid-back class atmosphere where students throw out ideas and do more close-reading of the text, you won't enjoy this so much.Either way though, you will learn to love Paradise Lost!",
    "You will either love this course or hate it. If you want to focus on a particular movement, close-read the entirety of a sizable text or learn about anything not written by a D.W.M., you will be sorely disappointed. If a survey of the Western Canon is what you are looking for, then there is no better place to find it.",
    "This class is amazing! If you're looking for a more traditional class on literature in the sense of focusing on the minutia of the text presented, this may not be the best fit for you. On the other hand, if you want a class where you will talk about the bigger picture and look at smaller sections of text, putting pressure on them (as Kastan would say), to come up with deeper analyses, this class is a perfect fit. This is the second half of the Western literary canon. 'Nuff said. Kastan is a lively and talkative professor. He's a great guy who has a knack for directing conversation. That said, if no one in the class is willing to speak up, he's more than happy to continue talking. In that sense, be prepared to do so if you want to get more out of it thanjust Kastan's ideas, developed over years of reading the same works (though admittedly, that's quite a bit in and of itself).",
    "There are a lot of problems with DS Literature semester 2. Foremost among them are the facts that these books are much harder than the books you read last semester, we have less critical distance between them and us than we did last semester, and the time we have to read them is more or less the same as last semester. But take it anyway. The point of DS is to take a tour; you know this already.Kastan, specifically, started off the year exceeding my expectations. He knows his Petrarch, his Milton, his Shakespeare \"crazy well.\" But further into the year, Kastan's focus on the texts weakened and grew farsighted. We started entertaining big questions instead of working with the books. I think Kastan grew frustrated with the format of DS, maybe for some of the reasons indicated above. I think he will be better next year, accompanied by the virtues of hindsight and experience. He is smart, and I think he will adapt."
