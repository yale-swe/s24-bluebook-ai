    "I think the instructor should rework the workload for this class. I think that requiring homeworks, a midterm, presentations, a paper and a final is too much. I think the professor should eliminate the final paper and replace it with two more classes.",
    "Question 10. This course is a very important foundamentals class for students interested in climate change.Question 3. The problem sets are very helpfull to learn the material.",
    "It was a big room and Professor Lee was quiet and tended to trail off towards the end of sentences. Other then that he was a very high quality professor.",
    "I really enjoyed the class and found it informative. Xuhui and Xin were great - very enthusiastic about the subject matter, very knowledgeable, very available to students. I do not come from a science background so it was not directly relevant to my studies, but it was good background information for someone who works on energy issues and it was interesting information. The only thing was that I felt we had very many time consuming and fairly challenging assignments - 5 in-depth problem sets, a group paper and presentation, another presentation on the reading, a midterm, a final ... perhaps you would consider only doing 3 problem sets in the future, or doing the project INSTEAD of a final, rather than in addition to it? Overall, though, a very good class. I would recommend it to others.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, and think Professor Lee is terrific. Very knowledgeable and accessible.I think the portions of the course that focus more on climate science are more useful and interesting than the portions that focus on climate and life (agriculture, human health, allergens, etc.) I appreciated the effort to incorporate the papers in each week's class. The group project was useful and interesting and I actually learned something from it; I feel like group projects don't always meet those goals. I feel like the types of questions asked on the homework are very different from those on the exams, though. Doing well on the homework didn't necessarily mean one was prepared for the exam."

   "comments": [
    "The homework really helped me understand the material.",
    "The sections on meterology and understanding how air masses work.",
    "Integration of the class teachings into the problem sets. The sets forced us to think through the material every two weeks and apply it, often in analytic exercises that illustrated the importance\/applicability of the material. Was very helpful when it came time to prepare for the exams - it was all still relatively fresh.",
    "The material is very interesting and Xuhui is great and seems to care about the students and whether we are learning. I found all the topics very interesting.",
    "Professor Lee and TA Zhang are very knowledgeable and accessible. Very organized course and materials. Great introduction class in climate and meteorology. A must take for students interested in advanced studies in climate change.",
    "the home works, kept me referring to the class notes",
    "The live animation and graphics included in the powerpoint notes were very helpful with relaying the information.",
    "The lectures were very interesting, and Professor Lee is very good at explaining the concepts involved.",
    "Really gave me background knowledge for broader climate issues.",
    "Clarity of the lectures and willingness of the professor to stop for questions.",

    "The group presentation\/paper. Eliminate it.",
    "Holding it in Bowers made it too impersonal. Folks might have paid more attention in a smaller setting.",
    "I'd have liked to learn even more about atmospheric chemistry as it relates to climate change.",
    "There are too many assignments...sorry to say it, but 5 problem sets, a presentation on an article, a midterm exam, a final exam, a final presentation and paper...is a BIT excessive. Maybe we could have done away with the final exam? It just seemed a bit much at the end...with the final group paper and presentation.",
    "The final project is a good idea though probably could be improved. Maybe some intermediate milestones for the project in the middle of the course to get it going early.",
    "hearing the instructor. and towards the end of the course it seemed like we ran out of topics.",
    "Some of the readings seemed irrelevant.",
    "The course has too many assignments. Cut out one or two of the problem sets or an exam. The group paper was actually a great assignment (for once! compared with other group assignments in other courses).",
    "Better, more relevant textbook or don't have a book at all.Questions on the problem sets were sometimes on topics we had not covered in class which led to a lot of time spent researching the question on the internet. Why go to class if I can find all I need to know on the internet?Group project should be worth significantly more than the problem sets, considering the amount of time spent on them.",
    "see above",
    "Too many evaluations - I've never had another class that has problem sets, individual presentations, group presentations, midterm, final, and term report. Too much for a bin class."

    "Very very good. Very approachable.",
    "Xin made herself available to answer our questions and to help out with problem sets which was great. She held review sessions for both exams as well. She knows the material cold so it's just a matter of taking the initiative to tap into her knowledge of the material.",
    "They were great - and made themselves available!",
    "Excellent. Zhang is very accessible and very knwoledgeable about the material in the class.",
    "Lots of Help.",
    "Both the professor and the TA were readily available by email and in person to help with questions.",
    "The TA for the course was not helpful. I understand that it is important to give all PhD students opportunities to gain teaching experience, but the TA for this course was not fluent in English to the point where she could explain complicated concepts in multiple ways. If I wanted the information verbatim from the course lectures or the textbook, I'd look there. When I go to a TA for help, I expect that she'll be able to answer my question in a different way, or at least point me to an outside source that is not the textbook, to help me to better understand the material.",
    "Definitely - again, see above. I felt both were very willing to answer questions and work with students.",

    "Since I primarily study land use law and policy, this course filled in the climate science gap in my education. It was really helpful.",

    "It helps to understand the scientific aspect of the climate change and the class talked many interesting topics, too.",
    "if you're studying climate change and energy policy, you're doing yourself a favor by taking a class on climate science--there's your chance!",
    "I'm interested in climate change mitigation. In particular, I'm focusing my studies on renewable energy development and policy. This course was very relevant. I learned a lot about some of the fundamental issues associated with climate change including about the distant and recent temperature trends, anthropogenic and natural impacts on the greenhouse effect, anomalies and mechanisms associated with the temp record, why the wind blows (huge for an interest in wind energy!) and what affects it, intensity of solar radiation (also huge for PV and CSP energies) etc. I've take a ton of social science courses here so this was a really refreshing change - actually understanding some of the mechanisms for why things are the way they are and how we interact with\/affect our weather and climate. I thought it was a great class.",
    "This course fits very well because I am interested in advanced studies in climate change but I did not have any background in climate and meteorology before. I am glad I took the class. Professor Lee is also a great instructor, very organized and accessible.",
    "Good information consumption class, lots of basics.",
    "Though it was a good course, it was not the most relevant to my own interests - perhaps the bin requirements should be eased.",
    "Good background on the meteorological and climatic impacts of energy and fossil fuel use, but not a central part of the program, which is more policy-based. I took it mostly because it looked interesting.",
    "Crucial for familiarity with climate change.",

The first class was a bit slow so I was unsure what to expect - but quickly picked up and I enjoyed it.Another thing I would say is that this is not a course to be taken lightly. The title may seem a little soft but between the two exams, five problem sets, short presentation, group presentation, and paper, this class requires some time. The material is not hard to grasp but requires some effort to take care of all of the commitments. I think the setup, with all of these requirements, allowed\/forced me to understand the material in a way that I might not have with a 'lighter' load.",

We each investigated a different element of the recent global surface temps record and reasons for the anomalies.I learned a lot - and more quickly than I would have if I'd done it on my own.Disadvantages - as with any group project, until someone steps up, it can be like herding cats. A solid outline that actually achieves the mandate, and that is agreed upon by all, is key. Everyone must be on the same page throughout - rather than just taking a piece, leaving to write it up, and then coming back to stitch it together like a rag doll. Requires some coordination that can be tough with busy people.",
    "There are big advantages! Talking through and working through the material in a group is crucial - and very helpful to understanding some of the concepts better.",
    "The final project was very interesting and great learning opportunity. There were good subjects to chose from. The advantage was to learn from each student research as a group. The disadvantage was that the final project was done at the end of the semester and it was a bit rushed.",
    "short paper for a big group, I only had to write a little piece, which was good, but I wasn't as invested as I may have been if I were working on a larger piece.",
    "The paper that we had to write as a part of a group, allowed group members to bring their strengths and expertise to the table to write their part of the paper.",
    "The final project was interesting, and the group worked well together, but, once again, not too relevant to my personal academic interests.",
    "It really helped reduce the time spent on each problem set. I learned a lot from group members and highly recommend it.",
    "advantages were getting to know my classmates better; disavantage was that the group project was right in the middle of all the other end-of-semester craziness, making it difficult to coordiate with other group members on meeting times and deadlines.",
    "Always difficult to schedule, and it can be very time consuming to work through everyone's thoughts and issues. However, I learned a lot during group homework sessions as we helped teach each other the main points.",
