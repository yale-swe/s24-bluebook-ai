    "Do research! Be friends with your PI! Do not count on being able to use your research for your senior project unless you are working on an entirely independent project, which is unlikely!",
    "Working in a lab is a great experience for anyone who is majoring in Cognitive Science or Psychology. There is only so much that one can learn from reading papers and talking about research; being part of the research process allowed me to learn a great deal. I got to be involved in every part of the research process, including stimulus creation, running studies, and data analysis. The time commitment is reasonable and very worthwhile. It is also fun to work closely with incredible graduate students and professors who are so excited about their work!",
    "I learned a lot about the existing literature, methods, design, and data analysis. It was a truly invaluable experience to get weekly individual feedback and discussion, and to participate at various stages of conducting and writing up these studies."
