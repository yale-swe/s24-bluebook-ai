    "Yes. I feel like I started at such a low level in terms of how much mandarin I could piece together and make things with. I am so much more confident now. If I bound get through it and learn, so can someone else.",
    "Not much to add to previous reviews of the class. Lots of work, but manageable if you have a system in place to learn all of it. Came in not being able to speak very well, but I improved quite a lot.",
    "Chns 132 was a ton of fun, it's a small class so you get to know the other students pretty intimitately especially if you're on the science hill grind right after Chinese class. A bunch of kids from my class and I called ourselves the Bus Crew\/Chinese Running Team since we either had to: leave class early\/walk to the shuttle stop\/run to catch the shuttle that we just missed\/any combination of these.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. Liu Lao Shi and Zhang Lao Shi are some of the best teachers I've ever had. It's not as much work as one might expect, and you definitely will learn a LOT.",
    "This class was intensive, but is rewarding if you put in the work. I would recommend this class to someone who is passionate about the langauge.",
    "A good introductory course for a heritage learner. Yes, I would recommend this to another student: it is a strong language class that is very good at improving oral fluency.",
    "I would situationally recommend the class, since I don't think it's for everyone. Depending on one's balance between writing and speaking level, some parts of the course can feel very repetitive and simple while other parts can feel overwhelming. It's a good course to learn Chinese though and the teachers do a great job."
