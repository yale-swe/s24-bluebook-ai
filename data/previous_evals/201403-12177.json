    "Absolutely fascinating CS credit. It is true that lecture could get a little tedious, particularly on the days that you cover the math behind everything. But everything that I learned in this class was important, relevant\/in use today, and just really cool. If Ewa TAs this class again, use her. She is so nice and so helpful. Seriously, take this class. It is worth it, even when some of the lectures are slow.",
    "A course with fascinating material, but an unengaging lecturer. I learned a lot and it was definitely worthwhile -- if you're at all interested in the theory and practice of computer security and you can sit through some dry lectures I would absolutely recommend this class. If you're just looking for an easy CS elective and\/or you have a low boredom threshold you should probably take something else.",
    "Interesting material and not much work compared to other CS classes (not easy though). Lectures will be boring if you hate the subject, but otherwise very informative. Homeworks are easy if you have any C\/C++ experience. You dont need any math knowledge (202 is overkill). Make sure to study from the slides.",
    "Great class. I was a bit wary because of how some of the previous years evaluations were, but it turned out to be one of my favorite classes. The class has mandatory attendance (or at least attendance was taken), even though he just goes through the lectures slides (which are posted) during the class. Grading seemed fair\/lax, but it helps to have a friend in the class when you get stuck.",
    "This course is an introduction to and overview of modern cryptographic algorithms. It's not too math-heavy; it focuses more on the cryptographic properties of things, not the details of what happens in the math. The course also goes over applications of cryptography to problems besides \"I want to send a message to this recipient without others able to read it,\" and is a great way to learn how you can do strange-yet-useful things with cryptography. The course does tend theoretical; CPSC 223 is listed as a prereq, but the coding aspect is minor (it's in some homeworks, but the course itself is \"here's how crypto algorithms work,\" not \"here's how to code crypto from scratch\").",
    "The class material was usually very interesting, but the lectures tended to be a bit dry. Thankfully, the slides are posted online for later review (essential for completing the problem sets - and studying, of course). Some of the lectures were really eye-opening, particularly those near the end of the semester re: NSA surveillance, etc. (Scary!!) The problem sets were generally manageable, sometimes even fun, though the exams seemed difficult to me and several of my classmates. There's just so much to remember, although the 'skip one question,' short-answer format of the exam helped. It's definitely not possible to cram. ;) Both Ewa (the teaching fellow) and Professor Fischer were nice and as helpful as could be, quite willing to answer questions outside of class. I must admit, though, that I enjoyed Ewa's lectures more, simply due to her smoother, more engaging delivery. Ewa is funny, and Professor Fischer is more 'punny.' I would recommend having some programming experience in a language like C before taking this class, since several of the problem sets required coding (not the exams though, don't worry!). I'm guessing most of the people taking it are Comp Sci majors anyway - I am.",
    "Ugh. All the CS electives were quite bad this semester. This was supposedly the least bad. Still bad.",
    "This class has 7 assignments that require very little programming (especially compared to 223 or 323) and two exams that essentially test your ability to memorize countless slides. The material covers cryptosystem basics but does not cover topics like how to design or break a new cryptosystem and only lightly touches on network security protocols.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in cryptography. There's a good overview of different methods and some of the math behind them. Useful when trying to use your own computer security techniques.",
    "CPSC 467 is a survey of cryptography and computer security as a whole, focusing on how topics in number theory and computer science have been used to develop various cryptographies over time. I would recommend this class to anyone that is interested in the material and enjoys basic number theory and C++ programming."
