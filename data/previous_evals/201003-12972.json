   "comments": [
    "Yes I will, but only if your are turly interested in the topics or if you are going to be an EE major. Otherwise, the materiasl and math can be frustrating at tiees.",
    "If you must take it, get excited! This stuff is cool! And the teaching is (for the most part) great and the workload isn't terrible. The curve is also pretty nice. You might have to figure out some things outside of class (on your own or by bothering the prof\/TA a bunch), but shekar is an awesome teacher and seriously, the material is awesome. If you're considering EE, 202 is a more math-y intro class than 201 or 200 but the material is very cool. If you're willing to tackle some harder math, again the workload isn't too bad and skekar is cool. Enjoy!",
    "If you don't like math, you shouldn't take this class (it's more mathematically rigorous that the prereqs make it out to be), but otherwise, I totally recommend. It's full of very interesting ideas (coding and error detection, networking, and the ever important Fourier analysis) and the Professor is great! Problem sets can take a while, but help you understand the material. You get to learn to MatLab for the labs, which is a very useful skill. It doesn't go into particular depth on many subjects, but sets the stage well for later classes (I suspect) and definitely piques your interest in certain topics. Professor Tatikonda and Alp, the TA, were both super nice, helpful, and understanding.",
    "I would recommend this course strongly. It provided an extremely interesting introduction to electronic signals and systems and exposed us to a wide variety of topics related to the field.",
    "Don't take it unless you love math and fourier transforms or have to for your engineering major."
