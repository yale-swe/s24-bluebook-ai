    "If you are a first semester DS kid considering dropping, don't. The second semester is well worth the effort, and I would definitely recommend continuing.",
    "DS Literature with Hilary Fink is a fantastic class and a great opportunity to read some of the most influential and enjoyable works of modern literature under a great professor. I would definitely recommend Professor Fink, although one must bear in mind that the syllabus of the course is so broad that no instructor could be very well acquainted with all of the books.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone who loves to read."
