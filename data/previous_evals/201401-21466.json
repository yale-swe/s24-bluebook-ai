    "Absolutely recommend it to anyone remotely interested in ecology, oceanography, and\/or environmental change.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Professor Decker is amazingly good at what she does and she genuinely cares for her students. Also, biological oceanography is a super cool subject, and you get some awesome hands-on experience because you have FIELD TRIPS!!!! The workload isn't too bad at all (just a few super easy quizzes, a midterm, a review of some scientific papers\/presentation, and a final) and Professor Decker is super willing to help you out whenever you need it. This is one of the hidden gems of E&EB and of Yale.",
    "More short assignments (quizzes, reading responses, short annotated bibliography) rather than a paper- which I preferred hugely, but may not be for everyone. MBD is a fantastic teacher, perhaps not the best lecturer, but will go far out of her way to help you. This is a major plus. Be aware you will not learn about dolphins or cute otters (much)- and that is probably for the better. Nobody will believe me when I say this, but studying plankton is fantastic. The class is basically half large-scale biological phenomena that can be studied as physical oceanographic things and physical oceanography as it interacts with ecosystem ecology, and one half fisheries and marine conservation bio.",
    "Take it! Really interesting, great prof, not much work, and FIELD TRIPS!",
    "Take this class, I loved it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in oceanic processes. You don't necessarily learn very many details about the various species of fish, but you get an idea of how complex the ocean is and how our actions are affecting it. An interesting, manageable course that will further your understanding of how the planet works."
