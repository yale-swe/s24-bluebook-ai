   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course, though it's not for the student looking for an opportunity to improve on basic skills of Spanish. It's more of an opportunity to practice using the skills you've already developed; there's obviously reading (though it's far from overwhelming), and the 15 to 20-page paper at the end is certainly a major exercise in writing. Though the class roster was small, the sessions were definitely in the style of lectures, which can be a formidable drawback for discussion (and for anyone in search of speaking practice). That being said, Professor Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez is a great lecturer and a great guy who is very approachable and incredibly knowledgable with respect to his field. He made lectures fun, and drew very interesting connections between contemporary Latin American fiction and French artistic phenomena of the nineteenth century (Flaubert came up multiple times). In fact, having a background in French could make this an especially phenomenal class.",
    "LOVE LOVE LOVE. Take this class if it's every offered again. The professor is fantastic and the readings are actually really interesting. You'll want to do them all. I also learned a lot about literature and how to read a text in Spanish critically. Excellent course!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in Latin American literature. It not only incorporates works from some of the great authors but also some new ones that are not as heard of. The lectures are easy to follow and provide interesting analysis of the texts at hand.",
    "Ooh, what a great decision! This course successfully familiarized me with the major movements in modern Latin American literature while simultaneously following a very specific (and interesting) thread - the traveler and the displaced. I did notice that the reading assignments from week to week could vary wildly - one week I found myself struggling to complete more than 150 pages; another, I only had to read 15. Also, the final paper's a serious load; get started on it early - please.",
    "Yes! You won't practice your spoken spanish much but the final paper (15-20 pgs) challenges your written spanish."
