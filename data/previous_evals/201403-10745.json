   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in theory.",
    "I would recommend it for students interested in Foucault and his reception, as this was its primary focus.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course to another student.",
    "I would likely describe it as a Theory course, capital T, and recommend it more heavily for theory-heads than for the theory-allergic--though everyone in literary studies should probably read Foucault... More seriously, I would describe it as a thick engagement with Michel Foucault and his successors that also tracks the complicated network of texts and conversations that precedes Foucault's work. In that, it's a Foucault course that sets the terms for a lot of further reading in Nietzsche, Hegel, Hartman, Adorno, Butler, etc. and provides a really solid foundation in this critical tradition.",
    "It's a great class for those who have never read Foucault or want to enrich their understanding of his work, or to understand the critique of power in literary criticism.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 977 to a fellow student, especially because there is no English pro-seminar. The course steeped us in a genealogy of critique from Kant and Hegel to Foucault and Butler. Caleb's clarityand the lucidity of the structure of his syllabuswere particularly useful with these theoretical texts. I really believe that the texts on the syllabus remain relevant and invaluable to graduate study in Englisheven though Caleb sometimes flirted with presenting them as outdated or no longer relevant ... and that reading them was like taking your English PhD medicine.",
    "It's a crash course in some Foucauldian thought, with emphasis on crashing.",
    "I would summarize the \"Critique of Power\" as I did in question #1. I would recommend the course to students from any department who are interested in learning about Michel Foucault and his inheritors.",
    "An introduction to the tradition of social critique with special focus on Foucault and Judith Butler, and its effect on English departments. I would absolutely recommend this course, especially to American Studies students, since their goal tends to be critique and Foucault is often daunting to tackle on one's own."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "This course helped improve my understanding of how I might use critical theory in my dissertation. Topics such as power structures, gender, and literary theory are now more accessible to me.",
    "The course helped me to think more about an important critical tradition and its potential applications to the literary, cultural, and philosophical problems that interest me.",
    "It has really helped me to refine the theoretical lens for my thesis project. The various accounts of power have been indispensable for strategizing a way of handling the predominantly historical content of my thesis project.",
    "Reading these major theorists at the base of contemporary literary studies was and will be invaluable for my work. I think I have a vastly more confident and accurate grasp of the current disciplinary conversation--partly from the very smart twist in the syllabus toward the contemporary moment at the end of the semester. And I'm sure that I will continue to engage with many of these theorists and most of these theoretical questions in my future work.",
    "See above",
    "As mentioned, I feel strongly that the texts on the syllabus (while perhaps no longer dogma in the humanities) will prove essential to my continued study in English. Even if I don't self-identify as a Foucauldian or Freudian, I know that my work will be strongerif not more responsible and responsive to the history of my disciplinewith the foundation that this course provided. I really look forward to having Caleb as a resource as I struggle through the methodological questions presented in this seminar in my own research and writing.",
    "This helped me start to get a handle on Foucault and other theoretical context for my work.",
    "Literary Studies and the Critique of Power helped me understand Michel Foucault, Judith Butler and other thinkers. The course helped me draw on this strand of literary and cultural criticism in my own research.",
    "I believe this course contributed much to my thinking about how I'd like to tackle my stated dissertation goals. As someone interested in the history of medicine, disability and psychiatry, learning Foucault's approach and reaching a deeper understanding of the tradition he participated in will aid me in planning out my research (whatever it is!). At least this: I feel I know what I'm getting into, and the state of at least English as a discipline is clearer to me than it was before."
