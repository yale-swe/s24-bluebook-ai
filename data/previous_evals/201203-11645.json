   "comments": [
    "it's a lot of work; there was a lot of hw, and the class was definitely a level harder than L1\/L2",
    "If you really want to learn Chinese, this is the way to do it. A great continuation of L1 and L2. The workload was predictable, but about right for its 1.5 credit tag. The teachers are excellent, the classes are small, and don't be afraid to answer some awkward questions in Chinese and embarass yourself with cute impromptu skits.",
    "If you think you know Chinese and have not taken 101 or 102, this course will be way more intense than you could have initially expected. Not that this is a bad thing, but it definitely forces you to learn more of the language than you ever thought possible in such a short period of time. I would recommend it if you have a passion for learning Chinese or if this is your intended major. It is definitely very work-intensive.",
    "I would recommend the class. Yes, it's tough, but by the end of the semester you really feel like your Chinese has dramatically improved. Put in the work, and you'll feel accomplished when you get through the course.",
    "Yes, is the best chinese course ever. Is intensive, and I think an hour a day is the best way to go.",
    "This is an intense, consuming class. Meeting 5 days a week is a lot, and the work never seems to stop. There is a short quiz almost every day in class, as well as homework every single night. Be prepared to work hard. If you are serious about Chinese though, then this is a great choice.",
    "This class is extremely demanding. But it is worth it if you are serious about Chinese.",
    "Chinese 130 is appropriately designated as a intermediate course. I had only taken two years of Chinese in high school whereas some of my classmates had studied Mandarin for 5 years, but everyone was placed appropriately into L3 chinese.Chinese at Yale is quite a bit of work, but it pays off. This was one of my favorite courses this semester because I could actually sense that my knowledge of characters and ability to speak was improving. The professors are all understanding and consistent, but sometimes they had difficulty explaining complex grammatical structures in English.",
    "I say definitely take it, but maybe when you are not taking that many classes so you can make sure to dedicate time to it. It is definitely time consuming, and I felt I could have maybe gotten more out of the class if I had not been taking 4 other classes."
