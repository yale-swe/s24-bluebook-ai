    "Learn about the designs of some interesting technologies that help reduce emissions of harmful materials. Class only met once a week for about two hours max and since there was no teaching fellow for the class we did not have to turn the problem sets in and just went over them in class. Definitely not a huge workload but you do have to write a 20 page term paper on any air pollution topic out there. Midterm was duable but you do need to put in some effort to study.",
    "I would recommend this class. I thought the material was really interesting and the class is not too much work either.",
    "Air Pollution control is a class that gives an overview of the technologies for limiting air pollutants. This class met once a week for approximately two hours, so each class was limited to a chapter. Not too difficult of an engineering elective, especially if you've taken some intro engineering courses. The midterm wasn't too difficult, but the final was substantially more difficult. The professor assigns a final paper for this class, and it is pretty open-ended so its enjoyable to write for the most part. I'd recommend this course if you're looking for an interesting engineering elective.",
    "It's a pretty esoteric subject to take if it's not required. It's quite boring, but it's easy. Only take it if you're an EnvE major. If you're really curious about how we control for air pollution, just wikipedia it.",
    "A class about cyclones and electrostatic separators and other ways of getting rid of pollutants. Rather dry subject material but definitely practical. Class is very manageable.",
    "An overview of various air pollution control technologies. Problem sets, two exams, and a term paper. Insist that he tells you more about the paper early so you can get a head start. Fairly straightforward class and interesting as well. A good elective in the Chemical Engineering department.",
    "Examination: Class is entirely lecture, but the exams are almost entirely hw problems, plus some key graphs.Final paper: A lot of work. Start earlier than you think you need - especially as the paper tends to be due on the same day as the final.",
    "In my opinion, not the most interesting CENG class, but it's also not that difficult."
