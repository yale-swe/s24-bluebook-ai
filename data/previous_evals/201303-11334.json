    "Yes, it's an excellent course. Keep applying!",
    "A pretty outstanding class. It's a whole heck of a lot of work, but it's worth it if you are willing to put in the time. Fadiman is one of those professors that you need to see to believe. She takes so much time to get to know each of her students, and really works hard to make sure that they grow as writers.The class is 3 hours each week, which is unnecessarily long, but that's a small price to pay. You don't need an evaluation to tell you to take this class. If you can get in, do it.",
    "You should absolutely take this class. Be aware, however, that is a huge amount of work, because this class makes you care about your work beyond simply wanting to get a good grade. Your real investment in the work makes it much more meaningful. You will learn how to report a story, and how to write a beautiful sentence. And, you will get to be inspired by both your classmates and Anne!",
    "Absolutely take it. You will learn a great deal about writing and read a lotof spectacular work. It is a remarkable opportunity to work with Anne and the other students in this course. I do wish it had been hyped slightly less though. I came into it already knowing of Anne as an exalted hero figure, and coupled with that, a little skeptical of how fantastic the course could actually be. Also! Do not act as if you an anointed one once you take this course. I don't think anyone in my class really did this, but some who were in 469 the year before were a bit obnoxious about it. Anyway, apply for this course! Yellow pages is one of the best assignments you can possibly complete at Yale. And don't take it credit\/d unless you want to. I did, and I'm not sure how much I benefited from it.",
    "Each writer on Anne's syllabus will teach you something important about writing. Together, they will teach you that \"good writing\" comes in all shapes and sizes. If you take this class, you will become a better reporter and a better writer. You will look forward to all of Anne's reading assignments, because they are fantastic. You will look forward to critiquing your classmates' work, because it is fantastic. You will always look forward to class, and you will sometimes even look forward to writing. You will work hard, even if you take the class Credit\/D. Which, by the way, you should do.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and Anne is the best teacher I've ever had. Whether you take this class or Anne's \"Writing About Oneself\" course, you and your writing will benefit from her instruction. She is an unimaginably kind, generous, hard-working, organized, diligent, and insightful teacher. Her feedback and insights are usable and specific, and she runs some of the best class discussions at Yale: she never allows discussions to get off-track or dominated by people who haven't done the reading, and the course never feels like a mere discussion of those (unbelievably enjoyable) readings. Each class is full of takeaway messages and craft lessons. Anne'ssyllabus has been carefully designed, and the readings are some of the best of any class at Yale. They're also MANAGEABLE enough that you can complete all of them in preparation for each class. [In fact, you may find yourself reading more than what's been assigned.]The writing assignments are stimulating and the Yellow Pages assignment was one of the most fun and helpful projects I've ever taken on. And Anne's conferences with you (she has six sixty-minute conferences with you individually during the semester, during which you do a close line edit of your pieces) are literally invaluable. If you get into this class, please take it: you'll leave it with an appreciation for words, sentences, essays, reporting, and journalism. You'll also leave it with a renewed passion for writing and a renewed optimism about the state of teaching in our world and university.",
    "469 is the best class at Yale. I'll be honest I thought the hype around this class\/Anne's classes was exaggerated, but it's entirely real. TAKE THIS CLASS. It's three 1000-word essays, three critiques, one author presentation, one long-from profile, one-on-one conferences, and weekly reading. It's a lot of work, but I honestly wished we could've had more because of how useful all of it was. And Anne is an amazing professor."
