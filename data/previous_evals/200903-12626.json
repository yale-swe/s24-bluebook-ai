   "comments": [
    "A theoretical religion course that looks at some nuanced and some broad collisions of sexuality, sex, and religion. Think Foucault. The assignments involved analyzing sources used in the assigned readings, which turned out to be a very cool and not too difficult assignment. The midterm and final are a little overwhelming, but if you keep up with the reading, which is not too much you're totally fine. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This is a really wonderful class taught by one of Yale's best instructors--I recommend it 100%.",
    "I would recommend it because it's a pretty easy course but with really interesting subject matter. The assignments are easy but boring and don't actually involve much writing or thinking about sexuality and religion....that said, it's not hard to get a good grade on them.",
    "While I wouldn't say this class has more work than the average Yale class, it certainly has more work than the average 100-level lecture course, and that should be taken into consideration. That said, Prof. Loften is FABULOUS and you want to take one of her courses. She's a great lecturer and will make you want to understand the material.",
    "This is a class you will love or hate. Shop it - what you see is what you get. You will either love Prof. Lofton from the very first lecture, or you will hate her teaching style all semester long. Personally, I loved it. While she prohibits using Facebook or checking email during class, that's not a problem because she is so interesting. The class mostly covers rituals within sex and religion, and the relationship between homosexuality and religious doctrine. The three writing assignments are easy and interesting, and the reading, while sometimes tedfious,isn't particularly difficult or taxing.",
    "IT is a good introduction to wgss majors; I'm not so sure about American studies.",
    "A great class on the issues of sexuality and religion that basically culminates in the idea that there is no answer.",
    "Such an interesting class. The professor is amazing. The readings and lectures are challenging, but so worth it in the end. It requires little work and can easily be an A. I would definitely recommend it!!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. I have no idea what it would be like if Lofton weren't teaching it, but she really makes the class. She's great. The class is basically about the relationship between sexuality and religion, so you also spend time talking about what we mean by sexuality and what we mean by religion. I really enjoyed this class.",
    "Great class, even if you don't know anything about the subject.",
    "I'm undecided as to whether or not I would recomend Sexuality and Religion to another student. The class certainly wasn't what I was expecting. If you are looking for hard facts or an in-depth case study (or discussions outside of American Christianity), this is not the class for you. Professor Lofton is passionate and bombastic and quite fun to listen to. The readings are generally entertaining, though can get somewhat abstract (watch out for Foucault, he will mess with your brain). The work load is generally light, but I found the source analyses and text nominations to be little more than busy work. Shop the class if you're interested in the subject, but look over the syllabus to get a feeling of the topics and take Professor Lofton's warnings about the course seriously.",
    "MUST TAKE AT YALE!!! It's not hard and it fun!",
    "I would recommend this class if you're looking for a semi-interesting, semi-easy class to fill out a schedule.",
    "I would definitely recommend Sexuality and Religion to anyone interested in either topic. The course is especially timely, too, with such issues as gay marriage and abortion still gracing the front pages of newspapers.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, unless they were taking it credit\/d\/fail and didn't have to worry about reading the professor's mind. If you are interested, just pick up the syllabus and read the assigned texts on your own time. This course offered little guidance in interpreting the texts anyways.",
    "This class was a great introduction to the topics of sexuality and religion and how they are intertwined in our American history.",
    "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS COURSE and highly recommend it to anyone and everyone! You don't need a strong background in religion, and mostly we just talk about the role of sex in American culture and how it got that way from a religious context, which is not only extremely relevant to everyones' lives, but is also very fun and interesting. The readings are really interesting and some are quite funny. The workload is completely manageable and Professor Lofton is an amazing teacher. She's incredibly animated and always speaks her mind, which is entertaining. We also watch lots of videos on youtube and listen to music relating to sexuality, such as Beyonce and George Michael.",
    "Take it! You'll learn a lot, and you won't be bored. One of the most interesting and provocative lectures I've taken at Yale.",
    "It is an amazing intersection of ideas of sex, sexuality, gender, and religion in America, and Kathryn Lofton is the most amazing and constant scholar of the world.",
    "Great lectures and interesting readings that don't give you a neatly packaged answer to the question of sexuality in America. Keeps you thinking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. As someone with little experience in WGSS or RLST courses, it challenged me to think in new ways. And Professor Lofton is absolutely fabulous and hilarious.",
    "It's a great class--I love the way you are encouraged to think.",
    "A look at American sexuality and religion in the last few hundred years. Not the most cohesive class I've taken, but you get to read all sorts of interesting materials and it makes you think. An interesting smattering of topics. Professor Lofton is really engaging--if you can keep up--and she made every lecture interesting and relevant. I would recommend it.",
    "Religion and Sexuality was easily my favorite class of the term. The subject material was interesting and presented in a very engaging way. Professor Lofton was great at not only explaining ideas, but explaining them in a way that made me excited about learning them. She also related the complex philosophical ideas that we discussed to easily apprehendable pop culture phenomena, represented by the YouTube videos that were a common part of lecture. The reading load was very reasonable and usually interesting. The papers were helpful to my understanding of the course material and not too tough to write. The only thing to be aware of--while not necessarily a weakness of the class--is that there are a number of days in class where she would discuss just religion or just sexuality, rather than the intersection of the two. Those days were important for laying the groundwork of the discussion, but just know going in that every class isn't going to be strictly about the intersection between the two. Take it.",
    "This class is great. The professor is INCREDIBLY engaging \u0096 funny, witty, great lectures. She plays music at the beginning and end of each class. She used Oprah clips to explain Foucault. baller. Its important to remember that it examines religion and sexuality from an academic point of view, so its important to be able to academically approach the subject. Also,its not really necessary to do the reading each week because you don\u0092t have to write responses, but its really good. I recommend keeping up with the reading, because it if you get behind it makes the exams difficult because she definitely asks questions to see who has done the reading.If you are interested in the subject and want to take an engaging class, I really REALLY recommend the class.",
    "Take it if you are ready to learn about religion and American culture form a very theoretical perspective.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. There aren't too many assignments (a midterm, 2 source analyses and a text nomination) and the readings are super interesting. You really get a sense for the way that sexuality and religion are inextricably linked in the development of American history and culture. Plus, Professor Lofton is wonderful. She's incredibly smart and engaging in her lecture style. She can seem a little eccentric, but that's part of the charm. When else could you use Michael Jackson to analyze the sexuality of the monster or learn about ritual by watching videos of football stadiums? TAKE IT.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a great coursewith an engaging lecturer. Fun elective class. Not too much work. If you come to lectures and do the readings you'll do well.",
    "Religion and Sexuality was a fun class. I feel like I didn't learn a ton of facts about Religion and Sexuality, but I learned how to think about Religion and Sexuality. The class is not too much work. There are two short papers, one slightly longer paper a midterm and a final. Section made for some interesting discussions.",
    "SO interesting. TAKE IT.",
    "I highly recommend taking this class - Prof. Lofton is brilliant, her lectures are so engaging, and the readings are actually fun. I loved learning about polygamy, evangelical sex manuals, christian ex-gay movements and a variety of other interesting subjects. This is a fun, relatively easy class - take it!!",
    "Yes. This was an interesting class with engaging lectures, pretty interesting reading and a manageable courseload.",
    "Great mix of religious studies and wgss. The course is fairly easy and a lot of fun, and I would definitely recommend it. You should go to lecture - Professor Lofton takes most of her exam questions from lectures - but they're interesting and fun, so it's not a burden. Assignments were pretty short. Take it if you've never taken a wgss or rlst class and want to before you graduate.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The professor talks very fast. She is a great lecturer, but you will be madly scribbling the entire time. The assignments are weird, but easy. The class is really interesting and I feel like I learned a lot - but don't skip lecture or you won't.",
    "If you take this course, be prepared to cover some pretty abstract topics that may or may not seem to tie together in your mind. Regardless, you cover some very interesting material, presented to you by a professor who is undoubtedly one of the best in her field, with a vivacious personality who makes you excited and interested in the topic at hand from her unique perspective. The grading is fair--other than the mid-term which may seem like a lot to handle. But with the open-note final, and the other three papers you write in this course (not much at all), I feel as though it is fairly easy to achieve a desirable grade in this course. Take a close look at the syllabus, however, and notice how some topics may not seem like they make much sense in the logical flow of things.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It deals with the interesctions of religion and sexuality in America and demonstrates how the dichotomy in thinking about sex as secular and religion as anti-sexual just doesn't work.",
    "history of the intersections of religious though and sexuality in america ... uses primary documents from varying religious groups to explore this topic",
    "Yes. A great course for changing the way you approach anything academic. One of the first courses at Yale that truly made me think and question my intellectual assumptions. \"Pin yourself to the board\" Professor Lofton said--something we should all try to do.Strengths: great reading, great professor.Weaknesses: lacking in coherence over the semester.",
    "This is a great survey class that addresses issues of religion and sexuality in America from a largely American Studies, but at times Religious Studies perspective. At times, the material may seem scattered, but the lectures are always engaging. (I found myself discussing Lofton's lectures at lunch every day after class.) The readings are always interesting\u0096 religion and sexuality? obviously. The few writing assignments are interesting and are not a waste of time, like I've come to expect from introductory lectures. The evaluations and exams are entirely \u0096perhaps overly\u0096 fair.Attend the first lecture. You'll probably love Lofton. You'll probably fall in love with Lofton. If that doesn't happen, don't take this class.",
    "The class is a collection of intersections of religion and sexuality. It is not always clear what the \"point\" is saved that the things on the syllabus are part of a larger marshaling of evidence for the cultivation of an individual perspective on the interaction between religion and sexuality. The individual modules are all interesting, despite being occasionally dissatisfying for lack of time for thorough discussion. I highly recommend it. It is interesting, and discusses a lot of really salient issues both on campus and on a larger scale.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course; one's interests' needn't be restricted to the principal terms framing the course (religion, sexuality) to get a tremendous amount from the class. Professor Lofton makes the content germane, pressing, and engaging even if one is only notionally interested in these topics at the outset.",
    "I would summarize this class as an energetic discussion of the intersections of American Protestant religions and sex, and how these religions look at sex. I would definitely recommend the class.",
    "Sexuality and Religion with Professor Lofton is an amazing class. Each lecture is enjoyable and the topics discussed are very controversial. Everything from Mormons to televangelists and TV talk shows are covered and made relevant. Very few assignments, usual load of readings, exams are manageable.",
    "Religion&Sexuality seems more to be a class about modern perceptions of religion, it doesn't rally cover past perceptions so well. I wouldn't recommend this class because I felt like there were a lot of blanks throughout the class even though most of the time it was very interesting.",
    "Highly Recommended. Series of interesting readings and topics all designed at getting a little closer to understanding the sexuality of American religion, and the religion of sexuality.",
    "Yeah, take this class. It's fun and the readings are entertaining as well as the lectures.",
    "I have already recommended the course to several of my peers.I would call it a \"wild ride.\"",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone else. I loved it, it was my favorite class of the semester. It is not too much work and it is totally worth it. Lectures and readings are very interesting and fun.",
    "This is a very entertaining lecture class that is good for anyone looking to basic exposure into WGSS fields. This is a perfect class for someone looking to cut their teeth into new material and give the major a try.",
    "A FABULOUS course. I would absolutely recommend it. Such a great look at religion in America. Start with Foucault, talk about various cults, about Mormonism, about the ex-gay movement, etc. Basically you should take it for Professor Lofton's lectures, cuz she's amazing. I could never even imagine falling asleep in her lecture. She's a fast talker. Take your notes on your computer b\/c the final was online from wherever you wanted and having ctrl + f would have helped me a lot. Don't get distracted during lecture though. Take this course. Just do it.",
    "Really interesting class. Don't take it if you want to just talk about sexual positions or something or if you think it's a cakewalk. It's not. It's intellectually challenging and thought-provoking. You will be thinking about that day's lectures while you walk to your next class, eat dinner, and brush your teeth that night. Especially take it if Professor Lofton is still the instructor. She's one of the best and definitely one of the most entertaining professors I've ever had.",
    "Superb course that will enlighten, educate, and sometimes even entertain you. I highly recommend the course to anyone who has the slightest interest. It is top notch course that holds your attention through the entire semester.",
    "ABSOLUTELY 100% TAKE THIS CLASS. THIS WAS THE GREATEST CLASS I'VE TAKEN THUS FAR. i'm admittedly not someone who likes doing homework and doesn't often read much of the assigned stuff for classes I take, but with this class i actually LOVED doing the hw. like i would get frustrated when I had work in other classes because all I wanted to do was sit down and finish the readings for this class. there's a fair amount of reading, i'd say about 50-70+ pages a week, but there really isn't that many graded assignments. there are two 2-3 page papers, a 5-7 page paper, and a take home final. we learn about so many racey topics that you would never talk about in other classes (polygamy, pedifile priests, sex manuals, hermaphrodites), and prof. lofton is so chill about that it's not awkward in anyway. its so entertaining. PROFESSOR LOFTON IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Its a great class for anyone interested in sexuality or american culture and I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It isn't too much work, but I felt as though I really learned something from the course. I think it also has an interesting angle and is well taught.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to other students. I felt like i learned alot in this class and the class was fast paced but manageable. The readings were interesting and useful and lecture was always interesting and productive. Also the material covered in the class is interesting and the pop culture examples make it relevant and fun. The teacher has a clear passion for her subject and for teaching with makes the class thoroughly worthwhile"
