   "comments": [
    "I would take this class if you are interested in theatre. If you aren't planning on majoring in theatre or don't really care about its history, this may not be the class for you. Do NOT take this class because you expect it will be easy.",
    "DON'T BE FOOLED BY THINKING THIS IS A THEATRE CLASS. IT IS NOT WHAT YOU WILL EXPECT!If you're interested in history, but don't want an actual history class then take this. This is basically a history class with the same amount of reading as a DS class, but it can be procrastinated easily so if cramming is your style then it is also great. The ending of the class is rough though (studio\/educational performance, paper, and final).",
    "Theater Studies 110 is a class you're required to take to take any other classes in the Theater Department. However, in addition to being a requirement, I found the class very engaging and informative, especially for those who have never before tied their performance perspectives to theory. The class explored how certain theatrical \"motifs\", like stock characters in comedy, came to be and really gave an extensive view of theater as a whole up until the 18th century.",
    "I would summarize it as an amazing survey of the history and style of theater. It truly connects theater to our culture and role as humans and this world we live in. It made me realize how important theater is to humanity and to the definition of our society\/culture. I would recommend it to anyone interested in theater or history or literature. But, I would warn them that it's a lot of work, but if they push through it, it's very worthwhile.",
    "Yes if you want to be a theater studies major",
    "I would only take this class if you want to be a Theater Studies major, as the amount of work is unbelievable and it can be boring at times.",
    "Pretty much a history of Theatre course from Greek Tragedy to the Renaissance. Some of the stuff you learn is pretty interesting and the plays you read can be even more so, but it's pretty much a gateway course into acting and other theatre courses. The studio performance, final paper, and final exam are all meshed towards the end of the course which can be pretty stressful. Definitely plan out your exam period accordingly when bluebooking if you're considering taking this course.",
    "Take it!",
    "It is very much like a history class.",
    "Your basic survey course necessary for the major.",
    "This class will develop your analytical and creative thinking skills, and is a great introduction to the field of theater studies. The pace of the course is fast, in reading, lectures, and examinations, so make use of your TA's and professor, and try to develop a reading and study schedule early on in the semester. You will gain a strong foundation in approaching plays from a variety of time periods.",
    "If you want to learn basic info about the history of theatre, go ahead. The work is a bit tedious.",
    "I would recommend THST 110 to any student. I don't think you have to be a theater major to enjoy taking this course. All you need is to be interested in the subject. The work load is pretty high considering we have a final exam, performance, and paper. However, handling this workload during finals is completely doable as long as you take the days final exams are scheduled for each course into consideration when choosing courses at the beginning of the term.",
    "If that student is in any way interested in developing a stronger appreciation of the theater, I would recommend the course. But if the interest is puny, his appreciation of all the reading will be even smaller.",
    "This is the basic intro to theater class. Professor McGinley is a great lecturer and always interesting to listen to. You meet many of the people you'll be working with in theater and the material is geared towards many aspects of the theater and not just acting. There is one midterm, one essay, a final and a studio performance, which ends up being surprisingly time consuming since it is comprised of only the people in your section.",
    "If you understand what's good for your theatrical career\/ambitions, you'd gladly absorb all the information in this class. I would recommend this to anyone going into theater. Any and all people.",
    "Average course- informative but not interesting. Definitely not worth taking if you are not majoring in Theater Studies.",
    "The plays are generally interesting, the lecturer is okay, the teaching aides are really lovely people. The reading load isn't excessively heavy and the two tests are easy. Don't make my mistake: make sure to meet with your teaching aide as often as you can while you prepare your paper. They really are helpful. If you have to take this course as a theater major or to get into the acting classes at Yale, it isn't a terrible class. It is a decent introduction to a lot of fascinating theatrical traditions but I wouldn't recommend it except as a prerequisite or for students who are already interested in the history of theater around the world.",
    "I would only take if you are thinking of the theatre major because it is a lot of work and some of it is not interesting. It is made better by the professor and the performance aspects. Overall, I didn't' think the exams were very difficult. It does not cover modern theatre so beware of that.",
    "It is a study of theater from Ancient Greek times until the 1700s. Simultaneously, you will be reading landmark plays from each time period.It is recommended because it is an intriguing course that makes one think and analyze the connections between a society and the plays that were produced at that time.",
    "This course is pretty horrible. The lectures are boring, the plays appeal only to a few students, and there is a large disparity between the competence of the TFs. I would only recommend taking this course if you need it as a prerequisite."
