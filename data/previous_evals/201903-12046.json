    "This class was amazing. I really feel like it made be a better scientist, and forced me to improve the way I read scientific literature.",
    "I gained significant skills in reading and analyzing papers in molecular biology and knowledge about many different methods in molecular biology. I also developed critical thinking skills in developing methods to answer a question.",
    "Critical thinking, deep reading, less fear.",
    "This was an extremely useful and fun course. I became much more comfortable reading papers quickly and in high volumes, discussing them with students\/professors, and trusting my scientific instincts to interpret things and come up with hypotheses.",
    "This class helped me learn how to speak about scientific topics that I'm not necessarily familiar with. Also, I think this class will help me to be a better scientist. I've learned a lot about what it takes to design a logical experiment that can answer a specific question.",
    "Thinking of bio questions in various ways and improvement on logic and methods.",
    "Logical thinking",
    "In this course, I learned how to critically break down a scientific communication using a broad range of papers. The course provided a platform to practice reading paper, critiquing them, and understanding their implications.",
    "Learned a good deal of molecular biology\/ biochemistry and so on that I was missing from my background. Also learned a good deal about how to dissect papers and ask good questions.",
    "I learned to think critically about scientific literature in a way I have never had to before. It was really good to be able to read these seminal papers in the field and understand the logic behind the experimental design and appreciate the finesse that went into some of the greatest scientific discoveries. I learned how to analyze published data and ensure the credibility of the claims being made instead of taking them at face-value. Overall, this course was very important in my understanding of how to read papers from my field.",
    "My analysis of literature has improved, along with critical thinking of techniques. I learned how to question findings.",
    "Critically reading research papers. Really carefully, understanding it takes time to read. Also presenting on material that we just recently learned through literature. Great class.",
    "I learned how to critically analyze papers in the field of molecular biology and biophysics, construct arguments, and write follow-up experiments about the papers.",
    "I learned so much!!! I developed an ability to read papers from a wide variety of sub-fields in the biological sciences, I learned about the applicability, strengths, and weaknesses of a plethora of different experimental techniques, and I learned more about the depth of thinking required in any scientific research.",
    "I learned how to more critically and efficiently read a paper from various backgrounds in order to understand and evaluate the problem and approaches to solve the problem.",
    "I developed a large knowledge in molecular biology methods and important advancements throughout history in the field. I also learned about molecular biology as a field in general. In addition, I improved skills related to reading papers and dissecting out important information and critically evaluating why the investigators made the choices that they did and the weight of their conclusions.",
    "I learned to critically analyze published results by understanding the exact details of assays."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is so strong because it really is a student led course. After the first couple classes, we realized that we really had to take ownership over our learning. The professors that join on thursdays are then what we test both our individual preparation and teamwork against every week. This cycle really makes you think about science differently, and learn to critically assess what you read in a way you never could in a normal lecture class.",
    "The strengths of the course are the discussion sections, both with students only and with students and professors together. It was very helpful to discuss\/debate\/get help from my peers and have facilitated discussions with professors. I learned a significant amount about molecular biology techniques and what can be used for different questions and how to logically think about a problem and how to answer a research question. The project was also a great opportunity to work on our critical thinking skills orally and in writing. I had never done a chalk talk before, so it was great to get practice doing that. The only issue I had with the course (which isn't necessarily an issue with the course but maybe with BQBS schedule in general) was that reading three papers a week was very difficult while taking 2 other courses and having to be in the lab basically full time. Reading 2 papers a week would've been more do-able as oftentimes I would not be able to read the 3rd paper very in-depth, or I would read all three papers, but not have a great understanding of any of them simply due to lack of time from the very busy schedule. From this, having less papers assigned a week I feel would be more beneficial as I would be able to better focus and really understand them. Also, having the course earlier in the day would be great as staying till 8 pm twice a week with our busy schedule was pretty rough.",
    "The open discussion format of the class was very useful and provided welcome variation from our other lecture-based courses. It was helpful to have Tuesdays be devoted to students-only discussion so we could help each other better understand the papers. The course seems very well refined in structure and content from all the years it has been offered. It would have been interesting to have had each instructor at least once rather than just 4\/5 to become more familiar with everyone's discussion style, but I was very happy with all of the discussions we had regardless.",
    "I enjoyed most of the papers we read. We read a lot of very significant papers that uncovered fundamental aspects of biology. It was very interesting to critically read these papers and get a better understanding of some very fundamental concepts.",
    "Strengths: engagement of students discussion and leading role of instructors",
    "It is a great course.",
    "This course was very well taught and enjoyable. It would be helpful though to have more engagement from instructors during discussions rather than them just asking questions.",
    "Strengths: very well organized for the most part and well structured. Good paper selection and good discussions. Weaknesses: none",
    "First, I want to start by saying that it seems the two sections of this course had very different experiences, so I think it would be helpful to rotate all of the professors instead of just a few so that all students can experience each professor and what they have to bring to the discussion. This course by design is promising, but there are some serious issues with expectations. The lead instructor for my section had high expectations for our level of knowledge and was very quick to show displeasure when we didn't live up to those expectations. The teaching style was abrasive and incredibly discouraging for a young scientist. There was no constructive feedback at any point in the course, but this was especially frustrating for the final project which consisted of a presentation and paper. I would have really appreciated some feedback on my project design, but did't feel comfortable asking for it as we were previously told that little to no help would be offered. This led to frustration with my presentation that could have been previously addressed if there had been feedback given at different stages of the course. Overall, this culminated to a very frustrating class that was not enjoyable in the slightest.",
    "The course is very long. Maybe only two papers? Or if keeping the same hours, can the class be scheduled earlier? Catching shuttles at 8pm is difficult, for the most part.",
    "I think it was solid overall but didn't get much feedback on my presentation at the end of the course. I would have liked that.",
    "I really enjoyed the course and enjoyed interacting with my peers and the professors. I wish the papers reflected the variety of research found in MB&B labs instead of mainly genetics and molecular biology papers. Nevertheless, most of the papers were very cool to read and gave me a better appreciation of all the work that goes into scientific breakthroughs. I loved the free food but maybe switch pizza places next year :).",
    "Strengths: Perfect amount of reading each week, wide variety of topics discussed, fantastic discussion sections, and great opportunities to seriously discuss papers with our peers. Weaknesses: Certainly wet-lab centric, only a single paper with any sort of theoretical work was read throughout the entirety of the course. There is more to research than benchwork and it may have been a positive experience to a have a week in which more theory heavy papers were read that utilized some useful quantitative techniques.",
    "Strengths are that it exposes you to different kinds of research and is a little bit of a crash course in the history of biology since many of the papers studied were seminal papers of their respective fields. Weaknesses is that it is a heavy course load and Tuesday section can be influenced by the level of preparedness by the students.",
    "I thought it was a great course. Many students thought that Mark was a bit scary, but it was fine."

    "Yes. This class is a must take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I really enjoyed the discussions and learning about how to logically think about research, read papers critically, and learn more about molecular biology technique, which will all be very useful during my graduate school career.",
    "Yes, unique and challenging and fun.",
    "This course is required, but I would still strongly recommend it to other students even if it were optional. In many ways it was my most rigorous course, but it was also the most fun and helped me develop skills that will make me a more confident scientist. Since this is one of the hallmark Yale courses, it would also be something I could easily mention at the recruitment weekend since it might be of interest to prospective students.",
    "Yes, it's helpful to graduate student for experimental design and leading your own project.",
    "Yes. I learned how to read papers and think logically.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This course was extremely helpful in understanding how to break down scientific literature, one of the most important aspects of being a scientist.",
    "Yes anyone planning on having a career in any biology-related field should take this course as its good practice for what youll likely be doing your entire career.",
    "Never. Despite learning a lot in this course, it was not a pleasant experience in the slightest. I would leave this course every week feeling dejected and as if I didn't belong in the program, and would not want anyone to have to go through this experience.",
    "Yes. You can learn a lot.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it even though it is pretty tough. I believe the outcomes are worth it.",
    "Yes. The course made me think about reading scientific papers in an entirely different way. In addition, it gave me the tools to think critically and develop my own opinions regarding scientific literature.",
    "Yes! It is an incredible course to take as one begins graduate school. It forces one to get acclimated to reading advanced academic literature while also acting as an introduction to fundamental concepts in biology.",
    "I really liked this course but I was in the good section (with Tony) where he tried to push us but didn't destroy our self confidence. The work load is heavy and the class itself is time consuming but I thought it was very valuable to my development as a scientist.",
    "Yes and no. I would definitely recommend the course based on the breadth of different papers that are read because it is valuable just to have practice reading and critically analyzing papers. I also think there is some value in reading papers outside of your interests and previous knowledge in order to develop skills of understanding new methods and evaluating logic. However, I would warn anyone without a strong biological background that they may feel this class is not for them. It is advertised that all the information needed is in the paper, but I found this not to be the case. Instead, it was commonly expected that students have knowledge of other systems or proteins that had certain functions or behaved a certain way or have underlying biological\/chemical knowledge of the systems not presented in the paper to be able to interpret results a certain way. Without this knowledge, students were encouraged not to speak unless they were certain of their answers. In addition, often it seemed that postulating was discouraged and shot down instantly if a word like \"maybe\" or \"perhaps\" was used. This created a feeling that the course was not meant for those with different backgrounds and further that they were not welcome to participate. In fact, if you did not already know the answer, you were discouraged from following a logical train and postulating a possible conclusion. This seems counter to the title of the course which indicates that it is based in logic, however it seemed much more based in methods and understanding the biological systems.",
    "Absolutely. My favorite course."
