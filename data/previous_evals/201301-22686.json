    "We read articles, stories, and a novel in addition to watching movies in order to discuss them as related to culural\/idealogical themes. I would recommend it. I always felt comfortable speaking, and the atmosphere was very friendly.",
    "absolutely. excellent class",
    "Advanced conversational Spanish is not particularly work-heavy or time consuming. The class meets three times a week, and for every session you're expected to have read an article or part of a story. During class you answer comprehension and analysis questions about the reading with your peers, and sometimes you have to submit a sentence-long summary to the professor. There are five quizzes in total which test vocabulary, but you're always told exactly which words you need to memorize for the exam. There are also five written homework assignments, but you submit two drafts of each and thus have ample opportunity to make sure that all the grammar is correct. There are two oral exams - one about half-way through the semester and another during reading week. Finally, something important to note is that you read a novel during the last two weeks of the semester, which is probably the most challenging part of the course.I recommend that anyone who needs to fulfill a language requirement take Spanish 150. But if you really love Spanish, if you want to improve your grammar or if you want immerse yourself more in Spanish literature, culture and politics, I recommend you take something else. This class doesn't really improve your Spanish, because it doesn't demand that much of you. I wouldn't say it's \"easy\" per se, especially if you haven't been practicing Spanish semi-regularly. But there is a lot of hand-holding and the work load is light, so it's easy to get by without putting in that much effort. The downside, of course, is that you don't really get much out of the class when you're not putting that much into it. Class is often boring and it's sometimes difficult to pay attention and really get involved in the conversation.",
    "This was a pretty solid class--not too much work, and the quizzes and exams were definitely doable. If you can, take it with Professor Valle! She's great, and she's very fair. You'll enjoy it, and your Spanish will visibly improve!",
    "Pretty good class - helps with speaking skills but could have been more challenging.",
    "A class that focuses on ability to speak. Covers interesting topics. You learn a lot. I'd definitely recommend it."
