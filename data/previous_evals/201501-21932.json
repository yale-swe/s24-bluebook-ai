   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course. I would recommend learning Matlab and C, but not through this course unless it is required for your major.",
    "Good introductory course, although many of the things you learn are not applicable to anything other than the specific problem sets that we were assigned.",
    "This is a great class for learning the basics of MATLAB and C. I'm not sure how it compares to course in the CS department, but definitely worth checking out if you are an engineer.",
    "ENAS 130 is quite enjoyable. As it is not a computer science class, it is not very stressful. Thankfully it does not require you to spend countless hours working on problem sets. Although Prof. Kuc is generally nice, however, he can sometimes be cranky.",
    "Had to take for MechE, but not a bad class",
    "Most of us have to take it, but as prereqs go, this is definitely not the worst. You get out what you put into it, and even though I did not do exceptionally well on the written tests, I still feel like I learned a lot and what I learned will be helpful in the future.",
    "Certainly take it. If you are considering taking it, then its likely you'll need these skills at some point. As a junior, I wish I had taken it earlier because the programming skills make solving certain pset problems in other classes easier. Kuc's lectures are clear and concise, and the problem sets are not too time consuming but interesting.",
    "It is a basic introduction to matlab and c. Useful material for engineers, well-taught, not an unreasonable amount of work.",
    "Take a Computer Science class instead.",
    "Take it; you'll teach yourself the programming and it'll be worth it.",
    "I'm really happy i took this class! it is a time commitment, but it's a great introduction to coding. I had no programming experience and the class really helped me to think in a different way. Professor Kucs is also adorable.",
    "Take this course if it is required for your major or if you're engineering. The class takes a good approach to problem solving programming. I was completely new to programming, and byy the end of the course I realized that I had learned quite a lot",
    "I would not take this class if I did not already know how to program. If you do, you'll be fine in this course, but if not, I highly recommend a CS department course instead. Luckily, the course notes are posted online, so one does not actually have to attend class to do well. The problem sets aren't too difficult, assuming you know how to program. Some of them are a bit odd and most of the work is spent trying to comprehend the assignment.",
    "We spent the first half of the semester learning Matlab and the second half learning C and communicating between Matlab and C. Two psets each week can be a lot if you don't keep up, but they're overall pretty straightforward. Midterm and final were not very relevant to the psets (tested more the logic of programming) but were also decently fair.",
    "I recommend it!. This course is very practical, and students can improve how to think about algorithm to solve the problems.",
    "You won't learn extensive coding, but you'll learn the mathematical uses of matlab and c.",
    "The class itself is boring, but the stuff you learn in it is really interesting.",
    "Boring, unhelpful class. Frequent copy-past psets accompany useless lectures (but good notes). Grading and TA support is AWFUL! TA's didn't understand the assignments.",
    "The course offered some helpful introductory material for coding and gave a good base for coding in matlab. Some aspects of coding particularly in C should have been covered more in depth.",
    "It's a good class for an introduction to Matlab - when You learn C, You aren't taught pointers or anything, which I've heard makes Your knowledge not that useful. Some of the hw assignments were a lot harder than others which was weird and You weren't warned about. I went to the office hours, which was really helpful, even when the TF wasn't helpful because it was essentially a study group where everyone helped each other out.",
    "Do not take this course if you can avoid it. You probably came to Yale to learn theory, so try to find a different programming course. Ask your Director of Undergraduate Studies if another course can count.",
    "A solid intro to Matlab, C, and Matlab\/C interaction. Kuc is a clear lecturer and HW assignments are well-aligned to the lectures. Only downside to the class is that I would have rather learned C++ instead of C. Tests are very fair (one midterm and one final exam).",
    "Doesn't give you anything special. You can learn MATLAB online and C is barely touched. Not worth it, take an actual CS course. It's a lot of work and you don't learn as much.",
    "This was the worst class I've ever taken. Even if this is a prerequisite class for your major, try to find alternatives ways to get programming experience.",
    "It's an introduction to Matlab and C in the context of programming for science and engineering. I would recommend it if the student is interested in doing research in a lab that uses Matlab or C.",
    "Good introduction to programming from a more practical angle that will probably be useful for lab and engineering work. Although I suppose attending lecture isn't necessary, I still benefited from going every time. Professor Kuc is a humorous lecturer and a good teacher. He has a bias toward audio and image data processing that is evident in the course material, but his real goal for the class is to nurture problem solving skills such as learning to debug and find information online. So I wouldn't worry if you aren't interested in the specific applications of Matlab and c that he chooses for this class; the point is to walk away with an understanding of how Matlab and c operate at a fundamental level and how that affects your approach to writing a program to accomplish some task. I think Professor Kuc does a good job structuring the class to train these transferable skills. Having 2 psets a week can get a little overwhelming if you fall behind, but it's a good way to force yourself to practice programming several times a week. It may be tempting to just copy and paste segments of his sample programs in order to finish the psets faster, but spending the extra time to work out the thought process or figure it out yourself makes the exams much easier. I recommend this class if you are interested in learning how use programming for data processing and simulations.",
    "Do not take this unless you have to. I think CS50 looks more promising. Go to TA help sessions and know that the psets have nothing to do with the test material.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who might use MATLAB or C in the future, or even to anyone who just wants an intro to coding. Professor Kuc teaches coding through example files which are extremely helpful for moving through increasingly complicated topics."
