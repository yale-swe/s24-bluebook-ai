   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Working in groups, critically thinking about social norms defining addiction, writing (short papers and end of term paper) skills.",
    "Writing, critical thinking, and presenting\/speaking skills.",
    "We learned how to have effective and investigative discourse about a broad topic, framed by four documents (reading materials).",
    "This was a great class in terms of collaboration. The assignments to work in groups helped me to understand how to work proactively and to take everyone's thoughts into account.",
    "Course took a very long time to develop an overall concept of the nature of addiction which could have helped for earlier assignments. Also felt that more exploration of the individual addictions could have used some work sometimes. The readings for each week I found to be less and less interested in and they seemed to diverge into accounts that you had a hard time relating back to what you were studying in class.",
    "I learned a lot about the humanistic views of history and addiction. As a person with a science background, I found the topic interesting but it was fascinating to see it from a new perspective.",
    "I have learned so much about analyzing historical sources, my own voice as a writer, and the history of addiction.",
    "I learned about the way different students' experiences with addiction shape their knowledge and\/or opinions about it. I also learned about how society as a whole has affected our stance on addiction.",
    "I learned so much about perspective and truly exploring the historical roots of addiction. I had never so deeply explored addiction and now feel like I have a much better grasp and understanding of the policies, opinions, and stigmas shrouding addiction. Most importantly, I learned that there are still many unanswered questions and that the search is never over.",
    "this course really expanded my view on addiction. before i saw it as it is plainly defined in dictionaries. now, i know that there is much more to it, and that there are a large variety of factors that can leave a person susceptible to addiction",
    "I developed a much broader and more comprehensive view of addiction than I had coming in. I learned some scientific insight into addiction, but more importantly, I learned how to analyze the language of literature to look for implicit meanings - a skill I haven't been able to develop in any of my other classes.",
    "How to critically read historical and modern medical texts.",
    "Opened my mind to a huge issue on many levels",
    "I learned how to take a multidisciplinary approach to a very difficult topic. I think that this class really challenged me in deciphering and relating documents of different subject areas.",
    "How to write a research paper that uses both humanities and scientific sources",
    "Learned how to write analytical, historical papers and really changed my perspective on addiction",
    "I learned to apply a critical historical perspective to contemporary debates about the nature of addiction, as well as to specific addictions.",
    "I learned how to analyze a lot of sources and pieces of text and thought a lot more about the social effects of addiction",
    "History of Addiction was an amazing course that taught me a wide range of new skills. First of all, since it was a writing credit, I do believe my writing improved. Through the weekly reading responses and midterm and final paper, I learned new techniques for writing and how to be more concise and fluid. I also got to practice new ways of thinking, particularly getting to practice integrating new ideas modern ideas with older ideas from previous centuries.",
    "This course open my eyes to how coded the language we use to discuss addiction can be and it has changed the way I think about and define addiction in general. This course helped me better my skills in reading and analyzing texts and then collaborating with others to form general arguments based off of the assigned readings and in-class discussions.",
    "Learning how to usefully synthesize broad ideas and gain new perspectives for approaching a controversial topic.",
    "I learned how to examine primary scientific sources from before the 1900s.",
    "I developed and nurtured a framework of the history of addiction in the U.S. I learned to view the social, moral, and even political undertones that color how we view or categorize addictions.",
    "This course allowed me to understand addiction as a fluid label that vaties depending on its cultural, political, and social context.",
    "I have learned to question assumptions about how we as a society views addiction, our values and our behaviors. This class has taught me to question everything to find the underlying motives behind our policy and beliefs.",
    "I learned so much about how to incorporate different historical lenses into one cohesive paper- definitely a great course for fine tuning my argument skills.",
    "How to consider source bias and trends through history",
    "I can honestly say none.",
    "I learned how to think critically about a range of sources from different time periods, and how to connect them together through common themes and ideas. So whether it was a scientific article in JAMA or a more psychoanalytical piece from Freud, I was able to not only comprehend what was being said but how that applied to the big picture of 'what is addiction.' I also learned how to write a source analysis and to search for primary sources, both things which I hadn't done before. The source analysis was a great way to hone my close reading skills and to employ the broad frameworks we'd discussed in class to a specific topic of my choice. The group collaborations were also something unique to this class and to my learning experiences at Yale. I learned how to incorporate lots of different ideas from different people, in a limited amount of time, and turn out an entertaining (hopefully) and logical argument.",
    "I learned that addiction is very complex and has been associated with stigma throughout history. This stigma prevents people from seeking treatment. I learned the history of many addictions, including those to substances such as heroin, caffeine, alcohol, and marijuana. I learned that neurobiology has a lot to do with addiction. I also learned about behavioral addictions, such as gambling, that I didn't know much about before taking this course.",
    "The class engages many of the skills required to craft arguments. What made this class stand out to me was the focus on collaborative writing and instruction on the kinds of sources to find for historical arguments about science. Few classes ask you to craft an argument in a collaborative setting with people who may disagree with you, and this class does it well. Bringing in our own sources every week was a useful practice in finding evidence to support claims.",
    "I developed the ability to think outside the box, especially when it comes to subjective material, like addiction. Sometimes, its not as clear cut as I think it is. Since I am more of a logical person, I struggled a little with understanding how to come up with some very deep analyses for less objective curriculum, but I learned to do so throughout this course. I also learned a lot more about addictions and how they work from both a scientific, historical, and psychological perspective. This course taught me a lot about the humanities and humanity, and I am so glad to have taken it!",
    "Historical analysis, deconstruction, source analysis, critical treatment of scientific writing",
    "Historical writing and analytic skills",
    "Historical context on the question of addiction in the United States and Europe, approaches to understanding and addressing addiction on social, personal, or governmental\/administrative levels.",
    "I am better at critically evaluating what experts say. I used to really accept science and medicine at face value, but I think the biggest takeaway that I got form this class is that one needs to stay reasonably skeptical. This is really valuable to me, because I want to go into medicine.",
    "How to formulate topics on addiction, formulate my own ideas on a topic that I so important to our society.",
    "I feel I learned a lot about the social construction of addiction throughout history. I also learned about how important a class's format is.",
    "I really learned a lot about addiction and the many different stigmas that have been attached to it. I also learned a lot about how that has changed over time and the many biases surrounding the way addiction is viewed in society. It is very interesting and I learned how to look critically at papers and analyze what's being said.",
    "Problematicize my understanding of addiction and the impact of my preconceptions",
    "I learned different perspectives regarding addiction, and was really able to alter my original view of addiction.",
    "I learned so much in this course. I was able to study addiction through a historical and scientific perspective. I learned how to make an argument and defend it with a variety of texts.",
    "I learned how historical periods influence our definition of everything. I learned how to look for historical primary and secondary sources and how to analyze them critically to build my own thesis.",
    "This course widely expanded by historical and contemporary knowledge about addiction. Although I do not feel like I left the course with a concrete definition of \"addiction\", all aspects that I learned in this course have complicated and added to my understanding of this question.",
    "The only thing I learned is that addiction will never be understood and that there is no single definition for addiction. To approach 'addiction' one must consider a host of influences, there is no single thing that constitutes addiction."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The arrangement of part lecture and part discussion was actually very helpful and engaging overall. The only issue I personally had with the class was that because it was 2 hours long, by the end of the period I would sometimes be bored and disengaged.",
    "I was incredibly disappointed with this class. Not because of the content or the instructor or the TA because all those were great. The class was not conducive to learning and more often than not was frustrating as a result. Strengths: Professor Cowles is great - super knowledgeable and helpful. The TAs were really invested and tried their best to help us learn. The content is interesting and made me think about addiction in a new way. The collaborative learning activity was cool and something I think would be a great addition to other classes. Weaknesses: This was my senior seminar and to have a senior seminar that is essentially a lecture\/discussion section is more disappointing than I can put into words. I could never hear what others in the group were saying and had trouble formulating my own thoughts because there were always so many other people speaking. I would not recommend this class structure. While it could potentially be ok for an intro level course, to take a senior seminar in this format was honestly such a disappointing way to end my Yale education. For a school that boasts their 6:1 student to faculty ratio to make a senior seminar into a lecture is just appalling.",
    "Strengths were the course materials (very interesting material) and the engagement of the TAs (they were wonderful!!!!). Weaknesses were definitely the setting: hearing your group members and TAs was very difficult when everyone was talking at the same time.",
    "The course was by far one of my favorites at Yale. The new format was really cool in that it has the best of both lecture style courses and seminar style courses. The layout of lecture --> collaboration --> group discussion was well-suited for gaining a great understanding of the material hearing from your the teacher, TF, and fellow students.",
    "I think the class should put the sections in different rooms (or at least some of them) because I spent a lot of time straining to hear the other people in my section speak.",
    "The course provided the reading materials needed to succeed in the discussion section and for writing the reading responses. The TAs guided the discussion while adding their own insight. The one weakness for the course is the noise level due to the many TA groups talking at the same time.",
    "I really liked the collaboration pieces and the general structure. The mini lecture followed by a small group discussion was a great way to frame the information before taking a deeper dive into it. Smaller group discussions are also extremely efficient for better understanding of the information.",
    "The large assignments (midterm and final) were very were too open ended yet the TF's seemed to require a particular approach to them. It felt a lot like \"what does this prompt mean\" for the assignments at times.",
    "The best part of the class was my TA--who was so knowledgeable--and the lectures of Prof. Cowles. It was amazing to just listen. In addition, the readings were very interesting and there was a high level of engagement with the material that helped me understand. The weaknesses were just parts of smoothing out the kinks of the format of the class--the breakdown of time, the guidelines of collaboration.",
    "I liked the layout of this seminar but which professor cowles lectured more. He is an amazing professor but the tf was the one leading most of the course. It was also very difficult to hear in the large room with all of the different sections",
    "Strengths are pretty much EVERYTHING about it- Prof. Cowles, the TFs, everything was so great- this class was my favorite part of the week!",
    "The format of this course was awesome! Even though it met for a 2-hour-long chunk, we never did any one activity for more than 45 minutes, so it went by really quickly.",
    "strengths: lecturer is very engaging, collaborative atmosphere makes class interesting weaknesses: there is a lot of noise in the classroom",
    "Overall, there is not enough communication between the professor and TAs. As a result the course may seem unorganized.",
    "strengths - AMAZING teaching assistants. i don't know where i would be without the thought-provoking and interesting comments my ta had to provoke discussion in our group. weakness - not many besides the noise in the classroom from other groups",
    "I actually really liked the way this course was set up, with seminar-style discussion in a larger section. The acoustics were sometimes challenging, but by the end of the semester, we had developed a system of discussion in pairs, small groups, and entire tables that worked really well. One pitfall was that each TA was assigned a much larger number of students than could be engaged with at one time. My TA was constantly moving between tables trying to facilitate discussion, and though we were able to sustain discussions fairly well independently, it would have been nice to have more time discussing with more directed questions from the TA than were physically allowable in this classroom setting. Maybe make each TA's group a bit smaller?",
    "TEAL was too large of a classroom to hold this class in. I would have strongly preferred a discussion sized classroom for this discussion based class. A strength was how it taught me to think about medicine with a critical mind.",
    "I didn't like how we only got a small portion of time being lecture by Cowles because he's amazing, because then we were split into ineffective sections",
    "Super interesting material, maybe better as a lecture as is was hard to hear in sections when so many people are talking in one room",
    "In regards to the material: - readings were incredibly fascinating. I actually enjoyed reading the articles in detail. Well-chosen - great topic, so interesting. So many layers to unravel. So much to discuss every section. It was amazing. - video clips were always relevant and enjoyable - lecture aspect didn't always seem as connected to the readings. Didn't always understand the purpose of it. Seemed unnecessary at times - topics for readings questions at times too vague and not easy to understand. This is also true of the reading responses. Reading responses - could definitely limit to only 4-5 reading responses. I think the material and readings are enough and we don't need a reading response every time to facilitate conversation, but I think the reading responses are helpful to refine my ideas before class. Format of class - perhaps too ambitious - I don't think having so many groups was the best. I think we could limit it to 5-6 groups. As someone who is nervous speaking up in sections, I think having more than one group was comforting. You got the experience of the seminar, but with less anxiety. - the lecture aspect was cool though, so I liked the format. - if we interacted more with the other groups, perhaps it would be make more sense to have this format. Like if two different groups (with two different TFs) debated something.",
    "This course is great because it allows for so many more people to be a part of a seminar. I think the course would benefit from more ta's so that students are competing with so many students for time to participate. I loved the collaborative writing and I think it was so important and relevant to learn.",
    "The TAs and Cowles are absolutely great and brilliant. The organization of the course was very straightforward and made for a great learning trajectory. That being said, this course was supposed to be my senior seminar and was expanded after sign ups into a huge course. I really wish I could have gotten more warning of this, or more individual work with Cowles.",
    "It was a very interesting course, I wish there had been more discussion with a professor Cowles because though the material was interesting, it felt like I spent a lot of time talking to people who also did not know much about addiction.",
    "I think hat having this course as a \"seminar\" with so many people kind of took away from what I could have gotten out of the course. Even though Cowles did a great job of organizing and splitting up the time so that he spoke a little and we got time with our TFs, it still didn't feel like we were able to really use that time to all learn something new, because we relied so heavily on our peers. It was great to have discussions with them, but it ended up being too much time dedicated to our group discussions. I would have wanted Professor Cowles to lecture more (or ideally to have a seminar with him and have a group discusin that he contributes to.",
    "the set-up of the classroom was not the best because of the seminar\/lecture design, but i think it worked out well. the collaborations were not too useful in my opinion but instead should have been a brainstorming session",
    "The readings for the course were excellent. However, class discussion remained at a surface level. I would have wanted discussion to go deeper into the readings.",
    "Strengths: got to know group well, comfortable asking TF for help with essays Weaknesses: timing - often pairs\/groups would finish conversations at different times, resulting in a lot of downtime or not enough time. Additionally, the collaborative writing was a great exercise but was sometimes a burden on those who pulled more weight than their peers. It would be nice to receive feedback on the weekly writing assignments from TFs, even if it was not your week to do the write-up.",
    "I liked how the course was done and the texts were very interesting. I wish there was a little more lecture cause I feel like I could've learned more history.",
    "Overall I though this was an amazing class. I got to learn about a wide range of addictions, was constantly challenged with the definition of what addiction is, and really had the chance to form new opinions on some relevant topics. Additionally, I really came to appreciate the new \"expanded seminar\" format. I really appreciate the effort to include more students in this class, and I think it worked out really well (although i did have an amazing TA). While I would have liked to have more 1 on 1 time with Professor Cowles, I know he made an effort to get to know all of us, which was pretty amazing considering there were over 100 of us.",
    "I think the setting made it difficult to engage in a seminar like manner because the tables and loud volume were not conducive to the environment the class was designed to be. That being said, I enjoyed the seminar like vibe in a larger class but I would enjoy hearing about the conversations the other groups were having",
    "The \"expanded seminar\" format is good in theory but the noise in the TEAL classroom can make discussions difficult. With big groups around two tables it can be difficult to hear each other.",
    "The strength of this course definitely lays in Professor Cowles. He is unreal and so good at what he does. I enjoyed that everything we learned was tied to a current trending topic such as \"addicted to twitter\", John Oliver shows, etc. The weakness of the course was that the seminar was simply too big. I feel like I would have enjoyed it more had it been smaller and we could work with Cowles more instead of a TA.",
    "Strengths include the discussion in small groups as I felt that this allowed each student to really engage with the discussion. I also think the material was very interesting and the breakdown for how time was used during each class was also conducive for a good learning environment. I especially think the TA's were a big strength. They helped keep the conversation going during discussions and made it an extremely enjoyable class. The only weakness of this course was that because there were so many people in the room at a time, sometimes it could be difficult to hear your own group members speak. The only way I think this could be fixed would be to hold the class in a larger room that is more conducive to breaking up in to groups (but I don't know if such a classroom is at Yale).",
    "Strengths: Interesting reading material, good lectures, nice if you have a particularly enthusiastic TA Weaknesses: Class format is almost a glorified bookclub. You end up leaving not feeling like you've learned that much, although I know a lot of people who really enjoyed the low stakes atmosphere. Sometimes it feels like the same ideas are hashed out over and over again. The room\/format itself was very hectic at times--people had trouble hearing each other throughout the semester, groups had to be split up into different tables, etc. It seems like the class might be more successful if it was still a pure seminar.",
    "I'm not sure how the TEAL seminar-like thing would have compared to a seminar, but I enjoyed the course--largely owing to the fact that I had a great TA.",
    "Some weeks, the topics felt repetitive because we also came back to the same conclusion that addiction is an amalgamation of different factors.",
    "I liked the content, it was hard to discuss in the room style.",
    "The class' subject material was extremely interesting and relevant, and Professor Cowles is an incredible professor. The only major weakness was the class format. I feel like the class would have been more fulfilling if we had lectures during an allotted class time and then separate discussion sections, or if it was just kept as a small seminar. Also, I wish there had been a bit more transparency in terms of grading and performance. I feel like the writing prompts didn't always stress the things that we truly needed in order to get a good grade, and I really have no idea what my final grade is going to end up being.",
    "The classroom was a little crowded. IF there were a larger classroom where we could space out the tables more, it would reduce the loudness of the classroom. I did really enjoy the screens around the room so that the circular table seating required no odd neck angles. I did really enjoy the large classroom format that broke into smaller sections and then came back together. And, of course, my love of Professor Cowles was a largely positive factor.",
    "More lecturing from Cowles would make it better. The discussions weren't very educating usually.",
    "The format just didn't work for me, and I think others felt similarly Constant concurrent discussions made it hard to hear, and the interruptions from the professor and other sections made it impossible to delve deeply into any topic. Also, the entire thesis of the course was \"addiction is a historical construct,\" which seems pretty superficial to me. I don't feel that I actually learned anything about the history of addiction that I couldn't get from reading wikipedia for 5 minutes.I'm sure the course is valuable as a seminar, but as an \"expanded seminar\" it felt like a depressing take on the humanities.",
    "Strengths: Highly structured and organized so you knew what to expect each week with regards to the types of readings and the class setup. Prof. Cowles is a genius and has a way of explaining things that is brilliant without being incomprehensible. The TAs were phenomenal (at least mine was), which made the class way more fun and productive. Weaknesses: The format of the class. I'm not convinced conducting 8 (or whatever the number was) sections at the same time is a great idea, mostly because of noise. Every week it was hard to hear what people in my group were saying, which made it hard to follow along in the group discussion. Given the fact that Prof. Cowles was basically giving a lecture at the start of class, and discussion time was the length of a typical section at Yale, I would say this class would have functioned better as a lecture with sections. That way we could have learned even more Prof. Cowles which would have been great, while also being able to hear our classmates in group discussion.",
    "This course was phenomenal. I would have liked to meet twice a week instead of just once. My TA (Jordan Bryant) was amazing and should be hired by Yale to teach her own class. Professor Cowles was of course fantastic, too. The organization of this class was stellar despite it being a weekly seminar of 100+ students. The course could be improved by going into more depth about some of the addictions, especially as they relate to neurobiology and anthropology.",
    "The format of the class is really strong. Starting with a brief lecture was helpful in framing discussions of the readings that followed. Discussing the readings and then being given a prompt to write about was effective in making sure that the discussion could be productive. I think sometimes the lectures seemed shorter than they could have been, although lengthening them would make the other parts of the class seem too short. I think having more specific questions about the readings would to guide discussion would make them fit within the context of the lecture portion more and perhaps we would get more out the readings that way.",
    "I like the class as it was. It was interesting to see it done lecture style and seminar style. I think a lot more classes could be structured this way. My only concern was for maybe some warning or be given an idea as to how much reading there would be each week. It varied, but sometimes there were 200+ pages of reading. Knowing how much reading would be done before hand would certainly help, especially when the reading would be posted the Friday before class on Tuesday. Sometimes students need more time than that, especially with other reading heavy courses.",
    "I don't think the format of this course was successful - better either as a seminar or lecture not the middle ground.",
    "Collaboration was a little unorganized, depending on the discussion leader. Some people are introverted by nature.",
    "Strengths: the syllabus, the TAs, the professor, the assignments. Weaknesses: lack of structured engagement with prof (to be expected given the size), acoustics of the room, ambiguity sometimes of group discussion prompts, circularity sometimes creates with discussing addiction (probs because language we come in to the course with is so loaded with assumptions)",
    "The strength is in the instructor and TFs, but the weakness is the classeoom",
    "The format really did not work for the curriculum or for fostering critical engagement with the texts. Other students couldn't guide the discussion or analysis in ways that would be achieved by the professor, and TFs were not in a position to be teaching this course, especially since many were not actually students on the topic or familiar with historical analysis.",
    "The unique large-section format of this class was really excellent and something I really hope continues in the future! I truly benefited from this!",
    "Strengths: the readings and content were really well designed and pick out. The lectures were really great too. Weaknesses: In the beginning, because the course was so new, the timing was off. We never had enough time for collaborative component. Also: the TEAL room is not soundproof enough, and I had a hard time hearing my TA and people in my section.",
    "Very interesting material that allowed everyone to form an opinion, and amazing TA's that motivated people to speak. Structure needs some working on, a little too loud and hard to focus.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Cowles; interesting material. Weaknesses: Format, underprepared TFs, not enough readings, format, lack of structure, format, the other students, format, pointless workshop classes, format. Also, the format.",
    "The topic is fascinating and the readings are cool. Very interesting discussions and there is a lot of interesting stuff to work with. Professor is great and gives a fantastic lecture and set up for the gorp discussions. The longer class once a week is a great format. The breakdown into smaller groups was tricky at first but improved as the class went on. One of the hardest things was hearing other people in the group because there were a lot of things going on at times and it could be hard to hear.",
    "The class is big which is nice because a lot of people take it but it was distracting",
    "The strength was in the instruction of the course. Dr. Cowles is an amazing professor who keeps class engaging and interesting. The weakness of the course was the structure. I took the class because I wanted to learn from Dr. Cowles, not from a bunch of undergrads who have no idea what they're talking about. I would have been much more satisfied with the class having been focused more heavily on lectures and much less on discussion with classmates.",
    "I think the format of the course during the end really worked, and can definitely be used for future seminars. I just wish that there was less of an emphasis on small group discussion and more listening to Professor Cowles lecture and maybe a bigger group discussion if necessary. I just feel like the small group discussion wasn't always as rewarding as I would have liked. I'm also a little disappointed because this class was cross listed as HSHM and PSYC, but the emphasis was on the history. Obviously this makes sense considering the name of the course, but I still wish there was more talk about Psychology without it being a \"scientific narrative.\" I felt like I wasn't really able to discuss the Psyc or science of an addiction (especially in my papers), which is what I've studied, besides in the context of how an addiction is written about scientifically. It was kind of frustrating having to focus so much on sources and how they're written instead of their actual content, but I guess that's what history is about. I overall enjoyed the content though, but wish there was more discussion from Professor Cowles unrelated to just the history, and that we could make claims about psychology in our papers rather than just historical claims.",
    "I love this course so much, this was truly the best course I have ever taken. My sole suggestion would be a slightly longer lecture. I always wished that Professor COwles had a little more time to lecture.",
    "The strengths of this class were the readings and group discussions. The weakness was that there was not enough time to delve into the lecture although it was often times very interesting.",
    "The best is the collaborative atmosphere of the course and the enriching discussions we have every week.",
    "The set up was...different. I feel like this could work in the future, but it was hard to hear other students speaking in that space. I also feel like the final write ups of class improved (since less questions were included by the end) but this process didn't always feel productive or \"successful\". However, I think Professor Cowles' summaries at the beginning were extremely helpful and I liked having our written section connect to some contemporary video\/event. It was awesome to tackle a different topic every week. The context was always interesting.",
    "It was simply too big of a class. Should be a seminar."

    "yes",
    "The class itself is really good and I would 100% recommend it if it was a seminar with Professor Cowles. That being said, the course was not a seminar, and I would not recommend the class in this structure. While it could potentially be ok for an intro level course, to take a senior seminar in this format was honestly such a disappointing way to end my Yale education. For a school that boasts their 6:1 student to faculty ratio to make a senior seminar into a lecture is just appalling.",
    "Yes, yes, take it!!!! You will learn a lot and it will lead you to reflect on your own life.",
    "take it! Great class, interesting topics, excellent professor and TFs.",
    "Yes!!! Henry is the greatest, the topics are very interesting, and the format is absolutely revolutionary. 10\/10",
    "Yes, I would. The beginning lecture by Professor Cowles was especially engaging and really provided insight into the topic (the individual history of a substance or behavioral addiction).",
    "Awesome course. Very interesting subject material and an incredible format for learning. Professor Cowles has a great setup here.",
    "This was the first year this course was on offer in this format, so it will have refinements next year. I wouldn't recommend taking it as much if you actually want to study what addiction does to people. Go for either a more medical based approach or a social systems class.",
    "Absolutely! I hope you're still allowed to take it without a cap on the number of people who can take the class. Prof. Cowles knowledge and lectures are invaluable and the TAs are excellent. The class, I'm sure, will have improved in its ability to be a smooth-running machine. The material is very interesting--for science majors, for non-science majors, for humanities majors, for everyone.",
    "I LOVE THIS COURSE!!! It was my favorite time of the week. Cowles is AMAZING and brings his TFs to the level of awesome that he's at always. This class has improved my writing skills immensely, and I am so glad I took it.",
    "I would recommend this course. Some of the time was spent simply talking about addiction and not learning new things, but most of it involved talking about the readings and historical perspectives on addiction.",
    "i would strongly recommend this course to other students. I it was fun to go to and i really feel like I got so much out of it. Professor Cowles truly cares about his students and is an excellent lecturer and reasonable and understanding professor.",
    "if the topic of addiction interests you, take this course. it is amazing and lets you learn about all types of addiction. very well taught",
    "This is a great course for anyone interested in addiction and the history of medicine in the United States.",
    "yes if you know nothing about the history of drug policy in our country",
    "Yes, worth taking because Prof Cowles and the TAs were great and its a really interesting class. Just have to know that sometimes its frustrating to hear or be heard.",
    "This class is fun. The readings are incredibly interesting. It's such a fascinating topic in the first place. You will definitely learn so much. It is not a seminar\/lecture that feels like a waste of time. The things you learn feel they matter and are tangible. I think the seminar lecture combo of the class is mostly good. Not as much pressure as there is in seminars.",
    "yes i definitely learned a lot, and it had work, but it was very interesting in terms of the readings",
    "Yes! pretty chill HU\/Wr",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. We cover a ton of incredibly interesting material from the 18th century to the modern day, and really got the chance to analyze it and form our own opinions. Additionally, since this class is so cross-listed, each student was able to focus on something that interested him\/her, so everyone really got something out of the class. Additionally, Professor Cowles and all the TA's were amazing, and their engagement and commitment to the class was incredibly evident. Absolutely would recommend!",
    "yes.",
    "I would not recommend this course to a student if it stays as a big seminar ESPECIALLY if you get an incompetent TA like I got. Cowles is amazing, but the fact that he was not leading discussions was disheartening.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student! The content was extremely interesting and the workload was low relative to other classes. It is a great class that gets you thinking but it won't take up too much of your time.",
    "This is a great class if you are a discussion\/reading-heavy oriented student. Not so good if you like feeling like you are learning a ton of new information or being particularly challenged. The material is definitely very interesting (you explore various different addictions during history), and when Professor Cowles does lecture, it's usually very good, but overall, the class was a bit too disorganized for my liking. I had a great TA, but logistics like having to be split at two tables or not being able to hear other people were frustrating. Also since it only met once a week, sometimes I felt like I wasn't as connected to the class as I would have liked to been. In the past, I've had once a week seminars where more of a community feels like it's being built. Overall, not my favorite class, and I wouldn't particularly recommend it, but I know a lot of my other friends really enjoyed how it felt lower-stakes\/was more discussion based. If that's your thing, this is totally for you! Definitely writing heavy, which makes sense with the credit, but beware the papers will be a lot to handle, and you won't have much in class help.",
    "Yes, it was very engaging and eye-opening!",
    "I recommend this course. The readings themselves were fantastic so actually do them. You will learn a lot and get a lot out of the class if you put in the work and pay attention in class.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would. The experimental lecture\/ seminar structure made it a bit chaitic at times so I don't know if I would recommed it for future iterations of the course but the matetial itself wad fascinating and successfully covered both scientific and historic sources.",
    "Yes, take this course! The workload is pretty chill, and Professor Cowles is a great professor. This class teaches you to question everything we think about addiction.",
    "Addition is an incredibly sensitive topic, and the professor and TA's really went out of their way to balance the hard science of it with the softer, more emotion-centered historical and philosophical accounts. This class is a must take- it's a solid WR credit that will enhance your argument formation abilities, as well as give you the opportunity to work with great instructors and engaging material.",
    "Yeah, if you need to take the easiest class with the lowest workload, it's this one. Otherwise no, unless the format is changed. It mifght be a good class as a real seminar, but not in the TEAL classroom.",
    "Absolutely! But with the caveat being that you have to be open and flexible to a new and at times frustrating learning environment. The fact that 7+ sections are going on at the same time can make it difficult to hear the conversations being had in your group, and can hamper the flow of discussion. But, Prof. Cowles is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter and he presents that in a concise yet comprehensive way at the start of the class which is a great way to launch discussion. The TAs are the real strength of this class. In effect, they are the ones teaching and running the course because they're guiding the discussion, meeting to talk about paper ideas and marking papers. So as long as the quality of TAs remains as good as it was this year, I would 100% recommend this class. Prof. Cowles has struck a nice balance with the readings whereby they generally aren't too long, plus they're diverse and most importantly, interesting! This is a course for those who are interested in exploring how society has shaped the definition of and ideas around the notion of addiction, both in a historical and highly modern context.",
    "ABSOLUTELY would recommend this course to anyone at Yale.",
    "This class was really great. There are so many interesting questions within the history of addiction that you can make your work really your own. For example, my essays were about jazz music and how it was treated as addictive within the context of racial and gender politics of the 1920s. It really helped frame my interest in the intersection of psychology, biology, and neuroscience with society, politics, and philosophy. More than the subject matter, the format is well-designed to facilitate collaboration through the collaborative writing assignments each week, which are very easy and only require work outside of class once per semester. Still, collaborative writing is a skill that few humanities courses engage, so it was a useful experience. Also, you get very clear instruction on how to conduct historical research, which some people with less experience in history benefit from. Don't expect this class to replace a seminar, since a lot of people felt that it lacked the strong relationship with a professor that other seminars offer. It is an entirely unique format that is neither lecture nor seminar, although the skills are more like seminar-style learning.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. You gain so much in knowledge from this course in many different areas: science, history, political science, psychology, life. I enjoyed the interdisciplinary feel of this course, and would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning more about addiction from various view points. It's not just about history. It's about us.",
    "It was my first HSHM course but it was definitely a stellar lineup of course material for testing the waters. Coming from a science background, it challenges the pedestal that you might put the scientific method on, and it forces you to begin rethinking the way that you've treated research in the past. Beyond that, it's simply fascinating to study addiction through a historical lens, and if you internalize the lessons you learn here, you'll be much more adept at approaching some of the problems in the discourse that we have about drugs and addicts in political arenas, News stations, and casual conversations. Workload is very amenable. You spend a lot of time talking to the people in your section (if it's taught in the 120-person format) so you'd do well to get a feel for the people you'd be in class with before committing. Great course overall, Cowles knows his stuff and curates a terrific syllabus to guide the arc of the course. Also quite minimal work for a WR!",
    "Yes definitely, very interesting for any major",
    "Please take this class!!! Your eyes will be opened to the wide range of addictions that exist and help change your worldview with respect to how you personally see these manifest themselves in society.",
    "This was the pilot year with the flipped seminar style, where Professor Cowles lectures for 30 minutes, and then the class breaks into group discussions led by TAs. Because it was the first year, there were some hiccups with the timing of everything. But that being said, the content and readings are still really interesting. Professor Cowles is a great lecturer. I definitely feel like I came away from this course with a new perspective on addiction. Also, the workload is not too bad, just a half page reading response and ~40 or so pages of reading per week.",
    "Definitely, very interesting, excited to come to class every week.",
    "Do not take this class unless its format is significantly changed. Save yourself the head and heartache and just say no. Wait until this becomes a lecture taught only by Prof. Cowles. This absorbing course was marred by the terrible, godawful, very bad, no-good \"leminar\" format. Due to no fault of any person involved, mind you. There simultaneously was not enough and too much class: not enough hearing from someone who knows what they're talking about (i.e., Prof. Cowles) and infinitely too much time spent hearing from people who have never taken a humanities class before (i.e., fellow students). It was the most frustrating class I've taken at Yale. I conceptually enjoyed the weirdly-light (honestly, gutlike) courseload, but it was completely inappropriate given that students were expected to talk for a majority of the class-time. Seminars work only because the students have enough to work with and because the instructor has spent a lot of time with the material in question. The TFs seemed like they had not been given enough guidance, with the interactivity (and quality) of the class varying wildly from table to table. It's hard for me to fault them, though, given that the ratio was one underprepared grad student per fifteen clueless students with, for the most part, no historical preparation (thanks to a lack of prereqs) and an utter refusal to accept something that may even vaguely approach original thought. Speaking of tables, the venue itself was horrible. It was impossible to hear anyone else, particularly when combined with the fact that each \"section\" was too large for one table. The result: fifteen kids scattered up to twenty feet apart expected to closely collaborate for hours on end. Did I mention that TEAL is also an acoustic echo chamber, causing the ambient noise level to approach \"deafening roar?\" tl;dr: this course was an excellent idea mauled by horrid execution. In search of combining the best parts of seminars and lectures, it got the worst parts of both. The lecture parts were great; the seminar parts crushed my soul every week for an entire semester. Yale College Administration: please just make this a lecture taught by Prof. Cowles. Not a leminar. Never a leminar. Ever again. For anything.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is a very interesting topic and there is a a lot of cool stuff to discuss. A great way to get a writing credit with little writing. Only a 5 and 10 page paper and then a smaller writeup that is outlines by everyone in the group. Really interesting. Definitely take it if you can!",
    "Although the class ended up being fine, it's pretty disappointing if you are taking it purely for interest and curiosity about different kinds of addiction. Also, if you're taking it because you've heard good things about Dr. Cowles (like me), you'll be pretty disappointed by how little class time is spent hearing from him and how much is spent discussing with everyone in your section who knows nothing about addiction but thinks they are experts (this class is FULL of section assholes). All in all, it's fine but would be WAY better if it wasn't taught in a large lecture seminar format. Also, Dr. Cowles' powerpoint format and layout are the most boring things on the planet and made my eyes hurt.",
    "I would recommend this course solely on the basis that the topic is incredibly interesting and you will learn several new ways to think about addiction. Moreover, Professor Cowles is an amazing teacher that everyone should get a chance to learn from. In terms of the class itself, we spent part of the class listening to Professor Cowles lecture about the history\/background of each week's addiction, part of it discussing in smaller groups the reading response questions and other questions posed during the lecture portion, and then the last part of the class was spent doing a collaborative writing. The collaborative writing was actually very chill and easy, one person each week wrote up a short piece that incorporated the readings, which is what we talked about during class so a bulk of the work was already done. The other grades are participation which includes reading response questions answered every week and section participation. Then there was the midterm and final essay. Honestly I'm somewhat concerned about my grade but the class is still worth it in terms of the learning that you do.",
    "I would completely (and already have) suggest this course to other students. It was engaging, informative and was applicable to places beyond the classroom. I loved how this learning wasn't only for the classroom. I walked away from this class every week with a new perspective and new information that I was excited to discuss.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I really enjoyed the seminar\/lecture format.",
    "This course has a different format and idea. You will be expected to read a lot and then discuss about your readings in small groups, but the process ends up being very fun and enriching since the articles are always very interesting.",
    "Yes, it's great.",
    "Yes. Although I think it could be improved, the content was extremely interesting.",
    "Only take this course if it is offered as a true seminar, not in the TEAL classroom format."
