    "We need a colloquium for this course. Desperately. Fortunately, I had research experience and had conducted ethnographic research over the summer before senior year, but many of my senior colleagues had not and REALLY needed some extra guidance. Honestly, I would have appreciated extra guidance even though I didn't necessarily need it. I think that our work would be all the richer with talking it over in a colloquium. Diversity of thought= better work. I spent many hours (20+) supporting other students through their theses instead of spending that time on my own thesis, and while I am always happy to support others, I do not believe that should be my labor. I know that a lot of students have been requesting this for a while, so I implore you to listen to students and to work with them in order to make your department better.",
    "I think seniors would benefit from a more formal colloquium arrangement or other structured essay writing opportunities",
    "I think the senior essay is what you make it. For me, it was a really rewarding experience. Finding a professor who is knowledgeable about your topic or area of interest but also who is invested in your personal, professional, and intellectual growth is key.",
    "The class gave me the freedom to work independently and to receive feedback from my advisor."

Finding a professor who is knowledgeable about your topic or area of interest but also who is invested in your personal, professional, and intellectual growth is key. Other than that, stay on top of any interim deadlines and submit a detailed outline before mid-term.",
