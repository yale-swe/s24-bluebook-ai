   "comments": [
    "A discussion of some of the problems facing humanitarian interventions today, and looking towards the past for lessons.",
    "Yes -- highly interesting syllabus that involves the study of international law and its direct application in the world, with many historical and contemporary case studies considered. Prof Zinn makes everyone participate, and it is a relaxed atmosphere so class discussion is usually quite vibrant.",
    "Good intro to issues surrounding interventions.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's an interesting topic and the workload is minimal.",
    "Just a really cool class. It will open your mind to what's really going on in the world, and will help you appreciate how privileged we are and how good our lives are in comparison with the rest of the world.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the material.",
    "Interesting readings, forces you to go outside of your comfort zone and to learn about present conflicts from various angles, chill atmosphere, fun!",
    "Yes. Not too hard. I did not know much about humanitarian intervention going in, and I really enjoyed the class. If one is an expert on the topic, the conversation might seem a little too obvious at time.",
    "Take this course if you want a poli sci seminar that is not a TON of work, but is still interesting. It's not a typical seminar: we were broken into small groups each week to discuss our readings, so those small group discussions were sometimes very engaging and sometimes not. I didn't love this class, but still enjoyed many parts of it and would recommend it. Plus, Dr. Zinn is awesome.",
    "I think Ethics of Humanitarian Intervention was a good course that has a lot of potential to grow as well. The amicus curie brief and the policy brief were strong components of the class since they give students the opportunity to work on a writing style not often found in a standard course. The workload was more than manageable and discussion could be interesting at times.",
    "YES! ABSOLUTELY! Professor Zinn's classes are engaging and active -- classroom discussion\/ group work is strongly encouraged. The work is manageable and you learn a lot! The paper topics were also very interesting. TAKE THIS CLASS."
