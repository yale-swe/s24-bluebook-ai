    "yes- professor Diaz is a wonderful professor to learn SPanish with",
    "Learn a ton and cover tons of topics. Teacher not very helpful. Class taught entirely in spanish.",
    "Prof. Diaz is a total mensch and a wonderful professor. He cares so much about his students that he only speaks to them in Spanish. Try to listen to him speak as much as possible; I learned more from that than from the text book. I love that he only explains Spanish grammar IN Spanish. 50 minutes of immersion per day will go a long way over the course of a semester! The work is easy and plentiful, the tests are generous, and class is always animated.",
    "I would, but only if they had taken an introductory spanish course before."
