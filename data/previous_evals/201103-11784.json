   "comments": [
    "The workload was bigger than I expected for a conversation class, especially writing assignments. I do not particularly recommend this course.",
    "Don't take it. You don't learn anything substantial.",
    "A really fun way to improve your conversational ability and knowledge of French culture and the language. I loved this class. It is a lot of consistent work, but interesting and it pays off if you do it.",
    "Absolutely! Take this course before you venture onto higher-level non-language courses in the French department.",
    "A survey course of French culture. You study different units like religion, women's rights, homosexuality, the environment... There is daily homework like watching a film and writing about it, listening to a clip and responding to it, vocabulary exercises, readings, etc. There are no essays or tests. Assessments include 2 oral exams, 1 listening comprehension test, 1 powerpoint project and 4 vocabulary tests. Class is very discussion-based so I think my spoken french improved a lot.",
    "FREN 160 is a general overview of themes in French culture (education, immigration, the environment, etc). Most of the classes revolve around discussion. We also watched 6 films throughout the course of the semester and presented more specific topics in exposes. The workload was greater than I expected for a conversation class (reading for every class, some writing assignments, responses to television clips, 4 vocabulary quizzes), but not too excessive. Mme Pinzka is really nice and enthusiastic and makes the class enjoyable.",
    "Definitely take this if you are at all interested in French culture. Your French vocabulary will improve substantially, and you will be able to discuss many pressing and relevant issues to modern French culture with anyone. The class itself is interesting, well-taught, and Madame Pinzka's energy and enthusiasm will immediately draw you in during shopping period.",
    "I took this course to improve my spoken french, but ended up doing more writing than speaking. The topics are all treated only on a very basic level and if you have been exposed to any French culture study before you will not gain a lot from this class.",
    "Professor Pinzka is an excellent instructor and is very kind. It's a great class to maintain your French, but it's also a lot of work. The class involves a lot of reading and writing assignments; there is homework due every class that takes a couple of hours to complete.",
    "I did not like the structure of this class. It basically centered around vocabulary lists; there are four tests, for which you have to memorize the lists and write an essay using 40 of the words, and for most homework assignments, the task is to write something using as many vocab words as possible. All in all the class felt very... high school.However, my biggest complaint is that every homework assignment was graded not simply for completion, but for accuracy as well. If you made mistakes on your homework (be they grammatical errors, spelling errors, or faults in comprehension), this affected your grade, which left literally no room for error in the course. As someone who has taken several language classes before, I found this policy unbelievable, as making mistakes is an important part of learning a language, and I have never before taken a class where students were penalized for making mistakes in their homework.This course was not what I hoped it would be, and I don't think my French improved very much.",
    "this class is more work than you think it will be, with 300ish-word writing assignments due nearly every day and difficult vocab quizzes. all in all it's a pretty good way to get your language credit done in one fell swoop, but be ready to devote time and energy.",
    "A well-structured introduction to French culture."
