   "comments": [
    "Can be tough, but it can be a nice challenge. Definitely recommend. It can provide you with a solid base for other courses. I'm very happy I took it. Throw out your pride, and get help when you need it.",
    "Even though it was Michael Frame who taught the class, do not expect Math 120 to be a walk in the park. Read the textbook, go to problem sessions. Multivariable means multivariable, and for that it makes it that much harder to conceptualize than single variable calc. Be ready to spend a good deal of time on the homework, and be attentive to when you need help.",
    "Be prepared for the class to get harder as it progresses, but overall, I really liked this class because I had an excellent instructor (Frame). I would say take it, but only if you're at least somewhat interested in math.",
    "Difficult but so worth it by the end! The maths is beautiful when you finally get it!",
    "I think this is a good class to take. It teaches a lot of critical thinknig and logic in addition to just calculus.",
    "If you have to take it, then take it. If you like math, then take it. If not, don't take it.",
    "I really do believe that the professor plays a huge part in how someone experiences this course. The material is difficult, but that's to be expected.",
    "multivariable",
    "Math 120 is very similar to Calc BC but with multiple variables and no sequences or series. I would recommend that you read the textbook ahead of time because otherwise the lectures can be confusing. Math 120 requires good spatial reasoning skills because there is a lot of computations in three dimensions.",
    "Michael Frame is the best. He makes everything clear and the nicest guy. I'm eternally grateful that I had him as my professor. It's a shame that he may not be teaching this course again. That being said, though, the class itself is great. Multivariable calculus is truly beautiful, especially if you like math to begin with. I'm an undeclared major, but this class caused me to consider possibly pursuing math. I would say, take this class if you like math. You will not be disappointed.",
    "Yes. I think Math120 is essential for a liberal arts education",
    "Maths 120 is an excellent class, which will take you through all the basics of multivariable calculus. I personally had it as a complement with Physics 260. If you are looking for a transition course from high school maths to University level maths, this is a fairly intensive, superb class.Professor Frame is one the best teachers, if not the best teacher I have ever had. Not only is he a great teacher, but a deeply compassionate, kind human being. If you have the opportunity to take this class (or any other) with him, I urge you to do it. His teaching style is lucid, relevant and comprehensive.",
    "Math 120 is a very fair and enjoyable course. The class starts out fairly easy and then rapidly gets more challenging after the first midterm. The midterms are pretty fair, although the lack of a curve makes it a little challenging. Also, be sure that you get a good professor. Having professor Frame made the class great, but their are definitely some grad students who teach this course who aren't so good. If you are willing to put in the time and use all available resources (office hours, course tutors, problem sessions) then this is definitely a manageable class where youlearn some pretty beautiful math!",
    "Multivariable is a beautiful form of math because of the connections it brings up between multiple dimensions and the sense of completeness you reach at the end. However, it is difficult towards the end, and it is really only of interest to people who already know they like math.",
    "There are a lot of students in Math 120 that have already taken multivariable calculus - a fourth of our class received a grade of almost 100% on our first midterm - So, if you've never taken it before, like I hadn't, it's tough - making silly or small mistakes on the exams can really destroy your grade... so this is pretty stressful. The material itself isn't incredibly challenging - it's worth it to keep up with it during the semester, and DEFINITELY do the practice exams posted online before the midterms and final. Conceptual understanding is important and helped me keep track of the material, but then a lot of mechanical practice also makes you a lot more confident and yields pretty good results.... I had Michael Frame this semester (I know he's been planning to stop teaching for a while, but I think he's definitely decided to have this past semester be his final one), so my class was great. However, I know a lot of people in different sections who did not have very good instructors and were very frustrated - shop a bunch of the teachers, and fight to get into the section you want... it's worth it to be taught well!",
    "I would recommend Math 120 to another student as long as they are sure that it is the right fit for them. Make sure your placement is correct!",
    "I would. In general, I think that multivariable is a very valuable course, especially for a science or math major.",
    "Great introductory course to college math.",
    "If you get a good professor for it, definitely take it. If you want a greater emphasis on proofs behind problems, try 230. If you get a bad professor or if you want to focus on the physical applications of multivariable, take ENAS 151. Pretty normal workload, nicely paced course.",
    "Only take this if you have to. Seriously, the subjects aren't that terrible, but the problem is the professors--the majority do not make it easy to understand or clear. By the end of the class I realized I was better off teaching myself the information from the textbook. The first exam is easy, second is hard, the final is super challenging.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student; calculus in 3 variables is incredibly applicable to real life, and although the second half of the course throws many new concepts at you, the challenge is worth it.",
    "This is a good class. I would recommend taking it with Professor Frame, however, I think that this was his last semester teaching this class. I would recommend taking it if you are good at math, because the difficulty level increases over the course of the semester and the concepts at the end of the semester are more difficult than at the beginning.",
    "As a potential Econ major, the first half of the course seemed applicable, however the second half focused on concepts only used in physics. Still, if you are interested in math, I would absolutely take this course. Michael Frame himself was an amazing professor who managed to make some complicated material very clear. This course is also good to take if you are unsure about your major and you want to see what it's like to take a slightly higher level of math.",
    "A pretty typical multivariable calculus course--exactly what I signed up for.",
    "This is a terrific course if you have Frame, though the material itself doesn't bring much to be fascinated about. It's standard-fare multivariable calculus. Basically, it just involves taking what you know from single-variable and extending that into cases of multiple variables (obviously there's more to it than that, but that's the idea). Frame has an ability to make this material very engaging. He is inspirational, accessible, and helpful at all times. It is a great course with him.",
    "A fast-paced intro to multivariable calculus, but made wonderful by Frame's teaching. Do the homework to make sure you understand concepts as youGo along, ans get help as soon as you don't understand a concept.",
    "The material is pretty simple, and the book is really good, so it's not too hard to do well. P-sets are easy, and only take an hour and a half at most.",
    "This is a useful course, and is definitely accessible without prior exposure to multivariable calculus.It is crucial to research which teacher to take before beginning, as I have seen amongst my friends that this makes all the difference --- the course can be simple or very time-consuming, depending on the instructor.Also the many practice exams with solutions that are posted for all the exams makes it very viable to score highly, as the question types tend to repeat.",
    "A class that seems geared mainly to the more practical side of multivariable, not for people who have an interest in math apart from its application.",
    "A bit intense, but enjoyable if you want to learn about some more complicated math.",
    "I would highly recommend Math 120 to another student, especially if they have an interest in mathematics and science.",
    "I would recommend this class because I do feel that the skills are useful.",
    "Math 120 is calculus brought to new dimensions with more demand on comprehension of concepts rather than simple application of formulas. I would recommend Math 120 to a fellow student. I feel like first year calculus students often do not understand the meaning behind many of the calculus concepts they learn. While the student can derive and integrate, they may not understand how or why the calculation is done. Math 120 demands the students to understand the why as well as shows students the potential applications of the calculus in the real world or in other fields, e.g., physics.",
    "The material is difficult in itself if you are not properly prepared. If you're in between MATH 115 and 120, go with 115. Otherwise you'll have to work much harder to keep up in class. Homework is good for going over your notes. Michael Frame made the class easy to take and had a very nice, concise way of teaching."
