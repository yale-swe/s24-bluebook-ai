   "comments": [
    "Assignments for this course are very helpful and informative Lecture format has a limited value add This class could benefit from a final project or paper instead of exam",
    "While recognizing the challenges of teaching large lecture course that needs to cover a lot of content, slogging through powerpoint lectures were challenging. I appreciated the attempt to include a more interactive assignment with the nuclear power debate and that was my favorite class. I would restructure the way the written assignment is designed - 5 people writing a 1,200 word essay meant that I spent far more time on communicating and coordinating with my group than working on class content. I also appreciated the few guest lecturers who shared their research.",
    "course topics did not seem to flow together as well as they could have",
    "Weakness: too many guest speakers who are not interesting at all",
    "Strengths: variety in exposure to many environmental health topics. enjoyed the debate activity. Weaknesses: covers too many topics and too much information. A lot of the information that we went over didn't sink in because there was just too much and we never went in-depth into any one topic. The class overall was not very engaging.",
    "The course was a brief overview of many topics in environmental science, I think it would have been nice to have some more in depth lectures and information on some subjects. Regarding the group climate change project, the debate was an interesting exercise, however the written portion of the group assignment was difficult to coordinate 1,000 words between five people, resulting in roughly 200 words per person was incredibly short and somewhat difficult to coordinate. Most previous group projects I have worked in that seem to work well result in presentations, projects, or papers of at least ten pages. Additionally, it did not seem adequate that the homework assignment with the most weight was one with only approximately 200 words per person and required coordination among five people. It may have been more interesting to have a slightly longer paper on a topic of a student's choice, allowing them to explore a topic of interest more in depth than the lecture style allows.",
    "The class structure improved substantially in the last half of the semester. We went from pure powerpoint slide reading to actual discussions. The debate was an incredible idea and should be conducted more than once during the semester. It was extremely helpful. In fact, I learned more from the case study website than I did from any powerpoint presentation. The layout was easy-to-follow. I would reduce the number of simple powerpoint slide lectures and increase the number of creative lectures\/discussions. Also I thought that air filtration system assignment (the second one I think) wasn't effective. It took me 9 hours to write the paper because the topic of air filtration simply doesn't appeal to me. Even after writing it, I honestly wish I knew less about air filters today. It would be helpful to have an option of 1 out of 2 or 3 topics we could write about, like the second part of that assignment.",
    "The powerpoint lectures were very text heavy and the lecturer read directly from the slides verbatim. This discouraged many people from going to class. The lectures did improve at the end of the semester.",
    "Too many things to remember for the exam.",
    "Overall the course was a very broad survey course in environmental health and was effective at covering a broad range of material in a short amount of time. I thought the topics were all very interesting, however, they are largely power-point based and there is not a lot of additional information that comes from sitting in lecture versus looking at the slides. It is a lot of information to digest and lectures can be really disengaging.",
    "I learned a lot!",
    "Strengths: case studies, discussion, available professor and TFs Weaknesses: lots of information, especially words on the slides",
    "The cases were interesting, the variety of the assignments were great, and I learned a lot.",
    "There was a lot of good information in this course, but it seemed very rushed. It seemed like there was a lot of extra detail that was not necessary for this intro class, and I was unsure about which topics I was supposed to focus on when studying. Classes weren't very interactive. I felt like a lot of the topics we covered could have been applied to other areas of interest, but we got bogged down in technical details which kept us from having discussions about the applicability of the topic. I enjoyed the homeworks - they were a good opportunity to expand on what we were learning. I would have enjoyed the class more if this kind of expansion was included during class time. Some of the guest lecturers were good, but some didn't seem to add much to the course. I was not a fan of the final group project. The random group assignments meant that some students were assigned group members who had very little interest in participating, and that made the project harder to get done. It would have been better if we had more heads up about the project and got to choose our groups.",
    "I liked that this class stood out among public health core requirements in not making attendance a graded item. The course could be somewhat improved by refreshing some of the stories associated with the concepts with more recent events and research.",
    "The course is provides a very important background of environmental health which is vital for public health practitioners. All the material covered in the course was new material for me that was not redundant with any previous courses. I learned the most from the assignments. The assignments are very interesting and simple enough that you get the most out of them.",
    "I understand that this course is difficult to teach because it is a lecture course with such a wide breadth. The information in the class was useful and the homework reinforced learning. Having only one interactive assignment (the debate) ended up being futile. It may be better to have discussion sections of this course where debates were more regular and in a smaller format. This could reinforce learning better than one random debate.",
    "The class provides a general overview over environmental health, which I believe was done well and added some contemporary event to make it more relatable. Main weakness if the rote memorization nature of the class - do not think it really helped make students actually knowledgeable on a deep level.",
    "The material in this course is incredibly interesting. However, whether it is because of the lecture format or the way it is taught, it was really hard to become engaged. The homework assignments don't require any higher reasoning skills, just basic research, and points would be taken off for little mistakes like grammar or improper citation. I wish there was an assignment that would require me to think more critically about a topic in environmental health (rather than assigning me a side), and form a thesis, and argue my point. I think the class topic is incredibly important, and I definitely feel more aware of what is going on environmentally, but it is simply not engaging enough.",
    "The course is very interesting and covers a large range of topics over the course of the semester. It gave a small taste of just about everything in environmental health, which I really enjoyed! I would have liked more group work (we had more towards the end of the semester) but overall I really enjoyed the concepts covered in this course.",
    "I think the homework assignments were appropriate and lent themselves to allowing us to learn about the material.",
    "This large course covers a lot of material, so it is difficult to make it interactive, however, the tests should be restructured to focus less on minute details and more on applying important and practical concepts, like risk assessment, etc. Memorizing the ways waste can be disposed of is irrelevant and a poor use of time for the vast majority of MPH students.",
    "This course is required for the MPH, so essentially everyone is there by force. Some of the topics discussed in the class are interesting, but it is not an intellectually engaging or stimulating class in any way. Professor Deziel is a boring lecturer who always seems unsure of herself and what she is saying. The homework assignments were far to simple and required no original thought or creativity. The group paper\/debate was an absolute nightmare--no mandatory class should ever have a group project because people's level of commitment and engagement with the course varies too much. Everything is covered at a very basic level. It might be helpful for future to focus on just a few topics and really go into depth. That way students can get more out of the course.",
    "these are important topics to cover but I found the lecture-style of most course sessions very tedious. if there are ways to incorporate more case studies or debates into the course that would help a lot.",
    "I think the overall contents and the their order is ok, it would be a good introductory course to environmental health if the instructor is more knowledgable. On some of the topics, I don't think Dr. D knows much and were definitely not prepared for students' questions.",
    "This class is great, helps me a lot on understanding the environment and health. This class discussed about broad topics, which I found really interesting and learned a lot from it.",
    "Good introduction to enviromntal epi",
    "I waived the class and don't have a response!",
    "It is an overview of a wide field, so every lecture is a new topic. One of my least demanding classes during my first semester of the program.",
    "Weakness: the PowerPoints! Class lectures followed the PowerPoint slides very straightforwardly, so felt like if there were times when going to lecture wasn't necessary. I also thought this class had such great potential to incorporate current events to class material, but there wasn't much of that. I am taking Health Policy with Jason Schwartz and he begins every lecture with an \"In the News...\" section, where he spends about 5 minutes discussing topics in the News that relate to class material. This was a really effective way for me to piece the material together to current events. Strengths: I thought the climate change debate was an interesting concept. It really helped me get a clear understanding of both sides of the argument. In the class I attended for the debate, there were 3 TA's present. One facilitated the entire debate, one was keeping time, and the other wasn't really doing much. I would recommend in the future, keep this climate change debate as an assignment, and assigning 1 TA per classroom and reserving more rooms. This would allow more opportunity for students to debate - too many students didn't debate and I thought it was a missed opportunity to be more engaged.",
    "Overall, the course is well structured. I'd say I enjoyed the second half of the course more (post-midterm). We talked about a lot recent and relevant topics and had more in class discussion. (Food\/built env.; nuclear power; hydraulic fracturing). Incorporating more recent news and class discussion into the first half of this course would make it more engaging and interesting.",
    "I think the strength of this course is that it provides an overview of the many ways in which the environment intersects with public health issues. But I believe that its overview nature is also its largest weakness. Most topics treated in the course are covered in a single lecture, and this necessarily limits the depth of information covered; little information is covered in enough depth to provide students with concrete tools to apply to practice. It was my impression that by only giving a high level overview of topics, students lost interest in the course. I think the most successful units were ones in which there was either a case study presented or a guest lecturer that focused in on a representative case (i.e. metals and health, environmental carcinogens, indoor air pollution). Personally, I would have preferred fewer topics covered in greater depth, and I would have liked many more readings, especially papers that were either detailed reviews of the subject matter and\/or that presented important case studies that shaped thinking about the particular environment health issue. I also think the course could very much benefit from having small breakout discussion sections, rather than only being lecture-based. If the course was structured around a smaller number of case studies, then discussions might more organically happen. Finally, I found the writing assignments (air pollution and pesticides) to be very constrained there was no opportunity within them to pursue aspects of the topics that an individual might find more related to their interests. Given that this is a graduate-level course, it seems like there should be more freedom for students to pursue their interests as they relate to the course content.",
    "This course's greatest strength was Professor Deziel and the assignments. I enjoyed the challenging but do-able nature of the assignments, and the mixture of qualitative and quantitative material in them. Obviously very few students went to each class, which is not the course's fault. Perhaps if students had \"clickers\" like remotes I've had in Statistics courses to answer questions in real time during lectures, or even answered them via an app on their phone or computer, this could increase lecture attendance and in-class learning.",
    "One of the poorer core classes. The class sessions are pretty useless because most of the content is either general knowledge or not taught well. Time would be better spent studying alone at home. Also, we try to go over so many small things in such a short time we do not get a chance to actually learn anything useful. It could be better to focus on fewer issues per lecture and actually learn useful things rather than speed through multiple small things that no one cares about",
    "strength: give us the whole picture of environmental factors and their public health impact, we can learn much basic knowledge from this class; weakness: there seems no united logic that links each lecture, and each week we change into a totally different topic, when I do the final review, I really feel confused about some contents if I didn't try my best to follow the \" learning objectives\". i think it is not necessary for us to have a close-book\" exam.",
    "It's a super interesting course, and I learned a lot about the basics of environmental science.",
    "Readings: Some of the readings were very good, and some were very off-point. The good readings were the ones that were accessible (EPA website readings) or ones that engaged our knowledge at an appropriate level. Other readings (e.g. reading about sewage management, other very technical papers) were inaccessible and beyond the scope of the class. I actually did read them, but was frustrated by them because they did not expand my knowledge of the subject in any way. Lectures: The lectures were fine. I don't necessarily think there needed to be more discussion-type exchanges in the lectures, because those are extremely awkward in a big room and feel really inauthentic. Lectures that included an example of a case study or environmental health in the news were more engaging, and easier to sit through. Also, a lot of the content, by its nature, is pretty upsetting because it makes everyone who cares about the environment feel terrible about all of the ways we're destroying it. Ending each lecture with real-world examples of changes that are being made (and are successful) would help with the framing of this class. Finally, I understand why there are \"secret slides\" in the class. It's frustrating when most students do not regularly show up for the class. But as someone who actually attended every class, the practice seems petty and unprofessional. If you would like to penalize lack of attendance, design an attendance requirement or something else. This is graduate school, and a more welcoming environment is an environment in which faculty treat us as graduate students. Assignments: Please do not continue group assignments into the future. If it is important to have a class debate about nuclear power, there should be a more nuanced way of going about who participates. Perhaps, those who participate will get extra credit. Or, you first solicit volunteers to participate. For those of us who have a lot of anxiety about speaking in front of a group of people for an entire class, there should be some additional benefits for being forced to participate. If this class is serious about debates in the future, guidelines should be more formal and debate etiquette should be discussed in advance (i.e. no formal debate etiquette allows participants to include new information in a closing statement, because the other side has no opportunity to address it). Finally, there are only four assignments in the class...having the fourth one due in the last week of classes, while simultaneously having to prepare for the final exam, puts undue stress upon students. Guest Lectures: One of the best aspects of the class. It's really interesting to hear about topics from people working in those specific sub-fields!",
    "I really liked the topics covered in this class, especially toward the end of the semester (hydraulic fracturing, climate change mitigation, organic foods etc). I thought the lectures were interesting and the exams were fair and straight forward. Good mix of guest lecturers. Deziel is enthusiastic and sweet. Honestly, my favorite class I took during my first semester here! The one thing I would have changed is the case study. Assignment - interesting topic, achievable length of paper, ample resources. Debate - that's a good idea for something controversial like nuclear energy. Cool. GROUP paper - NO. Never. Everyone has different writing styles, some better than others naturally. What will end up happening is either a paper that doesn't flow or someone who cleans up after the entire paper and that just isn't fair. Also, how come we all had to do the exact same case study? Not a lot of room for creativity.",
    "The course was too easy.",
    "This class needs to be half an hour shorter. The material is typically not that engaging, and dragging it out for 80 minutes did not help. Also, having lectures that are that lengthy twice a week makes it really hard to review the material, since the powerpoints are typically very long. Also, speaking of powerpoints, Dr. D, please stop punishing students who don't come to your classes by making your slides completely useless. I found this extremely rude and offensive, since not only are we not 5 year olds, but it is very difficult to study even if you did attend lecture with such sparse slides. Unless you are going to allow us to record every word you say, you need to actually put text on your slides instead of photos from newspapers. In general, I felt that Dr. D was extremely dismissive of her students, and often would treat us like children, as evidenced by the fact that she would deduct 5 points from our homework assignments if we walked into lecture 3 minutes late. Finally, group papers do not work. Please stop trying to make them work. The \"case study\"\/debate was actually a great idea, and I understand that group work is an important aspect of pubic health. However, trying to get 5 different people to write a clear and coherent paper in two weeks is impossible. Let us work in groups to develop our ideas, but let us each write our own papers and grade us individually. I am really tired of being penalized for the poor writing skills of my group partners (shout out to health policy fall of 2015). Basically, what I'm trying to say here is: someone needs to fix this class.",
    "I really enjoyed the broad spectrum of the curriculum material that was covered by this course. However, I think that this is also this courses greatest weakness. This did not allow for the instructor to go into great detail any individual topic. I think that the exams could be improved. I found them to be exhaustively long.",
    "Although the course is very based on powerpoint slides, exam content varies depending on how frustrated professor is on non-attendance.",
    "Strengths : very informative , talks about lots of things Weakness: many stuff are just common sense, not dug very deep",
    "It covered various topics but none of them deeply. It was unfortunate that some groups were not able to do the debate despite their preparation. This is not the best course at YSPH. It was sometimes interesting depending on the topic.",
    "This is very much a survey course, and if you are already someone who has some familiarity with the intersections of health and the environment, you might want to try to exempt out. However, if you don't know anything about this subject, this class provides a decent introduction to a variety of topics within environmental health. The class can feel tedious if you already know the information, so it could benefit from more specific examples or cases.",
    "This is a good introduction course to environmental health, and the topics covered a broad aspects of environments, but I wish this course could be better structured. Maybe instead of having topics all over the placement, she can try putting similar\/related topics together, and try implementing some basic concepts taught in the beginning of the semesters into later classes.",
    "It was an informative class. Strengths - the assignments allowed us to develop skills and thoughts in environmental health that weren't test taking. Weakness - class doesn't let you advance your field or interests from an environmental health perspective.",
    "Would have loved more social implications of climate change i.e. Refugee crises",
    "The course covers really important and interesting topics, however it is not taught in a particularly engaging way.",
    "The final debate assignment did not seem appropriate for this type of course (i.e. random groups, groups of 5, paper and speech).",
    "We were exposed to a lot of interesting concepts, but we were required to aimlessly memorize them. This was not useful. The interactive assignments and case studies were the most helpful.",
    "It was an interesting class in theory (in the sense that environmental health is an interesting, multi-faceted subject). I think that it was not taught to be interesting though. Many students have a negative approach to the subject and are not interested in learning and do not come to class, which lowers the morality of the professor herself. A lot of lecture time is spend simply going over the slides directly without much added information. And then also bringing in a lot of guest lecturers. I think this course could be better if the focus was more on controversial topics in environmental health based in the topic categories that are already covered. (I guess this would be more like the environmental health justice lecture). In addition the guest lecturers all come in with different ideas on how to present. Some come in with overly technical presentations - if a standard could be maintained that would be nice.",
    "strengths - I liked the topics the course covered and how the homework pushed us to delve deeper into the topics we learned weaknesses - the only one aspect I found unhelpful was the nuclear reactor case at the end of the semester. I feel like it wasn't really based on any of material and the pros and cons were already given to us on the website - it didn't involve much analytical thought.",
    "Because this course is a required course, all students -whether interested in the topic or not- must take it. Therefore, if someone is not interested it makes the class hard to attend to and commit. However, the professor makes an effort to make the topics relevant, to share updated research studies, and current debates. The class could be shorter, or the amount of content could be less, given that a lot of the content given is likely to be forgotten after class, for students who are not interested in them. Some of the lectures however, can be very relevant and interesting. A seminar-like format for the MAIN and most RELEVANT topics would be the most ideal format for this class in general. The assignments are relatively conducive, although depending on the subject they can be uninteresting and become busy work. I believe they could be made in a way that gives more leeway for the student to explore topics of interest, but keeping the same amount of time needed to complete them.",
    "The course material is very interesting but could have been taught in a more engaging manner. All of the assignments except for the nuclear power group paper were helpful to the learning process. I didn't like the group paper because it was difficult to hold my group members accountable. The debate felt awkward and contrived. The intentions behind this assignment were good but I would have rather written the essay on my own.",
    "I enjoyed learning about the various ways in which environmental factors impact health of populations. The guest lectures were fascinating and I left the course with a better understanding of environmental health.",
    "I think the course was a good overview of an extremely broad topic. Since it was more of an introductory course to environmental health, it didn't go very in depth. But I think the professor did as well as one could considering the point of the course. The climate change case study was excellent.",
    "Weaknesses: poor instructor, rote-memorization",
    "good much information to be remembered",
    "This course felt like a high school level class. For one, I think it would be extremely helpful if there were a discussion section. It would also be nice to read more primary literature and to learn more about how to apply EHS to our topic of interest. Assignments would be much more useful and interesting if we could tailor them to our interests. I felt like expectations of students were very low and the information we were learning was extremely basic. I also think it would be great if lectures incorporated more current events and issues into each lecture. For instance, all semester long we were watching the DAPL and Flint controversies unfold, and it would have been great if we could have discussed them in more depth and from different perspectives.",
    "Strengths: Covers a lot of topics related to environmental health. From pesticides to climate change, I now feel that I have surface-level knowledge on a wide variety of environmental health issues. Weaknesses: Poor feedback on written assignments. I felt that sometimes points were taken off just so that everyone would not receive 100% on the assignment. Ex. 5 points taken off because \"paragraph was too long\" Guest lecturers were not always the best and slides from them were difficult to review in preparation for an exam",
    "Thought that the course could be 1 lecture a week that's longer. Lot of material covered, but would rather focus on in topics and themes.",
    "Strengths: interesting material, tried to faciliate discussion Weakness: timing",
    "This course was not of graduate quality. It felt more like a high school course -- trying to do too many things at a surface level. There was no room for creativity or critical thinking by students. Environmental health is such an important discipline, but I do not think this course structure does the topic justice.",
    "Strengths- the topics we covered in this course were interesting and important to understand from a public health perspective. Weakness- I did not enjoy memorizing material for exams for this course. Did not help me understand the concepts covered in lecture.",
    "Strengths: - I really enjoyed the guest lecturers. It was nice to hear more about their particular fields of research. - The debate. I was skeptical about how it would go at first, given poor experiences I've had in the past with group work, however I found the exercise a lively and engaging way to learn material. The discussions that were had as a result were also very interesting. Weaknesses: - I think because of the early morning timing of the course, the number of people attending lectures decreased over time. I'm not sure how much flexibility there is in changing the timing, but perhaps moving lecture to take place a bit later (even by just 30 minutes 9am instead of 8.30am) may help with attendance.",
    "Weaknesses were the format of the lectures - straight powerpoints in which she read directly from them. Also the tests - were memorization of all the material, tiny facts that didn't seem to make a difference in the grand scheme of the course.",
    "It has the culture of being an \"easy\" class that other students tells us we should try to test out or exempt out if we can. I don't think that does environmental health justice overall. Definitely interesting topics, but this semester relied heavily on outside speakers as guest lecturers who did not all have the same level of scope and were sometimes too detailed or not detailed enough. Would benefit from more student accountability without infantilizing students. Perhaps would benefit much more from discussion groups rather than only a large lecture hall space. Even TFs themselves were playing games on their phones during lecture - shows the level of disengagement that can happen for this course. Easy class to pass, with many individuals not even ever showing up. Doesn't always gauge understanding and application towards own interests as a survey course - would benefit from encouraging students either through a final project or discussion based outputs to apply enviro to their own interests in public health (health care, social and behavioral, etc)",
    "I really didnt like the course as the material was very basic and not interesting."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D. was a very clear communicator and one of the most effective professors I've seen in using Canvas to ensure students are up to date. I appreciated her attention to detail on this front. Dr. D could improve her teaching style by showing more confidence and energy. A lot of the content covered in the course could be made quite compelling, but the class felt more like a pure information transfer.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Weakness: the lecture is all in the slides and she just read of the slides without any further illustrations",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Nicole is very nice, but doesn't really engage the class the way we need to be engaged at 8:30am.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I think overall Dr. D was a good professor. She is clearly passionate about the topic, however, she could be more confident in her place teaching, which may come with time and practice.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D clearly knows her stuff. She does impressive research and is able to convey information effectively. One improvement would be to command more outspokenness in the classroom. Oftentimes she asked questions and there were crickets (in fact, most of the time). That is, until the content and lecture format became interesting towards the end of the semester and the class finally lightened up a bit. One technique I've seen other instructors use is a random name picked that you can use online for free. Make attendance mandatory (participation as part of the grade) and pick students to answer questions randomly - this may seem like an unappealing method because it might be unpopular with students, but dead silence and lack of emotion in the classroom is worse.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She is a very bad instructor.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Accessible and always reaching out students, she was great and welcoming. Improved lectures throughout the semester. The last few lectures weren't just reading verbatim from the slides, which actually helped me pay attention in class and be more engaged by the material.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0More passion maybe",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I really love professor D. and I wish she had more confidence while lecturing! She is clearly knowledgeable and accomplished and you would expect her to command the room, but she has a tendency to nervously giggle and speak timidly during her lectures, and I think that contributes to people not taking her course seriously\/poor attendance in general. That being said, she is clearly an expert in her field and I enjoyed hearing about her research throughout the semester. I wish she shared more, it would make the lectures and material seem more real and pertinent.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel clearly knows her material and is very passionate about it!",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strengths: caring, knowledgeable, available Weaknesses: nervous at times Dr. Deziel is very knowledgeable so a little more confidence would relay the information with a stronger tone.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0The instructor was great at offering availability and feedback to students. I thought she was really fair.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel is clearly very smart and knows the topic well. She provided us with great, thorough information in each class. I think there needs to be more of an effort to engage students throughout the class. One suggestion would be to try to apply the class topic to other areas of interest (i.e. policy, chronic disease).",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. Deziel isn't a bad instructor, but she set the tone of the class on the first day with a 3 minute diatribe on how to properly address her. This was an outlier in my grad school career and telegraphed an insecurity that in the end felt inconsistent with her intellect and capabilities. It was a confusing beginning to a class that disengaged me.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strengths: The professor explains concepts clearly Weaknesses: The professor can be a little more sensitive to students' circumstances and can try to provide some support",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D is very kind and clearly cares about students. Incentivizing participation through clickers may be useful. Her teaching style was not one that I meshed well with.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D was very kind and responsive to emails. I did not engage with her too much outside of the classroom. Her particular way of teaching was not very suitable to me. I ended up needed to go back and go through all the lectures on my own time because I could not stay focused in class. Maybe a smaller class size would bring out her strengths more as a professor.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I think the instructor was open to answering questions from students.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0great teacher",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel is a nice women, but she is not the greatest lecturer or teacher. Her lecturing style is a bit dry and unengaging, making it difficult to want\/feel the need to go to class at 8:30 am.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Nicole is very organized but could do more to make lectures more interesting (a hard ask for an introductory course like this)",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She is great, the lecture given by her is very clear. She has learning objectives at the beginning of each class, which helped me understanding what she is going to talk in the lecture.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0overall good",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D is an approachable instructor who wants to engage students and see everyone do their best.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I thought Dr. D. was a good instructor. I thought she did a good job of listening to students' requests for more class discussion and really liked the nuclear power debate. She clearly wants to make it an interesting and engaging and I think she's moving towards the right direction.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel is clearly familiar with the very broad range of knowledge about environmental health. She is persistent in her lectures, and works to cover a lot of material. I think that lectures could be improved by continuing to keep the lights on (this happened towards the end of the semester, which was great) because I believe this helps keep people engaged and awake, and also by doing more small group work in lecture.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel is a fantastic professor and brilliant female leader. I thought she did a great job with a cohort that is not necessarily dominantly interested in environmental science since it is a core requirement across all YSPH cohorts. My only advice to her would be to perhaps take more confidence in her work, share more of her own research within lectures and further use her expertise to engage with the class in lectures more.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0First of all, she needs to stop making her speech making people call her \"Dr D.\" It is both cringeworthy and laughable. A lot of professors are respected without having to cry out for it, and when she does that she ironically loses respect from some of the students. She also needs to find ways to make going to class worthwhile. A good number of students stopped going because it didn't add much value. She is a nice person though, so I hope she can find ways to make this class good.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Nicole is very nice, the lectures which taught by her are clear and able for me to figure out key points and basic knowledge, however, some of the lectures given by guest lecturers seems a little like scientific speech or some seminars talk about some environmental issues. and these contents seems difficult to figure out the key point when doing final reviews.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She definitely helped me, when I had a lot of questions about the concepts.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0It was sometimes difficult to disentangle content from teaching style. For most people in the class, the MPH is their terminal degree. Since that is the case, I think it is especially important for the instructor to link the content of each lecture to real-world situations. Empower us as individuals to go out into the world and respectfully disagree with those who do not think environmental health is important. Also, a little bit of candor goes a long way. I think Dr. D was a fine professor, but the class sometimes felt inauthentic. I think not overthinking the presentation of the material is key.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel is a great professor. She is dedicated to her students and really invested in the class. She does a good job at explaining all the information, despite the variety of topics covered in class.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0At the beginning, Dr. Deziel put a little too much on her slides and was reading directly off the powerpoint which she was criticized for mid-semester. I noticed a shift toward the last half of the semester where she would talk more off hand, give examples not on the slides, and put less words and more pictures up. I think this was really great because you could still have the outline of what was happening in the lecture, but take notes on extra details. I thought she was an effective lecture and was enthusiastic and sweet. The only criticism is that Dr. Deziel may have come off a little bit uptight in the beginning of the semester when she emphasized students should not call her by her first name. I think most students default to Professor Deziel or Dr. Deziel out of respect. It may have given a wrong first impression.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She is really nice!",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D, please stop punishing students who don't come to your classes by making your slides completely useless. I found this extremely rude and offensive, since not only are we not 5 year olds, but it is very difficult to study even if you did attend lecture with such sparse slides. Unless you are going to allow us to record every word you say, you need to actually put text on your slides instead of photos from newspapers. In general, I felt that Dr. D was extremely dismissive of her students, and often would treat us like children, as evidenced by the fact that she would deduct 5 points from our homework assignments if we walked into lecture 3 minutes late.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I really enjoyed her enthusiasm for the subject matter. I found her energy to be infectious and kept my interest in the course.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Fine. Could have more in-lecture interactions and more interactive lecture exercises.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Prof Deziel is nice",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She is able to navigate discussions well and ask insightful questions. I am unsure why she feels the need to be called doctor, where all faculty are MDs and PhDs at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Most of the class was taught by guest lecturers and when Prof Deziel was questioned about some of the information in her lectures she stumbled over explaining intricate details.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Nicolai did a good job of presenting the material in an informative and straightforward manner. It would be helpful if the course were a bit more interactive though, as the lecture format can be a bit tedious.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She is good at explaining the concepts. She seemed not familiar with some of the topics covered in class, and sometimes she will read through slides, her teaching style may need some improvements.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Good professor - willing to help. Strength - knowledgable on subject material through research and provided various avenues for us to learn - speakers, assignments, debates. Weaknesses - difficulty with answering some questions and unraveling certain environmental health subjects.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Puts a lot of effort into the class",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0It's not Dr. Deziel's fault, usually, but ugh this class is dry. She's very kind and passionate, but she sometimes babies us a bit.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D covers a lot of important ground in this course, however I felt a lack of enthusiasm for the material on many occasions, which made it hard to stay engaged. Although the content of this course was very interesting, it wasn't a particularly engaging course.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel appears to be very smart, but it seems that she is still finding her way as an educator. She often seemed a bit discombobulated. She also has a habit of omitting a great deal of information from her slides. This makes her lessons difficult to follow.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I know you are passionate about environmental health given your work on fracking, but I think this passion is not so obvious in class. If you could find a way to show the passion through your teaching, the class would be amazing, I am sure. Also, I think that this class has a bad rep among professors and students, that no one is interested in teaching or learning. Don't be afraid to show your passion for environmental health. This appears to be one of the smaller departments at YSPH but it is insanely important because of its relevance across public health (and healthcare for that matter). Show the students that it matters (or if a new professor teaches this next time, help them show the school that it matters because it REALLY does).",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0I really liked how Dr. Deziel emphasized certain topics and made it clear she valued student input.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0In my opinion the professor was very good within her limitations (it is a very introductory course). She was realistic in what she expected students to learn and therefore the content she tested in exams. Although not the most enticing topics, the professor was good at trying to make the topics relevant and current.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel is very kind and very receptive. I think class would have been more engaging if the lecture slides had less writing.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel is a wonderful professor who is passionate about environmental health. She tries to make lectures and assignments clear and concise, and she responds promptly to student emails. The class could be improved by increasing the number of interactive activities and revising the assignments so that the grading is more transparent. The assignments appear to be graded on a rubric but students are not aware of such standards under after the assignments are returned. For the group climate change assignment, it may be a better idea to make it worth less than the midterm and final exam because group grades may not be representative of individual students' efforts. Having it represent such a significant portion of students' grades can be stressful.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0The instructor was very open to feedback and made herself available. The lectures were clear and well-organized.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0She responds well to email. She is a poor instructor.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Lectures did not feel very engaging. It felt like slides were being read, and the information on the slides was extremely basic. Class didn't feel dynamic or engaging. I know it is difficult to do that in a large lecture, which is why maybe having discussion sections would be a better structure for the course. Maybe using a case study for each topic to apply some of the content we were covering could be a better way for us to learn about topics both more in depth and in a way that can help us be better researchers in our own fields of interest.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strengths: Professor seemed approachable and genuinely interested in the topics Weaknesses: N\/A",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor clearly was interested and had good understanding of material. Tried to facilitate discussion and have other than exam assignments. Lecturing style was a lot of reading off of slides though..",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Dr. D is smart and passionate, but this course does not allow her to show these qualities in an effective manner. Her lectures involve reading off of the slides, rather than engaging with students in a manner that should be expected of graduate level education.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Strengths- Dr. Deziel did a good job of adjusting her material based on the feedback we gave her throughout the course. Weakness- Dr. Deziel hesitated answering questions we asked throughout lecture, but overall she was responsive as an instructor.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Professor Deziel is very knowledgeable and gave lectures that had clear objectives and therefore were easy to follow. She balanced lecturing with discussions I think having more opportunity for discussion in the future design of this course would facilitate learning even more. This is more of a stylistic preference, but slides could sometimes be a bit text-heavy and difficult to absorb; one suggestion would be to make them more succinct.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0Weaknesses were her presentation skills, directly reading from the powerpoints it was hard for us to engage in the lectures. The tests were more focused on minute details of the lectures I felt were not as important as the big picture ideas we should be getting from the course. She was also not very flexible with students, so concerned about formatting and grammar in our homework assignments, instead of content. But as a positive she really did try to turn the course around with the numerous guest lecturers who came in to speak and the new project about the nuclear plant. The project got us to interact with other students and dig deep into the topic which I found interesting.",
    "Instructor: Nicole Deziel \u00a0By setting the tone on the very first day with first words saying that she prefers not to be called Nicole and that we must call her Professor or Dr. certainly sets a power dynamic that many students find to be infantilizing. Often the instruction in the course seemed remedial or not at a grad school level. Instructor would benefit from improving professional slides - many typos that were repeated from last year's lecture slides even, as well as improvements on public speaking could prove to ask students more engaging questions to spark discussions instead of silence. That being said, I do think she fielded questions well as sometimes classmates could get very detailed and intense. Her youth as a faculty shows - I would suggest trying to restructure the class to include a discussion section to integrate more assignments like the climate change activity. I did appreciate the assignments and felt I learned greatly from them actually, despite being annoyed with the assignments at first. I feel they had a great deal of value. I also really appreciate the instructor's application of environ to current and relevant issues like Flint and Climate Change - this is one of the only courses (sadly, YSPH) which actually addresses current public health challenges. For that, I have been very grateful from Professor Deziel."

   "comments": [
    "interesting, but I feel like I didn't actually learn anything",
    "Overall, an easy course, but don't expect to get a lot out of it. It will give you some exposure to MANY environmental health topics.",
    "The course provides a broad overview of many different topics in environmental health. It does not give much opportunity to dive into any one particular topic. It is not particularly difficult and was not my favorite course, but may be of more interest to someone with a stronger interest in environmental health.",
    "If the class structure moves toward a more creative format, I would highly recommend the class to fellow students. The content is so important to know for all of us, regardless of our concentration, but I thought the lecture-based\/information-overload class structure took much away from the effectiveness. Make the whole semester look more like the second half of the semester (i.e. debate, opinion discussion like the organic foods one) and you have a great class!",
    "I did not take your course and on parts of the evaluation form, that apparently I must answer, has sections on it that I cannot decline to answer. Specifically the Teaching Fellow Section",
    "I don't like it as I don't think it's useful for my future career.",
    "I would recommend it because it is interesting information and gives you a good basis for environmental health principles.",
    "I exempted out of this class - but it made me select a TF",
    "If you are interested in environmental public health, this is a great class.",
    "Overall, this is a good intro class. It doesn't require too much work and provides a good basis for understanding of environmental health. It's not the most stimulating class, but I think it will improve over time.",
    "This is a required course, which is unfortunate. At YSPH, all required courses should be waved if you have the capacity to do so. It feels very much like the fact that students HAVE to be there to graduate gives instructors a tacit pass on making classes engaging, challenging, and interesting.",
    "The course is provides a very important background of environmental health which is vital for public health practitioners. All the material covered in the course was new material for me that was not redundant with any previous courses. I learned the most from the assignments. The assignments are very interesting and simple enough that you get the most out of them.",
    "Would not recommend. The information in the course is relevant, but the way it is taught is excruciating.",
    "class is ok. mandatory",
    "While this course definitely contains important information necessary to being a public health person, it is not very engaging. The class doesn't require much effort beyond studying the slides before tests and trying hard on the homework assignments. I liked the material and there was little work, but I probably would not take this class.",
    "This course is a good introduction to environmental health. Some of the lectures are boring and seem useless, while others are actually interesting. Everything is covered at a very basic level. The homework assignments are painfully simple and the exams are easy. Professor Deziel is nice but not the greatest teacher.",
    "Not a very engaging course but it does cover fundamental environmental health concepts that any MPH student should be familiar with.",
    "Yes, a very interesting class! I learned a lot from it!",
    "RECOMMENDATION",
    "I have no idea who my teaching fellow was and I could not tell you what any of them looked like. Never saw them. I don't remember them every speaking in lecture or reach out to offer help during the semester.",
    "This course provides a high-level overview of many topics relevant to environmental health and the intersection of public health and the environment. I would not recommend it because it covers many topics in a cursory way and there is not the opportunity to pursue your own interests in the context of environmental health. I would instead recommend that students pursue the specific environmental health topics of their interest in more targeted courses.",
    "This is a core requirement and I got much more out of the course than I thought I would. Students should take the assignments seriously, keep up with lecture material and use a high level of effort to get the most out of the course possible, regardless of background.",
    "It's required so you have to take it. Make sure you can find ways to make the most of your experience. For me, I got the most out of it when I decided never to attend lectures",
    "yes, I would recommend. it can help us build basic knowledge on environmental health sciences.",
    "Great intro course about environmental science - would recommend!",
    "I think environmental health is extremely important, so I would recommend taking the class as a survey of topics relevant to anyone interested in public health. I would recommend going to lecture, but I would not recommend doing most of the readings, as the readings we were assigned were generally not helpful or necessary to do. I would be cautiously optimistic about future semesters...the class has good bones, it just needs some more refinement in its execution.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for the environmental course requirement. It is introductory and straightforward and interesting.",
    "This course sucked, but you have to take it, so why are you reading this review?",
    "You have to take it",
    "Ez honor if you attend every class, but it's hard to attend every class lol",
    "I would not recommend it, but it is a required course.",
    "This is very much a survey course, and if you are already someone who has some familiarity with the intersections of health and the environment, you might want to try to exempt out. However, if you don't know anything about this subject, this class provides a decent introduction to a variety of topics within environmental health.",
    "This class is overall okay, if the structure of the class are improved, I would recommend this class.",
    "I don't have much interest in environmental health, but the various methods of learning allowed me to take principles of environmental health with me after the class ended. Informative class.",
    "Lots of work",
    "Fascinating and important content, but dry delivery. If you are a morning person with a previous interest in the topics taught, definitely take the course. However if you are not already interested in the content it will be hard to get excited about this course, although you will learn important things.",
    "In Environmental Health Science, you will memorize a lot of information, which will not be helpful. However, you will learn from the case studies. For exams, you will have to do some extra research on your own in order to learn the concepts.",
    "I would recommend it for people interested in Environmental sciences to take it and I believe it provides you with a good foundation for that topic.",
    "I would recommend this class if given in a seminar format. I believe it has some content that is very relevant and interesting for everyone, and therefore has great potential. However I would not recommend it if current format since it is a lot of money and time and could be spent more wisely in another class which suits the students specific professional interests and skills.",
    "i took this course because it was required. Although I did learn quite a bit about environmental health, I felt the course was relatively dry and somewhat disorganized at times. Going to class did not always feel rewarding (especially because it was at 8:30am) and the assignments\/grading can be a bit vague. With that said, this class did not require a lot of work so overall, it was fine.",
    "You have no choice but to take this course--but you probably won't like it.",
    "good",
    "Broad overview of environmental health topics. If you have the opportunity, I would recommend taking a Forestry course instead of this course.",
    "good introduction to environmental health but glosses over a lot of material (out of necesity to cover all that is needed to) a lot of lecture but necesary overall course",
    "A broad overview of environmental health topics. Overall, the topics are interesting but the way they are taught takes away from their relevance.",
    "This course provides a very good overview of environmental health topics, all of which are relevant but felt even more pertinent given the current political climate. Good gateway into other courses on environmental health should you be so inclined to take later on in your school career. Professor Deziel is super approachable as well as knowledgeable. Primary downside is the timing of the course.",
    "Fundamental course required on environmental that presents the surface of many environmental health problems but not taught in a very intuitive way. Hard course to teach but if one decides to dig deeper into the topics on their own, you will get more out of the course than expected.",
    "This is a required course, although I would elect to try to test out or use a syllabus to exempt out and opt to take a class at the forestry school instead if interested in environmental sciences. This is not one of the strongest courses despite the interesting topics discussed. Just not implemented very well. But you have no choice - it's a requirement."
