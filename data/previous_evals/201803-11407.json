    "I really enjoyed this course--it was a rapid run-through of how Islamic and postcolonial studies scholars have taken on the questions of what Islam is, how it is understood as being in crisis, and what the responses to it tend to be. I was strong on the postcolonial studies bit, but I still learned a lot, and found the Islamic studies material very informative."

   "comments": [
    "This course is well-organized, after a traditional graduate course fashion. It was also bizarre in terms of composition--it was a very small course and majority White American. Perhaps the former was a strength and the latter a weakness, if only because it meant spending many valuable minutes laying the cultural foundations necessary to understand a given concept (not Professor Grewal's fault)."

    "Yes! I recommend this course highly--frankly, there are few courses at Yale that interrogate postcolonial studies so broadly, and it was tremendously informative.",
    "Absolutely. It was a uniquely good experience because we had a very small, engaged class, but the subject is fascinating and challenging. The syllabus was unlike any other I've had in a class at Yale, and learning from Professor Grewal was a joy every week."
