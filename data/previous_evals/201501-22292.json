   "comments": [
    "The style\/format of this lecture course was not my favorite, but the subject matter is so interesting and so important that it makes up for that. I think everyone should take this class just to have a better understanding of what is happening in the Middle East today and why it has come to be that way.",
    "This is a great foundational course for anyone who wants to better understand how today's Middle East came to be.",
    "This class was a wonderful class and presented a good survey of the Middle Eastern region covering Iran to Algeria and Turkey to Yemen from the period of the late Ottoman Empire (c. 1800) until modern times. It discusses major turning points in history and how these have influenced modern times. In all, it put into perspective events that have occurred in the past 20 years based on a historical framework. While it does not focus on modern movements so much, it gives necessary background information that is important for understanding current events and the actions of Middle Eastern governments and Islamist movements. Professor Bsheer is very knowledgeable on the topic, and while he class is very no-nonsense and covers a lot of material very rapidly, I thought she did a good job of presenting an unbiased framework of the history of the Middle East that challenges many narrow viewpoints that have been used to explain this history in the past. The amount of reading is significant and synthesis of the topics in concise ways challenging, however I think this course is essential for anybody interested in the Middle East, whether professionally or out of curiosity.",
    "Good course for its attention to a humanistic understanding of the history. It's the only one of its kind at Yale--all others are political from the Western point of view. Bsheer is also interested in historiography, because the field is still going under much change.",
    "A great class about a fascinating part of the world.",
    "Sub par class. Bad lectures. fairly dry readings. the TA's are good though. not a lot of work.",
    "The strengths of the course are that it presents Middle Eastern history as the product of its own intellectual and political history INTERACTING with foreign influence, as opposed to passive subjugation by Western powers; that it focuses on history, not policy; and that you learn a lot. Unfortunately, the lecture format isn't great. There's virtually no time for questions or discussion. Also, WAY too much time is spent on the Ottoman Empire. The truly \"modern\" Middle East is sort of an afterthought (albeit an afterthought that dominates the final exam). Prof. Bsheer is brilliant, but not approachable.",
    "A disappointing class with an unreasonable professor.",
    "While I did feel like I got a good overview of the history of the Modern Middle East, I think that this class felt too much like I was skimming the surface of everything, particularly towards the end. I think the lectures could've been much more better structured, such that they did not just feel like a summary of the Gelvin book. They should've been much less fact-based (we could learn this on our own) as opposed to centered around a particular image, a particular moment or an artifact, or argument, and discussed during lecture how that was relevant to the history of the Modern Middle East.",
    "I would take this if you're looking for a better background on the Middle East.",
    "The Making of the Modern Middle East is all that you ever want in an overview of the region; although nothing goes too in detail, you leave with a general knowledge that gives you a foundation for understanding the Middle East today. Because of the course, I am now even considering a major in Middle Eastern Studies, but you certainly do not have to be a history or Middle Eastern Studies major to take the course. It is accessible to all, and Professor Bsheer ensures that every student has the resources to succeed. She can be tough, but it is certainly worth it. Professor Bsheer is the type of teacher who can change lives, and I would not have traded this class for anything. Even if I got a D in it, I would still be happy to have taken it because of all that she taught me about the Middle East, about academia, and about the world today.",
    "Take HIST 344 if you can! It is one of the most interesting courses I have taken at Yale, and I learned so much about this special region in the world and discovered many alternatives to seemingly obvious conclusions. Be prepared, however, for a pretty heavy load of reading and writing (granted that the reading is really fascinating).",
    "Good class!",
    "I would be cautious taking this course unless you have taken history courses before, it is a lot of material and expectations are not obvious for students who have not had exposure to history before. I would recommend this course for students who fare well in lectures with limited resources (PPP's were sometimes aiding the lecture and sometimes not present). Professor Bsheer has some very set viewpoints on some subjects that she is teaching, which is important to keep in mind.",
    "Great survey course, esp as a ROW credit for the history major. Interesting material and straightforward workload, and taught in a very engaging style.",
    "yes!!!",
    "One of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Challenging and rigorous, but absolutelty crucial for any student who wants to claim any kind of knowledge about the history of the Middle East withtout the biases that are usually associated with the region in America. Professor Bsheer holds her students to an extremely high standard and you can't avoid any lectures, but it was completely worth it.",
    "~100 pages of reading a week, 5 pg response paper, 10 pg midterm, 2 hr in class final (IDs and 2 essays). After taking the class, I not only understand how the Middle East was made, but also feel like I myself made it.",
    "Very hard- lots of info- so interesting and relevant- if you take it you MUST keep up with the reading even if you take it credit D.",
    "Professor Bsheer= amazing. Take this class. I had several epiphanies about the Middle East. I'm writing this evaluation from Jordan, and I can tell you for a fact that I'm viewing this country differently now. Take. this. class.",
    "Excellent overview of Middle East history from late 17th century to the present, with a focus on the Ottoman Empire and the creation of the modern state system in the postwar era. Challenging but rewarding.",
    "Good class, but not easy. Great credit d",
    "This lecture is a great historical survey of the middle east. The lectures move very quickly- you can't come to class and expect an easy, laid back lecture. However, while exam preparation is extensive, I gained a lot from the course. It was worth taking.",
    "HIST 344 is a history class that claim to cover Middle Eastern history from just before 1800 until the Arab Spring. While that is technically true, it does not cover all of that time equally. The class spends a tremendous amount of time on the late Ottoman and early Qajar empires and the post World War 1 era. While all of these periods are very important and, in isolation, there is nothing wrong with devoting a lot of time with them, it did result in very little time spent on the Middle East from the 1950s and on, and I would very much like to learn about that. I also have very mixed feelings both Professor Bsheer. She is an excellent Professor, but sometimes her lectures felt very robotic. Also I found that she was sometimes unnecessarily stubborn or even just rude. The assignments throughout the class were also very hard, and the final was given an incredibly short time limit which made it very, very difficult. But even with that, I would recommend this class to a student that wants to learn a lot about the Middle East between 1800 and 1930, and only a little after that. I would also warn them about the hard assignments, and the sometimes unpleasant professor."
