   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student because it's a good start to Yale and teaches you crucial skills for writing at Yale.",
    "If you're interested in climate change, this is a great way to get a writing credit. I thoroughly enjoyed the class.",
    "English 114, especially this section, was a really interesting and in depth class on not only the suject matter but also on how to write a proper college level essay. The class was difficult since we wrote a total of 5 papers in class but as long as you keep up with the readings and assignments then you should be fine. Take advantage of writing conferences and office hours in order to write a proper and excellent essay.",
    "Interesting topic, though much more academic than what the course title makes it seem like. There are some difficult readings and the concepts are sometimes hard to grasp, but in the end I learned a lot and improved tremendously in my writing. Would recommend to a friend.",
    "For a student interested in science its good for fulfilling a science credit. I can't really compare it to other English 114 classes but I've heard great things about some of them. I definitely would recommend taking an English 114 class if the student wants to improve their academic writing.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to another student. It gave me eyeopening insights into aspects of climate change that I had previously not considered and I feel like my writing has improved a lot. Its also a great way to explore the resources at Yale."
