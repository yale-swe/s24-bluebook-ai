    "I learned about Riemann Sums, different forms of integration and parametric functions.",
    "How to solve integral calculus problems.",
    "I learned the Fundamental Theorems of Calculus and how they relate to solving problems in calculus. I learned to apply advanced skills in algebra to solve complex integration and series problems. I developed a new perspective on math and find it fascinating.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge regarding how to think about math and how to approach a broad variety of math topics and problems.",
    "I developed deeper understanding of calculus.",
    "I finished the second portion of basic calculus.",
    "My analytical skills improved, and my thought processes were pleasantly challenged, and I ended up liking math even more",
    "Math problem analysis.",
    "Learned how to interpret, find and understand integration. learned integration techniques. learned about series convergence and behaviour, and polar coordinates.",
    "I acquired a greater ability to model the physical using math.",
    "By taking this course I gained a greater understanding of calculus. I also gained further problem solving skills as well as skills in building new material on material previously known."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are the practice tests provided for exams and the practice problems offered for the psets. It could be improved by holding more helpful review sessions that show examples of the different topics that will be on the exam while also explaining how to do the examples.",
    "Great course. One strength is that the tests are very fair and not designed to trick students.",
    "Strengths: well thought, solid curriculum, the assessments were challenging but fair Weakness: A lot of content felt crammed. Possibly felt this way because my session met T Th instead of M, W, F.",
    "There werent many weaknesses to this course! Math is always tough to teach, but I really appreciated the way the course was taught and the way the exams were structured.",
    "Strengths: my smaller class made it easier to reach out to my teacher for extra help. Weaknesses: the tests were significantly more difficult than anything we ever did in class. They often went beyond what could be expected making it hard to do well.",
    "Review sessions very helpful. However, sometimes my work was graded quite late.",
    "Just the pace of the class",
    "This was a very strong course.",
    "material was taught at an appropriate speed, I feel I learned a lot this semester.",
    "The exploration assignments are a great way to introduce concepts before class. The problem sets are appropriately challenging, and if completed with sufficient focus, they act as good practice for the exams. The only suggestion I have is that feedback from the problem sets would be better received if they were graded a little sooner. Overall, this class was very well run.",
    "The strengths of this course were the structure and my professor. I enjoyed how the material was taught first by online videos, exposing us to the new material before the material was taught in class. I also think my professor, Kevin Hart, did an excellent job teaching the course. He explained the course material in a very clear manner and provided the class with further resources for practice. The only weakness of the course was that the online quizzes were given on new material and often difficult to understand (but even this was remedied by giving students several chances to retake the quiz)."

   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this course to people that need it to fulfill a major requirement or because of premed\/prevet.",
    "Yes, the class is slightly fast paced but the tests are very fair.",
    "Definitely. It teaches you to think through math critically and conceptually.",
    "I wouldnt necessarily take this class for fun, but if you have been exposed to calculus before, it shouldnt be a super tough course. It was not super enjoyable, but depending on the professor, you could really learn a lot!",
    "Yes if they need to take math for later prereqs.",
    "How you do in this class really depends on which professor you get so if you get a great one, you have a better chance of doing well.",
    "Yes, the professors and TAs are good.",
    "If you must",
    "I would, I really enjoyed it.",
    "yes, but dependant upon the instructor. my instructor was amazing but I can see how this would be very hard and challenging with out a great instructor.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students. The concepts discussed are generally very visual and applicable to the physical world. It is difficult, but appropriately so. After mastering the techniques through sufficient practice, this difficulty is seen as a positive. It becomes an obstacle conquered.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course content was very engaging and so was my professor. The class was one I looked forward to and one in which I enjoyed learning new material."
