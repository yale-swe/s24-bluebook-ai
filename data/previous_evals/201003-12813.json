   "comments": [
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this course to anyone who's interested in reading some of the most important religious texts in the Asian tradition.",
    "You have to committed to doing the admittedly substantial amount of reading for the class to get anything out of it. It's really the best part - you get to read so many great things, and you're really missing out if you don't keep up. Plus, it makes discussion actually interesting for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Very well taught, but if you are not interested in the topic do not waste your time! About 100 pages of reading a week, a reading response, and a midterm and final paper; so it depends if you are willing to put the time in to make class discussions worthwhile.",
    "AMAZING, AMAZING COURSE. TAKE IT.",
    "A general survey of primarily religious texts of the three countries. I would recommend it, although I think it would probably come best after other courses that teach the basic tenets of the Asian religions or societies. As somebody with no background, I often felt like I was missing out on theopportunity to draw larger connections between the texts and the religions\/societies they represented.",
    "Alright, I took this course based on unanimous positive course evaluations from past semesters. Let this eval be the devil's advocate review. The course did not quite live up to expectations. It was disorganized from the very start (the syllabus didn't have the professors' names or office hours or anything, for instance). The structure of the seminar was forced and unnecessarily intimidating. The professors liked to go around in a circle, in order, calling on everyone. I think this is a huge pedagogical mistake. You should only cold call students at random if no one has anything to say, or if they've been quiet for most of the class. Or better yet, maybe they can adopt a law school style system, where certain students will be on call to be cold called for a given class, and can speak as they want to during other class sessions. This added unnecessary stress. I would also like to stress that the dynamic of the class depends quite a bit on your fellow students. This year, the course was filled with obnoxious former DSers and politicos who came in to put everyone else down, hog the limelight, and impose Western culture onto our readings of traditional Indian, Chinese, and Japanese works. I have no reason to suspect that past years didn't have a similar composition. Finally, do not be deceived - this is a Religious Studies course. Don't be fooledby the HUMS course number. Everything will be read in the context of religion. However, the professors will never quite articulate what they expect from a sound religious studies paper. Expect arbitrary grading. Take at your own risk - this style of course may turn out to suit you very well, or maybe not. Decide for yourself.",
    "If you have any curiosity about the major eastern religions, definitely take it.",
    "This is a great course for anyone whose education has been too Eurocentric. The ideas and the words themselves are moving and exciting. It is also an excellent complementary course to Directed Studies, so I would recommend it to all DSers out there. Although there is not much written work, there is an extraordinary amount of reading that you had better do if you don't want to sit embarrassingly silently through section (the professors will notice).",
    "I would recommend this course for those needing a RLST requirement and don't want to take a lecture version. This class is much more engaging and diverse.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is structured so that Prof. Granoff (teaches India portion) or Prof. Shinohara (teaches China\/Japan portion) give a quick introduction to the work and its importance, then you generally go around the room picking out and discussing important passages. Because of this structure, you get what you put into the class. Both professors are brilliant and put a lot of work into the class. The work load isn't heavy -- about 100 pages a week, a 2 page weekly response papers, and a 5-7 midterm and final paper.",
    "If you are at all interested in East Asia, take this class. You won't find a better introduction to the field at Yale. Both professors are tremendously talented and approachable. There is a lot of work, but it's not unmanagable.",
    "This is a really interesting class. It's a heavy reading load of sometimes dense, obscure, inaccessible material. But, if you're interested in ancient Eastern texts (think of this is an Eastern D.S.), then you'll love it. The two professors (a really cute married couple) are both amazing at what they do, extraordinarily knowledgeable and able to guide you through the material. Our class was a little too big to have really great discussions, and sometimes the readings were so hard or extensive that I felt I got nothing out of them, but overall I really enjoyed looking at such fascinating and, to me, obscure and exotic texts.",
    "A comprehensive exploration of some of the most influential texts to come out of the Far East in the past several thousand years. I would recommend it to those students seeking to better understand the Eastern religious tradition and its evolution.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! This is an amazing class that teaches the closest thing to the Eastern \"Canon\" as possible. There is a lot of reading, be forewarned, but much of it is really enjoyable (lots of Indian and Japanese epics). Everything isn't about Aristotle and Socrates...",
    "If you want a good introduction to the great works of Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, Mahayana Buddhism, Jainism and a bit of Hinduism with Genji and Heike thrown in too, go for it. The teachers are great and the works are too.",
    "Introduction to many great pieces of literature\/philosophy from India, China, and Japan. It is a survey, and moves very quickly and some texts are so different from western books that you might miss them altogether. But it was a great opportunity to make a completely foreign world come alive. I definitely couldn't have gotten anything out of these books without taking this class. Writing the papers every week can be somewhat time consuming, and our discussions weren't very good, but the reading made up for that. Also, the professors let you know about related performances\/conferences\/field trips related to the material, and occasionally integrate them into the class, so it's more like a DS experience (if you want it to be) and not just a literature class."
