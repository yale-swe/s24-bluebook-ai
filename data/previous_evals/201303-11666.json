    "DONT TAKE IT! Not the fun game theory class you'd expect it to be. Look at other QR\/ SO classes that at least do justice to one of the two designations. This one doesn't do justice to either. Neither will it satisfy your math curiosity, nor greatly enhance your social science understanding.",
    "Good course for a QR, but often frustrating only because I'm not necessarily used to that way of thinking. But on the whole, relatively easy, and important to know.",
    "It's like the main game theory, but smaller. A challenging class, especially if you're not used to doing econ, logic, or other QRs. That said, the exams are manageable and there is help available if you need it.",
    "Take this class as a fun and easy fifth if you're a science major looking for an SO. Or, take this class as a political scientist looking to add some (mathematical) rigor to your studies. Either way, you'll enjoy Professor Beim and gain a new perspective on competitive behavior.",
    "It's just what it sounds like in the title, so no summary required. I would recommend it to another student because it teaches you an interesting and different way of thinking, is engaging in lecture, and it isn't too much work outside of class.",
    "Tests were very easy. Psets were kinda difficult. Sectional is optional. Professor is nice and a good lecturer. Class always ended early. Pretty easy class if you're at all quantitatively inclined. Especially because the class is full of poli-sci majors that can't do math.",
    "Solid introduction to game theory. Problem sets could be quite challenging but if you love applied math like I do you should be fine. As a freshman more interested in math than politics but looking for that SC credit, this course was a great choice. The tests were fair. Again this is coming from a math person.",
    "No way~~~at least not with this professor.The material was interesting but I would take it in another department or with a different professor...",
    "Take it if you need a QR and don't want bullshit. Work for your QR a little. Learn to think about the world a little differently if you're more of a humanities person.",
    "I found PLSC 344 to be a very interesting class. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is: political science, math, probability. It is certainly very logic based. It's very cool to see how game theory can be applied to different situations, allowing us to better understand the people involved and the outcomes that occur. For example, who knew game theory could be applied to understanding the fiscal cliff?! The political applications of this class were not as emphasized as I had hoped, but still an interesting class all the same.",
    "This class has a lot of great material that's all interesting to learn, but it was run in an unbearable fashion and I would strongly recommend against any student ever taking it. I'm just going to copy and paste what I wrote for my Professor evaluation.The biggest and most fundamental issue with the course was that in her effort to not tell us the answers on the problem sets, we were forced to learn the material completely before it was taught to us. It made the lectures a complete waste of time. The second issue was that it seemed the problem sets had yet to be tried by anybody. There were often extremely vague questions or mistakes on problem sets that were followed up by \"Oops, sorry\" after hours of pulling my hair out. They would also sometimes take 15 minutes and sometimes take 10 hours and there was absolutely no way to tell which was which--they didn't get progressively harder, it seemed like the designers of the PSet. One of the questions on the final was literally the worst question I have ever had on any examination in four years at Yale. I was in complete disbelief that whoever built the test selected that problem to account for what? 10% of our total class grade? And lastly, and most frustratingly, PLEASE just be straight with us about the grading. Was section graded for participation or not? My final understanding was that it wasn't, but it was impossible to get a straight answer out of Professor Beim (or the TAs). This is the type of stuff that's just impossible to deal with as a student--not knowing how long my P Set is going to be, not knowing how I'm being graded, not knowing anything on the problem set because it hadn't been taught in class, and etc.This is nothing personal about Professor Beim, I think she was very nice and approachable, but this course was really poorly run in all the ways that make life difficult for a student.",
    "This course definitely has the potential to be an outstanding course. The subject material is interesting and approaches long-standing social and political science questions in a unique way. Professor Beim is very enthusiastic and receptive to questions, and her love of game theory is manifest.However, the lectures tended to lack organization, and the textbooks used in the class were not accessible, requiring a degree of math knowledge that the average undergraduate and non-math or economics graduate student almost certainly does not possess. The textbooks also lacked example problems that were of the same difficulty level and type that we did in class. Questions on the problem sets often required additional knowledge beyond what was covered in lectures and discussion sections, but discussion sections tended to end up repeating what was done in lecture.In general, I find that the best way to master a solution concept is repeated practice - solving a number of different examples enables one to master the algorithm in question. However, because we only had a few models\/examples for some of the concepts we were expected to master, attaining mastery and confidence in applying the problem-solving techniques we were taught in lecture was difficult. Additionally, the grading of the problem sets tended to be uneven based on the TA, and it was not always clear what the TAs' expectations were prior to submission of problem sets. Not ever receiving the solutions to the problem sets made it difficult to learn from one's mistakes.Overall, this course is a good introduction to game theory, and it is a fairly interesting class that fulfills the QR requirement. I am sure that it will be improved in the coming semesters and years, but until the aforementioned issues are rectified, I can only recommend this course with reservations.",
    "It's a nice class. The problem sets are the hardest part. The midterm and final were nice. If you like game theory, take the class.",
    "I would recommend (and have recommended) this class.",
    "I understand that this is considered an \"intro\" level game theory course, but it shied away from the mathematical side of game theory. That being said, Professor Beim was, for the most part, very clear about explaining a mathematical thought process in less-mathematical terms.PLSC 344 is exactly what the name of the course says it is: Game theory and political science. You will look at the basics of game theory (normal form games, rationality and uncertainty, (im)perfect and (in)complete information, extensive form and Bayesian game, repeated games, and collective choice (Arrow's Theorem). All with applications in political science. In terms of course spread, it covers all the important topics. I would definitely recommend PLSC 344 as a first-term alternative to the now-spring-term economic game theory (ECON 159) if you wanted to do a year of game theory (PLSC 344 in the fall and mathematical game theory, ECON 351, in the spring). Problem sets sometimes had confusing questions (the answers to which the professor frustratingly refused to post online) because the textbooks were unclear (Osborne and McCarty\/Meirowitz), but the midterm and final were both very straightforward and simple relative to the problem sets.",
    "Very interesting class with a great teacher. Take it with Professor Beim. Game Theory is interesting and also has very practical applications to the real world.",
    "A good course in game theory, however, if you take it expecting to cover a lot of real-world applications of game theory to politics and policy, you may be disappointed. We did do a handful of problems and assignments that were applicable to those topics (which were very interesting!), but mostly it was just general game theory. That said, if you know what to expect going in, it's a fine class. The problem sets are manageable, and you're allowed to work in groups. The exams are VERY easy. Professor Beim gives very clear--if not super exciting--lectures, and is always very approachable and helpful when you have questions.",
    "This really was a horrible course. The material itself was not that hard, but it was presented in such a confusing manner. Game theory doesn't have to be so hard as long as thelogical steps are presented clearly, but they weren't in this course.If you're good at math and are looking for an easy fifth course, this isn't it. The math is all super easy if you're a science major, and the material isn't hard, but it's presented in such an illogical and confusing manner. Very frustrating and unsatisfying. Hard in the worst type of way (not intellectually stimulating, but difficult to do well because the course is so disorganized).",
    "A pretty good QR. Overall I would recommend. The material is interesting, and it strays more towards Game Theory and some of the Political Science applications seemed less than totally plausible.Lectures were straightforward, and usually quite clear. The workload is manageable. The problem sets start out easy and ramp up in difficulty by the middle of the term, and then take quite a significant amount of time. The problem sets are often quite confusing, but that's a heads up and not a deterrent, though, since the TFs and Prof were happy to clarify and help. The midterm was easy, the final exam somewhat more challenging.",
    "I found the course worthwhile overall and reasonably interesting, but would not recommend as a QR for non-mathematically-oriented PLSC students--there are less stressful choices out there. In general, lectures were really well-organized and well-presented; Prof. Beim is very kind and does a wonderful job teaching this material, which is enjoyable to study--game theory can be a cool way to teach yourself to think. That said: p-sets were drastically (and confusingly) harder than what was done in class; often the relationship between the theories and concepts covered in class and the questions given on the homework--the rules we needed to apply and then how they were supposed to change in the context of the specific problem--was totally unclear. Grading was erratic and class resources were generally unhelpful--useful assistance tended only to be available in office hours, which could be difficult and unfair from a scheduling perspective (I took this as a fifth course). Midterm was pretty easy; final was a lot harder. If you like playing with numbers, and if you're intuitively good at it, then this might be a course to consider; if not--if you can manipulate rules and equations when explicitly taught to do so but struggle to reason through them independently--then you'll probably be unhappy in this course and might want to look at other options.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this course. On one hand, we explored some really interesting concepts and ideas about how people interact with each other; on the other, some concepts remained hard to grasp at the end of the course because we hadn't gone over them thoroughly enough, and the course as a whole could have been better structured. I would only recommend that you take it if you have a strong interest in game theory.",
    "Only take it if you have experience with game theory. Some problem sets can be fiendishly difficult if you don't know what you're doing.",
    "If you have a background in maths and need a PolySci credit, this isn't a bad idea. Otherwise perhaps look elsewhere.",
    "Take this course if you don't have any background in game theory. It's very focused on theory and doesn't actually explore case studies\/applications as much as it seems like it may. Prof. Beim is fantastic though; definitely not a bad instructor to learn game theory from if you've never been exposed to it before.",
    "This class was a lot of work and quite difficult. The problem sets took hours and the course is not like an introduction. Shop it carefully as it seems much easier at first than it is!",
    "Interesting, but difficult course. Glad I took it.",
    "Game theory is an interesting subject, but the class made the material more difficult than necessary. The problem sets were very complicated due to open-ended assumptions. The tests were fair."
