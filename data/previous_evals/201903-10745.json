    "I learned the vocab and grammar that followed L4.",
    "Managed to elevate my Chinese level from a colloquially conversational level to more advanced, official jargon.",
    "Chns 150 is an introduction to some more formal topics. The material sometimes felt like communist propaganda, but its overall a good course that really helped develop my chinese. Its not all formal the topics are formal, but you get a lot of colloquial vocab too. The course was pretty disorganized as compared to chinese L1 and L2, but its not necessarily disorganized.",
    "Continued to get a hold on Chinese, improve vocabulary, learn new grammar, etc.",
    "This course improved the breadth of my Chinese vocabulary in engaging in conversations about politics, society, and art. In particular, I greatly improved my essay writing skills with expressions and grammar structures, and also gained an interest for ancient Chinese poetry."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the professor was incredibly committed to student learning and was engaging every single morning, the textbook is designed to foster systematic comprehension and set clear learning targets Weaknesses: n\/a, this is a great class (the Chinese department is always fantastic)",
    "Strengths: - course organization - engagement - assessments - faculty Weaknesses: - course materials (course book is bad)",
    "This course is NOT the same sort of clockwork reliability as L1-L4. Projects can kinda just appear even when not on the schedule, deadlines and expectations for quizzes can be a bit confusing, and sometimes you just dont really know what you should be doing. I also sort of miss the frequent presentations and joking around that former Chinese classes had. Maybe this was just my group, but it felt like there was less laughing and more drilling than before.",
    "This is a phenomenal Chinese course - mainly thanks to the professor. We cover each vocabulary word and grammar structure in class for in-context usage. I think the textbook most needs improvement, it can be difficult to find connections between the text and the vocabulary, and would benefit from having them in greater proximity (like vocab words below the text as you go, which is difficult to read otherwise). I greatly enjoyed the essay assignments, and wish there were more frequent oral presentations."

    "Yes, if you've taken L4, I would highly suggest continuing the sequence.",
    "Yes. The Chinese language program at Yale is outstanding.",
    "Yes, take this class with Shen laoshi if shes teaching it. Shes so amazing and cultivates a lively and engaged learning environment.",
    "Ehhh. If you wanna learn Chinese really well, youre better off doing light. That said, youll learn a ton. Watch out for the final thoughits not worth all too much, but was kinda nasty.",
    "I highly recommend this course to students seeking to continue improving their Chinese skills, especially after coming back from a summer abroad program to continue engaging in interesting conversations."
