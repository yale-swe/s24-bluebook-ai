    "If you are interested in studying Hebrew from the beginning, you don't really have a choice but to take this course. I can't compare this class to other language courses here as I have only taken Hebrew, but the grading seemed very fair for a language class. The homework took between 30 minutes to an hour every night, but of course more time should be spent drilling vocab.Overall, I enjoyed the course."
