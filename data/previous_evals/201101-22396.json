   "comments": [
    "I think that this was a great course. It was supper fun and not very intense. It didn't have too much homework and it really game me a new perspective on drawing and art in general.",
    "Yes, it is great. and you don't need to take it credit D. just put in the effort. the difficulty varies a lot with the professor. I think with Will there is a doable amount of work. and he is a good teacher. you will learn how to draw",
    "Art 114 with Will starts out with line drawings (just the outlines, no value or anything complex. First of boxes, then of objects with elliptical attributes). After a few weeks, it introduces line value (how the darkness or thickness of a mark can communicate different things, like a plastic bag vs. a metal stool). Then we eliminated lines and had to communicate everything through shading. We stuck with this for a few weeks, and finally transitioned into facial portraits (of classmates inclass and self-portraits for homework). If you take this class seriously, you should expect 3 hours of homework per week. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class: Will is a fun but constructive teacher, and my drawing improved.",
    "Great teacher, great class. One area for improvement is if the class could have exclusive access to the room rather than having to tear everything down every day. A good question to ask during shopping period would be if the classroom is shared with other classes. A noticeable improvement in drawing skills is much more valuable than, say, a study-but-forget type of course.",
    "Great class; it taught me how to draw, from zero to pretty accurate likenesses! I can draw portraits, people, buildings, flowers, etc. and it looks like something when I'm done. It is hard to get into because of the amount of people who shop it but be persistent and shop every semester until you get in.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning how to draw.",
    "If you want to learn to draw, take this class. It is not too much work outside of class but it it can be frustrating if you are not naturally talented at drawing.",
    "Definitely take this class. Drawing is fun!",
    "Everybody should take \"Basic Drawing.\" It helps you see the world in new ways and gives you a creative outlet.",
    "Sure--it's not a lot of work, and if you're even remotely interested in art or drawing, it's a good course to take.",
    "Anyone with or without a background in art should take this class. It is very refreshing from the other analytic classes, but it really does make you think, in a new and different way. I find that I can appreciate art that I am looking at much more, and I improved my drawing immensely. There is homework, this is not a gut class, and if taken seriously I believe can be incredibly rewarding. I highly recommend basic drawing and will villalongo!!!",
    "A basic introduction to different types of drawing, geared for people with little or no drawing experience. Light workload, and very helpful to the audience it is aimed for.",
    "This is an excellent class, and I encourage anyone looking into improving drawing skills to take this class. I loved it, and I can see the improvement that I made throughout the course. The workload is pretty light (about 3\/4 hours a week dedicated to homework) and the class is really laidback and chill. Villalongo is a friendly instructor who is always ready to give critical advice or push you further.",
    "Good for someone not at all confident about their skills."
