    "Regardless of what some of the other reviews say, I enjoyed this class. The readings are incredibly interesting, and you will definitely get a better idea of what leadership has been defined as at various times. I never realized that political leadership was such a complicated concept until I took this class.",
    "Sure, it's very interesting. The grading is harsh though, so be prepared to have a drop in your GPA.",
    "If you already have a particular leadership case you are interested in, this class will give you the tools to explore it further. The class is just one paper with multiple drafts and you need to lock down a case study topic pretty early. The readings are extremely general so I found most of the academic value in the class through the independent research. Because the readings were so general, I found discussion to be less fruitful. Skowronek is very helpful in the paper writing process though and will help you make a strong argument in your case study"
