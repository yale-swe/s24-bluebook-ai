    "Yes, if you want to learn probablity",
    "Math 241 is an introduction to probability, but because such a wide variety of people take it, it's impossible for the class to delve much into actual theory. This also makes the course move incredibly slowly and focus almost exclusively on numerical computation since so many people are afraid of the word \"proof\". Example: We didn't cover the central limit theorem until the very end of the semester...If you're a math major, it's an easy course to take to get another credit, but you'll likely be bored out of your mind, which is sad because probability theory can actually be interesting. It's not the fault of Prof. Raman; instead, it's just the result of the hodgepodge of students taking the course.",
    "If you're a math major interested in theory, you should talk to the professor teaching the course asap to get a feel for how application-bent it's going to be.Balaji Raman taught this course like a statistics-only class. We did maybe 3 proofs all semester, and all but 1 them was trivial.Now, there IS some interesting theory (not involving measure theory) underpinning all this stuff, but we pretty much never delved into it.As such, the class could be really dry and slow at times. I felt we didn't go over any of the INTERESTING applications of the material, but that might change next year.That said, the problem sets are extraordinarily easy. Exams are easy as long as you know how to solve the range of problems involving the tools he teaches. That can be tricky, as a few problems will come up on the exam that he never really went over how to do; you'll need to practice to make sure you know exactly how to apply which formula when.",
    "This class is good as a probability class. You will most likely find it interesting and enjoy the class if you like probability, but otherwise will probably be bored. The workload is manageable and the exams reflect the material covered in problem sets and class. You also get a note sheet for each exam, which is very helpful.",
    "I would recommend it, the course is nice!",
    "Start off learning about permutations and combinations, then PDFs and CDFs, move on to all different types of distributions (e.g. Poisson, Binomial, Hypergeometric,...), end with the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit theory. I would recommend this class, but beware that it is not easy (and actually pretty tricky). It is extremely useful information to know.",
    "If you are interested in probability and want a thorough understanding of it, then I would recommend this course. We covered: combinations, permutations, conditional probability, certain inequalities (chebyshev's, markov's), central limit theorem, law of large numbers, sums of random variables. If these things interest you, then take the course.",
    "Very interesting class. at the beginning very easy but gets harder toward the end. I enjoyed it a lot. Average amount of work (if you are decent at math it is possible to do all the homework in one night). but the class is very interesting",
    "I would recommend thisclass...some tips though:Probability is all about tricks - the basic concepts are actually relatively easy to understand. I felt we spent a lot of time focusing on the basics and not enough on the little tricks needed to solve probability questions. In other words, too much theory and not enough technique. Some of the psets were thus pretty difficult...But overall, it was a very good course. Enjoyed it. Balaji Raman is a very nice guy and has open office hours all the time. Sometimes, he did make little mistakes in his lectures, which made things hard to follow.I do wish there was more on random walks, Markov chains, and gambler's ruin, which seemed like the most interesting topics.The book was not very good. Didn't explain things particularly well, instead preferring to insert random computer algorithms to answer difficult questions.The only thing I'm afraid about is that he said he wasn't curving any of the grades. Considering the average grade on the two tests were 15, that means the average will be a B.",
    "Tougher class than it may seem. Material on first midterm is certainly manageable, and it is not excessively difficult to perform well. Make sure you are \"on top of your game\" however for the second midterm exam. The material will be significantly harder, so take care in avoiding a feeling of false assurance in the fact that you may have done well on the first exam.",
    "Meh, not really. Stat 238 is probably better because the professor for that class has taught it for a long time and really knows his stuff. It's too bad that I cannot say the same for Stat 241. However, this is the only class that can open doors to higher Stats classes. Just hope there is a new professor or the professor improves the next time around.",
    "No because it is very difficult even though it is well taught.",
    "I found Probability Theory to be a fascinating combination of proof and applications. This course is an awesome way to see multivariable calculus used beyond analysis and physics. On homework and tests, we were responsible for knowing the concepts and applications, not the proofs. The homework is low-time-commitment, although many of the exam questions were tricky, and I wish that the homework had better prepared us for that. Professor Raman\u0092s lectures were very clear and concise. This class has left me wanting to learn more about the theoretical side of probability and statistics."
