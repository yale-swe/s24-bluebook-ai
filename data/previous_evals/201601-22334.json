    "An in-depth introduction to different methods of structural characterization of macro-molecules with an emphasis on crystallography. The final project gets you familiar with some of the hands-on aspects of structure determination and is definitely the highlight of the course.",
    "This is a required class for BP students and is indeed helpful for structural biology studies. The final project of solving and refining a x-ray structure of protein is really helpful and gave us a sense of how to really apply the knowledge we learn into practice in our research.",
    "CHEM 551 01 is an excellent introductory course for persons interested in structural biology and crystallography. It is not particularly math intensive and is more focussed on concepts and broad principles. It is an excellent class to take when one is in a crystallography lab and is need for troubleshooting as the practical aspects of the subject are frequently delved into. I would definitely recommend this class not only for Biophysics students but also for students of Chemical Biology, Cell Biology and MB&B.",
    "I would recommend it to another student since it is a more relaxed class and easy to get an honors."

   "comments": [
    "For research involving structure studies of macrobiomolecule, it is really helpful.",
    "Eventually In my thesis project in the Schepartz Lab I wish to work with EGFR and RAS proteins and crystallography will eventually be one of the many tools that I wish to use to attack my thesis problem. I feel Richards class has taught me a lot in the that regard - how to attack a problem - how to troubleshoot when stuck and how to validate the results - I have certainly learnt a lot from the classes. Moreover the trip to NSLS also brought us in direct conversation with some of the people in the field who are at the forefront of making crystallography as simple as possible for those interested in attacking a problem - this may prove useful in the future.",
    "I learnt more about Crystallography and Diffractions. I learnt about using crystallographic software, visualizing structures and structure refinement."
