    "This is an excellent way to get started on senior thesis research, requiring only a short project proposal, update, and a presentation\/paper at the end. What you get out of it is largely what you put into it. I would recommend this course!",

    "YES!! Pursue your own projects while you are in school. Never in your life would you get the chance to truly be the master of your research again unless you become a PI or entrepreneur.",
    "Standard - research for credit class. Both Professor Staib and Professor Duncan are super relaxed so if you miss deadlines or whatever you won't really have to worry about being penalized, as long as you get your work done."
