   "comments": [
    "I developed a much greater understanding of Chinese literature.",
    "Learned how to read works of Chinese poetry and literature with the proper historical context. In depth discussions of the differences in convention between Eastern and Western literature. Professor Chang was very helpful in elucidating the very opaque meanings of the works we read, being a leading scholar in Chinese literature.",
    "Intro to wide variety of authors and genres",
    "I learned how to read comparatively, as we would read multiple authors for a single class. My writing improved as well.",
    "During this course I was exposed to beautiful Chinese and poetry I would have otherwise probably never have read. We learned of the common themes of Chinese literature, significant symbolism, and the lives of many of these grand poets. We compared and contrasted different styles and I really learned to appreciate the history the poetry gives insight to as well as begin to get a grasp of deciphering the seemingly infinite layers of many of these poems.",
    "I learned so much in Man and Nature. Professor Chang was a wonderful instructor who challenged us to close read and discuss texts that encompassed themes of mortality, authorship, and nature.",
    "I got to know many great pieces that I wasn't familiar with. And I saw a different line for the theme which inspired me a lot.",
    "Man and Nature in Chinese Literature was absolutely wonderful! It met and surpassed my expectations. I came in knowing almost nothing about Chinese history or literature and I come out feeling like I've been exposed to so many themes and currents in this high context literary culture and its historical context. I now know a basic outline of Chinese dynastic history, and the works of dozens of poets. I will never be able to look at mountains or white clouds the same way again."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought the course was reasonably well done, though perhaps the discussion could be slightly improved by more actively encouraging student engagement.",
    "Strengths: Surveyed famous works and authors from many time periods in Chinese history, lessons would often connect with one another, Asian literature is a vastly different world from Western literature that is unlocked through the translations Weaknesses: Because of the limited timeline which is outside of Professor Chang's control, there are simply too many great works that could not be read. Some pieces that referenced a specific author or story, without having read that first, some of the meaning is lost.",
    "Strengths: Readings were good and both instructors were good Weaknesses: More guided discussion section would have been better than lecturing.",
    "I can think of no improvements--the course was very well organized, and I especially enjoyed the mixed format of presentation followed by discussion.",
    "A strength was really just how beautiful and interesting the poetry was. This was not a course where you read archaic poems with little face value. What I loved most was that there was a beautiful face value to the poems that only increased as the deeper meanings too were discovered. I liked the small size of the class, and how intimate it was as well. Each student was able to speak his \/ her mind and have meaningful discussions on the work.",
    "It will be helpful if there is more logical chain in the class, and maybe 5 minutes for the students to raise questions during the discussion.",
    "I don't think this course has any weaknesses other than students not always doing the readings. Professor Chang is amazing and I will now always her her voice when I'm reading translated Chinese poetry or anything about recluses, singing girls, gardens, whistling, hexagrams, and dynastic transitions. The papers are all well timed and offered good opportunities to sink one's teeth into a particular topic. Reading Journey to the West over spring break was very fun. I learned a lot!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, Professor Chang was very dedicated in teaching and explaining various works of Chinese literature",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants a basic overview of some major trends in traditional CHinese literature.",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in Chinese literature, this is a fantastic course to introduce yourself to some of the best works and minds. However, if you are uncertain if you are, this course will not be enjoyable for you as that is the sole subject discussed.",
    "100% recommend to everyone, but you will gain most out of the class if you have some Chinese background to help wth references. Prof. Chang nonetheless does an excellent job of filling in gaps.",
    "Yes, it is a flexible class. You can try very hard, or it can be a gut class. Ideal for practically anyone.",
    "Yes. I would definitely recommend this course. I usually have trouble bringing myself to read literature, especially poems that are hundreds of years old, but with this class, I genuinely wanted to do each reading because I knew the selection of literature would be pleasant and thought provoking to read.",
    "Yes, take this class! It is a wonderful opportunity to engage with texts that address a variety of questions and themes such as life, death, and the act of writing. Professor Chang is brilliant and welcoming. You will leave the class feeling that that you learned something lasting and important.",
    "Yes! It indeed provide a wonderful perspective for the theme and it will be a good opportunity for students to learn more great pieces.",
    "Do you like the deep places of the forest, the wild mountains, or the green moss? Do you fancy yourself a hero but think the government is corrupt and that you might end up becoming a recluse and keeping a fine garden? Are you interested in how people focus on small moments and imagery in times of unrest? Do you think ants might have a lot to tell us about political philosophy? Do you want to know more about Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism? Can you read Chinese or are you not able to read a word of it? Take Man and Nature in Chinese Literature! This was one of the lowest stress and but most intellectually rewarding courses I have taken at Yale. The readings are all fun and interesting and I often found myself reading more because the poetry was so good even in translation. The papers are very manageable if you stay on top of your work and I learned so much by writing them and talking to professor Chang."
