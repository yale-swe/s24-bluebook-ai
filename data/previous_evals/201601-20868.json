    "Well, if you're looking at this you're already in too deep. Get ready for a lot of late nights, existential crises, gray hairs, and opaque criticism. Good luck, kiddo.",
    "You have to take it. You have something due every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Start everything early, as soon as you get the assignment sheet you need to start working. Don't stop, and keep up with the pace.",
    "Most demanding studio you'll take, but you just grit though it and come out a stronger person\/better designer. Accept this work ethic\/philosophy for a semester and roll with it, it will be done before you know anyway and better to make what you can out of itcomplaining incessantly just makes it worse for everyone, yourself included. Enjoy it, seriously!!!",
    "Absolutely not. I would summarize this course as-- \"it will make you question the major and your desire to pursue the career\"",
    "Demanding and rigorous; be prepared to have your views challenged, your work criticised and to constantly have more questions than solutions. Even though you've undoubtedly developed some kind of pseudo-philosophy regarding your design work by this point, best to leave all baggage at the door for this one. (Wait, why don't we get to evaluate our TAs anymore? Shoutout to our wonderful Canadian duo, Boris and Anne! TAs are so important to the undergraduate studios!!!!)",
    "Get ready for the toughest and maybe best studio you will have had so far. This class will make you rethink architecture, it will make you feel it. It will keep you up at night thinking about your project. In this class you will find architecture as much as you will find yourself. Be ready to be pushed to the limit, feel lost at times, and almost wanting to give up. But keep up the rhythm, take the class at face value, and at the end you will cash out the big reward. In hindsight, and if you do keep the right mindset throughout, this class will be infinitely gratifying and eye-opening.",
    "This class is a crucible, but a necessary one."
