    "Fairly easier than 110 and 120 were, but still a pain to do. Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "This class is the next step in terms of learning the language. I would recommend this class to another student because, although it is difficult at times, it is necessary in order to become more proficient in the language.",
    "I would recommend taking it. Don't expect to learn a lot more than you already know from 120, but it is helpful to keep up the language.",
    "Yes, it is a fun class.",
    "Usually it's pretty straight-forward in deciding whether or not you are going to take this.",
    "Italian 130 is the perfect class to refine your grammatical understanding of the Italian language and to work on increasing fluidity of speech. I would recommend this class if these are two of a student's goals. The class also reads many passages, writes an essay a week (two, if you count the revision) and watches about four movies over the course of the term. If the student is interested in learning the Italian language and dedicated to commit to a five days of instruction per week, then this is a good class to take."
