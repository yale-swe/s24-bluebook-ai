   "comments": [
    "This course is quite good.",
    "confused",
    "This course actually is very crucial to me. In Biostatistics, most data I will meet is categorical. But this course is below my expectation. I think I did not build a very solid foundation in categorical data. This course is too 'APPLIED' to me. I expect there would be some theoretical stuff to me. But there weren't. All I learnt is to use SAS program to get some results, that I even do not understand!",
    "The material in this course was very complex and hard to understand at times.",
    "Maybe it is because the teacher has little experience in teaching, some way of her explaining the concepts is hard to understand. And the learning atmosphere in class is not good at the beginning and even worsen later on.",
    "Strengths: the new TA, Anita, was great.Weaknesses: I had a really difficult time connecting the lectures to the homework. I wish I had been able to learn more from this class.",
    "This course was not what I hoped it would be. The lectures were very theory-based, and the book is not great. Therefore, most of us in class had a hard time learning the material. I will come out of the class being a bit more fluent in SAS, but that is the only skill I really developed in this course.",
    "This class was pretty rough. It would be dishonest to say otherwise. The professor was not the best instructor and I do not feel like I got the course what I expected of it. The book did not match up well with the coursework (and was riddled with errors) and neither did our assignments. The professor showed little actual interest in us or if we understood the material. When pressed she would expand but if not for some pointed questions she would simple just keep on talking (softly) and writing out things. There was a definite lack of relevant examples. I would have been nice to see how what we were learning could relate in any number of public health contexts. Instead we just got \"Mice and fungicide exposure\" again and again. I really cannot recommend this course to fellow students. I think this course could be better taught by someone with more practical experience in actually working with categorical data in a practical way.",
    "Strengths:none.Weaknesses:- I think the instructor could improve her presentation of the material.- The textbook should be changed, as it wasn't clear- The lectures should be in alignment with the homework assignments.- The lab sections should be mandatory, and the course should provide better demostrations of application of material in SAS and possible R.- Lecture was too long.- There should be a mid-term or take-home exam at some point in the course, rather than 70% of the grade being based on homework alone.- Homeworks should not be strictly from the textbook.",
    "Terrible course. I did not learn anything new that I had already learned coming into the class. I would not recommend taking it unless you are required to. At the beginning, students complained that the course was too theoretical, and after the professor restructured the class it was not challenging enough. In addition, Zelterman's book for the course is also bad. I find myself googling concepts for clarification or reading the Agresti Categorical text, which is much better than Zelterman's book.",
    "This course started out horribly but improved a little bit as the semester progressed. I didn\u0092t learn very much in this course and it did not prepare me to analyze data for my thesis. Ideally, I would have liked to walk away from this course with the ability to confidently analyze various categorical data sets. Unfortunately, I feel nearly as inept as I did when I started this course in September.I suggest that the professor present examples that are more applicable to public health (i.e. not lab data). Students take this course to be able to analyze epidemiologic data sets. The course should use the type of data and format of data that we might expect to encounter in our careers.The textbook left much to be desired.",
    "The professor was new to teaching, and that fact was reflected in the course. It was poorly organized and taught, although it got better as the semester progressed. At the beginning of the semester, she assumed a level of statistical knowledge that few people had. It was supposed to be an applied course, but the way she taught it (and the homework she assigned) was highly theoretical. Everyone complained, and eventually she got the message. Even so, the lectures were difficult to understand, because again she assumed a level of knowledge which we didn't have and because she didn't explain things clearly enough. There was not enough emphasis on the interpretation of things, and so we constantly had to ask her questions about it. And the homeworks were difficult to do since the lectures didn't provide us with the skills needed to complete them. Again, this got better as the semester progressed, but this upper level course should not be given to a new professor to teach. As a result, the students learn almost nothing. We also switched TAs halfway through the semester without any explanation whatsoever. It was weird.",
    "I found this course to be disappointing. I have a Master of Public Health in Biometry, and having experienced much of this material in previous courses, I have witnessed first-hand how this material can be presented so that students find the experience rewarding.First, the lectures were disorganized and overly theoretical for an applied statistics class. Students did not receive a clear, helpful explanation for even the simplest of concepts (such as logistic regression and effect modification). Furthermore, the theory was often not pertinent to the assigned homework from the book.Second, the book did not complement the lectures, and because the homework assignments came from the book, students were left to spend several hours attempting to ascertain what the questions were even asking. Most of the time spent on assignments was essentially wasted on minutiae.Third, SAS coding for categorical data analysis was not adequately presented. When SAS code was provided, little explanation was given about how the code worked, why different options were used, and how SAS could be applied to the homework. I do not feel any more confident in my SAS skills as a result of this course.Fourth, without a clear understanding of where the lectures were heading or what the assignments were asking, the students had to strongly advocate for themselves. This was stressful on the students and also potentially unfair for the professor, as she was consistently interrupted during class to ask for clarification on important details. Additionally, students sent numerous emails to the professor and the TA each week, which was a strain on everyone involved.Fifth, becuase it was so difficult to get a clear understanding what was expected of us, we never got a chance to be truly challenged by unique concepts or to learn new ways of using statistical software.-I would use BIS 623 as a template for reworking the course. BIS 623 had clear lectures and, perhaps most importantly, weekly sections which thoroughly and clearly described the SAS code for each assignment. BIS 625 would benefit from following the methods from BIS 623.",
    "There were no strengths with this course. For weaknesses, the course was poorly taught. Nothing was learned at the end of the course. I regret taking this course because I honestly did not learn anything and know that other courses would have taught me a lot more. Also, the logistics of the course were unorganized such as different TAs during the middle of the semester.",
    "The course began in a very rough spot, with a combination of a novice professor, poor book, and uninvested TA. It seemed that the only way to make it better was to make it so easy that no one could further complain.",
    "Prof was new, but completely unprepared. The course suffered as a result. Really became a self-taught course because class instruction was useless.",
    "strengths- learned SASweaknesses- inaudible lectures both from ta and lecturer, very bad book",
    "This course would be improved by adapting a format similar to Applied Regression Analysis. Focus on applied methods should be strictly adhered to (unless more mathematics courses are made requirements for the course). Each class should involve the teaching of APPLIED methods for the analysis of categorical data, and SAS instruction must be included.",
    "good",
    "The class was poorly constructed and I feel I benefited little from taking it.",
    "The course started off a bit rocky. It would be most beneficial to students to focus on applied analysis rather than theorems and derivations. Categorical data analysis is an important tool for public health however I am uncertain on how practical some of the material was.",
    "There was no real consistency with the lecture and what was given for homework. Lectures were hard to follow.",
    "Strengths: The course content is very relevant and important to studying biostatistics. The lectures and homework assignments involved writing quite a bit of SAS code. The final project was a great way to incorporate the different types of regression models learned throughout the course.Weaknesses: The TA lab session was not scheduled consistently until weeks into the semester. The textbook was not always very helpful. Having lecture only once a week did not seem to provide enough time to cover all material."

I hope some improvements can be made. It is better for her to prepare some notes for students, not just writing on the blackboard. She may also assign different workload to MPH students and PhD students.But she responded to students' request very quick and she is also very nice.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang was a first year teacher. I know she put in a lot of effort but it was a little difficult to take stuff away from the class.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Maybe she could do better in teaching in later years.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0It is obvious that Dr. Wang knows the concepts, but she doesn't do SAS (and since the class is applied and YSPH focuses on SAS, it would be helpful to have a professor who did too). She wasn't a very good lecturer. She was, however, very responsive to emails!",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Professor Wang was not the best professor for this class, but it wasn't completely her fault given that it was her first time teaching it. She is a nice woman who seems to care about the students, but unfortunately, she taught the class at a level that was inaccessible to the majority of us. Lectures were hard to follow, and I feel like I should have walked away with better data analysis skills than I have.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The instructor clearly was not all that experienced at actually teaching. She had difficulty addressing questions, did not speak very loudly and taught in a very enigmatic way. I often felt like she was three steps ahead of the whole class and absolutely oblivious to that reality. She would defer to the TAs a lot too which was pretty unacceptable. I would hope that this course is made more valuable to those who dare take it in the future with a different, or vastly improved teaching experience. Also admitted she wasn't particularly well versed in SAS which a bit frustrating when all of our coding was expecting to be done in SAS.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang was very nice and approachable. However, her lectures require more preparation. They never seemed to be in alignment with the homework assignments. Additionally, she was very difficult to understand, spoke faintly and with uncertainty.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang speaks very quiet so it is difficult to hear her lecture. In addition, she does not explain concepts very clearly, regardless if the concept is simple or difficult. I didn't feel like she came prepared for class or took a lot of time to thoughtfully assign homework problems that would test our knowledge.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The professor did not explain things well and her lectures were incredibly boring. She also set office hours at an inconvenient time. I recommend that in future she survey the students for their availability before setting office hours.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0As stated earlier, she got better as the semester progressed, but overall was not a good lecturer. She often sounded nervous, laughed at weird times, and didn't explain things clearly. She was available for help by email, but her office hours were Monday after class, and the weekly homework was due on Monday in class, which didn't make sense at all. We couldn't use her office hours to talk about the previous week's assignment because we already turned it in, and we couldn't use it to to talk about the following week's assignment because we hadn't even received it yet. So her office hours were pointless. The final project was okay, but she emphasized concepts that we didn't learn (e.g., contrasts) and expected us to do linear regression when some people had not taken the linear regression course. Her expectations were not very clear either.As a new professor, she needed to at least talk to the former professor (Zelterman) of the class before the semester started to get an idea of what the course entails, what background students have, and how she should teach the course and what topics should be emphasized. She needed some kind of senior mentor. If she had done that to begin with, we wouldn't have had to suffer through the tortuous first few weeks of class.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The instructor was responsive to emails (even at night and over the weekend) and seemed to make an effort to improve the course.I think teaching this class would be have been better had the assignments been written by the instructor instead of coming from a book that didn't match her lectures.Also, because she did not grade the previous assignments, it is difficult to know what she expects from students when she grades the final projects.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The professor was unable to lecture or teach properly. Her lectures were hard to follow resulting in a difficult time in applying them to problems and actually learning.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0A very new professor should take guidance from mentors in the department, but should not feel pressured to use the former professor's text book if she can teach better without it.I appreciate her trying to respond to student and department feedback. I think she was trying, but by the end of the semester, she still did not seem to understand student concerns and questions.Overall, Dr Wang is very kind, but should have received more guidance from the department before the semester started, and needs to consider more what students need to learn to understand categorical data analysis in a public health setting.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Limited english, hard to hear\/understand. Obviously lacked teaching experience. Focused more on formulas rather than applied use of categorical analysis (as the class was presented as an applied course). She couldn't explain concepts clearly.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0strengths- great personality and willing to helpweaknesses- stage presence and ability to communicate complicated ideas effectively",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr Wang should, as mentioned above, focus exclusively on applied methods and include SAS instruction in her teaching every class. It would be helpful for her to follow a similar format to Applied Regression Analysis. Since she is not intimately familiar with the course book, it might be better for her to choose another book to work with. Each class should include information on the processes required for each and every homework assignment, with special emphasis on explaining the first few assignments- where students have no idea what Categorical data analysis is. If Dr. Wang does not find time in her lecture to do this, she must have a teaching assistant (as with Applied Regression Analysis) who understands exactly how to work through each homework assignment and can explain to students in detail what to do. It is important also for Dr Wang to respond to questions by students with in simple, understandable, non-theoretical terminology, as this was a consistent problem over the course of lectures. (For example, if a student wants to know what an interaction is, an appropriate explanation at this level might be \"Interaction is when one factor depends on another factor, and vice versa\" rather than writing and describing complicated theoretical notation which students cannot understand).",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0She cared but was unable to adequately teach or adapt the course to the students needs and requests.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0I understand that this may have been the first time the professor taught the course. She appeared to have listened to some of the students concerns that the course was too theoretical at first. I felt that the course could have been strengthened if there was a lab session rather than doing problems from the book. Her strengths include adapting quickly to meet the needs of the students. Her teaching style could be improved by teaching with slides rather than handwritten notes. It could be more efficient in illustrating examples.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0She needed to be more consistent with what was covered in lecture and what was given for homework. Also it was hard to understand her sometimes because she talked so softly.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The instructor was very nice and generally prepared. It would have been helpful to have lecture notes posted online more consistently. I also felt that the class would have benefited from additional practice in interpreting SAS output and writing reports before the final project. Her SAS examples toward the end of the semester were very helpful and a great resource."

    "Anita is very approachable, but she was only the TA for the second half of the semester.

    "It was strange that the first TA quit halfway through the semester. The new TA, Anita Wang, was helpful and her lab sessions were fine, but she had an epidemiology background and didn't know the answers to a lot of our questions. She had taken the course with Zelterman who had taught it differently (i.e., better) and so she didn't always know the details of the topics we were covering. She graded fairly and leniently, which was fine, given that we were often totally lost when trying to do the assignments.",

I'm sure the constant emails from students was quite overwhelming, so I can't blame him at all.His replacement, Anita Sung, was amazing. She was responsive, positive, motivated, and offered useful information in her sections. She deserves our deepest gratitude.",
