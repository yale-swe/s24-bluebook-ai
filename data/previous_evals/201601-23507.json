    "This is a great class which I will recommend to other students",
    "I enjoyed the variety of different cancer types that were covered in the course and the practical aspect of looking through data on cancer statistics. I think there were some redundancy in some of the lectures, and that time could have been spent on a better understanding of analytical tools for cancer epidemiology",
    "Nice exposure to various cancers\/cancer-related topics",
    "Strengths in providing introductory content regarding cancer, but not as great a focus on the epidemiology. A little disorganized, syllabus could be strengthened. The lectures can be a bit dry sometimes."
