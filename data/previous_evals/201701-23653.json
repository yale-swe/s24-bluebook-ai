   "comments": [
    "A smaller classroom would have been more engaging. The guest speakers were wonderful.",
    "The class would be better as a seminar. The material isn't super difficult, but the lecture presentation and passive learning could be better. I think the last class table top exercise would be a better method of learning.",
    "I enjoyed the readings on the list, but didn't necessarily think that all of the readings needed to be as long as they often were. Many readings went into far more detail than necessary, and weren't often talked about in class. It would be nice to know what the final would be like earlier in the class. Many individuals didn't know that we would be tested on presentations, but that isn't an unreasonable expectation.",
    "Lectures are well organized, and provide concrete image on how the Fed works.",
    "This is an excellent course. The only weakness is the organization of guest lectures, which did not conform to the teaching plan. Maybe the number of guest lectures could be decreased and we could hear more from Mr. English.",
    "Strengths: Prof. English is a lucid, authoritative, and patient explainer. Prof. English also provides excellent, helpful feedback on all assignments. The tabletop exercise at the end was helpful in pulling all the strands of the class together. Weaknesses: The class would have benefitted from a narrower focus, explored in greater mathematical\/theoretical rigor. Perhaps just fiscal agency\/payment systems\/financial stability without monetary policy \/ history. I wish we had had a followup class to discuss the tabletop exercise to cement its lessons."

   "comments": [
    "It was a truly engaging course taught by an expert in the field.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor English is a phenomenal teacher, and makes the information clear to understand.",
    "This is likely among the best senior economics seminars. The amount of work is very manageable and grading is reasonable. Assignments on the syllabus are well-balanced. I have learned a great deal about the banking system, monetary policy, and financial stability. It doesn't get too quantitative, just requires a great deal of conceptual understanding and economic intuition.",
    "I definitely recommend this course especially for those who seek for a job in the financial sector.",
    "Definitely yes. This is an excellent course on the operations of a central bank. One could familiarize oneself with the considerations of central bank policies easily after this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in economic policy."
