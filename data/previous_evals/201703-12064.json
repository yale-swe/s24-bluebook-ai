   "comments": [
    "Baseline knowledge of game theory and its applications in psychology and the real world.",
    "How to do basic game theory and think about reasons for human social cooperation",
    "I learned why people cooperate or defect in certain situations and how to evaluate those decisions mathematically and theoretically. I learned how to incorporate factors like altruism, reciprocity, and reputation into these analyses and why these factors may or may not be evolutionarily favored. Finally, I learned the ways in which these topics can be applied to everyday life experiences.",
    "Benefits of cooperative strategies through game theory, game theory",
    "This class was extremely interesting. I had taken game theory classes previously but this class went beyond the basics and allowed me to understand more of the theoretical side of game theory. It was such an interesting lens through which to look at cooperation. I learned so much about human motives in cooperation and defection.",
    "- Basics of game theory (which I partially knew beforehand, so this wasn't particularly insightful for me, but I imagine it's a pretty good introduction for people who have not seen game theory before). - Theories of reasons of cooperation, and modelling them with mathematical models. - Modelling skills not taught per se but the exposure to various models gives us a feel for how various psychological phenomena can be modelled.",
    "Lovely course, but mostly due to Professor Rand, careful taking it with a different professor.",
    "This was my first time learning about game theory and the psychological reasons behind people's choices and actions. I found this course very helpful in introducing concepts\/ forming a foundation for my Economics major.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of cooperation and how it evolved.",
    "This class allowed me to understand basic game theory and the psychological and cultural reasons behind choices one makes and choices groups make in aggregate.",
    "Game Theory",
    "I learned a lot about game theory models and how they apply to different forms of cooperation. I also learned about how to apply these models to real-world situations.",
    "You use math to describe the evolution of cooperation. You spend the first half of the semester modeling the prisoner's dilemma, coordination games, and anticoordination games with simple algebra. Then, you discuss the applications of the evolution of cooperation.",
    "Perseverance",
    "Learned a lot about how we make decisions and what factors into our decision making process",
    "A great introduction to evolutionary game theory as applied to psychology.",
    "I developed many skills during this course, but I would say the greatest skill I developed was the ability to posit and critically think about scenarios. because of the game theory that we learned, I learned how to manipulate games and understand the social implications of those manipulations, both through real-world experiments and through theory. It was an incredibly valuable course for me. The course also taught me a lot, as a first year, about the value of choosing courses based on the quality of the professor; I found professor Rand incredibly engaging and thought-provoking. He was also incredibly accessible and fair. That, as much as the material, made the course valuable.",
    "I earned a general knowledge about evolutionary game theory, and it's use as a model of cooperation.",
    "I learned about the evolution of cooperation.",
    "learned basics of game theory!",
    "Game theory, but in a biological\/psych\/evolutuionary sense. Very cool",
    "Got a chance to learn about game theory",
    "I learned a lot about why people make the decisions they do and why cooperation exists.",
    "I learned how and why cooperation has persisted throughout time and across species despite the temptations to be selfish and defect. I also learned how behavioral economics can be applied to psychology.",
    "On a micro level, I learned about basic game theory--how logic and simple math can be used to break down human decisions. On a macro level, I learned more about different theories and formulas explaining some of the more nuanced features of human culture.",
    "Learned a lot of theoretical information about cooperation and different reasons for its evolution. Some basic math set ups for the theory. It was a very interesting crossover between psychology and economics, with more of a focus on the psychology part of it.",
    "Not much. Focused on applying models to data.",
    "I learned how cooperation exists in a world that favors defection",
    "I learned about game theory and Nash equilibrium. I also learned about different types of games and how they influence cooperation versus defection.",
    "I learned about deeper motivations that drive human behavior and how they evolved. I also learned to apply skills I learned in other classes (game theory, psychological principles, math formulas) in a new field, which was my first experience with an interdisciplinary class.",
    "I learned how game theory could be used to explain daily life decisions and larger societal tendencies."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Course is highly interesting and low-stress, but is generally straightforward. Dave Rand is a great lecturer and is dedicated to his students' success, and it is clear that the material is his passion.",
    "Parts and spread out and not that difficult. Class lecture was very interesting. Exams didnt give you enough time to answer all of the questions in only 50 minutes",
    "Strengths - the first half of the course offered a great balance between mathematical and conceptual analyses of each topic. Problem Sets were a great way to apply this new knowledge. Weaknesses - I wish we incorporated more mathematical analysis into the topics presented in the second half of the course. As we were expected to do so in the final exam (meaning Professor Rand clearly intended for students to come away with the mathematical skills to analyze these topics), more instruction on how to do so would have been very helpful.",
    "Learn game theory well, fantastic understanding of different types of games and how they change, but towards the end the classes begin to focus a bit too much on single papers, etc.",
    "The reading responses each week are pretty irrelevant and are just busy work that should be eliminated. Also, we were promised more game days and only had one.",
    "Personally, I would have liked more (possibly optional) more advanced bonus material, such as looking at some of the mathematical models in more detail. However, I understand that not everyone would enjoy such material, so the course is fine as it is (it is very interesting, albeit a little simplistic).",
    "Strengths: David Rand Weaknesses: none",
    "This course balanced workload, reading, section attendance, and class very well for me to learn the material as best I could. The reading was always relevant and laid a foundation for material being covered in the next class. Section always reviewed and solidified material I needed to know for the exam. Finally, although it was the hardest part of the class, the psets were the best resource for learning the material because it forced me to think and work with my classmates which, in turn, solidified it in my head.",
    "The math was very basic and didn't get proved which made the findings a little less interesting. But on the whole the material was interesting.",
    "The first and the second half of the class felt a bit disjointed, so more focus on integrating the first with the second would be helpful. That being said, the material was really interesting and made me think often.",
    "Great course - only bad part is that Prof. Rand is leaving.",
    "The course covers really interesting material, particularly in the second half. Being able to use theoretical frameworks in the real world - such as how cooperation could have led to religion - was really thought-provoking to consider. That being said, the course was a little more math and theory heavy in the first half than I had expected. I do think that the background was necessary, but I wish it had been more clear how much of the course would be arithmetic before we could apply it to everyday concepts.",
    "The problem sets were good (once a wee). They were not bad, and they helped solidify what you learn in class. The exams were pretty hard because you cannot do much to study for them. The exam is basically a timed algebra test.",
    "More cultural reference",
    "Definitely had good TAs and loved the lectures. Weakness was definitely the exam format in my opinion especially the final. Felt like it tested how well you could come to conclussions about new things rather than how well you retained information from the course itself.",
    "Interesting, well designed lectures and sections.",
    "Professor Rand certainly was a strength. I also think that the power points and video recordings of lectures were incredibly helpful for review and enabled me to engage more during class rather than freak out about not getting notes on every detail. I also found the exams to be very fair and interesting; they accurately tested our knowledge and allowed us to find new applications and interpretations of the theory we studied. I think one weakness was the lack of clarity in the requirements for reading responses. They were pretty free form and we weren't always informed as to which reading(s) we were to respond to. On that note, I found my TF to not always, or really ever, be that helpful. I mostly left more confused from section than anything. Sometimes he offered valuable counterpoints to the material presented in class which challenged me to rethink the validity of our study, but that was often done in pretty unprofessional ways.",
    "The problem sets were crucial for my understanding of the course.",
    "I enjoyed the concepts and the material, but I did not like the way the class was organized and taught. The math was oversimplified to the point of not making sense, and it was incredibly frustrating. The class either needs to be more focused on the mathematical concepts so that they can actually be taught and understood, or it just needs to focus on the psychological applications and ignore the math all together.",
    "Lectures could've been clearer",
    "Not heavy workload or tough to understand, but lectures took some strength to get through since it seemed like Prof Rand spoke for 50 straight minutes without stop.",
    "Psets were nitpicking and nit enough time on tests",
    "The research didn't always seem very credible just because the field was so new. I also wished that there were more cohesive readings or resources outside the powerpoint slides. Section also wasn't very useful.",
    "Strengths: Professor Rand is an incredible professor. He knows so much about the field and seems to have an honest faith in what he studies. The TA's were also super supportive and knowledgable, and the class was the perfect size to balance small-scale learning and lecture-style teaching. Weaknesses: I found the mismatch between pset and exam difficulty to be a little frustrating sometimes. While the psets were pretty straightforward, the exams asked us to synthesize and stretch our skills in ways that we didn't have practice with. I think it's reasonable to make exams more a matter of synthesis than psets, but at the very least I wish the exams were realistically finish-able.",
    "Strengths: well taught, organized, material is always posted. Weaknesses: could use more practice material and section isn't always that useful, although it's mandatory.",
    "Strengths: Engaging Has. Weaknesses: Not practical material, not engaging lectures",
    "I struggled with the math",
    "Strengths: lecture content and level of engagement, real world application, energy and knowledge of Professor Rand Weaknesses: section was always repetitive and rarely useful; weekly readings did not really contribute to my understanding at all",
    "This was a very well done course. I found it very engaging. I cannot think of anything that could be done to improve the course."

   "comments": [
    "I loved this course because the material was fascinating, Professor Rand is an engaging lecturer, and the class was generally low-stress. It's not as much of an evolutionary psych\/bio class as I as expecting -- instead, it focuses almost exclusively on game theory topics -- but I found this interesting as well, and a solid introduction to the basic concepts of game theory. If you've ever taken another game theory class, you won't enjoy this class, but if you just want to get your feet wet, definitely give this a shot. Low workload combined with interesting and easy-to-grasp concepts make this a great fifth credit or SO distributional requirement.",
    "This is the last semester being taught by lrofessor Rand, but Id recommend it with him at least",
    "Yes!",
    "Very interesting because of the use of Game theory, fantastic introduction to Game Theory.",
    "Definitely. If the person was interested in game theory but also psychology, i would most definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes only if the other student is seeking a gut class to balance out hard classes. Not otherwise.",
    "Look, David Rand is leaving for MIT, so you're taking a leap of faith with a new professor. His material was awesome, can't speak for new teachers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students either interested in the psychology of how human's make decisions or economics.",
    "This class is great. The material is engaging and informative. It's also not too tough.",
    "It is not that challenging but is pretty interesting and Professor Rand is great, so I would recommend it.",
    "Yes! It's a really interesting course, and more specific than other introductory psych courses.",
    "I strongly recommend!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in thinking about cooperation through a new lens. It was definitely eye-opening for me, and I enjoyed seeing how different complex scenarios could be simplified and modeled. However, students should know that math will be involved - nothing extensive, but students should know what they are signing up for. Professor Rand is clearly an expert, and he always brings in new research - often work that he has contributed to - and is also an engaging lecturer, keeping every class interesting.",
    "Yes! This was a great course and psychology credit. If you miss math, but don't want to take very advanced math (past Calc III), this is a great option. The material is very interesting and straight forward.",
    "To fulfill a requirement",
    "Yes, I found this course to be very interesting and not totally time consuming. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is interested in the material but doesn't want to be overwhelmed with work from adding another class.",
    "Yes! Truly fascinating course.",
    "I definitely would recommend it. I think that the course, while not overwhelmingly difficult, provides insight into the nature of decision making, human interaction, and psychology in ways that few courses could. The course has challenged me to think in new ways; I will carry the skills of game theory and critical thinking with me. It's a fun course.",
    "Sadly, this is the last time that Professor Rand will be teaching this course. If it comes up again ,then take it.",
    "No. If you like the psych, take Moralities of Everyday Life with Paul Bloom. Same concepts, much more interesting. If you like the math, take a real game theory class. This weird hybrid is not worth it.",
    "Yeah! If you're interested",
    "Yeah. It's a bit boring in the sense that its basically repeated skill over and over the entire semester, but overall its a cool topic with very light workload.",
    "Pretty interesting class, but will not be offered again because Dave is leaving. Psets at times can get frustrating. Definitely not enough time to finish tests, but curve was relatively generous",
    "I like game theory so this was a fun class for me, especially since it looked at it from a psychology point of view instead of pure economics. Unfortunately, the professor is leaving Yale so the class probably won't be offered again.",
    "I would only recommend it to someone who knows they enjoy behavioral economics.",
    "Yes--I'd recommend this course for anyone, whether or not a psyc major. Game theory is useful for a variety of different disciplines, and even beyond that this course is a useful glimpse into understanding human behavior and decision-making. Evolution of Cooperation taught me a way of looking at culture that I hadn't considered before.",
    "Yes this was a great class, fun, and very interesting.",
    "Not likely.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I am pre-med and took this to fulfill a psychology requirement but came out of it having learned a lot. This course is easy and the workload is quite low but at the same time, it is fun and you'll learn something new.",
    "The topic itself was interesting to learn about; however, some of the lectures and readings were difficult to understand.",
    "Although I would definitely recommend the class to another student, the professor will not teach the class again at Yale.",
    "Yes I would because felt like it expanding my understanding of psychology and its applications beyond the typical field. I loved applying biology and economics to a field where they usually are absent.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although the work is challenging at times, it is work the time and effort to learn the material."
