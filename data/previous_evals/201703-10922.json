    "Well designed course. Interesting content",
    "Better understanding of policy making.",
    "A better understanding of the core concepts and theoretical underpinnings that were genuinely badly taught at undergrad. The slutsky equation was very useful to understand to visualise sub vs income effects.",

   "comments": [
    "Materials are covered in great details. Mike is extremely helpful.",
    "The lecture was focused on mainly consumer theory which was good. Labor supply theories and principal\/agent problems were also good. Game theories would be also helpful if time allows for him to give lectures.",
    "The main strengths are: 1. The topics are covered in depth and are fully explained 2. Both Professor Boozer and the TA are excellent. 3. The problem sets are really well thought, based in real world examples and make students understand fully the topics covered in class and engage in interesting discussions, and encourage us to read more. 4. The topics covered are really interesting and VERY well focused, bringing very interesting applications. 5. Lecture notes are very clear and well written. 6. Throughout the topics covered we acquired a good tool kit to solve microeconomic problems. The main weakness: we did not have enough time to cover all the topics planned in the semester.",
    "All of my comments are the same as for econometrics.",
    "The course is very helpful in laying the base for micro and also clarifies a lot of concepts. The first few weeks could have been taught more quickly so we could finish the syllabus.",
    "Strengths: everything. Just an amazing course",
    "Can be done in a more structured way",
    "The strength lies in the thoroughness by which the course covers some core topics in microeconomics, and in the way it allows people from different backgrounds (including less economics-oriented) to catch up and get to the same level. The lecture notes are also very useful and detailed. There are a couple of ways in which the course could be improved. First of all, the amount of time spent on the first set of lecture notes (the axioms) could be considerably shortened. This material was never really used again in the course and could have been covered in one lecture, leaving several lectures for more useful parts of the course. I also think that it would be possible to cover more in the lectures by going on less tangents. Finally, and this might be a case of \"careful what you wish for,\" I think we could have had a couple more problem sets, since those are by far the best way to learn the material, and sometimes several weeks would pass without a problem set.",
    "The course was insightful and thought provoking. Less time could have been spent on the Axioms as the pace increased significantly towards the final few weeks.",
    "I feel that we perhaps dwelled too much on topics that could have merited less time, such as the very first lectures on axioms, at the cost of covering theory of the firm later in the semester. Other than that, it was an enjoyable course that covered important topics well.",
    "A strength were the in-depth lectures and the problem sets. One weakness is the fact that we did not cover theory of firm.",
    "The strengths of this course are in the depth in which it goes to explain certain concepts. The problem sets are very useful. It brings about a strong intuitive understanding. Weakness of this course is in how little of micro it tends to cover. While I understand that time is limited, for a Master's level micro course to just cover Slutsky equation and Risk is a little underwhelming. Some initial parts of the course can be sped up to include more material and applications of Slutsky don't need so much time to be spent on. More mathematical basis would be better as well."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in micro economics especially further deep understanding of consumer theories, I strongly recommend. Also, students who are seeking Ph.D in the future, should take this course.",
    "Yes fully. In particular for people looking forward to really understand microeconomics and looking for an applied and in depth course.",
    "Yes - to people who learn well from reading.",
    "It was a really good course with lots of material to help clarify concepts and learn new ones.",
    "Recommend 100%",
    "Yes. Fun studying fir the pset and exam Great focus on concept",
    "Yes. It is a good overview of some key topics in microeconomics. For a somewhat more cursory coverage of a wider range of topics, there's the undergraduate intermediate micro, which might be more suitable depending on what one needs to get out of it.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, it is a good survey of the key topics in consumer theory",
    "Definitely! It is a very good course for understanding the basics of microeconomics",
    "Yes, if they want something intermediate between an undergrad and PhD. But I would warn it is not mathematically intensive, as you would expect a Master's level Econ degree to be."
