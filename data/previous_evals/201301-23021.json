    "It's a great course. If you're a non-native speaker, don't be intimidated: you can take this class without destroying your grades, so long as you take plenty of notes, start your final essay far in advance, and seek feedback whenever possible. Professors Gonzalez and Outes-Leon are incredibly kind and understanding people. They are 100% willing to help wherever they can.",
    "A review of latin american vanguardist literature. Lots of interesting readings. Some are pretty challenging. It requires a high level of Spanish language skills. The course is great- the readings are beautiful and intriguing, and the discussions are fascinating and definitely help a lot with gleaning the deeper meaning behind the texts.",
    "I had never taken a Spanish literature course before and I can say that I am very much satisfied with this course. I highly recommend it. It was well-taught and the material was pretty interesting.",
    "This course is good to take if you have a firm grasp of the Spanish language. The texts are quite complicated and deep, but once you get through them they are very rewarding. The reading isn't very long and it is all great. Highly recommend it."
