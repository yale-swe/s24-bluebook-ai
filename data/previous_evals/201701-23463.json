    "I learned to understand the global scope of public health and how truly interdisciplinary it was. My eyes were opened to the complexity of real-life solutions to health issues and I'm inspired to pursue it further.",
    "I was able to get a broad survey of prominent global health issues and discuss many associated risk factors for existing health disparities. Additionally, I learned how to write a policy brief.",
    "How to think of America not as a country on a hill, the white savior in charge of bringing all other countries out of their \"pitiful\" health states, but rather as only one player on a field of many with the responsibility to improve global health.",
    "Gained a much broader understanding what Global Health really is and what factors (geopolitical, environmental, epidemiological) really goes into caring for people around the world.",
    "- Epidemiology - Knowledge about major disease",
    "I learned so much about the practical world of Global Health and the many factors to consider. Such an incredible course!",
    "I learned a lot more about the biology of important diseases, namely, HIV\/AIDS, malaria and TB. I also learned about other diseases including NTDs and womens' health issues. I also learned about the challenges facing global health including financing and global governance.",
    "I walked into the course thinking that global health was just a lot of epidemiology, and walked out with a much broader world view of global health. It was much more interdisciplinary than I expected and I thought it was really wonderful that the course changed my perspective so much.",
    "this class was amazing, a true mind-opener , really redefined the way I thought about health and the determinants of health, really helped me see health in light of so many other factors, helped me think about how to best design interventions\/ what really matters when it comes to improving health, showed me how health interconnects to so many other societal factors and how any global health threat is so interconnected to other aspects of global health",
    "I now know the basics of global health, where before I knew nothing about the process, etc.",
    "I got a good overview of the many challenges in global health. We got a decent understanding of resources and responses to those challenges. I learned how to \"connect the dots\" between different determinants of health.",
    "Learned about a wide range of topics in the global health field. Improved writing skills.",
    "I learned how to understand health issues in respect to social determinants of health, how to write a policy brief, how to analyze data critically, and how to understand how solutions to global problems are interdisciplinary and comprehensive, amongst many other things.",
    "I learned not only the biology behind epidemics but how it affects\/is affected by external factors. It made me more aware of the complexities related to how the government and organizations must deal with epidemics and how to communicate with them on paper.",
    "It was a good introduction to a broad spectrum of global health issues. I have a better understanding of some of the key issues in global health, and I know how to communicate these issues effectively.",
    "I learned about general global health burdens and some ways in which to combat them.",
    "Through this course I learned much more about not only the biology behind many of the major communicable and non-communicable diseases across the world but also about the areas in which they are most prevalent and about what is being done to treat and cure them, all of which I found incredibly interesting.",
    "I've learned so much about global health and how to think critically about the reasons behind a person's health condition.",
    "I learned several foundational global health concepts as well as some of the biology of several major diseases. I also became a better writer, as our assignments included different types of writing besides just research papers. In addition, I became better at critically questioning data and thinking about it thoroughly.",
    "I learned about health and what I can do in the field of global health. I was inspired by the amazing teaching and want to explore other possibilities outside of the realm of biology, such as public health, social justice, education, and documentary work.",
    "Reinforced a lot of my previous knowledge on he biology of infectious disease, learned a significant amount on the social determinants of disease, then in the second half of the class, it really turned into more of a survey of all these small facets in global health. By only devoting one lecture to very large topics like women's health it felt as if we could not substantially learn about the subject.",
    "Provided a great interdisciplinary introduction to conceptualize healthcare, and on top of that, delved into more specific immunological concepts that we usually would not pick up from a social science course.",
    "Unbelievable overview of global health - the big three, chronic disease, tropical illnesses, and countless different opinions and lectures from experts in the field.",
    "Developed a strong understanding of the factors influencing health on an individual and systemic level and the interventions that can be performed to improve it",
    "I learned a great breadth of things about global health including the biology of many important diseases and social factors, or determinants.",
    "It was a broad overview of global health work and initiatives, with a particular focus on TB, HIV\/AIDS, and Malaria. I learned about the decision making process and how funding is obtained and allocated.",
    "I have learnt a lot about 'health' that I didn't even knew existed! The class was very specific about diseases e.g. AIDS, malaria etc at the beginning but then was more broad after which was really interesting.",
    "I learned about the broad scope of global health and the multitude of factors that contribute to it. As someone interested in going into this field, I realized that there are many potential paths one can take. I think I definitely gained a lot of knowledge about many global health challenges as well as ways to respond effectively.",
    "I became familiar with various issues that currently exist in the field of global health.",
    "I learned about global health systems. The most relevant thing I learned was that health affects people of different socioeconomic classes and races differently. However, I did **NOT** gain ANY writing skills from this class. I understand that the class was not a WR credit, but there were still a substantial number of writing assignments which Professor Talbert-Slagle and the TFs said they would provide advice on ,but that did not happen.",
    "In this course I gained an understanding of what the field of global health is and how it intersects with other disciplines such as biological sciences, political science, epidemiology, statistics, and environmental science. I also gained fundamental knowledge about the \"big three\" including pathogenesis, prevention, treatment, at risk populations, and successful horizontal programs to address these. We learned essential terminology and concepts to be applied in multiple scenarios such as the treatment cascade and indicators like DALYs. I also gained an understanding of NTDs and NCDs, with a focus on social determinants of health on the individual, community, environmental and political levels. One major takeaway was that assumptions about a geographical place or area of the world cannot be made based on prevalence of disease. Although certain countries in Africa have a high prevalence of STI\/AIDS, that does not mean it is an African disease or in any way defines the region. Conversely although according to the epidemiologic demographic model higher income countries struggle more with NCDs, they are still present in lower income countries.",
    "I gained a solid overview of the field of global health. This peaked my interest in the subject and I would like to take more courses in global health moving forward.",
    "A good overview of global health: HIV\/AIDS, Neglected tropical diseases, non communicable diseases, etc",
    "The class was a great introduction to the field of global health. It taught me how to write in different formats and how to approach health issues.",
    "This class really helped me grasp the concepts involved when surveying global health issues. I found it incredibly informative and fun. It is a survey course, however, so you do not go super in depth into many of the topics, but you do cover a lot.",
    "This course taught me a lot about global health issues and helped me see out of my own personal world and into the world of others. I learned that just because a disease or issue is not affecting me, it does not mean that it is not important. I also learned about many different diseases that I did not know before and more details about diseases that I knew very little about.",
    "I learned so much about social determinants of health that impacted the way health was viewed and emphasized all over the globe. These factors can be applied to all diseases, disorders, etc. and, I was challenged to do so in all the modules of the course.",
    "I learned about the social determinants of health and how important they are to health outcomes."

   "comments": [
    "I liked the lecture format. I wish that so much time wasn't spent on unnecessary tangentially related questions, though. Professor Talbert-Slagle was too kind to not answer any of the questions, but I was annoyed by how many of them were not germain to the lecture. I felt like I missed out on valuable wisdom from Professor Slagle because of the time wasted answering questions. A format should be introduced to limit in class questions (e.g. Piazza), but I understand that the questions came from the engaging atmosphere that Professor Slagle created, which I appreciated. Also I would have loved to have written a grant. I think that's an important skill that will come in handy for many of the students in the class, especially those who want to pursue health. Although if that's the case, please reintroduce the WR??? I spent more time on the writing for this class than I did for my English class because the writing is more intellectually stimulating and the format forces a brevity in language that is in itself a valuable writing skill.",
    "Professor KTS is a very sweet and caring professor. It is clear that she really cares about her students and is very knowledgeable about the course. I would only advise that she cut down the number of questions asked so that we get through all the material, give a rubric for the writing assignments, and focus more on case studies and her own work. It is fun to learn broad themes, but I think what she can offer as a GH professional for many years is so valuable.",
    "Strengths: Talbert-Slagle is the best, most caring professor I've had the pleasure of meeting at Yale. The class is a lecture, but she runs it as a seminar-- by the end of term, none of us were afraid of contributing to her in-class questions. Section was also great-- if Peter is TA-ing again, definitely try to get into his section! The first half of term was taught comprehensively, engagingly, and was a lot of fun. Weaknesses: Some time after Spring Break, we had a TON of guest lecturers, and while their presentations were great, I missed have Professor TS teach us. I understand that she was trying to show us students the breadth and depth of global health, and that her specific area of expertise wouldn't have necessarily lent themselves to allowing us to explore those subjects she herself hadn't studied in depth, but I would have preferred if she taught more in the second half.",
    "We learn a lot, and it is very apparent that Talbert-Slagle tries to touch on every topic within Global Health for at least a short time. The only thing is that sometimes she responds so much to questions the main point of the argument\/lecture can be lost.",
    "Weakness: it doesn't seem to flow that smoothly, assignments were not graded in a timely manner or assigned as predicted by the syllabus",
    "It was an incredibly engaging course that felt like a seminar despite being a lecture. However, a little more structure and a way to access notes (like a powerpoint or diagrams) after class would be more helpful in understanding what we are meant to take away from the lecture.",
    "I thought the scope of the course was really great, covering everything from women's health to mental health to infectious disease. But I felt that administration of the course was slightly scattered. For example, we received instructions from TAs and occasionally the professor quite late (eg when we had many guest speakers for several lectures in a row and never was introduced to the topic before they began to speak). Another example would be the timing for when essays were assigned. It would have been very helpful to have the final essay assigned as soon as the previous policy brief was due, just so students would have more time to work on such a long assignment before other courses' midterms and final exams also caught on (also because it was promised to be assigned earlier than it was). It was just difficult to get information out of administration sometimes.",
    "This course was absolutely fantastic, extremely designed",
    "It was fantastic, particularly due to the engagement of Prof. Talbert-Slagle; my only suggestion would be to distribute guest lecturers more over the course rather than packing them all in toward the end.",
    "Strengths: great professor, fascinating material, interesting readings, wonderful discussion sections Weaknesses: assignments need improvement and clarification, some organization needs work, too many guest lectures, sometimes too shallow of an approach to material",
    "I enjoyed everything about this course",
    "As far as strengths, the course has a nice balance of looking at health issues from biology, policy, environmental, social, political and many other standpoints. Another strength is that the course brings in guest speakers from different areas which is very refreshing and interesting. The writing assignments were also helpful and interesting to work on. A weakness is that sometimes the reading assignments were disorganized and some of the books required for the class were never assigned.",
    "It's an engaging course that emphasized that the course was about humans and their conditions, rather than mere statistics. I felt that we could have spent some more time on learning about the cost-effectiveness of treatments, but overall, it had a wide scope that was in-depth enough for an intro-level course. The guest lectures were overall interesting although some of them were hit-or-miss with the level of engagement.",
    "grading was unclear, structure was often times messy",
    "Strength: material is engaging, the student can get as much out of if as they want Weakness: The class felt a bit disorganized, and the expectations for various assignments weren't too clear. Grading for the class was also a bit more arbitrary than for other classes. Teacher treated the class like a WR credit, even when it wasn't offered. Setting clear expectations from the beginning of the semester would be helpful, and giving students more feedback so that they can improve would be great.",
    "I really love the issue of global health but found this course to be a pretty ineffective overview of the topic. In the beginning we focused really specifically on the biological factors of certain diseases like HIV and later schistosomiasis by going into excruciating detail but then did a complete 180 in the second half of the course and had back to back guest lecturers and did very general overviews of topics like social factors of disease. The structure of the course was simply too disorganized. I felt like every class was either micro-examining one topic or completely brushing over entire fields of research (respective to the first and second half of the course). Moreover, the powerpoint was not really helpful at all given there was little information and when things were written on the board there were so many arrows and circles and crossed out sections that it was near impossible to take notes on a laptop and even taking notes by hand meant trying to read it later was un-doable since the formatting was so confusing. I also thought the papers were just regurgitating information we found on the web and was testing our ability to compile information rather than actually synthesize or analyze. I think it would have to be almost completely transformed next semester with only a few guest lecturers or one class with panel discussions and then a more even flow or topics with a standard level of biological analysis of each topic.",
    "I thought the course was structured very well, with the first half of the material focusing more on biology that becomes widely applicable to many illnesses and the second half featuring mostly guest speakers. I enjoyed the second half given that we learned from experts in the Global Health field about their particular areas of research and efforts to promote global health and well being.",
    "The course was very well taught and engaging, but I wish we had analyzed more specific case studies in class or in discussion section so we could become more familiar with specific interventions and strategies that are used in the field.",
    "I enjoyed the course material and the assignments, as I felt they were diverse and taught us a lot. I also really liked the guest speakers, particularly their diverse backgrounds and experiences, though I wish the guest speakers had been more spaced out during the semester. I think the order that the material is presented in could be improved, as it seemed strange to me that we would learn in-depth about several diseases before addressing the healthcare structures that can address those diseases.",
    "This course is amazing! I learned so much about the Big 3 infectious diseases as well as other diseases like NTDs and NCDs, in addition to global health on a broader level, in relation to pressing needs in the current refugee crisis.",
    "Talbert Slagle obviously cared a great deal for her students and wanted to make the learning environment comfortable for everyone and ensure that all facets of global health were understood. However the class was far too large for the course to be run how she wanted and the course would be very well served by either having a cap or two smaller sections. Because as the class was this semester, the constant questions from students and MANY tangents made it difficult to learn a substantial amount of information or feel like you were receiving anything besides a survey. The guest speakers also were interesting but they made the class feel very haphazard and not organized. Finally it did not seem very productive to have a final paper over a final exam given the structure of the class. The fact that we had so little notice for the paper was quite challenging and the lack of exam gave little motivation to thoroughly engage with the lectures or readings that occurred toward the end of the semester. While the concept of the class is great the way that the course is organized and that students are assessed needs to be rethought.",
    "This was great in tying different aspects of global health together. The guest lecturers were also incredibly engaging and their field of work was extremely inspiring. However, the course often seemed rather disorganised, especially after the midterm. Assignment prompts could also be released earlier to allow for more preparation time.",
    "Strengths: felt like a seminar, very flexible, students had a major voice in discussions and lectures, great guest speakers Weaknesses: few online resources for reference",
    "A bit disorganized at times but very passionate and knowledgeable teacher.",
    "The course is overall strong. I would recommend that Professor Talbert-Slagle limit guest lecturers to 2 per class, instead of giving each guest lecture an entire lecture to themselves (they were all great to hear from, but each could have given a lecture with all the same content in about half the time). I would also recommend having a final instead of a final paper.",
    "Strengths: lecture was very interesting, the assignments were also engaging Weaknesses: All guest lectures were at the end and could have been spread out during the course. There were a lot of readings, almost impossible to do them all for every week!",
    "I loved the class overall. I thought the reading assignments and lectures were all very interesting and engaging. My advice is a few structural shifts. The guest lectures should be more spread out over both halves of the semester. Also, I think that there should be a final as well as a midterm. The midterm increased accountability. Afterwards, I noticed that less people came to lecture and less effort was put into the reading assignments. Also, writing assignments feel very subjective, and make it hard to get a sense of how well I am doing in the class.",
    "Professor Talbert-Slagle is fantastic in terms of willingness to help students, her enthusiasm for learning and the subject, and her approachability\/accessibility. Unfortunately, the course was very disorganized in the sense that the individual units or topics did not relate to each other or necessarily build on each other in a coherent way. In addition, this was even true of the lectures and readings within the same module\/unit. The assignments also seemed somewhat random and vague. They did not directly relate to course content and the instructions for them were loose. Happily, the exam was very fair. The nature of this class as a survey course also made it so that we developed little depth in regards to each of the issues we studied. Though this is generally true of introductory or survey courses, it could have been improved in this case had the course content been better tied together, or if the class followed some form of consistent approach to studying the issues. Altogether, I think everyone in the course generally came away from it with a basic awareness of many problems in global health but wanting more. The same level of awareness could have easily been reached by doing some casual reading on one's own.",
    "Strengths: solid introduction to global health Weaknesses: EXTREMELY disorganized: Professor Talbert-Slagle is a great person and well-intentioned, but lectures were soo disorganized that it wasn't worth coming to class. Also, the guidelines and expectations for writing assignments were EXTREMELY VAGUE! These were the assignments: an HIV paper, a policy memo, and a final paper and op-ed. For all these assignments, NO rubric was given. For a class that emphasizes writing clearly and concisely, why was there not a rubric? I don't understand. I guess KTS comes from a good place, perhaps in wanting us to explore our ~creativity~ with these assignments, but it doesn't work out. KTS and the TFs have a set idea of what they are expecting, and grade HARSHLY because the work that students' submit do not conform to their expectations. But they don't provide a rubric ???? This just doesn't make sense. I wish there had been more transparency with this class.",
    "The course did a great job of presenting a broad overview of the field and demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature. I enjoyed many of the guest lecturers whose work was relevant to the course work, however I felt like too many guest lectures broke up the continuity of the material presented in the course.",
    "Great lectures and TA's. The reading was interesting but the amount could have been lowered to make sure people were able to complete it.",
    "While the professor was wonderful and full of knowledge, I wished that she would treat it more as a lecture and less as a seminar\/section (answer fewer questions!)",
    "Strength: Professor Talbert-Slagle is absolutely AMAZING. She cares about her students and knows her stuff. She gave great overviews of each topic and really tried to engage all students during lecture, even though there were like 100 of us. Weaknesses: Super Vague assignments. Though I appreciate the ability to explore topics and the freedom to write about what I was interested, it was a bit difficult at times to pick a target or craft a thesis because the standards\/rubric was so vague.",
    "The class was very engaging and was very structured at the start. However, the class did not feel as organized after the first midterm. For example, writing assignments were not clear, there were too many guest lectures, and there was n set schedule for assignments. Other weaknesses were that the sections were alright, but did not seem to contribute anything substantial to the class except for clarifying questions about the broad assignments. The class also required us to write in different formats (op-eds, research papers, public health briefs), but did not explain how to approach these type of assignments.",
    "I was not a fan of this course. what could have become a very interesting class was poorly organized, and the second half had no flow at all. we skimmed over a bunch of topics, but I left feeling like I hadn't learned much at all. it could be improved by: -using fewer guest speakers (interrupted the flow of the class, and quality varied). -changing the \"questions in lecture policy\" - I know that Prof T-S really values the fact that we are able to ask questions at any point during the lecture, but I think that the class was far too large for that to work successfully. Instead, it just took us off topic, causing us to rush through other parts of the class which could have been very interesting if more in-depth. -expectations for papers were not clear, and grading was inconsistent across sections.",
    "I think this course should have fewer guest lecturers. Those lectures tended to be scattered a little hard to follow. Further, I think after the midterm, we should cover fewer topics, but take more than one day on each topic we do cover.",
    "The course was really great, especially for a first time course! All classes were very engaging and the readings related to the class a lot. I think that having guest speakers was clumped towards the end of the semester, so I think having some for the beginning topics would have been interesting.",
    "Was a little haphazard scheduling-wise, but Professor Talbert-Slagle is the best of the best."

    "Yes, it is a great intro into global health.",
    "ABSOLUTELY",
    "Yes, Professor Talbert- Slagle is amazing, a wonderful teacher! If you are interested in learning about global health or if you are a global health scholar, you must take this class!",

It was much more interdisciplinary than I expected and I thought it was really wonderful that the course changed my perspective so much. It was a little frustrating that the class seemed unfocused at times, but ultimately \"global health\" comprises so many topics that I thought the course did a good job of covering as much ground as possible.",
    "Take this class, it is a huge mind-opener, you learn a lot, whether you're just curious about global health or seriously considering it as a career, this class will leave you with a lot of information and insight into how complicated and interconnected global health is; the professor is excellent, so much to learn here!",
    "Yes, and I already have!",
    "Yes! It's such an interesting field and fulfilling class.",
    "YES.",
    "Absolutely, this class was interesting and contained material for both scientific and humanities focused students",
    "Definitely! The course is eye opening and inspiring and Professor Talbert Slagle is nothing short of remarkable. You'll learn a lot about global diseases and how to respond to them and gain vast appreciation for how interdisciplinary the changing field of global health is.",
    "YES! Underling global health is essential, no matter what field one enters. From the perspective of a non-bio student, the biology was well-explained, and the non-bio parts (the role of governments, society, etc.) were accessible.",
    "This class would be good for someone with little exposure to global health, and there are many great resources! but do be prepared for assignments that don't necessarily parallel the material assigned in class.

    "Please take this class, it is a life-changing opportunity!",
    "The course concept is great and it is a great intro class if you are interested in getting more involved in global health at Yale. The class needs a lot of organizational work but Kristina is great and I hope that she will take the feedback that she receives to heart and alter the structure of the course to better promote student learning.",
    "Yes",

    "Yes, it's very interesting and fulfilling. It's also important to gain a more global view of the struggles others go through and the health threats to this world and how we can address them.",
    "If interested in global health, yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Definitely! It is a great class, even if you initially did not know much about health and disease (e.g. not a pre-med student).",
    "I would definitely recommend! This has been one of my favorite classes so far at Yale. It really opened my eyes to the range of possibilities in the field of global health.

The nature of this class as a survey course also made it so that we developed little depth in regards to each of the issues we studied. Though this is generally true of introductory or survey courses, it could have been improved in this case had the course content been better tied together, or if the class followed some form of consistent approach to studying the issues. Altogether, I think everyone in the course generally came away from it with a basic awareness of many problems in global health but wanting more. The same level of awareness could have easily been reached by doing some casual reading on one's own. Hopefully the course will improve next year, since this was the first time that it was taught, and in that case I would recommend it because I believe there was a lot of potential (and it seems the Professor realized that).",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to another student. I think this was one of the worst classes at Yale I've ever taken, if not the worse. It was so poorly organized with a lack of transparency regarding what was expected for writing assignments and how assignments were graded. One of my friends literally broke down crying during office hours out of frustration with the lack of transparency with this class.",
    "Yes especially if they are interested in the global health scholars program",
    "Yes! I strongly recommend this to anyone interested in medicine, public\/global health, and international diplomacy.",
    "YES. This course is so interesting and gives such a great overview of health topics. Professor talbert slagle is a GEM. She genuinely cares, not only for her students, but also the people behind the health issues she lectures about. She's super approachable and easy to talk to if you want essay help or if you just want to talk about health in general! The material itself felt a bit rushed at times, especially when we learned about mental health and substance abuse, but I guess that's to be expected when you're trying to cover the entirety of global health in a semester. I also appreciated the guest speakers she brought in! They were so engaging and super high level type experts in their respective fields so it was nice to be able to talk to them and get their input on things. Just beware of vague essay prompts and make sure to run an outline or ideas by your TA before you begin writing.",
    "If you are interested in global health this class can give you a brief introduction. This was the first year the professor taught the class, so it is likely that it will be more organized next year.",
    "Absolutely! Great class with a great professor who really cares about her students.",
    "yes, take it learn about Global health but be warned they graded the midterm paper after the semester ended and they are very unclear about grading in the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it includes a lot of biology as well as knowledge of public health issues. I think the topics were interrelated very well.",
    "Definitely. It is taught by an amazing professor who really cares about her students, and the course itself is very interesting and applicable."
