   "comments": [
    "This is a great class to focus on a long term self directed project in digital photography. Take it with Meredith--she's a great instructor!",
    "This class is for students who would like to focus on their own photography project over the semester as it provides both freedom and time for students to pursue their own interests. Take it if you have a project in mind, and the amount you get depends on how much time and effort you've put in.",
    "ART 338 is a fantastic way to continue to hone your personal photographic practice as well as understand contemporary photography as a whole. The class gives you the opportunity to create a body of work as well as learn how to write about and sequence your work. If you are interested in photography and have taken and enjoyed other photography classes, this is a great way to continue to grow as an artist."
