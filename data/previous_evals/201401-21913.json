    "Senior research is one of the best parts of being an applied physics major. Choose something your interested in and run with it!",
    "Depends who your mentor is. Make sure your project is well-organized with your PI and then you get a grad student who is involved and responsive.",
    "It's research. Take it.",
    "Most of the time for Physics or Applied Physics senior projects, you \"find a lab\" that has \"similar research topics to your interests\". You then \"get paired with a graduate student\" and then all your work is done in that context. My project was completely different. There was no lab at Yale associated with what I wanted to do and investigate...so I went to Prof. Roman Kuc and we designed a project based on a problem I wanted to investigate. He was a great advisor and mentor! I did my senior project on a \"stringless violin\". I was trying to figure out a way to introduce artificial vibrations into a violin body using an actuator and mimic the behavior of a real violin. The idea being that one could transmit the signal of a string a of a real violin across the internet to the another \"surrogate violin\" located elsewhere and hear the sound of the instrument as though it were playing live! For this project, I didn't have a graduate student that I was paired with. I would meet with Prof. Kuc every week, discuss the theory and experiments, then walk down to the CEID to machine the parts with Prof. Larry Wilen. I did all the data acquisition and analysis myself and to be honest, it was really fun being in control of my own experiment and not leave that responsibility to a \"grad student\". It was an experiment that I thought of and now had the chance to investigate. I've had two \"typical\" lab experiences in nanotechnology in the past and it was a real liberating experience to explore something I wanted to do myself and on my own terms!"
