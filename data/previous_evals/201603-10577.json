   "comments": [
    "I improved my written Chinese a lot through this class, and feel more comfortable speaking Mandarin Chinese. I also became more familiar with modern Chinese culture, idioms, and even Chinese History from Professor Su's stories.",
    "I was able to expand on my Chinese skills that I learned at my house while learning some basics about modern Chinese culture.",
    "After a gap year studying Chinese in China, CHNS 162 was a great way to stay engaged with the language at a comfortable level and not lose my newly gained abilities. The course focused on daily topics that delve into societal issues (e.g. food safety, ethics of makeup industry, rural schooling, migrant children's education), but the overall difficulty of material itself was not bad for anyone who has lived in China.",
    "I improved my Chinese writing, oral, and reading skills.",
    "My command of advanced chinese has increased considerably since beginning the course",
    "I developed a much greater breadth of character recognition and writing. Also learned a lot more about Chinese culture and general Chinese language, especially the difference between abstract thought and more concrete ideas. I feel like I gained skills to be able to converse in Chinese rather easily and will be able to talk about many things.",
    "This Chinese course teaches reading, writing, speaking, and to some extent listening skills for heritage and advanced learners. The topics discussed range from food, flowers, and music to successful entrepreneurs and the lack of support for children of farmers. All of these subjects teach Chinese culture along with the advanced vocabulary."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Textbook is good, relatively low workload Weakness: Would like to see less fluffy material in the Textbook (more 163-esque)",
    "Strength: Professor Su adds to the class with stories that illustrate the deeper meaning behind phrases.",
    "The course is very structured around the textbook (a pretty good one, though), with minimal to no outside sources to supplement our learning. The textbook readings are not that challenging for L6 Chinese, as they are written for foreigners, so I wish we had been exposed to more \"real\" Chinese media (e.g. journals, news broadcasts) to challenge our comprehension a bit more. That being said, because we just used the textbook our schedule was very regular and predictable, so it was easy to be on top of the work and plan ahead. And by far the best part about this class is having Su Laoshi! He is the most caring, kind, knowledgeable, funny, cool teacher I've ever had; he was flexible with deadlines when times got tough, told us forbidden stories about the Cultural Revolution, and make it a joy to come to class.",
    "The course's dictation requirements are good for improving writing skills, but the reading material could have been more engaging. It would be nice to include short fiction or other interesting reading material into the course.",
    "I feel that I struggled with learning to handwrite characters and to make my way through reading passages",
    "Strengths: The course is taught be a very motivated and related professor. It was structured in a predictable and manageable way so that nothing was too surprising and everything was very manageable to get done. Weaknesses: Outside of class there was not too much aid and help. And especially coming from without Yale chinese education, it was difficult to understand at first what was expected.",
    "This course was very organized: each unit had roughly the same schedule and structure. The deadlines were not very strict, so as long as students completed each units' assignments before beginning the next one, that was fine. Su Laoshi was an excellent teacher (more below). There is not much I would suggest for improvement. The only thing was that due to the transition from Classes to Canvas, class materials were not easily accessible online.",
    "This course provides a fun and lively environment for practicing advanced spoken and written Chinese. I would not, however, recommend this course for any student that still feels he or she needs to continue building their foundational Chinese skills as there is not very much room (given the way the class is designed) to help facilitate that, unless you are willing to make time outside of class to meet with the instructor."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you want to improve your Chinese and you test into 162 or on track for this class, I absolutely recommend it. Your written Chinese will improve so much from the weekly dictations and really learn a lot from Professor Su.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. As mentioned, you learn a lot about Chinese culture and about the deeper meaning behind some of the phrases you hear in this class.",
    "Definitely! If you'd like a class with a nice structure and not too much work to keep up (and maybe slightly improve) your Chinese, take 162. And if you take Chinese at Yale, you just HAVE to take a course with Su Laoshi at some point! He really is the best.",
    "I recommend this course to any student serious about improving their mastery of Chinese.",
    "Absolutely. The teaching quality of Su Wei is phenomenal and the class is incredibly entertaining and beneficial for advanced Chinese learners",
    "Yes, even though you may seemed challenged by the level, the professor makes everything very relatable in class and facilitates practice, especially practice that strengthens reflexes. You will have to do a lot of the learning by yourself, but the classes are great to immerse yourself in an environment where Chinese is the only thing spoken.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student looking for a slightly challenging class to learn Mandarin Chinese. I not only improved my speaking, reading, and writing, I also made great friends and met an extremely smart and kind instructor."
