   "comments": [
    "How to read French literature closely; the mechanisms of translating (French to English); finding the right balance between consistency and understandability in translation",
    "Not only do I have much more confidence is translating texts from French to English, but I also feel that my French grammar improved and vocabulary expanded. I have a solid grasp on the nuances of French syntax, idioms, and tone.",
    "I learned how to translate and interpret French texts into English, and the different ways in which language must be conveyed based on cultural, grammatical, and social structures.",
    "Tools for translating French literary texts into English ranging from the purely syntactical and grammatical to the highest levels of voice, context, and style.",
    "A translator's job is more than finding the exact meanings of words and correlating them with their English counterparts. You need to account for artistic tone and other literary stylistic choices that the author makes, while still keeping the original intentions of the author. It's actually really difficult to balance these different criteria when translating, and extremely rewarding when you get it right (although there is never really only one right answer!).",
    "I developed reading skills, specifically close reading with attention to every detail. I learned how to question the author's (and my own) word choice, syntax, and use of literary devices. Ultimately, I learned how to appreciate translation as an art form of its own."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: workshop style; very fun readings; tight knit class; cultural conversations Weaknesses: could have used a more structured guideline for what the instructor likes and doesnt like in translations",
    "The course was wonderful. The work load was manageable, the in-class workshops were really engaging and fun. I don't see any way it could be improved!",
    "Strengths are the format of working on a rough draft, then talking about it in class, then submitting a final translation. Weaknesses is that there's only one individual translation assignment (the final) so you might not have any idea about how you're doing, and grading is extremely unclear.",
    "This course was very helpful, in that it gave me a better understanding of how the French language is written and structured. The course is taught in English though, so its less of an opportunity to work on conversational French.",
    "I absolutely loved the seminar format of this class: each week, we would either discuss as a full group or pair up to discuss drafts of our translations. Hearing from my classmates was both helpful and so much fun! It also truly got across that there is never one correct translation, and different people might understand the authors voice differently. I also loved that for our final project, we were able to choose what we wanted to translate. I really dont feel that there is much to be improved about this course!",
    "Professor Waters is a joy to work with and brings so much enthusiasm to the class. She is the real deal (a professional translator, and very good at what she does) and will guide you down the right path, although sometimes there isn't enough time in class for everyone to have the individual focus and attention they deserve in order to completely iron out their inconsistencies. The texts chosen by the professor are always extremely well-written and challenging - they usually contain very niche and quirky uses of language which trains you in tackling those trickier phrases and words. It would have been nice to have a clearer, more updated syllabus with assignments posted on canvas. Sometimes it was a little unclear as to what was supposed to be handed in next class, but Professor Waters was always very available over email to make up for it.",
    "This course is a lot of fun! Prof. Waters always chose interesting, challenging, and thought-provoking works of writing. We were given a lot of room to explore different ways of translating. The class was quite close-knit, allowing students to befriend each other. I do wish that we got a more solid grade feedback prior to the midterm date. (Prof. Waters's comments were helpful, but did not readily reveal how well we were doing as translators)"

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The class is taught in English but your reading of French literature will immensely improve through the process of translation. An overall fun and engaging class.",
    "Yes! Translating is an extremely practical skill, and the course is genuinely a joy. Professor Waters always keeps in fun and engaging.",
    "Yes- this course is really great for majors and non-majors. It gives you a chance to read works from a lot of interesting contemporary French authors, and to see how the translation process works in literature.",
    "If youre interested in gaining a deeper understanding of Frenchand Englishabsolutely! Translation is so much fun and very satisfyingyoull definitely notice how you improve over the course of the semester. Keep in mind, though, that this is a class mainly taught in English, so if youre looking to sharpen your French speaking skills specifically, this isnt the right place for you. It will help a lot with reading comprehension, though!",
    "YEP. The L5 course to take if you want to maintain your language skills and think creatively but don't need to be doing an intensive 5-days-a-week-with-a-9am-start-time course. This course rocks especially if you want to dive into some wacky French writing. You'll gain some really key insights about French as a language compared to English and what it means to be a professional translator (beyond just literal translation!). Professor Waters also includes funny little moments throughout the course and her seminars which liven the atmosphere a bit. The workload is consistent and manageable (you translate 1 4-5 page extract a week, and go over corrections on your draft from last week's, which you note down in class).",
    "This a fun course worth exploring! Translating is really cool, although it's not everyone's cup of tea. Regardless, this course really pushes you to read passages very closely, paying a lot of attention to details. Prof. Waters knows how to make the class feel close-knit, and it feels like a community. However, I do wish that she (and other French professors) spent time talking about the problematics of the works we translated. Some of the works had problematic parts that I think should have been discussed. Perhaps there can be more discussion about how different senses of political correctness plays into translating..."
