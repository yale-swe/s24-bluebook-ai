    "I learned a lot about ways to approach mechanistic problems, as well as problems in chemistry in general.",
    "The most important thing I learned was how to think about the big picture of mechanistic processes and the analysis of results. If one were to decide to conduct a mechanistic study, is it feasible? Mechanisms are really hard (but interesting!) to understand. If you go down the rabbit hole, make sure you understand and think about what can feasibly be learned.",
    "This course definitely expanded how I think about reaction mechanisms, both thermodynamics and kinetics. I feel like my understanding of chemistry has shifted (maybe towards feeling like I know even less, but that is okay), and this course pushed me to conceptualize chemical reactions in new ways while also building on the knowledge I already had."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths-lots of critical thinking, especially during the problem sets. Weaknesses- I wasn't sure how to possibly prepare before class, which was fine ( I still learned a lot). It would be great if either the lecture notes (or Jim's draft of the notes?) were posted so students could skim and see what was going to be covered. Or for example, for electrochem, suggesting we read the Dempsey paper before class could create some really useful class discussions. Strengths- It was very useful when we got to ask about the homework in class.",
    "Jim's lectures and problem sets were interesting and engaging, but sometimes wandered around. I would have appreciated more organization and focus and a clearer objective of what we were supposed to be taking away from certain lectures."

    "The workload is fair and every assignment had a purpose. The problem sets take a long time, but I also feel like I learned a lot by doing them. The same is true from the final proposal project.",
    "Absolutely, this course changed the way I think about mechanistic studies and altered how I read literature."
