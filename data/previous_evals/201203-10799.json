    "It was a wonderful course everyone should take, regardless of whether you are a genetics PhD or not. You will learn a lot about analysis and scientific thinking and the discussions will provide a foundation for learning about other people's lab experiences, such as those working on model organisms versus those working on humans.",
    "I would strongly recommend!",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to anyone in the biological sciences as inevitably anybody in the BBS will have to put at least some of the skills learned in this class to use.",
    "I would recommend this class, it was a good overview of genetic techniques.",
    "Probably not...I didnt really learn much in the class",
    "Very very helpful!",
    "A lot of basics, but worth knowing and relearning.",
    "I will recommend to take another basic genetics course before taking this class."
