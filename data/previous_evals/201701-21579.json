    "absolutely none",
    "None. This class benefited me very little.",
    "This class really opened my mind to International Relation theory and International Security. I gained a lot of insight into how foreign affairs works, how the international system runs, and how all of this interacts with security. I was able to learn theories that I could apply to case studies throughout history and in today's world.",
    "Basic overview of International Security frameworks. I feel like a lot of the frameworks are transferable to real life situations. Pretty interesting.",
    "I learned a lot about the different theories that explain the world we live in with the different facets of diplomacy, war and security.",
    "Ability to analyze conflicts and identify\/argue for different concepts and trends through history & current events",
    "Not many, it was mainly memorization.",
    "I learned a great deal about specific theories and schools of thought pertaining to International Relations and Security, and how to apply those theories to real world examples.",
    "theories of security, elements of interstate, civil and cyber war",
    "Gained a basic but comprehensive understanding of theories of international politics.",
    "I learned about the two main schools of IR thought, realism and liberalism, and the different theories they encompass.",
    "This course taught me exactly what I was hoping to learn -- theories of warfare, how they've changed with the advent of new technology, and relevant real world examples to accompany everything.",
    "Lots of great history",
    "You learn mainly about the theories behind how international security politics work and how states come to decisions about security and war.",
    "Gained knowledge about the various theories concerning international conflict and its causes, as well as grand theories on the state of the world and international relations.",
    "I learned alot about modern day international security and the aspects and characteristics of what security is in general. I recommend a polysci student to take this course.",
    "In this class, I received an introduction to International Relations theory and the many facets of International security. We got exposure through lecture, readings, and section discussion, and had practice writing through the two short papers."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The midterm exam format does not test any analytical ability to engage with the material, rather only tests very specific terms discussed in lecture.",
    "A little more similarity between the sections and grading within them.",
    "Strengths: decent material and interesting lectures Weaknesses: assessments and their grading was the most arbitrary and unpredictable that i have ever seen in my academic career",
    "The strengths of the course pale in comparison to the weaknesses. The class is unorganized, the professor is smug and unapproachable, the TA's are unhelpful and not even willing the help. The course content itself is not engaging (international security should focus on more than just the United States).",
    "The midterm was definitely not designed to text how well students comprehended the material, only how well they could memorize really small details from lectures. It was really frustrating because as someone who had been to every class and did all the readings, I felt the grades that I got (and that a lot of my friends got) were not reflective of the information we knew. Super disappointing. At least the papers help you showcase your comprehension a bit more.",
    "No weaknesses. The whole class was awesome and Professor Kocher made it interesting and highly engaging making me want to go to class every time.",
    "The exam format must be changed. It's absurd that the two exams taken during the course of the semester \"test\" knowledge through ten one-word or one-sentence questions. Students are given no opportunity to explain their understanding and synthesis of the material.",
    "Lecture slides were not posted, and the format and content of the midterm was never discussed in either class or section. This made it extremely difficult to study for.",
    "Sometimes dry, especially lecture. Maybe use some pictures or videos to help us understand, rather than incredibly bland powerpoint slides.",
    "Very interesting topic. Only problem is thay slides are not posted online and it gets hard to fill notes.",
    "There are many weaknesses in this course, and frankly I wish I had taken another course because this was a waste of a class. Prof Kocher is a very clear lecturer and organizes his lectures in a well-structured manner, but he doesn't seem to know a lot about the material in any greater depth than what we learn from the readings. If you ask a question in class, he will probably not be able to provide a satisfactory answer, probably because he doesn't know enough about the content of your question. That being said, the lectures don't have a lot of substance or depth and are basically a re-hash of the readings. The midterm is basically meaningless, and I frankly do not know why Prof Kocher writes his exams in the way that he does. The questions asked on the mid term and final exam are meaningless questions that have no substance - they are merely there to see if you have done your reading or not, rather than to see if you have thought about what you have learned from your readings and lectures. In short, the midterm and final exams are shallow, and they have nothing to do with what is to be meaningfully reaped from the class's material. The section discussion is also worthless and do not spur any meaningful discussion. Sections are a yet another re-hash of the readings, and the TAs just want to know if you have taken the main ideas from the readings. Overall, I was very disappointed with this class, and particularly with Prof Kocher's teaching style and his exams.",
    "Strengths is the material. Weakness is the way it is taught. There is no encouragement to blend theories and actually apply them but merely to understand them.",
    "The course provides a good overview of theory, but could be improved by using more practical examples.",
    "Not a ton of work, challenge in theoretical material. straightforward tests but require basically memorizing lectures",
    "Good broad overview of topics in international security Weaknesses: exams were poorly designed, tested too specific facts instead of theories that were discussed for a large part of class, especially for the first midterm. The final was okay but testing quotes that were not explicitly discussed in class or in section also seemed unfair. They were not on the slides.",
    "An expansive view of the topic; however, sections could be better used arguing the merits of the different ideas presented.",
    "Lectures were thorough, but felt a little slow. When the professor said the midterm and final should be very straightforward and that if you've attended lectures they should be no problem, that was only partially true. You also had to thoroughly know the slides and readings, especially details for the slides.",
    "I thought the course was really fair in that if you went to class, the material that would be on the test was presented to you there in a clear and understandable manner.",
    "Taught very well",
    "The testing in this course was difficultthe professor valued memorization rather than critical thinking.",
    "It is good and interesting information, however, I think that a weakness is that the information can become confusing and hard to sort when it is all presented together.",
    "The course could have been a LITTLE more in-depth. Strong TA's. Lecture was weak, slow-paced. The class also suffers from a problem in which expectations aren't clearly managed. The professor made it sound like the midterm would be very easy then quizzed us on excerpts, author names, etc. I know I personally would have done much better if I had known what was expected of me.",
    "strengths are that it is a good lecturer. more modern day material so really helpful to make certain connections. TA are helpful and good sources. Tough grading so be careful. You either know the answer or you dont and cant word around the answers.",
    "This course is very well structured. The lectures are arranged in a way that allows for a clear progression through related and increasingly nuanced material. The combination of lecture and readings provide a wonderful introduction to the subject from many different angles, and the balance between formal writing assessment (two essays) and assessment of content (exams) was very effective. The section provides a useful companion to the lecture."

   "comments": [
    "Interesting topic, TA made it difficult",
    "Absolutely not. The grading of this course was erratic, unfair, and did not assess your knowledge of the course. Rather, it tested if you could use the correct verb the professor used to describe a topic in class.",
    "It was more difficult than I expected. If you keep up with readings it should be pretty straightforward. Also, make sure you go to class.",
    "Avoid this class. I don't believe it will be offered again because Kocher is leaving, but if it is offered, stay away. The class is extremely unorganized, the lectures are extremely boring, and the content is not engaging. Kocher may be a nice person, but as a professor he seems unapproachable and offstandish. The TA's do the bare minimum and do not seem to care about the course or the students. And while the course itself is terrible, the workload is much higher than expected. The midterm is extremely arbitrary it asks you to recite random facts from the reading and lecture that show little about your overall understanding of the content and you get feedback on the papers about a month after you submit them, even if you submit them on time.",
    "This class has the ideal structure. Readings are reasonable in length and very interesting. Lecture is short, clear, and engaging. There are a few papers, but expectations are clear and the paper is facilitated for creativity. The midterm and final are very easy and straight-forward with absolutely correct answers. Ideal in many ways, and Kocher is great. My only gripe is with section. It's unnecessary and a waste of time. It's a review of some curriculum, so if you've done the readings you don't need to go and if you haven't done the readings you don't contribute anything. Waste of 50 minutes and should definitely be changed.",
    "International Security was one of my favorite classes at yale thus far (rising senior). It was truly interesting material and the lectures were engaging and easy to follow. Although the midterm and final were difficult, the essays were interesting and the TA's were very willing to help you. Professor Kocher was truly an amazing teacher and one that will be missed. But I have no doubt that another international security scholar, that we have at Yale, will teach this next. Workload was the same as compared to others but highly reccomend for anyone of any major!",
    "It's interesting, but learn how to take the exams.",
    "No would not recommend",
    "This class is a good course for anyone looking to establish a theoretical foundation for international security studies. Many students don't take the class seriously because of its reputation as a gut, which can make section pretty dull; however, the TAs are great and the readings are really interesting. Definitely a great class for beginners to international relations",
    "Yes. Easy, pretty interesting. I don't know what kind of grade he is handing out, but its not a lot of work and it stuff people should know, especially in our international climate.",
    "Yes, as it is very relevant to today's world, and it is not too difficult.",
    "Classic course, take it",
    "This class is a huge disappointment and a waste of class. Do not take it unless you are a poli sci major who desperately needs an international relations credit. Prof Kocher is a good lecturer, but there is no substance in the lectures and the sections are a waste of time that do not spur any meaningful discussion. If you have previously taken a class on international relations theory, you will learn nothing new from this class.",
    "I would not recommend this course because while the subject matter is interesting, lectures are not. And even if you do the work for the class, the exams do not set you up for success, regardless of how well you know the material.",
    "No",
    "This is a good course to get a wide overview of International Relations theories in a relatively low stakes class, although the exams can be pretty difficult. If you come to class and skim the readings you should be okay.",
    "Good political science class if you like theoretical understanding + practice examples. would be helpful to have taken a war history class",
    "International Security is a great course to introduce you to IR. It's well organized, well taught, and touches on a number of important topics.",
    "Yes, a must have for political science and IR scholars.",
    "Yes, but I don't think it will be taught again. It feels very laid back, but you actually need to be very on-top of the material throughout the semester. Lectures were thorough, but felt a little slow. When the professor said the midterm and final should be very straightforward and that if you've attended lectures they should be no problem, that was only partially true. You also had to thoroughly know the slides and readings, especially details for the slides. I don't think this course will be taught again.",
    "Yes, really interesting class",
    "Great intro class",
    "If you are interested in theoretical political science then this might be a good class to take, if not I'd recommend taking another class. There's not that big of a focus on curent events and there are some references to historic events (like how different theories of war explain the occurence of WWI and WWII). I think this is a good class to take Credit\/D, I wasn't really invested in the material and the workload is very low if you're just looking for an extra credit. Prof Kocher is a nice lecturer who always offers his own reinterpretation of the theories so his lectures are interesting!",
    "This course was okay. It is very theory based, and how the theories are applied to international politics. The workload is alright, essays are not bad, the midterm and final questions are specific however and can be tricky.",
    "Ultimately no. The lectures were slow, and though the course material was interesting I don't see it impacting my future life or being very applicable in general.",
    "Yes i would recommend because its useful for the world. You gather another worldview through the class and a different lens.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The material is extremely interesting and will give you a window into the world of international politics. It is also approachable for a student with no background in the subject, so do not be deterred from taking this class if you don't have experience in IR. The expectations of the course are very clear and laid out right from the beginning - lecture, readings, section, two short papers (5 pages), and the midterm\/final. The midterm and final are very manageable if you go to class and do the readings."
