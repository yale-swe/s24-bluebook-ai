    "Miki is one of the best lecturers I have had during my time at Yale. Math majors will not want to pass this class up!",
    "Yes yes yes yesyesyesyes. Miki is the best math professor I have ever had. The material is challenging, but really interesting, and Miki does a great job of presenting it carefully. She's always available to answer questions in class, office hours, or via email. If you are a math major you should absolutely take this class.",
    "Definitely a must take course for anyone who is interested in algebra and its applications. The material is quite interesting and can be used to solve some cool problems in perhaps unexpected ways. Miki is a great lecturer and if you're lucky you might even get to hear her sing about simple groups.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course is a great option for anyone pursuing the math major or any other student that is interested.",
    "Every single math major should take this class with Miki. It was without a doubt the best math class I've taken thus far at Yale. You will learn a lot about a beautiful topic, and Miki makes the material engaging and approachable. Tests are hard, but grading is fair and I even found myself really enjoying the problem sets.",
    "Yes!!!! This is an amazing class. First of all, the material is extremely interesting and important. You'll finally see some of the most interesting consequences of abstract algebra \/ group theory, proving things like unsolvability of the quintic (i.e. why there is no quintic formula for the general degree 5 polynomial), impossibility proofs (you can't trisect angles, square circles, etc), algebraic proof of fundamental theorem of algebra, etc. The professor is an extremely good teacher, very funny (in a hilarious sassy way!), friendly, and just makes things really, really fun. She's also kind of crazy. She sings, draws cats randomly, dismisses analysis hilariously, jumps onto tables, puts dinosaur stickers on stuff (she made sure to plop a little egg beside the pterodactyls) and does other crazy stuff. PSets are fun, and exams are suuuuper reasonable compared to Casson's (if you took 350 with Casson, you are very well prepared for this class). Do not miss out.",
    "Recommended if you're interested in more algebra after 350 and are willing to put in a good amount of time. Really cool material, but it's quite difficult.",
    "Standard introductory course to Galois Theory. The homeworks are all pretty short, and the exams are also straightforward. Miki is a great lecturer, and looks intimidating but is actually really nice. It's nice stuff, so you should take it.",
    "Math 370 is definitely one of the better math courses I've taken at Yale. Miki is amazing at the chalkboard, and while she can be intimidating at first she is really good about answering questions without making people feel silly for asking them. Galois theory itself is also just really cool stuff--even if you think algebra isn't that interesting, seeing the nifty ways that group theory and field theory fit together is still very fun, and was very satisfying.",
    "good course. not easy",
    "This is a good class for any math major to take.",
    "The subject of Galois theory is truly fascinating and beautiful, and this course does a good job taking you the whole subject: motivations, definitions, examples, all building up to the major theorems and results. So in this way, it's very satisfying. Miki's really great. She's got a lot of energy, and she really loves the subject. She gives the class a lot of life! She is very approachable, and she's always willing to make time to meet with you (or the class) to help out. She lectures pretty quickly, especially considering she always explains a little more than she writes (as do most lecturers), so it can be easy to miss some of the explanations. I don't think this is a bad thing, though: I think it just means that she expects a little more attention and active listening out of her students. Consider yourself warned! Also, I should mention now (and Miki does on the first day), that you should really have a solid grasp on finite groups before taking this class. I would definitely do some review even if you took Casson's 350. I would definitely want to be comfortable with the class equation, the Sylow theorems, Cauchy's theorem, the structure theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, direct products, semi-direct products, and in general the ways in which subgroups can sit inside their parent groups. Miki will definitely help you with groups if you need it, though!",
    "Galois theory is really cool and Miki is good at teaching it. You should take it, especially if you want to learn about geometric constructions or why there's no general equation for quintics or higher.",
    "Galois theory is a beautiful subject and it's a treat to have a class with Miki! Definitely good to take right after 350 so that you remember everything.",
    "Math 370 is a fantastic course! The material is very cool -- all of the fun impossibility results (geometric problems of antiquity, polygon constructions, quintic formula) fall out from some beautiful algebraic framework that ties together polynomials and the complex numbers. What really makes the course though, is that Miki is a wonderful instructor! Highly recommend it."
