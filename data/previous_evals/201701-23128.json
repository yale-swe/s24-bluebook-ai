    "I gained so many skills in this course. I was especially appreciative of learning how to do different design roles, how to devise new work, and how to organize an ensemble.",
    "Both theoretical and practical knowledge of devised theater; creating a piece of theater using unconventional methods that focused on design.",
    "If I could sum up the skills, knowledge, and insights I developed by taking this course into this tiny little box, I absolutely would, but this class gave me so much I'm not sure this box can contain it. I learned about all different types of design and manipulations of it. I truly feel as though I've experienced collaboration in an academic setting for the first time in my Yale career. I've learned to listen and value other people's opinions while also voicing my own. This course gave me life skills on top of the academic ones. Incredible course.",

   "comments": [
    "This class literally has no weakness. It was truly wonderful and its strength is how much liberty the professors give you to create and collaborate with your peers.",
    "Hard to say really since I feel like the class is very dependent on the people in it. For our course, we had a very strong group willing to throw out ideas and compromise when necessary. I think maybe jumping right into the material right at the beginning and concentrating more on \"doing\" than talking about doing would benefit the course and potentially get things on track earlier on!",
    "I thought this course was really well planned, especially for being the first time ever taught. I was a little sad we didn't have time for more 'teaching' moments, those sort of stopped as we focused more on our etudes and performances. Also it may have been nice to spend more time in the whitney rehearsing, because discovering the space in which we were performing was always an important part of our work."

   "comments": [
    "YES!!!!! If you are a creator and want to know what it means to be a total theatre maker here then YES take this course you will not regret it.",
    "This course is really incredible, but I think it's suited to a certain kind of student. First, you have to be willing to put your traditional \"role\" in theater aside. If you're an actor, be prepared to learn how to do lighting and sound. If you're a producer, you might turn into a choreographer at some point. If you're a sound designer, you will definitely work your way onto the stage. You also have to be willing to put in the work. Completing the \"etudes\" as they're called requires a certain time commitment (I would say 3-4 hours outside of class per week), but if you think about this time commitment as the rehearsal time for the show, it's really not that much in perspective. Nathan and Deb are really amazing about giving you prompts to generate material and then also letting you steer the ship. This class provides so many incredible opportunities to do... literally whatever you want. It was honestly the most fulfilling process that I've been a part of at Yale. You learn so much about so many different disciplines in the theater, and how important all of them are to performance. I can't recommend it enough.",
    "YES! Take it!!!! It's such an incredible course with incredible professors. You get to know people so well but also get to create a piece of theater that you can be incredibly proud of at the end of it all. No other class at Yale is similar to this one in any way. Seriously, take it. You won't regret it one bit.",
    "I'm not sure if this course will ever be offered again at Yale, but if it is you should definitely take it if you are interested in experimental theater, devised performance, and exploring theater design outside of regular trappings of text and narrative. Nathan and Deb are a dream team, but ultimately the work created in class is led by the ensemble which is very exciting."
