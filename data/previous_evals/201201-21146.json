   "comments": [
    "Overview of current world events via student presentations",
    "yup",
    "I strongly recommend other students to take the class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it as a graduate level survey course on US foreign policy and international relations from the American point of view.For students with strong background in IR, the course can also be a fun change of pace: not everybody wants 5 classes with 30 page papers due in May.",
    "An invigorating course, with great people. A chance to learn about critical security issues from an expert and tome of living knowledge.Yes, I would recommend this course, because of its practical nature and the level of discussion the readings, classmates, and professor bring to the table each week.",
    "The course is a discussion of the most salient issues in contemporary United States foreign policy. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to learn from a venerable practitioner.",
    "This is the marquee course of Yale's IR program, and a terrific offering for Yale undergraduates with an interest in foreign policy. It helps if you have studied grand strategy or know the essentials of historical diplomacy as a foreground. The class is meant to train prospective diplomats, and I certainly feel as if I could pass muster on any foreign service exam set before me after competing this course. \u00a0Course expectations were eminently reasonable: two 12 page papers and a presentation in class. These assessments allowed for depth in what is otherwise a broad geographical survey of American foreign policy. Yet despite its breadth, I never left seminar unsatisfied. Amb Negroponte does a terrific job navigating discussions to hit the core strategic points, and his rich anecdotes offered great color. On the whole, amazing class not to miss!",
    "YES absolutely",
    "Yes I would - I learned quite a bit and enjoyed the culture of the class, very intellectual and interesting.",
    "Excellent course; highly recommended.",
    "It's a survey course that touches on the relevant issues in U.S. foreign policy. The strength of the course is derived from connecting the larger issues to one another and getting the insights of the Professor based on his extensive experiences.",
    "Yes. It's a useful look at how policymakers think and the top issues on their minds. I found Professor Negroponte's habit of listing the top 5 priorities of each country we studied to be a useful exercise.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it",
    "Broad sweep intros to different issues in American foreign policy. Very general however."

   "comments": [
    "This course was outside my graduation requirements",
    "yup",
    "The class helped me deepen my understanding of US foreign policy. I am very satisfied with the class.",
    "Its more of a generalist class, so it strikes me that the course is intended to introduce rather than deepen. Even so, the breadth of topics covered means that everybody walks away having learned something.",
    "This course did not deepen my degree discipline at Yale, but helped me solidify my knowledge and career desires post-Yale.",
    "It contributed very much, as it is important to be knowledge of cuurent events in order to give the best policy advice possible.",
    "As noted above, I feel more than ready for the foreign service exam after this course. Regardless, the tour of America's regional security interests offered a good macroscopic vantage for my research interests, and also, for potential ventures I am considering in international business. In short: Yes!",
    "For me, it broadened my knowledge in an area I do not get to focus on inmy graduate work, thus it was incredibly helpful in informing my career development.",
    "Very much so; it will be very useful down the road.",
    "This was a great course to take in my final term as an IR student in tying together important contemporary themes.",
    "See above.",
    "Yes, very helpful for my profession",
    "Yes it kept me on pace with contemporary issues in ir. very helpful."
