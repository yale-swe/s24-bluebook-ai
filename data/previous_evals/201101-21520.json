    "I would sincerely recommend this class to anyone who's interested. It will revolutionize your ideas about what dance and choreography. You explore Balanchine, Trisha Brown, modern multimedia compositions, Katherine Dunham and everything in between. You post a weekly blog response to the week's readings and viewings (which can run up to 90 minutes so don't wait until the last minute) and research movement possibilities in class. Students lead choreographic laboratories based on the week's theme, and the ideas in the course culminate in the final project.",
    "It's a choreography course where students look at different choreographic techniques, and then choreograph a final piece in collaboration with composers. I would recommend it to another student, as it's a lot of fun and not too much work.",
    "Advanced Dance Composition is a really, really wonderful class if you are interested in learning more about choreography in an academic context and getting an opportunity to work on some interesting choreographic explorations of your own. Emily Coates is incredible to work with and has a wonderful knack for pointing you in the right direction. Take it if it sounds like something that could even possibly be interesting to you, it will expand your concept of what you can do.",
    "Advanced Dance Composition is a rigorous exploration of the elements of dance composition. The class is a fair bit of work: it consists of often lengthy weekly viewings and accompanying reading responses paired with class discussions and workshops, in addition to a final paper and composition project--a collaboration with students in the advanced music composition class. I would definitely recommend the class. It opened my eyes up to the possibilities in modern dance choreography, though I can't really say I feel more confident in my choreography after taking it--more overwhelmed, if anything. The final project is both a wonderful opportunity and an incredibly frustrating experience; the time-crunch at a point in the semester when most of the dancers taking the class were in tech week for other shows, combined with a group of rather inflexible and tardy composers made it a scramble to come up with anything at all and left me feeling like I hadn't really pushed myself as much as I wantedto choreographically, but I'm still glad I took the course."
