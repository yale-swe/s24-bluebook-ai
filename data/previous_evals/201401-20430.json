   "comments": [
    "This class has some great themes, and Prof. Dudley is really awesome and incisive. It's definitely a class for people with liberal opinions. I wished that we had someone more center or right just for the sake of a more interesting\/challenging discussion. Also, Dudley is a harsh grader and there are weekly reading responses, so I'd recommend this as a Cr\/D\/F.",
    "Yes if you're a serious anthro major.",
    "I would recommend this for anyone. It is probably better to take it as an upperclassman because I enjoyed thinking about it in the context of other classes but I know underclassmen also got a lot out of this class too.",
    "Super interesting insight into the systems that create and sustain inequality. Definitely one my favorite classes that I've taken at Yale. The readings are fantastic, and definitely made the class. Take it!",
    "Yes - great course! The readings are fantastic, and Professor Dudley is a great seminar leader who definitely knows a great deal about ethnography and inequality generally. I love how she starts her classes requiring everyone to participate. Take it if you can! The three essays are pretty fun to write, and I definitely preferred this over one long final paper.",
    "The reading list is AMAZING. I definitely learned a lot from taking the class, but the grading is super harsh. The reading responses are also do two days before the class meets which is ridiculous and annoying. I don't think I've ever taken a class where I've gotten so much more out of the reading than I got out of everything else combined (papers, meeting with the professor, class discussions.) The class does get better though as the semester goes on and as the concepts come together.",
    "If you are an American Studies or Anthropology major and this class sounds at all interesting to you--TAKE IT! One of my top three classes at Yale, hands down, it forces you to think critically about important issues in American society such as poverty, drugs, and the prison system while identifying broader trends in politics and private organizations that are at the heart of inequality in America. A good amount of reading, but all of the books are excellent and well worth the time. You will not regret it.",
    "Great class. Works very well with the new s maller seminar format. I wish the papers felt more substantive- you're required to use every single book, and it ends up feeling a little tedious after writing pretty substantive reading responses every week. Such important sigh, though, and professor Dudley is wonderful, warm, and demanding.",
    "This is one of the most important classes you will take at Yale--inequality is one of the most defining issues of our time and you will come away from this better informed and more attuned to the immense difficulties that some of your fellow classmates might share. If you are a low-income student, this class is vital in helping you understand your Yale experience. IF you are not a low-income student, this class will be even better for you--there are not many spaces at Yale where conversations about wealth and class can be had but this is definitely one of them.",
    "Without hesitation, I would recommend this class to another student. It changed the way I look at our society and equipped me with the tools to be able to discuss critical social issues in an articulated and effective manner."
