   "comments": [
    "I would say that DS Literature is easily the best part of the DS curriculum. If you have a chance to get in Professor Yeazell's section, you should definitely capitalize on that opportunity. The reading in DS Literature is quite a lot, but everything is very readable and builds on its predecessors. I think the range of texts is great, and if you are really into the material, you will love it all, from Homer to Dante. I would recommend taking this class only if you are extremely passionate about doing DS. Directed Studies is a pretty polarizing program\u0097people either love it or hate it.",
    "I would recommend DS to a fellow student only if they were willing to put in a great deal of time and effort. It is a lot of work, but it is definitely worthwhile.",
    "DS Literature is a good class: a fast-moving survey of Western literature, but it'll introduce you to some great works you can always come back to (or try to avoid). Prof. Yeazell leads section well and well her particular expertise may not be the works we study in this class she has plenty of experience with them and I think it helps her empathize with students reading them for the first time. Also, If you're considering Directed Studies in general, I'd say go for it. Yes, you move a blindingly fast pace, yes, you'll run into a few pompous know-it-alls. But you'll also get at least an introduction to the ideas, stories and history that an educated person should really know, you'll have great professors in small sections, and you'll get to know a lot of interesting people in your classes. DS is a great community to be part of and there is no stereotypical DS kid: there are lax bros, stand-up comedians, science types (a few, anyway) as well as the stereotypical future classics majors. So don't worry if you haven't read a single work on thereading list. No matter what, I don't think you can waste your freshman year if you do DS.",
    "A fast-paced survey of early western literature, taught by brilliant senior faculty, and taken along side some of the most interesting students you'll meet here.Take DS for works, for the professors, for the intellectual camaraderie - there're so many wonderful things about this program.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student. With DS courses, the reading does become a bear from time to time, but I rarely found the literature to be unenjoyable. The class was very rewarding and very worth taking.",
    "I would recommend DS to a specific type of student. Not everyone would be happy doing DS, but if it matches your educational goals, then it's great. The literature class covers really great books that everyone should read at some point.",
    "good, don't switch",
    "Ds 1st semester Literature is everything you hope it to be and more. The syllabus includes books that must be read, and the professors truly understand that, in teaching this course, their task is to introduce us to the roots of literature.",
    "I think that it provides a great overview of the classical texts for anyone who is looking to read them. I would recommend DS Literature to another student because it is a great class in which discussion of the texts can facilitated.",
    "If you have the motivation and interest, take it. It is a lot of work, but I think it's worth it.",
    "YES! This class is fabulous. The reading is outstanding and Yeazell was a wonderful teacher. I learned so much.",
    "Greek and Roman classics, plus selection from the Bible and Dante.As far as the recommendation:First, there is the question of whether or not to take DS. It's a personal decision, and there's no right answer for everyone. I recommend it, but with reservations. The seminars are slightly too large to be as effective as they might otherwise be; you read each work so quickly that you don't really have time to contemplate it and write each paper so quickly that you don't have time to revise it. But the lectures tend to be exciting (the big question among the DSers is always, \"How did this week's lecture compare to last week's?\"), and the professors are excellent. The DS community is a wonderful asset--it's as if you're part of a second residential college, and you have instant conversation material with any of the other students. And of course, there is the fact that you are reading the greatest works of Western Canon...Second, there is the question of the professor: Ruth Yeazell is a great professor. There were times when I wondered if it would be different\/better to have a Greek or Latin or Biblical or Italian scholar, but Yeazell, an English professor, is more than capable of teaching the curriculum, and a fabulous discussion leader besides. Her 19th-century and slant on the ancient works was interesting, and she had great points to make about the role of women in the works we read, as well as about the relationship between literature and visual art. Yeazell also always had fabulous paper topics, and she gives very detailed comments on graded papers."
