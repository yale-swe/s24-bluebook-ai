    "This class is a comprehensive introduction to Roman sculpture. I would recommend it to a student who is very interested in Roman art, becausethe material is very specific, and if you are not interested in the subject matter, then it will be a difficult class to devote the necessary time to. That being said, it does not require too much time, and none of the reading is essential. The midterms can be a bit overwhelming, but they are certainly manageable, and this year Professor Kleiner decided to reduce the number of dates that we needed to know. Overall, if you are more interested in a survey course, this is not the best class to take. It might not be the best class to take if you have not yet taken an art history course, either, because I felt that it expected some experience in analysis, but it is not an impossible first art history course either.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone - whether they are an art history major or not. I am a major and was dreading taking an ancient art class but ended up falling in love with this one. Professor Kleiner was incredible, as were her lectures. The online forum offers a nice break from normal sections. And the creative project option (instead of writing a term paper) made the class feel less restrictive and much more enjoyable. Sometimes the tests were difficult to study for as portraiture can look pretty similar and not every work has a specific name, however, unlike Greek art there are rarely any artists and Professor Kleiner was very accepting with date ranges. Overall, it was a great class - definitely take it.",
    "What a wonderful class! This is a lecture you will want to wake up for each Tuesday\/Thursday at 9am. Professor Kleiner is a great lecturer and her passion for the material is evident each week--she gets so excited! The reading for the class is not even necessary, if you go to each lecture and stay engaged. The paper\/project in the middle of the term is actually fun, especially the opportunity to design your own Roman monument. This is a class for which I will certainly remember the material, even past the final!",
    "This class covers a lot of information, but all of it is very interesting! It would be great to take for anyone who is interested in art history, or particularly ancient Rome's history in general.",
    "If you can handle the monotony of going to a 9 am class twice a week and sitting in a warm, dark lecture hall for an hour and a half looking at semi-identical statues and discussing their hair styles, then this class is an easy A. Otherwise, I probably wouldn't recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student but they should know its not an easy A.",
    "Lectures on Roman Art from the Republic to Constantine. Two midterms (the second is noncumulative) and a research paper, no final. I would definitely recommend it. Roman Art is a great topic for a well-rounded person to have a grasp on, and it will definitely make any trips to the Roman world way more interesting.",
    "Straightforward art history course. Two exams (which require a lot of memorization) and one paper, so the work for the course is concentrated on those three things. There's an online section that is a pain, but only worth 10%. Professor Kleiner is great and the lectures are interesting (but early). Grading is subjective based on who you get as a TF. Good course overall.",
    "If you want to take a fun intro class about Roman monuments than this is the class for you.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to a student interested in taking an ancient art history class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class . I am a science major and only took this to fulfill the distribution requirement, but Professor Kleiner's excitement about the material was contagious. I got a lot out of the lectures, readings, and museum visits - I now feel like I could go to Rome and understand the art. This was probably the most organized classes I have ever taken at Yale: the classes v2 site is thorough, the professor is always prepared for lecture, and expectations for exams and the paper are crystal clear. The extreme organization of the class, though, leaves little room for the student to be unprepared - I found myself scrambling when I procrastinated on the paper or fell behind on forum posts. Overall, a well designed class with an enthusiastic professor that will make you like Roman art.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in Ancient Rome or Art. It is rich in historical content as well as understanding of art. Very good introduction to the Art of the Roman Empire. Taught by an amazing lecturer and great T.A.s",
    "This class is amazing! It is a great introduction to art history and both the art and the Roman history are amazing. Professor Kleiner is awesome, as were my TFs. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in art history, even if you have never taken a class before. The workload is light but the material is great. Just be sure to start studying for the exams weeks in advance!"
