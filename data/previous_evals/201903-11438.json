    "I learned the future tense of Hebrew and lots of new vocabulary. I also learned a lot about Israeli culture through music videos, commercials, and TV shows that we watched in and out of class. My speaking and listening abilities developed greatly as a result of the quick-paced in-class setting.",
    "I learned the future tense in Hebrew, and expanded my vocabulary.",
    "Future tense for various verb buildings. Lots of vocabulary. Israeli culture (music, film, daily life). Lots of speaking, writing, and reading skills.",
    "Hebrew grammar and vocabulary, as well as Israeli culture. Also worked on writing and speaking skills",
    "Future tense of Hebrew. Lots of new Hebrew verbs\/vocab. Gained proficiency\/practiced the language quite a bit."

   "comments": [
    "Meeting as a class every day means your language skills will truly develop at a pace that would be impossible if the course was not structured like this, but the workload feels more intense as a result, even though none of the work is truly difficult. Just having homework for a class every single day feels like a lot. This course is also less organized in terms of connecting vocabulary and verb structures with larger themes, making it feel more disorganized overall and sometimes difficult to understand what exactly we were expected to know. However, Shiri and Naama are great and I loved getting to know them!",
    "The course is really heavy on the homework side, and a lot of it seems like busywork. I would be fine spending the amount of time i did on the homework if it actually felt constructive. The class could also be more engaging-- sitting five days a week in a class where we did not really engage with each other or the professor in any major way could be draining.",
    "Strengths: This course teaches you how to truly speak Hebrew in a day to day setting. It gives you a complete understanding of the fundamentals of the language. After this course you understand the majority of the important verb tenses and buildings in Hebrew. Weaknesses: Sometimes the homework handouts felt a bit tedious. I appreciated looking back at them before exams and quizzes, but I would have preferred if they were optional.",
    "Overall the course is very strong. A lot of active participation allows for learning. However some more time might dedicated to working on speaking skills",
    "Too many random worksheets we use once\/never use."

   "comments": [
    "Hebrew is an incredible program and has certainly shaped my Yale experience. If you want to feel connected to your heritage or are just interested in the language\/culture, I definitely recommend choosing Hebrew over other languages. It's rigorous, but so is any language at Yale (and the others are likely more so).",
    "I would recommend the class because i think that Hebrew is a very interesting and important language, and a lot of the projects we did in the class were interesting. However, I would have liked the class to have been more engaging.",
    "Absolutely! This is seriously the best class I have taken at Yale. I feel like I am a more confident Hebrew speaker and I have a strong grasp of the language. The class was fun and never too stressful. I 100% recommend it!"
