   "comments": [
    "All the students thinking about taking this course are likely locked into it since they want credit from 110, but all that aside this class is pretty good. The workload is insane, I regularly put in 3-4 hours a night for this class and I'm looking forward to an easier semester now that it's over. If you fall behind it's EXTREMELY difficult to catch up, so don't fall behind. I really wanted to hate this class, since it was so hard and was the source of a lot of stress during my semester, but I just couldn't do it. The class is a lot of fun, the students form a nice little community that really makes you enjoy being in class, and at the end of the day you really do learn a lot of Japanese. It's fun, even if that fun is a little bit masochistic. A GREAT class to take credit\/D, if you can swing that I wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "It's a great course if you would really like to learn Japanese and want to speak Japanese. However, it can be very demanding if you are not ready..",
    "Japanese 120 is an excellent continuation of an excellent introductory language program. We learned tremendous amounts of content and had ample time for practice. Each of the instructors are excellent, clear and dedicated. While the work sometimes borders on excessive, it is always helpful. I would highly recommend this to anyone dedicated to learning Japanese."
