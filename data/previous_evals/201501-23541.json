    "It was great to get to know the designers through their work in this class. The Shakepseare project in which we got to practice the director-designer relationship was extremely valuable. By far, the most interesting part of class was the Final Project, because we got to see a project of the designers' choice, so it didn't just become \"Ming steamrolls everyone until their design looks exactly the same\"."

   "comments": [
    "While I appreciate that the class is geared towards teaching designers to think completely independently, and to arrive at a strong vision for the play, scenically, by doing a close reading of the play, it leaves the directors without much to do. And I felt like my motor skills are far too weak to actually execute anything close to what I can describe or picture in my head."
