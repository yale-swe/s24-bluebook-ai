    "TAKE IT.",
    "A straightforward course delivering an increased understanding on ancient culture over time. I would recommend it.",
    "Ya its fun and not that difficult",
    "It was a fun and not too time consuming class. A great writing credit.",
    "I absolute recommend this course or any course taught by Prof. Elkins. Classes are fun, engaging, and he makes the material easily graspable to the most introductory of students while still introducing fresh perspectives and concepts to the most experienced students. The class itself is something very different from most classics courses as you get a glimpse into the daily life and experiences of Greeks and Romans. You get to learn about the history of the civilization from the masses point of view and not just the historians. Really awesome.",
    "Awesome class.",
    "Definitely a great class to take if you're really interested in ancient Greece and Rome (and especially if you liked Gladiator) plus you don't really need to do any of the readings.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! It was a relatively easy class for a writing credit and it is an interesting way to learn about ancient civilizations.",
    "I would recommend the class. There is a lot of reading, but often it was spread among students, and it was manageable. It helps to be an athlete!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interesting in learning about ancient Greek and Roman culture through the lens of public sport and spectacle. The two papers allow you to pursue your own interests within this topic. The readings weren't necessary for success in the class, and the in-class presentations were low-stress and kind of fun to put together.",
    "YES. Great class. I'd recommend having some experience in the Classics Department, as I think it would have greatly benefited me but overall it was a great class.",
    "Okay -- this is definitely a great class to take. The majority of your grade is based on two topic-of-choice 10-15 page papers. Students give presentations each day on some of the readings, so if it's not your turn to present (once every 2-3 weeks), you can just relax and leisurely surf the web.",
    "Take it. It's fun and not too difficult.",
    "good way to get a writing credit"
