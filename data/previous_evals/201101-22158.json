   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend this for Architecture students.",
    "Yeah for sure.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The homework assignments are actually very interesting, and the midterm is very straightforward. The final is open-ended and allows tons of flexibility to meed the expectations of multiple disciplines. The material is very interesting and always fun. Professor Addington is fun to listen to. TAKE IT.",
    "You learn about sustainable building strategies. Very cool stuff.",
    "Yes.",
    "This is a wonderful wonderful class. Definitely one of the best classes I've taken in my four years at Yale. Professor Addington is amazing! She is so smart and such a great lecturer. She really changed the way I think. She is also very approachable and helpful. It is also great how interdisciplinary this class is even though it is primarily an architecture class. Fun assignments that are different than the typical paper\/midterm format.",
    "This was one of the only classes I've ever taken where I really got the sense that the professor wanted you to actually know the material, rather than trying to trip you up on midterms and take dumb points off on homeworks to see how much you don't know, which was really apparent in her teaching style and which I really appreciated.Take it if you're at all interested in green building\/energy issues\/planning\/design\/engineering. Professor Addington is extremely knowledgeable and approachable. The material was interesting, and very real-life-application-based, which was great. The homeworks, while they take a bit of time, were FEW and far between (like, 2 of them, I think. Maybe 3). And you get a few weeks to do them. The midterm was SO manageable, and you can do pretty much whatever you want for the final.It was a bit scattered, though, which I know some people were turned off by, but which I followed easily, and I think I got more out of it than many because I had a background in building.",
    "Awesome class, especially for non-majors. Great intro to the field. Prof. Addington has a unique perspective on architecture (a mechanical engineer who transitioned to architecture) and the material is fascinating.",
    "Yes, you should take this if you care about buildings, architecture, energy, sustainability, etc.It is easy to adapt to even if you're not an arch major.",
    "Take it! Even if your interest in energy is only cursory, the design paradigm that Addington follows is worth learning.",
    "It is an informative class overall. The work load is very reasonable too.",
    "Yes, although the material gets somewhat repetitive.",
    "I took the course largely because it had been enthusiastically recommended to me, but I don't think the recommendations actually came from people who had experienced the course first hand. The first few weeks of lectures were very engaging, and I had no doubt I wanted to take the course, but I felt like it burned itself out before halfway through the semester. The workload was light and the projects were fun, but overall I felt I could have found a better use for that credit. It was still more of an introduction to urban design than I would have ever obtained otherwise.",
    "This is a fantastic course, the workload isn't terribly heavy, and it's actually a really interesting look at sustainable development around the world. She invited some really interesting guest lecturers. First half of course is largely learning about strategies while the second is a lot of case studies. DEFINITELY take it. You'll be a better person for it!",
    "It's a very large scale class that deals with the current green building industry. It gives thoughtful insight into what is wrong about people's current thought processes and basically, what we should REALLY be focusing while we continue to build both cities and individual buildings. It gives insight into what is important. What are our responsibilities as citizens of the earth.",
    "Environment, Energy, Building is a very good class. You learn a lot about sustainable design of the building and how the building relates to its context. Basically, the class is guided by the theme that architecture can make great changes at the level of the building. You learn the science behind many sustainable technologies and learn how to evaluate \"green design\" in an objective way. You learn that many of the buzzword technologies may not be that good and you evaluate them throughvery different lenses, such as its operational and embodied energy.I really enjoyed taking this class and I definitely learned a lot about buildings and their design. The only bad thing about this class is that, at times, it is very repetitive. There were some lectures that were recaps of everything else and rather redundant. But, overall, an enjoyable class. Plus - you get to apply what you learn (such as evaluating your own room). Also, Prof. Addington is brilliant.",
    "I think this class would be a good choice for anyone at Yale. It's easy to get into the material, there aren't any prerequisites. It's a cool way to challenge and expand your own thinking. You learn a little bit about everything - materials, physics, design, energy, chemistry. I think it has the potential to be one of the new, cool classes at Yale. And Prof Addington is great!!",
    "Good class, although it loses momentum after the first half.",
    "take it if you're really interested in the topic. don't expect to get a huge amount out of the class, but if you get a chance to talk to addington one on one you can learn a lot.",
    "A good overview to sustainable design strategies, both on an individual building scale, and community\/city-wide scale. Most of the learning about specific strategies comes through looking at case studies, not to much technical material.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who wishes to get a holistic perspective on issues related to energy and sustainable design. If you want to learn specific architectural design skills this is probably not the course, yet I think the material covered in class will help you develop a solid perspective on sustainable architecture.",
    "If you are really keen on the environment\/reducing carbon or energy use then take this class. There is not very much architecture involved though. You do assignments based on operational and embodied energy looking at specific buildings, you do a couple presentations and then you have a final paper where you can basically write about whatever you want, even if it's something you didn't learn in the class.Its an energy based class, not so much an architecture one. Although you do have some good guest speakers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material is really interesting, and it's a really light workload so it makes a great fifth class. The class consists of lectures and then projects, so it doesn't require a huge amount of time outside of class, and when it does they're usually fun projects.",
    "I highly recommend taking Addington's class. She is very knowledgeable and extremely friendly. However, this class is not an architecture class. The focus is more on methods of reducing energy consumption, not so much the designing of buildings itself...",
    "I recommend this if you are interested in the subject matter. If not, you will get bored of the lectures fairly quickly.",
    "Yes, this is an awesome class. It's extremely interesting and you learn a lot about sustainable buildings and the general background of energy, environment, and sustainability.",
    "Yes. TAKE THIS CLASS! Whether you are of a relevant discipline or not, Professor Addington is not to be missed. This is an opportunity to learn directly from THE greatest expert in the field. Professor Addington's lectures reveal truths that you will not be able to find anywhere else."
