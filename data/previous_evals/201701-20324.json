   "comments": [
    "I learned about writing and discussing theory.",
    "A pretty decent if broad knowledge of important social theorists and their theories, as well as how the discipline of anthro has been shaped by past theorists. I feel as if I have a much stronger grasp of what anthropology is and what anthropologists are concerned with.",
    "Critical reading of anthropological theory. Comparative approach to theory. How to engage theory with methods.",
    "I fleshed out my knowledge of the history and theory undergirding anthropology over the past hundred years and learned a great deal of the considerations that anthropologists take into account in theory and practice.",
    "I learned a great deal about how anthropologists think about and theorize their own work. I became more comfortable reading theory.",
    "This course, or a course like this, is so necessary for anyone majoring in anthropology. It's kind of crazy that a theory class is not a requirement (only a strong suggestion) of the major. I gained a more comprehensive understanding of the history of anthropology, as well as the internal divisions and tensions of the field."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely loved this course.",
    "Amazing texts! Good discussions but could have been more lively",
    "The syllabus is pretty incredible actually. A lot of cool, interesting readings that give you a well-rounded understanding of anthropological thought; it also covers most of the important social theorists. That said, it's probably too ambitious--there's so much reading that we couldn't possibly go over everything. Prof Erami also assumes that we're all well-versed in social theory too, so she'll namedrop people with the expectation that we'll follow along, which isn't always the case. It also created a lot of lulls in discussion because she would ask big, difficult questions that no one was prepared to answer. Student presentations didn't help because they often became the 1 or 2 presenters lecturing for 20 minutes. Discussions often felt more like lectures because Prof Erami would just talk about all she knows (which is a lot!). She does have interesting thoughts, so I think discussions would have been a lot more engaging if she made the readings\/discussions more accessible and didn't assume what we've read\/didn't read outside of class. It'd be cool to really go into detail and really analyze texts together as a seminar, rather than the broad overviews we were often given by Erami--kind of like our essay prompts, which were all good prompts!",
    "The readings were the highlight of this course. Though we did not always manage to go through each of the readings posted on the original syllabus, the selection of articles and chapters was truly engaging.",
    "Amazing syllabus, very helpful professor and TF, great format for the papers, and very thought provoking material Only suggestion-- if it's the same room, it might be more conducive to discussion to have everyone sitting at the sane part of the table. Just because there's a ton of white noise in the room and the conversation sometimes could literally dampen towards the back of the room, especially with a spread out group.",
    "The quality of the readings was a major strength, as were the creative assignments. I especially liked the final assignment, which allowed us to delve deeper into two writers. That being said, I think the course could incorporate more of a build-up to the final assignment by allowing students some flexibility in the final weeks of the semester to read more about certain authors that they are particularly interested in. I think that taking a more in-depth look into a a couple theorists at the end would help us get a better grasp of the broader debates and nuances of different approaches. I thought that the student presentations on the readings were a weak point. Most of them summarized the reading without adding much more. I bet having print-out sheets with students Canvas questions would be a better way of sparking discussion. If you want to keep student presentations, I think they should be restructured so that they focus on a particular element (theoretical background, historical context, etc.) that would otherwise be missing from the discussion.",
    "The strengths of this course are its challenging material and amazing readings. If you actually commit to struggling with the readings, and spending an extra bit of time with them, you will gain so much. The syllabus is just great. A weakness of this class is that there are just so many readings--if you have a heavier course load, expect to be slightly overwhelmed. And yet, I would not choose to eliminate any of the material we engaged with, so there's really no solution. I found that I simply had to become comfortable with absorbing what I could."

   "comments": [
    "This is a great class but you really need to make the time to do the readings, otherwise you won't get much out of it.",
    "Absolutely take this with Prof. Erami if you can!",
    "Yes absolutely. If you want to read the ideas of some of the most important (and brilliant) thinkiers, and discuss them with a very rad Prof (and TF, and the other students were cool too), take this class",
    "Would recommend if you really know your social theory (eg Foucault, Hegel, etc), or get really excited by dense social theory. Otherwise, I'm not sure you'll be engaged in the class enough to merit taking it.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students interested in social theory and willing to take a class with a heavy reading load.",
    "Take it! Even if you're not an anthro major, the material is pretty new to everyone so it's a great chance to engage with some of the more influential voices in anthropology\/sociology\/ethnography. I learned a ton and felt like I was reading the intellectual foundations of what was happening in the world around me and how to rethink what I'd been learning in history, art, social sciences, etc. True gem of a course, especially with the assignments-- great prompts and short enough to force you to be concise and thoughtful with your ideas, but broad enough to let you write about something that interests you. Reading is definitely Troy manageable, as are the three short papers. Prof. Erami is great, and the syllabus is stacked with pieces that everyone should read at some point!",
    "Anthro theory centers around an incredible (and extensive) reading list. You will read about the development of the field of anthropology and its many critiques and defenses. You will *not* read ethnography or other actual anthropological texts. Instead, the course seeks to understand the theoretical frameworks that anthropologists use to guide their work. Prof. Erami is fluent in speaking theory and she spends much of class lecturing in an impromptu manner. Most of the work is the reading and weekly reading responses. The other writing assignments are *very* minimal only three 4 page papers. The seminar discussions can be a bit hit-or miss, but definitely 100 percent shop this class. You will learn a lot.",
    "Take this course! It somehow manages to be very challenging and calm at the same time. The readings are so interesting and challenging, and class discussion is genuinely engaging."
