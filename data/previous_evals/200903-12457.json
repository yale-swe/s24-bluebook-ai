   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to another student. The description sounds like it will be life changing and it falls short of that. It's good but not great but it has the potential to be great. Professor Brown-Dean is amazing.",
    "Definitely. I would suggest this course to anyone interested in Political Science. It definitely helps one understand an underrepresented marginalized community within America.",
    "Take it. You will learn a lot and see that African American politics is more complicated than you thought before.",
    "Yes. This class is great.",
    "An overview of topics in African American Politics. Doesn't ever get very detailed and most people didn't do the reading.....discussions were interesting but not really about the lecture or readings.",
    "OF COURSE. I really appreciated this course. It provided a comprehensive view of the different perspectives in African American politics and highlighted the fact that African American politics is more nuanced than usually presented. I enjoyed writing the experiential learning assignments, as well as the final term paper. They forced me to think about the historical and political contexts of the issues often presented as part of \"the black political agenda.\" The readings were also very interesting and appropriate. I enjoyed every reading. I read everything.",
    "Pretty intro-level course, but great readings and a wonderful professor doing amazing work who you should get to know if you are at all interested in any of the topics mentioned on the syllabus. I recommend this for someone looking for exposure to the range of issues, topics and ideas in the field, but be prepared for class discussions focused on personal experiences of the students, rather than course material.",
    "This course explores the African American political experience. Like the field of African American studies, this course entails an approach far different from traditional political science courses. Each week is themed which allows students to explore issues ranging from religion to modern day cultural production to the civil rights movements.I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Interesting class with a great professor and lively discussion. Worth taking whatever your background.",
    "If you're interested in African American studies, take the course, though you may find it a bit repetitive if you have a great deal of background. If you're interested in American politics generally, you should certainly take the course, though it may take you a bit of time to warm up. Grading is fair and Prof. Brown-Dean--who is an amazing resource--will make herself available. I probably got less out of it due to the early hour; make sure you'll be ready to participate at whatever time it is scheduled.",
    "This class was a very informative look at African-American Politics. Professor Brown-Dean is very informative. The work is more than substantially rewarding.",
    "It's a great course for anyone interested or newly interested in African-American problems. Professor Brown-Dean allowed a lot of freedom in discussion as well as in our assignments outside of class. If you have significant knowledge of the topic, I might not recommend taking it, because it could sometimes be difficult to discuss new or \"outside-the-norm\" political ideas in class. Much of the discussion was hindered by talk about problems that clearly exist, when we could have talked more about alternative political strategies, tools, goals, etc.",
    "Good course. Interesting readings, important topics, and relaxed atmosphere. A bit bigger than most seminars - not everyone gets a seat at the table (literally), but not hard to get one's voice heard. Professor Brown-Dean does a good job commanding the class with intros and transition comments. Student-led discussions were by and large good. The size of the class made it hard to learn everyone's name, which I think restrained some students from freely speaking their minds. Reading isn't too burdensome - though full books are assigned for some weeks. Make sure to get the books ahead of time, because they can be hard to track down. Experiential learning assignments were a bit of a pain. If you get started early and arrange outside input, it'll make things easier - since you'll be able to lean on someone else as opposed to writing strictly your own reflection. Plus you'll learn more. Potential for excellent research paper. I really encourage you to meet with Professor Dean to discuss topics, even very early on when you have only the sketchiest of ideas. Don't be afraid to ask questions like \"If you were going to write on this very broad topic, where would you look and what would you read?\""
