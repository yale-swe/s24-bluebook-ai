    "Take it if you can get in!",
    "A dream come true for any college student.",
    "If you have a chance to take this class, do so without hesitation.",
    "Definitely take it if you get in! I really enjoyed it",
    "Take if you get in. The classes themselves are relaxed, although the workload toward the middle and end can be a fair amount, with almost weekly 1200 word essays, group projects, a final 15 page paper, and readings, although you rarely have to do the readings. Grading of the reading responses seems a bit arbitrary though.",
    "Absolutely. A unique way to meet exceptionally-talented professors, visitors and fellow students. Dean is very good at giving students a practical understanding of investing issues from his decades in the industry. He engages the material in a way that makes the classes memorable.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, especially the guest speakers. As someone with almost no background in investment and no intention on going into a job in the field, I still found the class both accessible and really interesting. Every week I felt like I was learning something new, and I really enjoyed the conversations we had with guest speakers who are incredibly important and impressive in their fields. It's really unlike other classes in its ability to get you to meet and talk to people who have real-world experience, and Dean and Dave are clearly really invested in getting students to learn. Class discussion was always relaxed but also interesting and engaging, and the course is well-designed: both the individual writing assignments and the group assignments really helped me synthesize the material and I really enjoyed doing them.",
    "Of the Econ seminars I have taken, 450 was the one I was most consistently excited to attend. Dean and Dave brought in a really impressive list of guest speakers who often did genuinely interesting activities with the class, like working through an investment thesis for a mattress store or cupcake chain. Weekly papers are a great exercise in learning how to write a memo and were actually fun to work on. I think the application process for 450 is earlier than for most other seminars, so watch out for that.",
    "An amazing opportunity and a real treasure of the Yale Econ department. I imagine that Warren Buffett sitting in Ben Graham's class might have felt a bit similar. There's just nothing even close to the opportunity this class offers to get a real understanding of investment management from the leading experts in the field. Benefit from the Yale Investment Office's (and Swensen's) relationships and reputation in learning from these guest speakers."
