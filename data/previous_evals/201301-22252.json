    "Too many feedback requirements--I found them unnecessary and unhelpful to my final product. I would eliminate them entirely.",
    "It's the senior essay with your preferred advisor! A great opportunity to apply what you have learned in the four years. The workshops were a bit helpful but maybe if there were multiple grad students helping, students can have a bit more direct help. Overall, good.",
    "I would recommend doing your senior essay this way. Doing it as part of a course creates more work while leading you to pay less attention to your senior essay. Writing a thesis is a quintessential college experience, and I would recommend giving it the attention it deserves by doing the separate seminar.",
    "The senior essay is fine. I would not wish the major on anyone, but if you're reading this course evaluation it is surely too late for you."
