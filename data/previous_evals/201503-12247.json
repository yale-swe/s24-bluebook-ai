    "I highly recommend this class!!! As someone with very little background in Middle Eastern history, I think taking this class is a great option. The materials are interesting, covering lots of ground. Professor Bsheer is amazing in leading discussions (and assigning very interesting readings!) My classmates, nearly all history majors, were also phenomenal. It was definitely challenging, but I feel every bit of this class pushes the student to be a better thinker and a better historian. It's one of the most worthwhile classes I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Amazing class. Take it if you're willing to put in the work. It isn't abnormally time consuming in itself, but your respect for professor Bsheer will make you want to do all the readings carefully and turn in high quality work. She will teach you how to think about the Middle East and dispel a lot of misconceptions about the region.",
    "Yes defintiely!!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Even if you don't know anything about the Middle East, or think you aren't interested, this class will change the way you approach history and will change the way you see things in the news, in the world. It will do everything a history seminar is supposed to do, and broaden your intellectual perspective such that you can form opinions about the world with a more open mind.",
    "Absolutely 100% take this class if you have the chance. Professor Bsheer is amazing and will help you improve as a student, a thinker, and a writer in so many ways. The class is hard though! DO your reading!! Spend time researching for your final paper. It will benefit you so much!!",
    "Yess!",
    "Reformers & Revolutionaries in the Arab World is an excellent, rigorous, thorough examination of Middle Eastern history since the 1850s. The course's perspective particularly takes a historical lens of oppression and resistance. If you're someone (as I was before taking the course) who had only taken a more \"great man\"-centric or Western-centric style of history course, then this perspective can be a shock to your system. However, I believe it was a healthy one -- it is very important to know the sins of West in creating violence and sectarianism in the contemporary Middle East, and a lens which frames social movements as front and center is no more strictly \"ideological\" than one which assumes political leaders to be the movers and shakers of history.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this seminar to any student in any discipline if he or she can get in. This material is mandatory knowledge for the world we live in in this day and age and having the opportunity to work with Professor Bsheer is truly incredible. My favorite class I've taken thus far.",
    "This course is absolutely phenomenal. Not only is the subject matter interesting and extremely relevant but Professor Bsheer is also a wonderful and engaging professor. If you are at all interested in the Middle East\/ Arab World I would highly suggest taking this course. The work is manageable but you will have to do all of the readings etc. I",
    "This is a really excellent class. Professor Bsheer is tough in the best way possible: she will help you question your own assumptions about the Middle East and push you to think and write more rigorously. Our class discussions were fantastic. The readings incorporate more theoretical and conceptual ideas, which is not true for every history class. If you are interested in social movements, leftism, imperialism and anti-imperialism, or an understanding of current events grounded in two centuries of history, this is the class for you. Make sure you pre-register if you can -- in our class there were only three spots open because of all the pre-registration.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, but take it only if you have some background knowledge in Middle Eastern history, or if you are willing to put in a lot of effort to bring yourself up to speed. The course covers a lot of ground, and the reading load is dense. Professor Bsheer is an excellent teacher, knowledgable, sharp, and passionate about her field. She does has very high standards and expectations, so this is not the class to take if you are of the faint-hearted (or have a full courseload). That said, if you are truly interested in the Middle East and social movements, this could be one of the most enriching classroom experiences you have at Yale.",
    "A fantastic, eye-opening seminar on the politics of the Middle East, from the late 19th C to the modern day. A fair bit of work -- a good deal of reading each week (with reading responses), a few small assignments (paper\/presentation), and a longer research paper for the final project. As with all seminars, the class depends a lot on who is in it - but Prof. Bsheer commands the classroom really well, and students take the work and seminar discussion seriously as a result."
