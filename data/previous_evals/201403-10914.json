    "Highly recommended to anyone and everyone (although you may enjoy it more if you have good French). There has to be something for everyone here: if you don't like Debord, you'll like Nancy. If you don't like Nancy, you'll like Blanchot. If you don't like Blanchot, you'll like Barthes, or Bataille, and so on. An engaging semester of delightfully difficult ideas."
