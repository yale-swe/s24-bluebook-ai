   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the history of the discovery of many physical constants. This course has a really diverse range of topics covered, and that is definitely its one of its strengths.",
    "I learned more physics lab skills and developed my lab report writing ability. I didn't learn much actual content - the experiments served more as methods to practice lab skills than to learn and understand a new topic.",
    "Very good foray into a physics lab.",
    "I learned how to design my own lab experiments and complete better lab write ups.",
    "I worked with a wide variety of lab tools like XRD, liquid nitrogen for superconductivity, and electrical circuits. I solidified my lab report writing abilities, and developed better habits for report organization.",
    "This course doesn't offer much knowledge\/insight\/skill that PHYS205L did not.",
    "Learned to use many more pieces of lab equipment, and how to experimentally test much more difficult theories than Hooke's Law. Also got good practice writing lab reports, which I am now a lot more comfortable doing.",
    "I developed lab work skills and got practice doing data analysis.",
    "I learned how to prepare and conduct a physics lab and write a report on the lab, and I learned how to use the methods and concepts taught in PHYS 205L.",
    "I would love to say that my understanding of advanced lab techniques was increased, but in reality, the only thing I've learned from this course is how to write a lab report the night before it is due. Sure, some of the experiments are fun but this class is in for a major redesign.",
    "Learnt about superconductors and some other phenomena",
    "Understanding of experimental techniques and devices used in physics, particularly electronics Scientific writing skills"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Experiment guides need to be updated.",
    "Almost all of the experiments are really cool, which makes the lab fun to participate in. The main weakness of this course is sometimes the experiment guides are inaccurate, but all of the people involved with the course were really helpful at answering questions.",
    "The experiment guides are frustrating and confusing. The apparatus of the experiment is usually so involved that the pre-lab \/ introduction feels hard to comprehend without having had hands on time with the apparatus. Then, while the instructions are clear enough, the requested data analysis often felt unreasonably confusing and not well explained. Further, it did not feel like any resources existed if you needed help figuring out a lab report; the TA and section instructor were not familiar with the experiments and often times answered a question by suggesting that you just skip that part. The course instructor is hard to communicate with and when talking with him it often feels like he has better things he would rather be doing. The experiments themselves are actually pretty interesting.",
    "This course should not be a half credit. It required as much or more work than all of my full credit courses. Many of the lab guides are outdated, so reading them ahead of lab section is not always helpful. The guides should be revamped and updated to be more efficient and more focused on the theory rather than troubleshooting.",
    "more theoretical background for the labs would help for students who are not taking a lecture sequence concurrently",
    "Strengths: Being able to pick our labs was awesome. A few of the labs (superconductivity, Rutherford scattering, and nuclear reactions) were AMAZING -- we got to work with amazing equipment, and it really felt like we were doing \"science\" (some other labs felt more like confirming a result that we already knew; obviously, these three labs were also just confirming, but it felt like we were discovering along the way). Two bye weeks was good, too, alleviating some pressure in stressful weeks. Weaknesses: Our TA seemed to grade more harshly than other sections' TAs. It felt a little useless sometimes to be doing the lab and the report, as with digital logic and electric field plotting (the report was basically 5 pages of \"we tried it, it worked, turns out physics ISN'T wrong.\") The only feedback we got was our lab report grades, and that was always a little murky: I needed to specifically ask what an \"insight\" point was (and the response was, \"Something particularly nuanced. Hardly anyone ever gets it\" -- not the most helpful) and we'd get points off for something like handwriting an equation (which we were told was AOK).",
    "Certain experiments are intriguing and challenging, but on the whole this course is pretty dull and far too much work for half a credit. This could be addressed by making lab blocks longer and only having lab reports due every other week like many other labs here.",
    "I liked that we got to do cool and real experiments. A weakness would be that sometimes they were difficult to complete.",
    "I really enjoyed the fact that this class allowed you to pick which labs you were most interested in performing. The labs were more interesting than 205. Grading was hard to figure out because each lab was so different and there was not a set formula for the lab report.",
    "I like that at the start of the semester we are given a list of possible labs to do during the semester and can choose which ones to do, instead of being forced into doing boring labs like in 205. The once-a-week lab report gets very tedious and draining, but over time you realize how to write an effective report.",
    "This class needs to be worth than more than half a credit. I could take 8 lab classes in a semester for an \"average\" 4 credit semester, but I would, in reality, be taking 24 hours of lab + the time it takes to write 8 lab reports. That makes absolutely no sense. On average the lab reports are about 9 pages long, and one lab report is due each week: this is more writing than some writing credits do in their whole semester. This class is in the midst of a major overhaul and the direction it is going is much better than where it was when I took this class. The problem is that most of the experiments don't capture the beauty of physics and instead come down to taking very tedious measurements with very little to no reward. I feel the classical physics labs need a major overhaul in their design. The modern physics labs such as superconductivity and the particle accelerator lab are super cool.",
    "Fun doing a few of the experiments, but they can be a bit long and the write ups are long and not very fun",
    "Strengths - flexibility and independence for students, material is at a very high level, exposure to experiments most students would not work with Weaknesses\/improvements - information was often very difficult for me to understand, with limited background, although physics majors in the class told me they experienced the same problem; often, when experiments went wrong I had no idea of what to do to fix them and had to rely on outside help"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Required for physics majors. If you have the option, take the lower level lab instead.",
    "This course is really one of the coolest labs offered at Yale. The experiments that are offered are extremely diverse in the topics that they cover and are incredibly interesting. You get to use a freakin particle accelerator, and recreate many of the experiments that you hear about in every class like Rutherford's or cyclotron stuff! To really get the most out of this lab, it is very important to read and understand the experiment guides prior to doing the experiment or else you will miss important data for your analysis.",
    "Yes, as a lab this course is not as bad as others from what I've heard. The grading is fairly lenient, and seemed to get easier as the course progressed. The course requires more time than 205L, but the work is more meaningful; the grade is entirely based upon the 8 or 9 lab reports.",
    "Yes. It's a good second level physics lab.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student remotely interested in physics or anything related. The labs are fun and interesting.",
    "For practicing the necessary skills for experimental physics, this course should definitely be recommended. The workload was tedious at times, but the experiments were always very cool, and I always felt as though I learned something new about the fields which were covered in the experiments.",
    "This is a required course for Physics majors, don't take it as a non-physics major unless you're looking to develop physics lab report writing skills.",
    "This course is more work than a half credit and I would only recommend it for someone who is really interested or requires it for their major.",
    "If you're taking this, you probably have to for the physics major. It's a good class with some cool experiments -- if you're really into physics, I'd say take it. If you do, here are my recommendations: make sure to sign up for Nuclear Reactions, Rutherford Scattering, and Superconductivity -- I also really enjoyed Digital Logic. If precisely measuring stuff isn't your thing, avoid Kater's Compound Pendulum. Electric Field Plotting is really easy, but also kind of annoying, and I would've traded it for another circuitry lab. Conservation of Energy and Conservation of Momentum (two separate labs) were simple, somewhat instructive, and easy to write up. I tried to take 166L, but the DUS told me I couldn't (don't know why -- under YCPS it's supposed to be okay). I don't regret doing 206L, though, because as it turned out I really only had to do around 5-6 hours on each report (very doable the night before), and I learned\/practiced some cool physics to boot.",
    "Take it if you have free time and space in your schedule, but your time could be better spent elsewhere.",
    "Yes, the freedom of 206 is refreshing compared to other intro labs.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants to learn how to actually do physics research in the future. The experiments for the most part fun and engaging.",
    "If you're a premed, try talking to your advisor to see if 165 would count as your lab credit. If you have to take it, I'm sorry for you. Avoid the classical mechanics labs at all cost. Definitely take the superconductivity lab as it is the most fun. Godspeed.",
    "No",
    "Only if you have a strong background in physics (e.g. if you are a physics major); I did not and felt I did not get as much out of the course as I would have liked, due to my lack of understanding of the material"
