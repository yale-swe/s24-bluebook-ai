    "I would be they would have to see if it was the type of teaching they would like since it is a different type.",
    "This a standard introductory math class. The teacher stands in front of the room and goes over formulas\/example problems. Yu-Wen is better than most at actually explaining the concepts behind the formulas, despite being forced to move at a very quick pace. I took BC, so I was better prepared than most students. Many found the class difficult. If you have to take 115, take it with Yu-Wen. Also, people have complained about Coursera (online videos and prep problems), but I liked getting an overview of a concept before coming to class.",
    "Math 115 is what you would expect it to be. I would only recommend it if you enjoy calculus.",
    "If you don't really have to take the course and are not very interested in math, I don't recommend you this class. If you have to, take prof. Hsu's section. This semester several other professors taught our section for a few classes and I felt prof. Hsu was the best in explaining the materials and making the class interesting. She was really passionate about teaching, which was a good thing especially for math class.",
    "I would not recommend Math 115 to a fellow student unless he\/she had to take it and I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend the experimental Coursera sections to anyone who is going to take the course. The course is difficult, and the videos\/prep problems add a lot of work to the course and I usually found them unhelpful. However, if you do take the course, Professor Yu-Wen's a pretty good instructor. She teaches very quickly but makes herself very available during office hours, and is very nice.",
    "Good luck!",
    "I placed into 115 freshman year but ended up taking 112 before this, which I think was a good decision. Jim Rolf and Yu-Wen Hsu are both good professors to take it with. Certain sections (Rolf's, Hsu's, and I think one other) did an experimental \"flipped classroom\" thing this year, and I'm not sure if it will be implemented into all sections next year. This meant that before each class, we had to watch two videos explaining concepts and do online prep problems, in addition to normal p-sets. Then in class, we went over the concepts briefly but spent more time going through problems and focused on questions that we had from the videos. I think a lot of people didn't like it, but I thought it was helpful although some of the videos did not explain the concepts super clearly. Check whether your section is going to have this experimental design and decide a section based on whether or not you think that kind of thing is for you.",
    "A hard class that you should only take if you have to. The midterms will destroy you even if you study really hard - but , they're not impossible and the Gods of 115 are not entirely cruel. You have to do most of the work outside of class since with the new online portion, class entails just doing problems. Read the textbook, it's helpful and watch the videos for the most part. Sometimes they're long and rambly but they can be really useful. Good luck is all I can say.",
    "Math 115 is a class that teaches basic calculus skills such as integration. Yes I would recommend Math 115 because it is one of the math classes that grants a core understanding of calculus.",
    "I recommend it fully. It was a difficult course, but not overly difficult, and the resources available made learning the material a manageable process."
