    "This class is a good introduction to radio--not mind-blowing, but pretty interesting. A nice chance to work on radio projects for school, and the professor is very supportive. We also had amazing classes-definitely a highlight of the course.",
    "Don't take this class, plain and simple. It's poorly conceived and poorly executed. You will leave classD every day wondering how an hour and a half could feel so long and yet be so incredibly unproductive. The professor has absolutely no concept of how to lead a seminar, especially a discussion-based one--we're talking spending entire periods learning how to upload files onto websites, listening to guests ramble about their favorite audio equipment, listening to the professor tell long-winded stories, and eventually, listening to the professor lecture us for a full hour and a half about how the fact that the course was going poorly was our fault. To be fair, you will probably come out of class with one or two serviceable radio clips, but your grades on them will be based not on the quality of the project but on how stringently it adheres to the professor's strict guidelines. If you learn anything, it will be despite the professor, not because of her.",
    "This class was poorly organized, and each session often seemed to be a waste of time. Understandably, this was the first time the course was offered, so kinks are natural (and even expected), but I can't really see how one would tweak this course to make it better without completely shifting its focus. If you're reading the Bluebook and thinking \"oh, I might like this class; I enjoy writing,\" STOP. This is not a class for people who enjoy writing; this is a class for people who are in love with public radio and want to self-motivate to produce Ira Glassian radio reflections. Thus, you will not write. You will not have fun. You may even suffer. That being said, we had some cool guest speakers and McCabe is generally a great and well-meaning person; this class was just a total dud.",
    "You can go from not knowing anything about radio to producing professional-quality radio pieces in a semester, and you can have a blast while doing it. TAKE IT.",
    "Professor McCabe made what might have been a good course a total disaster. She has very poor time management and class organization skills. There are no \"workshops\" of students' work. You'd post stuff on the course blog, but there was never a chance to engage with it during class because McCabe talked the entire time, and not even about relevant things. We once spent an hour of class going over how to upload a file to a public radio exchange website, a task a monkey could do in ten minutes. The course was also NOT about writing: it was about making your projects sound nice, picking the right music and sound effects, and making a poorly reported, weakly written piece sound clean. In fact, Professor McCabe disparaged journalism and reporting, repeatedly insisting that it \u00e2\u0080\u009cis not the same thing as storytelling.\" Part of the issue was that the course was new and not fully thought-out: that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll blame it on, as she did repeatedly whenever anything went wrong. But a much, much larger issue was that Professor McCabe herself has weakly thought-out ideas about the craft and structure of story and incredibly poor organizational, interpersonal, and therefore teaching skills.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend it. You do have to be mindful of deadlines more so than in other writing courses, because you have the extra variable of going out and interviewing people and collecting sound, so don't count on busting out a project the night before.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS.You get to pretend you're on This American Life every week and produce pieces that are truly meaningful. Yes, it takes a lot of time and effort but it is SO WORTH IT. This is not a class to half-ass, though, so if you think you can't allot the time it deserves don't even bother.",
    "A great writing credit. You will learn an awesome skill and will create something tangible afterward. It is a lot of work if you are nit-picky and want your pieces to sound comparable to something on This American Life. I put at least 10 hours of work into each piece, but it felt like literally no time at all. I fell absolutely in love with the medium. There are 5 projects, and the fifth is a revision of one of the previous ones. I would totally recommend it to another student. It's a laid-back seminar, but you'll need in to put in a lot of work--which you'll probably want to do because your pieces can be seen by everyone else in the class.",
    "It was a great introduction to the world of radio production and writing for the spoken medium.",
    "Because of this course, I was encouraged to explore and engage with New Haven in a way I hadn't before. It was a lot of fun creating radio stories. The guests that Professor brought to class were, for the most part, very helpful. If you want learn a bit about learning how to produce radio stories and get a taste for what it might be like to work for public radio, definitely take this class. As a warning, I often found the class incredibly time consuming, but fun regardless.",
    "Radio is amazingly fun. Definitely take this class. Prof. McCabe is incredibly dedicated, and I went from knowing close to nothing (outside of a love for \"This American Life\") to feeling confident and producing decent quality pieces. Some of the other students work was even picked up by local NPR stations! Completely worth it if you like storytelling at all - radio is it's own art, and very fun to work in.",
    "Take this course if you really want to learn how to make NPR-type pieces. It's fun and it's not too much work. Just enough. It definitely is a refreshing course to take if you are tired of all the essay writing and midterms\/finals.",
    "This was the first time this class was offered, so I hesitate to make a lot of generalizations. As we took it, it was somewhat disorganized and the calendar, assignments, etc. were constantly in flux. Also Professor McCabe's personality takes a little getting used to--there's not really any hand-holding and she has high standards. We did have some really awesome guest speakers, though.",
    "If you are reading this, the primary error of allowing this class to be taught has already been made. Don't compound that mistake by taking the class. If you're a beginning writer, the course is evasive, misleading, and condescending, an exercise in fitting your creative abilities to the narrow demands of a professor who isn't sure what she's teaching. If you're a more experienced writer, the class is an exercise in self-restraint. It consists of five poorly presented assignments scattered between seminar meetings that were repetitive and unplanned, led by a professor who was aggressive, lazy, and limited. Seminar meetings consisted of dithering discussions of an individual student's technical problems or vacuous \"pitch meetings\" in which students presented plans for an assignment and Prof. McCabe offered suggestions guided by arbitrary, contradictory conceptions of what the assignment needed to look like. Prof. McCabe seemed to lash out at students who were trying to do unconventional things with assignments. Her feedback was centered on things like voicing and technical issues, strange for a class that purported to be about writing or storytelling. She was insecure about her abilities, blaming students in an angry rant for mid-term evaluations she thought were unfair. She let one guest ramble about his favorite microphones for a class, and taught another class on how to upload files to a public radio website. It'd be worthwhile and fun to offer a class on writing for radio. This wasn't a class, and it wasn't about writing. It was unpleasant and insulting, not up to the English department's standards and not up to the standards of anyone who expects student investment in a class to be returned."
