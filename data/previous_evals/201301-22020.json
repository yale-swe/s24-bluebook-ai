   "comments": [
    "Grammatically, it is a lot of review of the things we already went over in prior classes, but your Italian improves monumentally through speaking and writing. We also work much more with the Italia culture: watching movies, reading poems, looking at art, etc. The class consists of 4 Temas, 5 exams (mainly over the cultural texts) and a final presentation.",
    "Fun class! A lot of great movies and interesting readings.",
    "You have to take it to get credit for 130, and it's more or less painless, occasionally fun. You watch good movies and learn some useful grammatical structures.",
    "If I compare Italian 140 to the other Italian classes I've taken, I'd say it's a lot better and definitely worth being taken. There's only a slight emphasis on grammar and writing, and much more of the class comes from an understanding of culture through cinema and literature. If you're hesitant, you don't need to worry because the class is very laid-back and not work-intensive. It's a fun way to continue your understanding of Italian and the Italian culture.",
    "It is a continuation of the Italian language - more focused on culture and communication rather than simply learning the language. It's a fun course, but beware: it requires watching at least one movie and reading a big text every week."
