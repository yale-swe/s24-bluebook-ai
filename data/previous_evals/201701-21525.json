    "A better appreciation for early 20th cent. music.",
    "This course taught me the language and tools needed to analyze music by Debussy, Bartok, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, and Webern.",
    "A more complex and thorough understanding of 20th century music.",
    "This class was a great introduction to set theory, 12 tone music and was really insightful in learning how to discuss and analyze pieces that don't have clear tonality.",
    "You learn some broad techniques of analyzing 20th century classical music such as 12 tone rows, mapping forms, etc, but overall you just get Friedmann's views on how to break down music -- which I think are super good. He is very no BS is the way he approaches music - it is all about what you can hear, vs. what you find in the score - and the analysis he leads you through genuinely helps with your composition. I definitely felt my composition techniques improve throughout the semester.",
    "An exponential expansion of appreciation and understanding of the composers studied. Rigorous training in model composition and critical analysis."

   "comments": [
    "It forces you to step out of your comfort zone and makes you think critically about music in a way that's not offered in many music classes.",
    "This course was extremely valuable and clear. I can imagine that when it was taught as a year long course following 20th c. ear training, it would have been even more so.",
    "The course is very focused and particular, which may be a turnoff for some students, but serves to accomplish its purpose. Any student taking this class will be well-versed in the material and style of the era",
    "I feel like this class was really interesting and well thought out. One thing that could maybe have been better is if we talked a little bit more about what went into our analytical essays, it also felt a little bit like being in the dark when writing those.",
    "Everything was perfect; no improvement needed.",
    "I like the way it is run with composition sections that break up the full group sessions. I think if the syllabus was planned a little more closely we could have spent a more equal time on each composer - we flew past Stravinsky!",
    "Students could use more feedback on model compositions outside of the short 30-min composition sections."

    "Because Debussy, Bartok, and Schoenberg are largely removed from the rules of 19th century music theory, I don't think that MUSI 210 and 211 are very necessary for this course. It helps to have taken them, but don't feel intimidated if you are rusty on that knowledge. What is most required is time and interest. I wish I spent more time thinking about the topics presented in class. You can get by without spending too much time on this course, but you won't get much out of it if you do that. I particularly liked the Debussy unit. Schoenberg\/Webern and serialist composition is still not very convincing to me. But I respect Friedmann as a musician, and he respects that music, so I am a bit more open-minded with regards to 12-tone music than before. I think this course really would be better taught as a year-long unit with 20th century ear training. You really miss a lot if you aren't trained to hear the right tetrachords\/inversions\/etc...This class ultimately was a lot of fun because Friedmann is such an interesting and hilarious person. I looked forward to every seminar. It has piqued my interest in 20th century music, and I think I will be more likely to self-study Debussy, Bartok, (and maybe Schoenberg) in the future.",
    "If you're willing to step outside of your comfort zone in music, this is the class.",
    "If you're a composer or analyst, you will enjoy doing the (significant load of) work for this class. One of the best classes I've taken.",
    "Every music student should take this class if they get the chance, although you should be prepared for a heavier workload than comparable classes in the music department.",
    "Take this class if you care about 20th century music! Friedmann is one of the strangest professors I've ever had, but his thoughts on music, analysis, and listening are really insightful and different from the more standard theory of 211. Things definitely get a little bit confusing as you go into set theory and 12 tone music but it was definitely worth it!",
    "Yes; excellent experience.",
    "Yes - you have to be pretty deep into the period of music and theory in general, which limits the number of people who I'd be able tor recommend, for in general its a great offering in the music department.",
    "Friedmann is a genius. Each class is a mindblowing experience as he makes each piece come alive with his analysis. Be warned that the workload is quite heavy--a short analytic essay or a model composition for every piece studied. Nevertheless, these assignments are incredibly rewarding and make class all the more engaging. If you are even slightly interested in Debussy, Bartok, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, or Webern, take this course!"
