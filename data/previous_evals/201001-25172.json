   "comments": [
    "If you have a specific conflict you want to research, absolutely take this class. Abbey will improve your writing tremendously. However, it is not the most interesting seminar as a whole.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Take the class if you're interested in issues of displacement, ethnic cleansing, and refugees (as the name suggests). It'll give you a very broad picture and allow you to focus on the areas you're interested in.",
    "It is definitely a class that anyone interested in ethnic cleansing should take. You will learn a great deal about theoretical analysis and be able to apply it to case studies.",
    "Very theoretical, too much so perhaps.",
    "This class is a great class if you can get through a lot of dense theory. While the readings were not necessarily overly lengthy, they took a good amount of time to understand. However, I really liked that this class held me accountable for what I read. The final paper expected that you understood the other main scholars in the field's scholarship well enough to critique it yourself. This definitely challenged me transition to a higher, more rigorous level of thinking, which I think I will benefit from in the future.",
    "An amazing course introducing different ways of looking at ethnic cleansing. I particularly saw this course as a prep course for grad school. Abbey seemed to structure it in such as way as to prepare us for graduate studies in political science. Not only did I learn more about ethnic cleansing, I also learned how to write and think more critically."
