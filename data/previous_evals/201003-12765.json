    "Good class if you're already proficient and Turkish but want to keep improving. Read articles, stories, and poetry and write about it. It was fun, and my Turkish improved a lot in one semester, even though I was already basically fluent.",
    "The factor that makes or breaks language courses is the professor. No one is better than Etem and a student of any level of Turkish should feel really lucky to have him at Yale. I'm looking forward to continuing Turkish.",
    "Sure! Etem is really laid back. I am a native speaker who didn't know how to read or write really (no schooling in Turkey), and this class really helped me become more formal with the language and become exposed to different media.",
    "Turkish 150 is an advanced course for people who have an intimate familiarity with Turkish. In this course you may expect to be introduced to media, as well as twentieth century novels and poetry. It is a lot of fun."
