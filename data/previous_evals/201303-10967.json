   "comments": [
    "A class you should not just take because \"it's easier than 180.\" Honestly, it probably is, but the class is such a mess that it is more infuriating in the long run. You truly don't learn anything, especially not physics. When my 180 friends were learning things like rotational motion, we were learning \"probability\" and \"Eigenvalues.\" These things are important, but who knows why they are in an intro physics course. I would recommend 170 to students who already have a strong physics background and will understand and appreciate the biological examples (the whole class is biological examples). You will not learn physics in this course.",
    "PHYS 170 has the potential to be a really great class. The material taught was extremely relevant to those interested in the biological sciences and I could tell all the instructors put in a great deal of effort. If they can iron out all the organizational problems of this year (and it seems like they are already working on it), I think this will be a very useful class for bio majors. If you want a classic, straightforward physics course though, you should probably take 180.",
    "I would say that PHYS 170 is not your typical intro physics class. You learn a lot about the intersection of biology\/chemistry and physics, so if you are interested in the bigger picture, PHYS 170 is great. However, if you would rather learn conventional physics, this may not be the best class for you.",
    "I would recommend this course for pre-meds who have to take physics, or those who don't really like physics, but need to take it. It was more interesting than a traditional physics class.",
    "If you're a curious learner, you're at a disadvantage. Learn the methods and equations and plug numbers in.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class unless you have to take it. It isn't a good class and the material is confusing.",
    "It can be overwhelming, but once you all you need to know from class is the equation that was being derived all class, the class will become a cakewalk",
    "This class is extremely stupid. I don't understand why people think that alternative teaching techniques will somehow work better than a regular lecture--the format of this class was so bad. Firstly, the material we cover is strange, barely resembles physics, and is not relevant to anything outside the course. Secondly, we wasted so much time in class with these stupid \"In class activities\" that made us feel like we were in 5th grade and were an absurd waste of time. Thirdly, the problem sets in this class were the most mind-bogglingly stupid think I have ever encountered. The questions were ridiculous such that you cannot do them on your own. However, section consists entirely of the TA looking at the pset answer key and copying the answers on to the board. No learning ever occurs. It is an easy A despite all this, so take it if you are premed and don't care about physics and just want an A.",
    "170 is the physics class you should take if you don't actually care about physics and are just trying to get through the MCATs.",
    "Great way to complete the pre-med physics req. If you ever wonder \"why does the AAMC make me take this physics stuff?\" this course answers that question. Yes",
    "Only if required for premed or something \u00e2\u0080\u00a6.",
    "pretty hard but good class",
    "Challenging, but if you are deciding between Physics 170 and 180 and are interested in biological or chemical sciences and not so sure about Physics, then take 170 because it will connect the material to your other interests.",
    "I really don't like physics as a subject, and I only took PHYS 170 for premed. Given that, I was surprised how much I liked this class. It was pretty cool that Mochrie highlighted biology applications of physics, and, whenhe lectured, his lectures were pretty awesome. I felt like the concepts in the course weren't too difficult, and the tests \/ quizzes were very fair, though the problems sets weren't too helpful and probably too difficult. The greatest thing about this class was definitely how much support Mochrie structures in to the class (Sunday review sessions, Monday help sessions), and how accessible he is in general (he's awesome; and he wants to learn your name.) The one TERRIBLE, OVER-ARCHING WEAKNESS OF THIS CLASS THAT MUST BE FIXED was the in-class activities, which were boring, dumb, and a complete waste of time. I literally feel like I learned nothing from any of them, and would have much preferred a traditional lecture format instead. Still, overall probably the best class I've taken for premed yet.",
    "If you're a pre-med student I would recommend this course. This is not a typical intro physics course and covers material that's atypical, but the material is honestly more interesting and has more practical applications. You won't realize this at first, but once you start to do the problems that Mochrie gives for practice, you realize that the stuff he's teaching you is applicable in so many ways and that's what makes the course cool. There are extensive class notes that can be both helpful and confusing sometimes. I could see how you could easily fall behind if you don't go to class or don't read the notes, but if you do the work to keep up then the class is worth it. Choose a section before Wednesday so that you can work through problem set questions in section. Problem set questions have capacity to go from easy as pie to hard as Vin Diesel's abs. Some of the problem sets actually made me kill myself, but then I had to resuscitate myself because I hadn't finished them yet. The tests are not as bad as the problem sets and the grading is very fair. Take good notes in class because you can be swimming in the deep end of the pool for the final if you don't beforehand (you can add crocodiles to that if you weren't paying attention in at least most of the classes).",
    "Yes, if you have to take physics for pre-med or even are a biology student interested in physics, this course is great. The workload is big, but if you can spend the time on the material you will learn a lot. I thought this course was difficult but rewarding.",
    "Yes, to be perfectly honest, I don't like physics very much but I enjoyed 170. If you have to take physics for the MCDB major, this is definitely the class you should take. It's enjoyable and you do actually learn quite a lot! Simon is a dedicated teacher, who works to make the material engaging. The psets are pretty challenging, and will more than likely require you to get help from the TA's, but the midterms and quizzes were absolutely fair. I thought the final was surprisingly challenging\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 so we'll see how it goes.",
    "Worst class I have EVER taken. I can't even begin to describe how much I hated this class. Just don't. Please, for the love of God, take 180.Okay, so you're thinking, \"Maybe Simon Mochrie isn't that great of a teacher. That's not that big of a deal. I've taken science lectures here before, I know I can just read the book and be fine.\" WRONG. There is no book. Simon writes up notes that are RIDICULOUSLY long and filled with JUNK that does not make any remote sense. Seriously, the stuff you learn in this class is NOT hard. I could have done this in middle school, but between the teaching and the lecture notes, it took me hours and hours each week to understand something that should have been easily explained in like 10 minutes. Any time a TA would explain something, it would easily be 100x more understandable (in 1\/10 of the time) than what happened in lecture or in the lecture notes.",
    "This class is so much work. Problem sets every week, weekly quizzes, 2 midterms and1 final exam. Sometimes you may think, \"All i do is physics.\" The class was well taught when Mochrie actually taught the class. At the beginning, there were too many complicated in-class activities that were confusing to us who were trying to use the basics. This class is not friendly to those who have never taken physics before. I had never taken physics before and felt that I was at a disadvantage. Some simple principles were just not explained thoroughly and well enough so that a person who had never taken physics before could understand. The final was also killer. We had 2 practice exams from the 2 years before which were manageable\/comparable to the midterms, but our final exam was ridiculous. I don't think it was representative of everything we learned in that class. That being said, I learned a lot in this class.",
    "I would take it over Physics 180",
    "Yup, recommend it. It's interesting, and it's not taught like a traditional science course.",
    "You'll take it because you need to. Don't take it if you don't have to. It's okay but it's not particularly fun.",
    "You probably need to take this. Quiz every week was not too bad. Similarly midterms were much easier than the psets. Some of the pSets were too hard and too long and required a lot of time and effort seeking out help to get them done. I did enjoy the shorter in class activities which gave you a chance to test yourself and work with others. Was not a fan of the longer ones (which they eventually did away with) or learning catalytics. Emphasis is on problem solving (although lecture did go into derivations). Class also does spend a lot of time on probability.",
    "This class... Most of the time lecture seemed pointless, since Professor Mochrie went through material so quickly, then expected us to have absorbed the information enough to do an \"in-class quickie.\" These activities were probably the bane of every Physics 170 student's existence.The questions are worded poorly, so it takes basically the total alloted time to even figure out what the question is asking. I would have much preferred a lecture style physics class.Also, I, in general, have an issue in teaching the application of materials beforeteaching the fundamentals. I think this class has the intent of teaching pre-meds the physics that the will be able to apply in their lives, but it misses the mark. I would have much rather learned classical physics before the application. What's the point of learning application when you don't even know what you are applying?Overall, I would only recommend the class if you needed to take it-- which is pretty much applies to 95% of people of in the class.",
    "This class is good if you want to learn concepts you wouldn't learn otherwise, such as the dynamics of actin polymerization. It is a reasonable amount of work, and Prof. Mochrie is very kind.",
    "Fall 2013 was the guinea pig for this class in the TEAL classroom, which seemed like an epileptic trip sometimes with all the screens and switching. Mochrie is really invested and puts in a lot of effort into this class, which is very respectable, and in a few years this class will be well-executed. He's an average lecturer, and knows that most people in the class are taking it because it's a requirement, so he tries hard to make it as engaging as possible. Which is a hit-or-miss - you're forced to understand the material with the constant stream of in-class activities and so you learn a lot more than if it was in a lecture room. The psets are hard and long and by the end you'll start copying from each other and the TAs. The two midterms were easy, with curves around 95-100. Yes, the mode on the second final was a 100. It's one of the classes where if you can work hard in the class and stay consistent, you will be rewarded (with good grades), no questions. Unfortunately the final was balls-hard so everything's back in the air. I would say it's worth taking if you need to fulfill the requirement.",
    "Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a better introductory option for students. The material is undoubtably interesting, but I wish it was covered in a better way. The midterms\/workload are not difficult, just very time consuming. Final is impossible.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who values absurdity over meaning in life-- someone who would take a class just to laugh about how even things that seem to make sense don't when viewed through just the right lens.",
    "Physics 170 has been my least favorite class at Yale thus far. Not incredibly difficult but very frustrating and a very strange introduction to physics.",
    "Professor Mochrie is a really cool guy, and he tries so hard and is so dedicated to the class. However, the lectures were convoluted and hard to follow. The class was super disorganized probably because of the TEAL classroom it was taught in, which caused a lot of technical difficulties and detracted from any cohesiveness of lectures. The problem sets were incredibly difficult and often took 10+ hours each. Though midterms were doable, the averages were really high, making the class incredibly competitive. The final was difficult, which is especially rough since a lot of people were relying on it for their final grades. Do not rely on the final! Although you will learn some interesting information, I feel like I don't have a solid grasp on basic physics concepts, which I'd hope to have coming out of the class.",
    "Physics 170 is a challenging course for individuals without any background in physics. Most o of the students have taken AP physics and have a basic understanding of physics principles - putting you at a disadvantage. That being said, with the resources offered by Simon and a little more time you will be able to succeed in understanding the material. To note, this class is a significant amount of work (more than organic chemistry) and you must be prepared to invest most of your time to this class!",
    "I deeply appreciated how Mochrie how to incorporate relevant information for all the pre-medical students in the class (a vast majority), however, there were many times when the material was drowned out by messy derivations. PSETs are long and quite difficult. Midterms were very, very easy, which is not good since a few stupid mistakes means already you're below the curve. Final was more difficult than I thought it would be.",
    "Take it with Mochrie if you can! If you want real physics take 180, but take 170 if you want a more interesting course. The problem sets are long and hard, but the midterms and quizzes are very fair. They usually reflect the difficulty and subject nature of the practice problems. Beware the final...it was extremely difficult our year and much harder than any of the practice problems!",
    "Yes! The material is interesting, the work is fair, and the classroom environment is great! The interactive lectures are so unique and a great experience to have.",
    "FAIR. IT WAS WEIRD IN THE INTERACTIVE CLASSROOM SO BEWARE.",
    "Yes, the Professor and TA's go out of their way to be available to help. There are lots of help sessions if you want them and the constant trickle of work forces you to keep up without being overwhelming. The problem sets are difficult but the tests are very fair.",
    "It's a decent class. If you have to take intro-physics and pre-med, it's a decent class especially if you don't like math.",
    "Physics 170 is a good class for premeds. Not having a textbook is frustrating at first and if you've never taken physics before, it will be difficult at first. That being said the course provides a lot of extra help and review sessions which are helpful. The problem sets are difficult while the midterms are easier.",
    "Take it if you need to take an intro physics class. I enjoyed it so much, and I wouldn't have picked 180 over 170 in a million years. I actually loved the interactive nature of the class, and I thought it helped me form study groups and a better relationship with the professor. The material is more tailored to a pre-med audience, so if you're not into the health applications of the material, you might be a little bored, but I thought it was really interesting.",
    "Do not take this class if you want to learn physics. Take it if you absolutely can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t or don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to take Phys 180. While the midterms and quizzes are easy, the problem sets and final exam are way too difficult. You also won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really learn physics after the first 2 modules.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone with a slight interest in math and any interest in science.",
    "basically learned how to problem solve more than simply physics. problem sets got longer and longer. almost impossible to finished with out help from tutor or TA. during lecture we simply went over exactly what was in themodule, so it was tempting to zone out. i would have liked to have an emphasis on either learning physics or getting tips on how to problem solve or both! i didn't really think that the physics problems tweaked to fit biology examples were that helpful - it made the problem much more confusing than it had to be and the concepts could be learned in a biology class, which many of us would have to take anyway if we are premed.however, there might be (good) changes to the course, since many students voiced the same thoughts and prof mochrie is very open to suggestions.it is worth shopping both 170 and 180 and see which you like better - learning atmospheres are vastly different.",
    "Take 180 until they figure out this new format.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "It will not help you with MCAT physics but will teach you some pretty cool biological applications of physics. However, it is a huge time crunch. Pre-class activities, in-class activities, problem sets that were impossible so that you would have to get the answers from TAs. This means that you're basically always studying for tests, but it really sucks away time from other classes. Shop this and 180, and see what you like. I had never taken AP Physics, so I opted to just stick with 170. And the TEAL classroom is basically like the Smart House (from the Disney Channel movie) - it's a great in theory but malfunctions sometimes, and it takes a bit to get used to turning your head every which way and interrupting lecture for in class activities. Take it if Mochrie is teaching it - he'll make it worth your while. But the final was crazy harder than anything we'd been asked to do before, so that was a nightmare.",
    "This class went a lot better than I was expecting it to. I only took it because physics is required for my major and this seemed like the easiest option. Prof. Mochrie is really invested in his students, even in such a huge lecture setting. We did a lot of in-class activities, which became a little annoying and counter-productive, but I think they're going to change that next year based on feedback we gave them. The p-sets are reasonable and really prepare for you the midterms. Overall, I'd recommend this class.",
    "I was dreading having to take physics for my major. As it turned out, this class was so much more bearable than I was expecting, and I feel like I did pretty well in it in spite of having a weak high school physics background. I wouldn't be able to survive such long physics lectures without the interactive element of the TEAL room. The p-sets are not as bad as they are alleged to be either, although they always required input from the TA no matter how familiar you personally were with the material (that's a product of this class tying in various biological elements that wouldn't otherwise be discussed in a physics class). I only question whether I'm learning physics, or whether I'm just learning how to take physics at Yale.",
    "An unconventional physics lecture for pre-medical students and biology majors. Not your average physics class. Be prepared for some statistics and probability!",
    "This class. Definitely shop 180 before just automatically signing up for this one. This is not your average physics class to say the least, so do your research (I guess you kind of are now by reading this). It is not lecture style. It's based on \"in-class activities\" and lots of demonstrations and strange, malfunctioning technology (you'll see) and working in groups. There's no textbook, which is good and bad. Mochrie teaches right out from notes he seems to write himself. The first few units are basic physics - motion in 1 and 2 dimensions, Newton's Laws, the whole shebang. And then the application to biology begins and you end up learning more about probability than you do in any stats class. Yes, you read correctly. Probability. Interesting application of physics, but I think it may also be useful to learn the physics first, especially when you're taking a physics course, and especially when regular physics will be tested on the MCAT. Nonetheless, the material was not too difficult and like I said, it was interesting. But don't complain halfway through the semester. Know what you're signing up for first.To succeed (I'm not sure if I did), but to succeed, I think you need to do the problem sets with other people because they're often so ridiculous that it's useless to attempt them yourself. I didn't go to the study halls on Mondays very often, but perhaps I should have. A good way to start\/finish the problem set rather than scrambling for answers in the wee hours of the night before it's due. Go to the review sessions on Sunday to prepare for the quiz. Make sure you know who the best TA's are. I would go to the review sessions the night before the quiz and maybe study for an hour after and that was all that was needed for those. In other words, there are lots of ways to get extra help for this class. Use them.For the midterms, practice problems over and over again. Don't bother reading the notes again.Do NOT count on the final for your final grade. There's this policy that if you do well on the final, it can override your midterm scores and I know people who plan on only depending on the final. Don't do that. The final was absolutely ridiculous, to everyone's surprise and dismay.",
    "This is a great physics course if you are interested in applications that might relate to medicine or pharmaceuticals. The psets are long and can be difficult, but the tests are fair. The teaching I thought was great, and Simon incorporates demonstrations into the class well. There is a lot of variety in what goes on class to class and the instructors made efforts to improve the course as it went along.",
    "Phys 170 covered some basic and important ideas in physics. It's really the first class that I would take in physic. I would reccommend for anyone who hasn't taken physics before and wants to try it.",
    "Intro physics + pchem + biophysics",
    "I would recommend it to them only if they have taken math beyond 112.",
    "Physics 170 is probably required for you. I would recommend preparing to spend hours and hours working on the problem sets, but the midterms and final are not as hard as the problem sets would indicate. Go to all of the help sessions they offer, because they will give you homework answers at them.",
    "If you are looking for a non standard physics route, take this course",
    "This class is by far the best science class I have taken at Yale. P-sets are hard, but fully prepare you for the midterms. The class is interesting and engaging.",
    "Of course most of you looking at this review probably have to take this course for premed, in which case I'd say go for it because among all the physics courses, it's the most doable. I took this class as a science requirement though, and I definitely WOULD NOT recommend taking it for that. I wanted to learn physics, and to do so I should have maybe taken 180 or some other class. This class can scarcely call itself a physics class. Yes you cover mechanics, but other than that, everything else is more like applied math. Also, all you basically learn is how to solve the particular problems that pertain to the course. Which is pretty useless, if you ask me...",
    "Decent class, just attend lecture.",
    "As a student who has never taken physics before, this class is a bit of a double-edged sword. I think the class is better than PHYS 180 from what I've heard of 180: the tests are slightly fairer. BUT, our class was a guinea pig in that the class was converted into a more interactive class with in-class activities and the use of learning catalytics. At the beginning, it was really terrible and confusing, and the class often fell behind in the syllabus. However, the instructors did modify it to make it better (shorter activities that had to do more directly with what we were doing in class). The major problem was the psets (where often we would not have been taught enough information to actually do the problems by the due date, but Mochrie often changed the due date \/ the TAs would help us in section). There are plenty of resources for extra help (peer tutor office hours - there's seriously like 7 or 8 of them - study hall, help sessions for the weekly quizzes), but then prepare to spend a horrendously large amount of time on physics each week. Overall, if they fix the interactive aspect of the class, I would say PHYS 170 is worth it. Mochrie is pretty good and helpful when not rushed for time and Raphael is probably the best TA for a science class I've ever had at Yale. Definitely shop the class at least.",
    "This is a good course if you need to take physics but plan to have a medical career.",
    "If you're pre-med, this physics class is definitely the best option. It's physics, but it's not too overwhelming.",
    "Great class.",
    "Phys 170 is a great course to experience biological physics. I would recommend it both for the topics and the unique way they're taught.",
    "It's a lotof work, especially if you don't have a physics background. The problem sets are terrible, but TA's and tutors help out. Similarly the in-class activities are not useful most of the time and are more of an annoyance, and a discouraging one at that. Overall, take it if you have to, but be prepared for a long semester. The bright side is that Simon and the TA's and peer tutors want you to do well in this class and provide a ton of resources for outside class-time help.",
    "I would recommend this class over PHYS 180 to anyone who does not feel that they have a good physics intuition or to anyone who has not taken physics before. The class may seem difficult, but with the resources available and with professor Mochrie being the professor that he is, the class becomes much manageable and understandable.",
    "PHYS 170 can be a very challenging course at times, but it is still a good course. Since it is a new program, there are components that could be refined over time. It is vital to attend not only the discussion sections but also the Sunday and Monday night help sessions to get a solid understanding of how the concepts work. If you do not put in the time and effort that this class requires, it can be difficult.",
    "Pretty good class. If you're interested in biology you'll learn some cool things. Psets can be a fair amount of work but section will help. Midterms are very reasonable, final a bit harder but fair. I chose this over 180 and I think that was good choice.",
    "If you are premed then physics is necessary, but beware that this class does not teach the physics that will be on the MCAT. What we learn in this class cannot be called physics. Rather, we spend time on random concepts like eigenvectors and probability.",
    "take it over any of the other physics options if you are a pre-med student, but it still sucks. make sure you meet with the peer tutors whenever possible. do the review problems before exams and attend review sessions - they are enlightening and won't trick you.",
    "Overall this was a great intro physics course. A lot of work but so worth the time. The teaching style was unique and engaging and very interactive. I felt like I learned so much throughout only one semester.",
    "Overall it's a good class with a nice curve. Professor Mochrie is really nice and helpful. The final was harder than expected but the curve was good. If you want to take physics to help study for the mcat, then do not take this class. Otherwise you should take it if you're mcdb.",
    "Essentially this class is physics for pre-meds. You go through expected topics, like Newton's laws of motion, but you actually spend a surprising amount of time on things like random walks and Brownian motion, which - although at first I wondered why we were covering them in intro physics - ended up being very interesting and have cool medical applications. Overall, I liked the class and would recommend it, but be prepared for some long and tough problem sets.",
    "If you take this class, be prepared to get nothing out of the lectures (except extreme frustration) and to go into extra help sessions to do the psets (whose problems are pretty difficult). That being said, the connections with medicine are interesting, and the midterms are really fair. This class was really frustrating, but I thought it was better than 180.",
    "Phys 170 is an intro physics that uses biological examples. As more of a biology person, that makes it both more interesting but also more confusing, since the physics concepts are not always as standard and straightforward as you would get in a class like 180. Also, this class is definitely not a gut. Problem sets are long and the tests, though reasonable, are not jokes. You will have to put a fair amount of time into this class.",
    "If you need to take a physics class then I would recommend this one. The \"sciences\" aspect makes in slightly more interesting, but not necessarily less difficult.",
    "Decent introductory physics class. Take for pre-med. Psets are hard, but tests are reasonable. Professor Mochrie is a boss.",
    "Physics 170 was a very unique class since it was not taught in typical lecture style. In the TEAL classroom, students were expected to work together and conduct in class activities that were a hit or miss, to say the least. Professor Mochrie spends a great deal deriving equations. The midterms and quizzes are fair and pretty straight forward if you complete the practice problems beforehand. Also, form a Pset group with your friends, since those can be pretty time-consuming!",
    "I would recommend it, especially if the idea of regular physics doesn't sound all that exciting to you.",
    "I thought the course was difficult in a way that wasn't very rewarding. I put a lot of time into the course and went to two different discussion sections as well as all the review sessions, but it was difficult to have an intuitive understanding of the material. I took AP Physics B and my background didn't help me as much as I would have liked. I did like the applications of physics concepts, and would recommend the course for anyone who feels like they don't need a traditional background in physics.",
    "The grading is forgiving and most of the material is fair, although a lot of the homework and some test questions requires significant thought. The class is interesting and fun and the TA's and professor more than helpful. The interactive component keeps things interesting. Lectures often show the derivations and some practical applications of the physics formulas; homework will give you plenty of work with problem-solving. I enjoyed how Professor Mochrie tied the material in to biology, chemistry, public health, nuclear physics, and more!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course as it applies really cool topics in biology (molecular motors, membrane physiology) to physics. I wish the course involved more calculus so we could de-simplify a lot of concepts, such as eigenvalues and eigenvectors, however.",
    "Physics 170 has some strengths and weaknesses. Professor Mochrie was a smart, cool, and approachable professor. Don't believe that you only need Math 112 for this class; they teach you modified versions of eigenvalues that are hard to understand and if I hadn't even known how to integrate things that would have made the class tons harder. It sometimes seems like the link to biology on some topics is tenuous, and that the class is a bunch of random topics from physics thrown together for the benefit of pre-meds. I wanted to like this class a lot, and sometimes I did. (I also had a great TA, which really helped.)",
    "Interesting, not harsh grading.",
    "yes. take this class if you're not a physics person. Mochrie is one of the few teachers i've encountered who has truly taken to heart what it means to be aware of your audience; his attention to pedagogical details really saved the class for me. physics would have been a nightmare without the effort he put into making it engaging.",
    "PHYS 170 is an all around well organized and well taught class - science lectures don't get much better than this. Professor Mochrie is a diamond in the physics department and amongst all of the professors at Yale. He genuinely cares about his students and makes sure that all the material sticks - if you ever have any questions, don't hesitate to ask him because he is super approachable and helpful. Also, don't worry too much about grading in this class because Professor Mochrie emphasizes LEARNING over grades (as evidenced by the generous number of quizzes he allows us to drop!) I am so glad I took this class because even though some of the material is not considered to be \"classical physics,\" the atmosphere and structure of the class truly made me feel comfortable and ready to do my best.",
    "only if required",
    "This is a decent physics intro course. The topics are mostly interesting, but the lectures may not be well organized some of the time. The workload for this course is pretty demanding, with weekly quizzes and weekly problem sets, but the grading is pretty fair.",
    "It is essentially a strange hybrid of biomedical physics. It is NOT and MCAT preparatory course at all and teaches you little about the basic physics principles.",
    "I was debating between PHYS170 and PHYS180 to begin with, and there were several moments during the semester I wished I had gone with PHYS180 instead. Mostly because of the sometimes haphazard structure of this course. The instructors seemed to be experimenting with how best to teach the information, and make it interesting\/engaging to students, that sometimes it felt like the class focused too much on how could physics be \"fun\" rather than teaching us physics itself. This resulted in numerous in-class or pre-class activities that were due with psets but really a waste of time (sometimes 30 minutes of lecture) as it often involved concepts that we hadn't been taught yet thus while we worked as a group, we still didn't always get the point of the lesson. It would have been more effective if they simply taught the concepts with examples. Problem sets were long and tedious and sometimes the TAs didn't even know exactly how to answer them (or different ones were suggesting different approaches). Going to the homework help sessions were really helpful. All that being said, the tests were reasonable for the most part, and the instructors really tried.",
    "shop phys 180, but you probably have to take one or the other",
    "Summary: Biological physics explained almost exclusively from a mathematical view.Recommend: Only to a math student."
