   "comments": [
    "It is a great course to take if you are interested in the material, you will learn a lot. If not, however, obviously you probably will not enjoy it.",
    "If you like the subject matter (awesome monkeys, linguists having pissy catfights over material no one else gives a damn about, human origins) it's probably worth taking even though the class itself is pretty terrifically boring.",
    "Very interesting material but not well taught. It will probably not be engaging if you are not already interested in the evolution of language, but if you are, it's a great summary of the field.",
    "Evolution of Language was at once a compelling scientific analysis of the history of the human language faculty. A wide range of insights on the matter was presented in both lecture and reading material. I would recommend Evolution of Language to Linguistics majors or to those who are keenly interested in the subject. The material required a fair amount of supplementation outside of class for essay responses, but the take-away messages from the seminar were compelling. Prof. Anderson is an expert in the field, but not the best lecturer in the sense that he relies upon Powerpoints a bit to heavily. I would recommend Prof. Anderson's class to students with a strong interest in linguistics and the inertia to wade through a dense subject matter (both on the syllabus and supplementary) outside of class. I am glad that I took the class, but am also glad that I will only take it once."
