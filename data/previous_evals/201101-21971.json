   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in graduate school, definitely take this course. You will learn how to conduct research and how to deal with real issues of data analysis.",
    "Yes, you should definitely do directed research for the maximum number of credits (3)",
    "Do whatever the hell you want, but know that ambition means jack shit in this course.",
    "its an awesome way to get involved in the field of research, just the right amount of guidance and freedom",
    "I would only work in this lab if you enjoy doing rat research and if you have time. It requires 2 hours every M-F with an additional hour of directed reading.",
    "Definitely take directed research with Laurie Santos if you can! It's a great hands-on experience, and the vibe of the lab is what really makes it fun.",
    "I'd definitely recommend getting involved in a lab as a psychology major. It really adds an additional layer of depth and experience to your time at Yale that you would otherwise miss out on. It's also a far more hands on approach to the concepts that you'll learn about in other psych classes. Take it. Do it.",
    "A way to do research for extended periods of time within the week, to give you a good sense of whether you'd want to do it for longer.",
    "I would recommend Directed Research for any psychology student who is interested in pursuing his or her own research interests.",
    "Course to learn about how to conduct research. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Yes",
    "A great opportunity to do independent research, but still get tons of support from phd students and professors. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Great chance to do research in a field that you find particularly interesting- it might be hard work, but worth it!",
    "You get to work with monkeys and an amazing professor for credit. Do it.",
    "If you EVER have the opportunity to do research, definitely do it. It's usually really fun, adds a lot of flexibility to a 5-credit schedule, and is one of the easiest A's you'll ever find at Yale. All around, a great decision.",
    "You find your own lab, your own mentor, your own project, and you dedicate time to your project. This is one of those classes that really depends on your choice in lab and how much you make out of it. If you are considering research at all, I think it's a fantastic opportunity to gain hands on experience with empirical research and you should definitely consider it!!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! It expands your capacity for thought and creativity in ways that other classes do not.",
    "Make sure you do it in a topic\/lab you're interested in.",
    "Your experience to a very large extent depends on your lab\/advisor.",
    "Directed research obviously depends entirely on the lab and researcher that you are working with, but if you find one that fits your interests, it can be very fulfilling.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking to get started in a psychology lab! It's fantastic! The only reason one might hesitate is the amount of time it takes, as it is a decent amount. However, I have found it to be pretty manageable, and without a doubt worth it.",
    "This course is an awesome introduction to research methods in cognitive science. Working with the Capuchins in caplab (usually as part of a team of researchers with a graduate or undergraduate project head) is the best way to learn about this sort of research, since you encounter all of the thrills and pitfalls that accompany real research. Definitely one of my favorite experiences at Yale! You work on a project, going in to the lab for 1.5-2 hours 3 times per week, along with a one hour lab meeting. The monkeys are really fun and really will broaden your perspectives, and the lab meetings allow for discussions with people who are absolutely GENIUSES in cognitive science. What a great course!",
    "Take Monkey Lab! You play with monkeys. And get monkey prizes. And do science!",
    "PSYC 493 is an independent research program that allows you to delve into and explore any area of psychology you want, as long as you can find a faculty member that does research in the same locale. You get out of it as much as you put into it, so it's very subjective. I definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely take it as soon as possible. It's the only way you'll get to do real hands-on research. Make sure to pick your advisor\/mentor really carefully, though! Although my advisor has been amazing, the experience is very variable depending on who you work with, so ask around before you commit to anybody.",
    "I would recommend it for Psych majors, obviously. If you can get in a senior requirement now, why not?",
    "You come up with your own project for the summer and carry it out. You get to see each step of the way in the research process - from planning your study to presenting on it. I would recommend the course if you have a strong idea about what you want to research and you have a general understanding of statistics (if you are running an empirical study).",
    "N\/A",
    "it depends on who you do your research lab with, but i enjoyed my lab a lot! i was with J Dovidio supervised by Adam Pearson. Adam is really nice and i was responsible for setting up, running and doing data entry for his study, which at first was intimidating, but he went through it with me and once you get the hang of things its totally fine and enjoyable :)",
    "If you've done CapLab and really loved it, do this. It's really not as much work as it sounds-- certainly less than the Comparative Cognition prerequisite (which itself wasn't bad workload-wise). Be sure to attend the weekly meetings; they're only an hour, but they're important.",
    "It's directed research; you pretty much know what to expect. I had a great experience. My only advice is to not be afraid to take this even if you are an underclassman or not majoring in psychology."
