   "comments": [
    "It's a demanding and technical introduction to the foundations of logical systems. You'll define and analyze the structure for set theory, sentential logic, and first-order logic. The material is demanding, but the workload is quite manageable. There's no reading (unless you're stuck on a problem set), and one (hard) problem set every two weeks.Sun-Joo is brilliant. The fact that she's capable of giving hour long, proof-based lectures without depending on notes is a testament to that fact. She's also approachable, and sincerely interested in the students.I recommend this course highly to students with an intrinsic desire to learn and practice logic. This is not, however, an easy QR, especially for non-analytic people.",
    "If it's not for your major, don't take it. It will take you much time. And even if you're taking it towards your major requirement, better take it after PHIL 125 because later you'll realize that you really need the more basic stuff.",
    "I would not not recommend it and I definitely don't regret taking it but I will most likely not take the next course in the series.",
    "Great course. Excellent material. Excellent Professor. Absolutely take it.",
    "I would not take it unless you need to for a major requirement or want to pursue logic. The grading for the assignments is very strict, and there is no curve. Even if you understand the material very well and work hard, it is almost impossible to get an A.",
    "If you're a student of proof-based math, this is a relatively easy math course. There are occasional problems that are legitimately difficult.Doing the problems is fun, but the material itself isn't terribly fascinated. I didn't have much of a feeling of accomplisment when we finally proved the completeness theorem, which is the explicitly solitary goal of the course.For those without math experience, I'd recommend it as a way of learning to think in a different way. Though this material isn't terribly interesting in itself (perhaps it is for a while, but it gets dry) as a math student who enjoys philosophy, I can attest to the benefits that a philosophical argument can gain from a solid understanding of and experience with mathematical proofs.",
    "I would recommend the class to someone who likes doing problem sets instead of papers and has a general aptitude for math over other subjects.",
    "This is a very tough class if you come into from the philosophy major, as I did, without having taken any math classes at Yale. I had a blast with it, though, and once the concepts start clicking, I felt like a learned a lot. The homeworks are almost entirely proof-based, so experience with proofs helps a lot. All in all, this class was home to some of my most frustrating and most satisfying intellectual experiences at Yale. But the frustrations were good frustrations, the type you can only escape by genuinely learning something. I give it a high recommendation.",
    "Take this class! Take every class you can with Sun-Joo Shin! This course was artfully crafted unlike any other course I have taken here. The problem sets do take a lot of thought and a lot of time, but you feel very accomplished after completing them. The take-home takes a lot of time also, but afterwards, you will look back at the class and see how all of the puzzle pieces fit together. Mathematical logic is truly a beautiful subject, and this class captures the beauty. Disclaimer: It's hard. If you think it's an easy QR, it's not. You need a decent amount of mathematical intuition to understand a lot of the concepts we do. A decent amount of the class is math majors.",
    "If you have experience with proofs and are willing to put some effort into this class, it will be a good experience. I would not recommend someone taking this class if you have never worked with proofs before unless you are willing to put in a lot of work on your own to not only learn the material, but to improve your proof writing technique.",
    "Wonderful course, great professor, a little background in theoretical math will go a long way. Overall, an excellent introduction to the math and philosophy major."
