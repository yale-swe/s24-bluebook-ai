    "Yes, but not to students not interested in public service.",
    "I would certainly recommend it. It was a great foundational course in understanding the true complexities and difficulties in creating counter-terrorism policies.",
    "Definitely recommend. There is a substantial amount of reading but most of it is easy to grasp and is to the point.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to anyone with an interest in the challenges terrorism and especially counterterrorism pose for democratic societies. The Professor's hands on experience in the field and his dual academic and political\/professional perspectives makes the course a unique opportunity to understand the complexities of the topic. A very relevant course for anyone with a background in political science."
