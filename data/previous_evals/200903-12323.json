    "Yes.You learn to get a more wholesome view of what it means to be a musician, understand and appreciate non-Western (not familiar) musical tradition that is so rich and complex, you get to appreciate the beauty of the music that you otherwise would have dismissed as some exotic thing ....the peak of this was at the end-of-the-semester concert, your ears get used to the beauty of Javanese music...and understand that the world, after all, is not all about Europe and AmericaA rare opportunity to actually play gamelan as well, if you ever wondered what that gold colored wooden\/metallic blocks were on your way to pick up UPS packages in Hendrie, it is gamelan! An experience that you can't get everywhere else....exploit the opportunity when you can at Yale!However, it is surprisingly time-consuming. Although short, there is writing assignment every week. Readings could take some time to internalize (and some readings never did internalize, some were very complex). In addition to the 2-hour class, there is mandatory 2-hour long gamelan rehearsal every Thursday, and also section (although optional, we are to attend weekly section early on in the term; towards the end, it was sometimes necessary to come to gamelan room in free time to practice the individual parts). The final paper is long, and the final concert eats up (although wonderful experience) one day of your reading period.",
    "I highly recommend this course if you are intersted in world music, and I think it is a great experience for classical musicians, too.",
    "Take this course. It's one of the best I've ever taken, period. You learn the basics of playing Javanese gamelan, as well as some history and culture. The homework isn't bad - a few chapters of reading per week, a 1-2 page essay every other week, and a final project. Professor Weiss is incredible; even if you don't have a ton of musical background (and being familiar with music is definitely helpful, but not necessary), take this class just so you can have her as a teacher. I don't think it's being offered again until '11-'12, though.",
    "The best course I have taken at Yale.",
    "This class is an in-depth look at the history, music, and culture of central Java, Indonesia. In this class you have the opportunity not only to learn about the Javanese music, but you are also required to learn to play the instruments in the ensemble.This is a great course for music and non-music majors alike. For music majors, this is a unique opportunity to learn about a music completely different from anything in the West and apply your knowledge through performing with the ensemble. If you aren't a music major, you should not be concerned about taking this class, as everyone in the class knows little to nothingabout gamelan, and everyone learns to play several of the instruments in the ensemble. Professor Weiss is most concerned with you learning to play the instruments and having a great time doing it. I guarantee if you take the class you will do just that.This was probably the most enjoyable class I have taken at Yale, and I would highly recommend it.",
    "MUSI 346 is a fun and very low-stress class. Although it may seem crazy going into a class with no background knowledge of either the Javanese culture or the gamelan, the way the course is structure really allows for total beginners to be fine. Just don't panic on anything, and it should be okay. The gamelan is a really neat ensemble, and although I initially found playing the gamelan not as engaging as, say, playing the piano, I eventually came to really enjoy rehearsals, as gamelan playing is really a social function. Being with the group is a very relaxing and rewarding activity, and it's an experience I'm certainly glad to have had. Even though the course is finished, I hope to continue playing with the group in the future.",
    "I'd say it is a great class to take and a unique class as well. I would recommend it to anyone, especially music majors and those interested in eastern music and how it differs from western music.",
    "If you're at all interested in the Javanese gamelan, take this course! It's a great way to get involved in the ensemble on campus and a fabulous addition to the largely Western-oriented music department."
