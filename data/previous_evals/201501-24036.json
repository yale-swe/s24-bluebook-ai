    "AMAZING. Take this class!! The readings are both fascinating and incredibly inspiring, the workload is very reasonable, and the topic is hugely important - feminist theater and feminism in general is always worth learning more about, and Elise Morrison is one of the best people to learn from. You'll meet some really amazing guests, read things you've heard about but always meant to read, read things you've never heard of that are actually brilliant and moving, and have fantastic class discussions. This class is important and a LOT of fun. Take it.",
    "a wonderful, wonderful class! I think it should be a staple of the theater studies department- female writers and feminist issues need more acknowledgment in classes. The coursework and discussions were incredibly interesting and the readings were manageable and really good. Prof. Morrison is a great instructor- she is knowledgable and is committed to students doing well in her class. TAKE THIS CLASS. it's amazing. I would recommend it to anyone interested in theater, english lit, or feminism. Or, you know, any citizen of the world who wants to be more informed.",
    "YES! TAKE IT! This was one of my favorite seminars I have taken at Yale. The material is so interesting, and the combination of theory and actual theatrical texts provided great context and facilitated really wonderful conversations. Taking Feminist Theater and Performance has made me think differently about my other Theater Studies work and work in theater more generally - I feel like I am bringing a new perspective to my work that is really exciting. Elise is an amazing professor with so much passion for the material and for her students' ideas about the material. Absolutely take this class."
