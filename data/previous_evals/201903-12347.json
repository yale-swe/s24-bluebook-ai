    "Learning to read and write about French History",
    "I learned about revolutionary France; some of the themes are the social history of ideas, the collective action of the ordinary people. and the changes and continuities in the revolutions.",
    "critical thinking, everything there is to know about the french revolution",
    "A great history class for all students. I developed my reading skills and learned how to think about history.",
    "HIST 275 provided me with extensive knowledge of France from 1789-1871, particularly the themes of this period such as the centralization of France, the dechristianization of France and the development of collective action as a means of instituting change.",
    "This course introduces a distinct approach to learning about France in the 18th and 19th century, less an emphasis on Napoleonic imperialism and more what life was like for ordinary people. I have yet to take a course with a more passionate professor on his subject than Merriman.",
    "I learned a lot about French history.",
    "I developed a thorough understanding of the history of France from roughly 1789-1870 and read some of the most important literary works from that period.",
    "Learned about the full French Revolution, in great depth.",
    "Learned about history of france, but really taught myself most of the information",
    "The course focused on the cultural aspects of the French Revolution, while providing a general overview of 19th century France. Do not take this course if you are trying to study the French Revolution's implications on the European balance of power. Take it if you want to study how the revolution effected the lives of the masses.",
    "I learned an immense amount of information about the revolutions in France.",
    "I learned about French history between 1789-1799 in some detail, and then the broadest overview of French history from 1800-1871, with a focus on social organization and collective action.",
    "French history, especially after 1789, is full of lots of confusing contradictions and paradoxes. By taking this course, I was able to get a better grasp on what exactly the French people were fighting for, who the Revolution was for, who benefited the most out of it, and lots of other similar big questions. It's also a good way to get a broad picture of French society and values; Professor Merriman is a very entertaining lecturer with lots of relevant experience. We had a lot of cool single-topic lectures in the latter half of the semester like on drink and French culture, on rural life with a focus on Professor Merriman's home village of Balazuc, religion and the state, etc.",
    "French revolution is interesting",
    "i never took a class on revolutionary france so i gained knowledge on that",
    "Not a lot. Learned very specific details about the French Revolution but wish it would've focused more on the themes of the time period",
    "writing skills, synthesis of information, and research",
    "A great knowledge of France during this period. I did not realize the complexity of the period, nor the sheer number of revolutions and uprisings that occurred.",
    "I learned a huge amount about France! I also learned how to use the library resources and how to write a research paper.",
    "I learned how to combine information from readings and lectures when the links werent clearly made. I learned how to write an argumentative research paper for history. I improved my ability to discuss historical topics in an educated way.",
    "More knowledge on the French revolutions",
    "a lot about history and the impacts the French revolution had",
    "I learned more about French history as well as the societal attitudes in France in the 19th century.",
    "I learned about the revolution of france e",
    "I learned a bunch of facts about the history of the French revolution. I didn't really learn that much about interpretations though of the history.",
    "Aside from learning about the material in the course, I also acquired better writing skills!",
    "I learned basically all there is to know about France between the years of 1789 and 1871.",
    "I developed a deep understanding of French history from 1789-1871. I also strengthened my skills at historical research and primary source analysis.",
    "I learnt that the French Revolution is not one event but rather a series of revolutions that shaped modern Europe today.",
    "I learned about revolutionary France and all of the political changes that took place from the 1789 revolution through the Paris Commune. I learned about the forces that prompted revolution, what made revolutions successful or unsuccessful, and about how France restructured itself.",
    "I learned about the French Revolutions, and other more obscure French revolutions during this time period. We also through the course tackled many interesting questions-- thinking about what liberalism and capitalism meant during the 19th century, and also what prompted these revolutions. In addition, we read many novels\/fiction literature which allowed me to better understand what more large-scale political changes meant to the common people.",
    "I do not believe that you actually learn a great deal from this class. You gain some general knowledge about the French revolutions, but nothing that you couldnt learn by reading a couple of chapters in a book. Furthermore, professor Merriman is far and away the worst professor I have had at Yale. His lectures were absolutely useless and totally unrelated to the material upon which we were tested; he mainly spent his time in class recounting personal anecdotes, rather than actually teaching. If you take this class you will very much be left to your own devices and have to learn everything on your own from the readings. Even then, however, the assessments were clearly written by the TAs and the essay questions which they asked were in no way representative of your actual level of knowledge regarding the material. Finally, from discussions with my classmates and comparisons, I found the grading of assignments to be extremely subjective and inconsistent across both TAs as well as the opinions expressed by students in their writing. Grading seemed to be based upon whether or not your TA agreed with your opinions and point of view, rather than based upon your understanding and mastery of the material.",
    "Learned a lot of details about the french revolution.",
    "The course was a very interesting exploration of a narrowly defined and critical moment in European history that really helped my overall understanding of the currents of history at that moment and beyond. The course also helped me develop my essay writing skills for its research paper. Really an interesting subject material that was taught excellently.",
    "I learned about the different revolutions that occurred in France from 1789-1870 as well as important ideologies that emerged during that time.",
    "Learned how to take better notes and learned to write essays more effectively.",
    "This class gives a very solid overview of the history of revolutionary France.",
    "French history, often a cultural and social perspective, from the French Revolution to the Franco-Prussian war."

   "comments": [
    "More structured lecture",
    "Professor Merriman is very knowledgable about the course. He is also a great lecturer.",
    "Brilliant lectures.",
    "Merriman is awesome. He is so knowledgeable about the material and has a genuine love of the subject. Sometimes his lectures are bizarre and don't seem related but they are always interesting.",
    "Prof. Merriman made each lecture fun and interesting, but the discussion section was a waste of time.",
    "The course did a very good job of painting a picture of France in this time period, particularly how ordinary people lived. Additionally, the course connected past events in French history to present day current events. The course could be improved with slightly more emphasis in chronology during some of the lectures, as during discussion of a handful of topics it was slightly unclear the order in which events were occurring.",
    "Lectures can be slightly all over the place and often it is not clear which anecdotes are worth noting. But regardless, it is priceless hearing a world-leading professor talk about French history.",
    "It was a great course.",
    "It might help to have slightly more organized notes sent out by Professor Merriman before lecture, as this could help students follow along. Aside from that, the course was really great!",
    "Very comprehensive of the revolution, but hard to follow at times. That being said, the exams were fair based off how much material there was to learn. Wish the syllabus would have broken down the percentages of how much each assignment is worth, however.",
    "Professor Merriman was a very interesting lecturer as has had a lot of experience in this subject, but the lectures are a little all over the place. There are no lecture slides so it's tough to follow",
    "Professor Merriman lectures on lots of things that may only be vaguely mentioned in the readings. The readings cover the general political events around the French revolution while Professor Merriman delves into things like the changing nature of work, the culture of drinking, and the development of Paris during lecture. I can understand how this makes the lectures essential to the course, but not having readings on these social topics can be a setback for those interested in them.",
    "Strengths: Lectures were interesting and I enjoyed attending, especially the ones concerning important revolutions during this time period. Weaknesses: I think more lectures on Napoleon could've been added, especially considering that toward the end of the class the lectures did not focus on topics that were very important. I also wish that lectures would've stayed on topic a little more. Another weakness would probably be the novels that were assigned. From section discussion, I could tell that most people did not read them.",
    "Strengths: interesting subject matter! Weaknesses: A professor who often fails to follow even the most basic outline for classes, who goes on 20-minute tangents about drinking culture and denigrates important historical perspectives. I felt like we ran out of \"revolutionary\" material by midterm, and the second half of the course presents a more-or-less random sequence of subjects.",
    "It seems like the course alternates between 20-30 pages of history a week, and hundreds of pages of literature (Old Goriot and L'Assommoir) or dense political writing (Marx's The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte). It's not necessary to do all the readings to do well in the course, but you'll get a very different experience if you do them all compared to otherwise. In that way, a lot of the course could be considered to be self-directed; you pick your own 10 page paper prompt, you focus your own research on the topic, etc. You should be interested in French history and culture, but even if not, the course is a good way to maybe open up some interests in the area.",
    "Rambling lectures but done by someone who really knows a lot",
    "Lectures do not cover the information pertaining to the test. Merriman prefers to just tell stories about his time in France which, while interesting, are not helpful when it comes to the exam",
    "strengths: content, commitment from professor, engagement of professor",
    "Overall this course was well organized, but I think maybe a more comprehensive syllabus with the actual distributions of the assignments would have been nice.",
    "weaknesses are how disorganized the lectures are-- they don't really pertain to what we are supposed to know. strengths were how interesting the lectures always were!",
    "Lectures were enjoyable and the TAs were all very strong and personable (as was Professor Merriman). I think the weaknesses came in the nature of the course both being very specific in its content and a broad overview of a time in French history. This is how the course is largely because thats how the history of the period works, but it is hard sometimes to juggle both these broad themes and specific events.",
    "Absolutely zero resources or lecture slides or notes made it very hard to catch up if you missed a class.",
    "Prof. Merriman is amazing and so passionate.",
    "Strengths: -interesting lectures -the readings are manageable and also interesting -I appreciated the assignment of novels which are integral to understanding the material -assignments were not overwhelming -- straightforward exams and you get to choose the paper topic Weaknesses: -disorganized (after 1830, the chronology was confusing) -not as in depth as I thought it would be, especially considering this is a relatively short window of time in French history -some lectures were not substantive",
    "Lecutres are fun, but I'm not sure how informative they really are. A lot of times it felt like it was just the professor talking about whatever had just come to mind, rather than a cohesive lecture.",
    "While Professor Merriman is great and knows a ton about the material discussed in class, I found it very difficult to prep for exams. Being that there are no PowerPoint slides, students must rely on their notes. However, in some cases, important topics that are on the exam weren't touched on completely in class. Having taken history classes at Yale before, I found the course to be somewhat disorganized.",
    "Merriman is a legend that knows so much about France it is astounding. I always find it fascinating to learn history from professors that are so deeply immersed in the material, and Merriman's lectures are just hilarious to sit through. The one thing that could be improved is more structure regarding the essay, and a better way to standardize the grading across different TFs.",
    "strengths- interesting topic, passionate professor weaknesses- poorly organized\/no structure, section could be much more helpful if highly structured as an opportunity to review and clarify lecture material",
    "The content is really interesting, but the pace of the class is quick because there is so much to cover.",
    "Strengths: Professor Merriman is very passionate about French history, and lively, making every class very fun. I also enjoyed the diverse readings we were assigned, which further facilitated discussion. Weaknesses: The class is often disorganized, and for someone who did not have background in European\/French history it became easy to get lost. Additionally, this made studying for the exams more challenging than it should have.",
    "There are no real strengths in the class. The largest weaknesses were the fact that Merriman doesnt actually teach you anything about French history, but rather just tells you stories about him in France. Additionally the TAs are wildly inconsistent in their grading of the assessments. This is a huge issue as the assessments already arent a fair assessment of your knowledge of the material and are extremely subjective and unfair in how they ask and expect you to apply your knowledge. For example our final exam asked how different French people from relatively unimportant regions would feel about one of the many revolutions, based only upon a few years of their past experience. Unfortunately, mastering the material will not guarantee that you do well in this class, which is extremely unfair and frustrating",
    "Merriman's lecture style can be quite overwhelming and all over the place. But he does try his best to be engaging and interesting.",
    "Merriman is a fantastic lecturer. He is incredibly engaging and you never feel bored for a second in his class. He occasionally goes on tangents but they are always just as interesting as the course material itself and frankly it gives you a bit of a break from notetaking so I saw it as a plus. Merriman can be a little disorganized, but after a week or two in class I got the hang of it and it presented no real barrier to my learning. Sections are moderately useful but not as enjoyable as lecture. They might be a bit more helpful if we went over the reading in more depth rather than constantly reviewing the more easily understood parts of the lectures.",
    "The course was very unorganized and the professor would go off on tangents quite frequently, so it was hard to keep track of things in chronological order. But the class was interesting and the professor is really funny and a kind man.",
    "The strengths of the course were the lectures and the section but the weaknesses were the readings that we had each week",
    "The courses content is very interesting and Prof. Merriman is kind, entertaining and incredibly knowledgeable. However, the course lectures could often be disorganized and sometimes hard to follow.",
    "Great lectures, well supported by section and reading. Pretty cut and dry history lecture, no real comments"

    "Yes.",
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in French history.",
    "definitely. really interesting period.",
    "Yes, as a non-history major, this was a great history class. Merriman is a legend and everyone should take a class with him before graduating.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student who is passionate for the subject of history or interested in trying out a history course at Yale. The French Revolutionary period is an extremely interesting period of history, and this course's lectures were very strong.",
    "YES.",
    "I would. It was very interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course regardless if you are a history major or not.",
    "Not necessarily, it was greatly disorganized and all over the place.",
    "Yes. Great credit\/d. Grading is a little difficult for those who are taking it for a grade, but a gem of a class for pass\/fail.",
    "No, there is not much work that needs to be done in the class, but you do not really learn much from the class. I had to teach most of the information to myself before the midterm and final and even then, the TAs grade the exams and are unneccesarily harsh.",
    "This can serve as a good intro course for people new to the major or a humanities credit for STEM majors. If you seriously want to study the cultural history of the French Revolution, however, I would recommend just asking Merriman for guidance.",
    "If you are interested in French history or revolutions in general, I would take this class.",
    "I'd have trouble recommending this class to another student. It's a super interesting period in French (and European) history, but I don't know that this class helped me understand it in any great depth. Lectures were scattershot and often confusing, although sections helped a lot.",
    "No",
    "yes because revolutionary france is actually interesting but know that you'll have to do a lot of work on your own come exam time because lecture is tough to follow",
    "Definitely not. While professor Merriman is a great guy, the TAs were very pretentious and were incredibly strict",
    "Yes definitely.",
    "yes",
    "No, because it was difficult to follow lectures.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Merriman is a gem, and a professor that absolutely everyone at Yale needs to take a class with before they graduate. He is truly something special, and his lectures are super entertaining. They may not be always related to the actual material we are learning nor will they teach you events of the period, but you will leave every lecture having learned something new about France from one of the most knowledgeable people in the field. He has so many fascinating stories to share, and truly, deeply enjoys teaching the course.",
    "Yes! Merriman is a very interesting and great professor. I would suggest doing the work to keep up with what we are learning, as he doesn't cover everything in class.",
    "Yes, because it is an enjoyable atmosphere to learn history that allows you to more deeply access an important historical period.",
    "Yes",
    "yes, good and interesting class",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in learning more about French history. If you took advanced European History in high school, though, I would say that I did not learn that much more in this course. It is interesting subject material and the lectures are fun, but I did not learn a great deal in this course.",
    "I think this class is very interesting and going through the time line was super helpful and interesting.",
    "Yes, but not necessarily if you're looking for a super engaging class.",
    "Depends. I have found better history classes at Yale, although if you are very passionate about the French Revolution and its aftermath, this course is for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is relatively simple, with just a midterm, final, and one essay, and I enjoyed learning about the material and doing the readings each week. If you are interested in the subject matter or time period, I would absolutely recommend that you take it.",
    "Yes, the content is very interesting and the professor is a great lecturer.",
    "I would recommend if they are interested in revolutionary France but would caution them that the class lecture style is quite disorganized",
    "The content of this course is really interesting, and I think it's really important to study revolutions, but I found myself lost a little bit along the way. There is so much content packed into the semester, and I had to put a lot of my own time into researching events in order to solidify my understanding.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is interested in French or European history.",
    "Not at all. Youre left totally on your own and graded unfairly.",
    "Yes if you need a humanities credit.",
    "I would. Its relatively easy and not stressful, but you learn a bunch of interesting history about a critical nation to European history and the lectures have broad applicability to historical understanding in general. The class is a great call for anyone who is serious about history or someone who just wants an easier but interesting history class.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course if youre willing to sit through lecture and then have to put the things you learn from lecture in a chronological order based on textbooks.",
    "Yes I would recommend this if u are interested in France history.",
    "I would recommend the class but students should be prepared to have to fill in some gaps of information on their own as the lectures can sometimes feel disorganized.",
    "Lectures were always a blast - Professor Merriman was eccentric but interesting and a titan in his field! Most of the content is better learned through the readings, which were inconsistent (sometimes 5 pages, sometimes a novel and then some) but mostly interesting. Not super challenging - a good fifth class - but interesting enough if you are interested in the topic."
