    "I developed knowledge of the fascist history of a number of European countries in the early 20th century, and read about modern attempts to preserve democracy in the face of autocracy and instability. We covered a number of frameworks for understanding fascism and populism both historically and today.",
    "Learned a lot about engagement with history and trends of fascism, also great emphasis on writing succinctly and clearly",
    "I learned about the history of fascist politics and how they manifest today",
    "To start, this is not a political science class in that you spend the semester developing a political theory of fascism, but instead a history class about fascism in Western Europe, with a bit of more contemporary discussion toward the end. I learned about the growth and development of fascist movements in Western Europe.",
    "This course gave me an important historic lens with which to evaluate our current moment of populism and democratic erosion with more context. I now have a better understanding of the rise of fascism in 1930s Europe, and what the similarities and differences are to the era of Trump and Brexit.",
    "I learned about fascist movements across Europe in the 1930s and was able to connect themes and lessons to modern day contemporary society.",
    "The history and politics of Europe before and during WWII, and its relevance to the present day."

   "comments": [
    "This course was excellent as is -- no need to improve! The discussions, professor, guest speakers, and class dynamic were perfect.",
    "Overall the course is very strong, the readings are well-curated and diverse, and the flow from beginning (early 20th century history) to end (modern populism and theory) felt extremely natural and empowered us to better understand the material.",
    "Strengths include great guided discussion and an excellent selection of readings. No real weaknesses",
    "Dr. Young is great, as are the readings. However, the class discussions could lag because of the class engagement. Like all seminars, your experience depends on the class members",
    "I like the 3 papers and a presentation structure. Maybe the prompts for the papers could be more specific though.",
    "Strengths: Dr. Young is a great professor and extremely accessible to her students, very engaged in the topic, and gives awesome feedback without heavily penalizing you in the process. Guest lectures are interesting. Learn about a subject that is not taught much Weaknesses: The class is far more of a history class, and at times some discussions could feel pretty out of touch.",
    "Dr. Young is an engaging, helpful and knowledgeable professor, and one of the highlights of the class. I also really enjoyed the history component of the course. At times, conversation swayed a bit all over the place and focused fairly heavily on current events rather than the historic topics. But students were passionate about these discussions and engaging to listen to. I wouldve like to have a few more outside of class experiences like movie viewings and a field trip, which I think couldve helped bring the group even closer together.",
    "The strengths were the level of discussion in the classroom as well as the wide breadth of readings we were exposed to. I also really enjoyed weekly office hours where we would recap political news that had occurred within the past week and use the critical lenses we developed in class to tackle current events.",
    "The course is essentially perfect. Discussion is always interesting; the readings are very accessible and fit well with one another. The essays are spaced well in the semester and professor Young gives enough prompts that everyone will like at least one of them. I really appreciate how much effort she puts into grading students' writing; she really cares about what everyone is writing and wants them to write the best possible paper. The best course I've taken at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this class to everyone! The readings and discussions were very interesting, and I learned a lot about historical fascism, the threats to modern democracy, and today's geopolitical challenges.",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in politics or history this course provides an excellent framework for exploring these topics. The environment is excellent for engaging with difficult ideas in a productive way.",
    "Yes! Professor Young is very dedicated to the course material and clearly cares a lot about her students. The class is super interesting, and the workload is reasonable but structured well to help you learn.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you get in. It was easily my favorite class of the semester. Try to do all the readings because it makes the class better.",
    "Yes! This class is amazing. The structure of the class is great because each week someone is assigned to provide an overview of the readings to the class, so you avoid the situation where no one in the class has done the readings and discussions go in circles. The paper prompts are very interesting and kind of fun to write, and you can deviate from the prompts if you want also. Dr. Young provides really great, in depth feedback on all your work.",
    "Yeah, it's interesting. Really depends on who's in your seminar though.",
    "The class is good, prof is great and very engaging, but know that this is a history class not a political science\/theory class. Part of the strength of the class relies on the discussion and thus people in it.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in learning more about the rise of fascism in 1930s Europe, as well as issues democracy is facing in the present day. The class is a high quality political science seminar with a very good professor, but not one of the most memorable Ive ever taken.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if this student has a particular interest in politics and ideologies. I believe it is really relevant and important to know about the foundations and spread of fascism given a worldwide democratic backslide and the upcoming 2020 presidential elections in the United States.",
    "Absolutely Dr. Young is an excellent professor and the material is super relevant for anyone interested in history, politics, or really anything else.",
    "1000% Yes!!!"
