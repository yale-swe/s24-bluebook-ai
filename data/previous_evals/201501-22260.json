   "comments": [
    "It is what it is. US and the World 1776-1920. It's a lot more Euro-centric towards the beginning and the end of the course. Prof. Cohrs is brilliant, but his lectures are a bit overwhelming. There is a fair amount of reading, but it is reasonable. I don't like that there are not any grades until the end of the term. The paper at the end is killer.",
    "I really liked the first month or two of this class, but the lectures started to all blend into the same set of generalities. It often felt as if each lecture was prepared to stand on its own, which occasionally worked but usually made them quite repetitive. I think that Professor Cohrs wanted to stay \"out of the weeds\" and take a wide-angle lens on the material, but I think that the class would have been better served by going into a bit more detail about events during lecture. He also had an irritating habit of consistently running at least five minutes over on every lecture (often closer to ten), which was particularly maddening given how much repetition there was in the lecture. He does have an interesting perspective on the period and is approachable about the material. I would definitely recommend going to a talk by him or something like that, but this class didn't do it for me.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Definitely gives you a great sense of where the US was in relation to the rest of the world during the 19th century, which is traditionally not taught in detail in US history courses. Cohrs is very clearly an expert in the field, the readings were insightful, and the assessments were not too difficult.",
    "Combination of US and European history. Weighted, as course title suggests, to the US but with extensive analysis of its position in a changing global environment during the time period.",
    "It's a pretty easygoing course. Interesting but not the most useful course I've ever taken",
    "A great class to take, both as a Global Affairs major or as a student casually interested in the growth of the US's foreign policy stance, or the comparison of said stance to the ideology of the founding fathers.",
    "The relationship between the US and Europe, focused mostly on 1900-1920 although the class is supposed to be the whole 19th century.",
    "A thorough overview of Central European and American history from 1776 until World War I. The class incorporates both reading and discussion. Since the class is a small-lecture format, you feel more of a sense of accountability for course material--but still, the class is only as valuable as the work you put in. Strongly recommend as an introductory level history course.",
    "Yes. This was one of the best history classes I took at Yale. The course readings, sections, and lectures were all fantastic.",
    "An examination of international history in reference to American history from the period between 1776-1920. While it covers history familiar to most American students, the international history element adds a significant layer of nuance. I personally do not have a strong European history background, which made the first part of the course (ie the Congress of Vienna , unification of Germany) a bit tricky but if you spend neigh time with it, it becomes clear. I am a US history major and took this course at the same time as two other US history courses (one covering the early republic and one on the Civil War) and was able to apply the material from this course to help understand the other digress even more. I would recommend this course to someone who likes primary source research, is willing to out in some extra background work, and wants yo know what is happening in the world during key moments of US history. Also Prof Cohrs is absolutely awesome and brilliant",
    "The class is broad and well-structured with plenty of contrasting viewpoints as well as a sort of professorial narrative. You get to engage with primary texts from the time and see all the different sides to the story. However, I did think the class got a little boring towards the end of the section, and I think the professor could be a little bit more direct when he gives lectures. He clearly knows a lot, but it sort of seemed like he walked into class and just said everything he knows about the specific decade or event we were reading about for the week. Take this class if you're particularly interested in the 19th century. I'd recommend taking the class anywhere because the 19th century is actually fascinating in many ways, but the class can be difficult at times. Also, just to note, the class focuses a lot on Europe. I don't blame him because Europe was basically running the game at the time, but so you know.",
    "Take this if you want a broad (if somewhat repetitive) introduction to American foreign policy and American imperialism. If you have taken U.S. history courses in the past, you may find some of the material very basic. The readings are very interesting. Cohrs tends to hold his class around 5 minutes late usually, so consider this if you have a really tight schedule.",
    "A course that focuses on the diplomatic wake of the Napoleonic Wars and WW1 more than the rest of the 19th century. Cohrs is a great lecturer, though the class can seem a bit disjointed. Know that 70% of the grade is locked up in the final exam and 8-10 page paper."
