   "comments": [
    "This is a very interesting class that can benefit anyone interested in literature . I would recommend it for someone with a background in literature, as I think he would get much more out of it that way than someone who comes in with simply an interest in languages.",
    "The best class I've taken at Yale. Tuesdays are for discussing the readings: famous translations of various works into English, and arguments for various methods of translating. The background reading is rigorous and interesting without growing too far from practice. The translations themselves span some of the greatest works of world (mostly Western) literature and are aesthetically beautiful. The class itself is aesthetically beautiful, drawing on many metaphors from within the works themselves (Sappho's desire, Sherazade's storytelling, Quijote's quest) to describe the practice of translation.As far as working on your own piece goes, it is a nice measured project that runs throughout the semester, rather than being a quick disappointing rush at the end. The feedback that Professor Cole gave was touchingly thorough and serious; the feedback students gave was both highly critical and highly supportive. In the end you'll have something nice to be proud of.Do yourself a favor and take this class and do the reading and find something brief that you love and translate it.",
    "This a good class for anyone interested in the learning more about how languages work and interact in literature and poetry.",
    "Yes! Take it over pretty much any other class.",
    "This is the best course I have taken at Yale, and one of the most challenging too. I was initially skeptical that one could talk about translation for a whole semester, but how wrong I was. The coursepack is an assembly of some of the most interesting topics in translation, comparisons of different translations of the same works, and fascinating secondary readings. Professor Cole really knows how to lead a seminar discussion, and the class itself was probably the brightest collection of students I've seen in one room. The workshops are a lot of fun, and they expose you to neat works of literature from all over the world. Professor Cole is extremely invested in each student's project; he'll regularly set aside an hour from his schedule just to help you with the latest developments in your translation.",
    "YES. Please take this class if you can, it was the highlight of my semester. It is a lot of work, of course, but it is the kind of work that pays off in the long run."
