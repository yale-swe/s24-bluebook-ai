    "Amazing survey course. Professor Barringer is simply amazing and engaging. He's obviously incredibly intelligent but also so articulate and funny. There are points in history when it isn't easy to be engaging but wow dude, he just gets it went. Also, we pretty effectively went through works that really captured the essence of each movement\/period even though we took on a pretty big chunk of history. Sadly, there is a really big variation in grading between the TAs so like caveat emptor",
    "A good survey of Western art, and it's not all \"dead white men\" as some people might think. Read the textbook and go to section! Also, the earlier you start on your essays, the more fun you'll have with them.",
    "A must-take class if you are a human at Yale: amazing professor, great sections and TFs, and beautiful works of art. It can be a bit heavy on work with 3 papers and 2 exams, but is well worth the effort. The textbook was rather unhelpful and expensive, though, and I preferred reading articles online and Khan Academy.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class! Although I'd probably recommend auditing the class, because the exams and papers may be considered overwhelming.",
    "You learn a lot about art, but the class is a lot of work and hard to Cr\/D. He insists on paper sources (books) from HSAR so you have to start your papers early or all the books might be checked out. I don't think this requirement is very well thought out for a lecture that is so large; online sources can be used by many students at once while books cannot. Also class runs over almost every class period so plan accordingly.",
    "Yes--if you do not have a strong background in western art, if you want to know what you are looking at the next time you go to an art gallery or museum, take this class. Its benefit is for a lifetime.",
    "An ideal introduction to art history. This was my first art history class ever, and I took it in my second semester senior year. I think if I'd taken this class as a freshman or sophomore, I might have majored in art history because of it.",
    "100% recommend",
    "Best course at Yale. Truly enriching if you are interested in Western art, architecture, history and culture. You will be a much richer person for having taken this course.",
    "This is a must. See above!!",
    "Fascinating material, amazing lecturer, incredible section--but really subjective and grading. The class is perfect. You learn a lot, you are challenged and exposed to new material. The lectures are a highlight in my Yale career (as a senior I can say that). Every single lecture was good. Prof. Barringer is amazing. TAs are also generally good--I interacted only with mine, and she was great. But the grading was pretty ridiculous. As an intro class, and the first HSAR class for many students, it was crazy receiving papers back with such terrible grading. Take it Credit\/D!!!",
    "As a senior economics major with absolutely no background in art, I came in skeptical. However, this was one of my favorite classes at Yale, and one of the only lectures I actually wanted to go to every time. Just be wary of the workload. Although there are three papers and two exams, 50% of your grade is backloaded into the final paper and final exam, so much of your early work does not count for much.",
    "EXCELLENT class and you would be making a mistake by not taking this class before graduating. It is a Yale must-take",
    "This is a good survey course on art history. As someone who had never taken an art history course before this was an amazing introduction. The lectures were super interesting and I looked forward to going every day.",
    "HSAR 115 is a fantastic class which I would definitely recommend. The work load is not overwhelming, but the information is truly interesting, and the class\/sections are well structured.",
    "This class is a must take if you just like looking at art. It's really interesting and the lectures are fantastic.",
    "ok, you clowns. time for some real talk. no matter who you are, you absolutely must take this course. simply being in barringer's presence is a great honor, and one of the greatest lessons the course teaches you is how the history of art is really the history of the world. its so enlightening and will allow you to see history through a completely new lens",
    "MUST TAKE",
    "This course was amazing. The tests were a good amount of work to prepare for if you don't have a great memory, but if you are good at memorizing, it's a breeze. Lectures were incredible--entertaining, enlightening, and impeccably well-prepared by Barringer--and my only complaint was that we didn't have more time to go in depth about some of the more recent art that was taught. 10\/10 would highly recommend!",
    "Yea. You all need to take this course. It's a bit of work for a credit\/D class, but if you leave Yale without experiencing the Yale art gallery or have some experience with art your college career will be wasted. Just take this it meets the hype.",
    "Amazing class-take it! Easily my favorite class of senior year, and probably in my top 3 of all of Yale. There are 3 papers, midterm, and final, which is annoying, but the papers are pretty fun to write and the tests aren't too bad. Great class to take C\/D\/F",
    "I would absolutely recommend it to another student. It's learning about the history of art from the Renaissance on, and is just completely a blast. I loved it.",
    "I would highly recommend for anyone seeking an introduction to art history since the Renaissance.",
    "Great survey course, but definitely challenging for those with no prior background",
    "Amazing",
    "This is a fantastic class, one of the ones I have enjoyed most at Yale. It is a great review of art history, and an enjoyable lecture in general. I recommend anyone remotely interested in art history take this class.",
    "Great intro to an omnipresent subject!",
    "I highly recommend the class. This will give you a great overview of history of art. there is quite a bit of work involved.",
    "A fantastic course and he highlight of my senior year. I took it credit\/d and it was so good that I went every lecture and section just for fun. I learned so much and learned how to really look at art. I'll be in NYC next year, and I'll definitely enjoy going to museums more! Definitely take this!",
    "Definitely recommend for any major!!",
    "It's an amazing course for anyone with even the slightest interest in art and art history. It gives you the tools to discuss and understand art properly, and having the YUAG and YCBA right on campus allows for opportunities to see the art in person that only taking the course at Yale could provide.",
    "Fantastic intro class! You learn a lot about art history itself and more importantly learn why the study of art history can be valuable. Not too much work, and the class really encourages you to begin to think visually and connect trends in art with other historical trends. Take it if you are interested in art history!",
    "Yes. Regret taking it Credit\/D.",
    "Great class. I took Cr\/D and it was not too much work, and the lectures were an awesome intro to art. Perfect class.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "HSAR 115 is a great introductory art course. The lectures are incredible and getting to use the YUAG is a highlight of the course.",
    "Great class. Very interesting to see the larger artistic trends that have taken place over the past few centuries. Of course the survey nature of this course means that we were not able to dive into as much depth about any given period or style of art as I would have liked, but I definitely feel like I walked away from this course having learned a lot. Professor Barringer was fantastic. Intelligent, funny, and engaging, he was able to clearly communicate the ideas behind different pieces as well as how they fit into larger artistic movements. The course does have a significant workload. Art history exams already are typically a significant time commitment, and beyond having a midterm and a final, there were three additional papers that often required research at the art library. Still would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Great Credit\/D\/Fail class if you're good at writing and not good at tests or vice versa. There is a lot of work though: 3 papers, a midterm and a final though, so even if you take it C\/D\/F, you will still have some work you need to do.",
    "Great intro survey, highly recommend.",
    "Very funny and intelligent British lecturer talking about Art from 1500 to 2000. Take the course. The YUAG is amazing you only realise quite how amazing once you have taken this course.",
    "It's exactly how it's described in the syllabus, a survey of western art. I would highly recommend it because I fell like I will use the things I learned through life and I am more cultured because of the class.",
    "Take this class! Great survey, great professor, exams aren't bad (just require memorization of slides). The paper assignments are interesting but do require a substantial amount of research in print sources. This would be a great credit-D.",
    "It's a great survey of material from early-Renaissance to present. I would absolutely recommend it to other studentsyou come out with so many interesting facts and knowledge that's relevant to the rest of your life, inside museums and out.",
    "A great lecture, would definitely recommend taking it senior spring! However, I don't think it's the best credit\/d because you still have to put in a lot of work over several assignments. It's hard to bs this class in a leisurely way, but I would recommend starting it credit\/d and see about switching. But it's an amazing class and a great way to close out your Yale experience. I wish I had taken it sooner!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's a great overview of \"Western Art\" since 1300 and confronts the problems of such a canon in an intelligent way. It is great at bringing together the art being made at a given era with the historical and political context of the time. It's not a huge amount of work; the research can be a bit daunting but I really enjoyed doing it, and the number of slides to memorize is not overreaching.",
    "This is a fast-paced course that will open your eyes to the trends of art throughout history. Learning to analyze and speak about art is a great skill. I would recommend this course to students with either a lot or a little experience with art; either way, you'll learn a lot of new things. Professor Barringer is a great synthesizer of all the information, and he's also entertaining. I think a course in art history is vital to a well-rounded person, so I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone because you will start notices things about the aesthetics of your daily life (for example architecture), and how it was affected by past art movements. It is a lot of work, but it is not too hard. Therefore, if you put in a little bit of time, you should be fine with the course.",
    "Awesome introduction to art history. Barringer is engaging and hilarious-- the lectures are always enjoyable. Section is really cool because it's in the YUAG and you get to see the works you learn about in lecture. You don't really need to read the textbook at all, but the workload from the three papers is substantial-- definitely too much work to credit d. Take it. Start it credit d and then switch it to a grade. This class is dope.",
    "It's a great survey of western art history. If you haven't taken any art history before it's a great course to take.",
    "This class moves quickly! You'll need to attend each class or make sure to get notes. But it's very fun and well worth attending anyway. Tim Barringer is amazing. As someone who has never taken an art history class before, I was blown away. You must take this class before graduating.",
    "Great way to experience great art and learn about it! I finally understand what everyone is talking about and I've gained appreciation for art I used to hate. Definitely take it if you want to learn about the western pictorial tradition but don't expect any diversity.",
    "Amazing course! Take it. Take it Cr\/D\/F, but take it! You will learn so much. The lectures are incredibly engaging!",
    "A wonderful course--definitely take it! Professor Barringer is an amazing lecturer, it's a survey course while still giving you a good understanding of individual artists and pieces of art, and you get to spend your sections in the art galleries. Highly highly recommend!",
    "Take this class regardless of your major. It will be worth all the effort you put in.",
    "Very good experience and totally doable for someone that hasn't taken art history before.",
    "T A K E T H I S C L A S S. It's worth every minute, it's fascinating, even if you're not into art history, and the papers and tests are actually kind of fun. It's really great to sit in lecture twice a week for fifty minutes just looking at beautiful things. It's important to get some background in visual analysis!! I've taken away so much from this class, and I'd greatly recommend it to anyone even remotely interested.",
    "A class that every Yale student should take before they graduate. Whether or not you have any art exposure going into the class, you will leave with the skills necessary to appreciate art in all its forms for the rest of your life. This was a perfect senior spring class, and section in the Yale Art Gallery once a week was a pleasure rather than a calendar obligation.",
    "An amazing course because of Professor Barringer's amazing lectures. I took it credit\/D. If I didn't the workload would have been unmanageable. There were three papers and two exams in this course which was a little bit much. Definitely came away with this course with a new appreciation for art. Take this class credit\/D if you can. If you want to just learn, audit the class and have a great time without dealing with the assignments.",
    "It was a very fun class and I felt like I learned a lot more about history of art, especially modern art.",
    "A great survey course. A good bit of work though so I would recommend taking it credit\/D",
    "I recommend every Yale student take this class before they graduate. The lectures are amazing and Tim not only analyzes art by also the historical trend that created it, and you gain the ability to look at art critically and historically. Take it just take it.",
    "YES! I Imagine this is the best intro art history class you could take.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course! I took it Credit\/D\/F, and it was the perfect class for this, because it has a fair number of assignments (especially considering the fact that it is an intro level course) but you can also get a lot from the class even if you don't put a ton of effort in to the essays\/studying for exams. You don't realize how nice it is to spend a class looking at beautiful\/interesting art. And section in the YUAG is awesome! Definitely take it if you have any interest in art or trying out art history as a new thing!",
    "Amazing, definitely take! I'm a senior in STEM and this was my first art history class, and I'm so glad I took it. If you think you might like this class, don't hesitate! I've always liked art and it was cool to learn about it in a more formal manner, and having this understanding has made me enjoy art in a different way. Lecture was always interesting, and the papers were not bad if you give yourself time to do them. Section is also really fun (as someone who usually doesn't like sections) because you discuss works in the art gallery. One of the best class decisions I've made during my time here!",
    "Great intro course on art history. A must take before you graduate!!!",
    "TAKE IT!!! Start it off Credit\/D\/F if you're nervous about its workload. But rest assured that if you give this material the time and attention it deserves, you will do well, and it will be among the most rewarding experiences you'll have at Yale.",
    "Absolutely. Must must take. Especially if a STEM major - it is extremely different from STEM courses and will change the way you see art.",
    "HSAR 115 is a unique experience. You have incredibly entertaining lectures from Professor Barringer on art. Then, you go to the YUAG to learn about the pieces you saw in lecture with your section. It opens up your mind to art and cultural history as well as the amazing collection of art that Yale has. I would recommend this class to anyone. I took art history classes before and loved it. Many of my friends loved it and had taken no art history.",
    "I would 100% recommend HSAR 115 to an open-minded student. Art history is incredibly interdisciplinary in that it involves art, culture, history, religion and science at once. It is definitely worth every student's while, especially when taught by Professor Barringer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, its an absolute wonderful introduction to the history of art and you walk away having learned SO much! Compared to HSAR111 (the first half of the Intro to Art History), HSAR115 is more relevant to the modern-day viewer in that you are more able to see the affects and influences of each movement and how they led to the each subsequent movement. You shouldnt feel like you have to be an art history major or a humanities person to take this class; you should take it because you will be that much more enriched. Honestly, youd be surprised how much of everyday life overlaps with art history, and it makes you feel pretty awesome to be familiar with works of art that others refer to and to be able to discuss it at will.",
    "My favorite class so far at Yale. Everyone should take it at some point! Lecture is very interesting and you learn a lot from just sitting there. Section in YUAG is also really interesting, I can now navigate the art gallery and understand the exhibits. Papers take some work but are really interesting to research and write. Grading is very fair, the midterm and final take studying for memorizing slides but are very manageable if you study far enough out.Absolutely loved this class!",
    "Excellent introductory course.",
    "HSAR115 01 is an introductory art history lecture that covers the changes in art from the renaissance to present times.",
    "Great class to learn about Art History of Europe! Auditing is a good solution if you cant take it for credit.",
    "Highly recomend this course",
    "Yes. Even though it's superficial at times, but the materials are rich and fun. Especially if you have never taken art history and will not pursue it as an academic subject, this is a great class to enjoy and learn to appreciate artworks.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It will change how you see and move through the world. Papers and studying for this class aren't a chore; they're actually really fun!",
    "I highly recommend it to anyone who may not necessarily know much about art history but who want to learn.",
    "Definitely take this class. A perfect Credit\/D, and a pretty easy class if you want to take it for a grade, too. The papers are a bit of work, but overall the class load is very manageable (not essential do the reading, for example).",
    "I think it is imperative to take an art history course while at Yale, especially with the tremendous resources we have available at the YCBA and the YUAG. Although I have not taken any other art history course at Yale, I would still argue that you should take this one. It will fill in gaps that you may have and cement your understanding of the evolution of art into the modern era.",
    "A comprehensive introduction to western art from the Renaissance to the 21st Century. A great, engaging class-- though significantly more work than the average intro course. There are three papers (2 five page ones and a final 10 page research paper that requires 8 sources from the library), a midterm, and a final. I have never checked out more books than in this class. They are all manageable, if you plan ahead-- but it was more writing than I have done in some English seminars. Overall, though, a great way to learn about art and to take advantage of one of Yale's amazing resources: the Art Gallery."
