    "I would definitely recommend the course to people working on radio astronomy and people interested in the field.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who was interested in pursuing radio astronomy.",
    "You learn about radio telescopes and how they work, as well as some basic data reduction techniques for radio data. I probably wouldn't recommend the course for someone who doesn't want to do radio astronomy, because the workload was heavier than expected. Lectures are interesting, but they don't prepare us for the homework, and the textbook is pretty bad. So the homework can be difficult when you don't know how to approach the problems at all."

    "I learned a ton about radio astronomy having come in with little knowledge. Lectures were fun, and I looked forward to them. It was basically a pure elective for me since I don't plan on doing radio research in the future."
