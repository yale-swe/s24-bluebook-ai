    "Instructor: Kelly Sue Aho \u00a0I think Kelly could have been prepared with more practice problems, primarily in the beginning of the year when we were reviewing basic chemistry concepts. Thank this would've been particularly helpful to set the pace for the rest of the semester. Our conversations were primarily based on the problem sets, or some misconceptions prior to midterms and finals. I think it would been really nice to have more skill building incorporated into the help sessions. Especially having some opportunities to work with the equations are provided in class briefly to be very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Sue Aho \u00a0I didn't interact with Kelly at all, but she seemed quite friendly and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Sue Aho \u00a0Kelly was great, it would have been nice if she had more office hours. Also perhaps if Gabe gave her more guidance on what things were most important to review for exams, etc.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Sue Aho \u00a0Kelly was very accessible, and responded to questions promptly. She was very helpful in making clarifications and in helping to review key concepts.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Sue Aho \u00a0Great prep sessions. However, 'learning it all by heart' is not helpful. It was better when she gave us an insight of how gabe usually asks questions",

    "Lectures are very fast-paced and occasionally tangential. It is not always clear whether what is being covered is entirely relevant to the topic at hand.",
    "I really enjoyed all of the different case studies in topics covered in this course. I do think that at times the lecture could be somewhat jumbled, and without titles on most of the slides provided, it was sometimes hard to figure out what the train of thought was when studying. I do think some of the math of mathematical concepts all mentioned were not explained in detail enough that I felt comfortable with the concepts they represented.",
    "It is sometimes hard to follow Gabe's lectures. He jumps around a bit. It would be very helpful if his slides (handouts) were in the order in which they are presented and had appropriate labels and titles. Also when he is lectures he sometimes writes things on the board but other times uses abbreviations or doesn't write them at all.",
    "Gabe is an incredibly passionate instructor although he only showed this openly towards the end of the course. I feel like a good book would have helped to structure my knowledge better, however I really appreciated the white board notes and the step by step approach of instructing.",
    "Gabe is a great teacher. I struggled a bit in class because I didn't have much of a chemistry background, but was able to do background research and end up doing ok. I think it was helpful that he didn't require us to memorize many chemical equations for exams, especially for someone who doesn't have much of a background in chemistry. However, it might be helpful for him to specify a couple equations that we *should* commit to memory, equations that are found regularly throughout other environmental work (the weather equation, for example). A better review before exams would have been helpful as well...maybe something that Kelly or future TF's could hold?"

The highlight of the course was the HBEF field trip, which put a lot of the material into perspective and enhanced my understanding of watershed processes, experimentation, chemistry, etc.",
    "The material in this course was so applicable to any environmental scientist. Case studies were helpful and great way to engage students.",

    "Perhaps more organization with slides (i.e. titles). It would also be helpful to have access to in-class slides.",

    "It would be helpful if notes were more well-organized. Also, more specific direction in terms of review of key concepts from general chemistry would be useful for those of us with a weak background in chemistry.",
    "Coherence of instruction",
    "Better review before exams...a lot of information is given in the course, and I tended to way overstudy and get into the nitty gritty details of what Gabe would say in class (and what I wrote down in notes). If you get into all the details of what is covered, I don't think that is a reasonable amount of material to study (it would be too much). Having a study guide would help curb the amount of time invested in studying."

Also the problem sets require quite a bit of foresight and time to think over the questions. But overall, the course is an excellent one and you learn a lot.
