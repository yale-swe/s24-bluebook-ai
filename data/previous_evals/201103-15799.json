    "I would say it\u0092s basically a course on PET imaging. It\u0092s an introduction to the theory of it, as well as studies with drugs, mostly drugs of abuse. The professors are all extremely nice, the workload is more than manageable, and the experience is enjoyable. If you need rigid organization, though, this may not be the course for you.I would recommend it to another student only if they were interested in neuroimaging, particularly PET, or neurochemical systems, particularly dopamine.",

    "I was exposed to a new method of neuroimaging, which opened my eyes to what can be accomplished as far as neurotransmitter systems go. I can think of several studies I would be interested in pursuing using PET imaging.",
    "Helped clear fundamentals about PET principles and strategies."
