   "comments": [
    "Quite an eye-opener about the world of disability studies. It sparks thought about their portrayal that many often overlook. The readings are long but more than interesting enough to be worth the time. Take this class if you think you'd be interested in disability studies but don't know much about it.",
    "I would recommend it if you're looking for an easy-ish humanities, american studies, or english class. there is some work, but it's never overwhelming. Don't take it if you don't care at all about disability, or you'll be tired ofreading and writing about it by the end of the semester.",
    "An interesting way to get a writing credit of you want to try something new. Definitely changes the way you think about disabled people. Or do you even call them disabled people?",
    "You read theory papers, biographies, literature, and see films related to disability. Throughout the course of the semester you learn to look critically at all of these- and become an advocate for appropriate and respectful portrayals of disability.Professor Berger leads discussions in a very open manner, and is a caring, great professor. I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "This class was great! You really focus on disability in literature and disability theory in interesting ways. The books are great; sometimes the theory is a little complicated but you can skim it to get a good idea of what it is talking about and then you go over it in class. The writing is fun (and graded very fairly\/easily). Our class was small and discussions were great!Professor Berger is simply awesome. He could not be nicer, and he is great at facilitating class discussions. He is also available and eager about helping out with all papers; he truly is a joy to learn with.",
    "This is an interesting course that you should definitely look into if you have any interest in disability studies. It is also similar to an English course because of the response papers and the readings, so keep that in mind when you are shopping."
