    "I think that this class was somewhat helpful for developing different ways of thinking about the issue of forgery. I was particularly interested in the concept of literary forgery. Unfortunately, I think that the content was in some ways too diverse though, and as a result became spread a bit thin. There was a lot of catch up work to get people to baseline understanding for much of the Assyrian (for example) material. I think that there were also too many case-study readings for class (especially since we ended up focusing on one). It would have been helpful, I think, to explore a single case study deeply for several classes."
