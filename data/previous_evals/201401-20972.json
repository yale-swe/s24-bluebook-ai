    "You know how it goes, you do your research, you write something up, you present at group meeting, and you're done. If you were already planning on continuing your research, why not get credit for it?",
    "It's relaxed, and the amount you work is all up to you and depends on your mentor. Definitely recommend it to sophomores\/juniors\/seniors that want to.",
    "Good, standard research for credit class. definitely take it",
    "If you are looking at this class then you probably have to take it. It's just research with a paper and presentation at the end. I had a great time and it was nice learning so much.",
    "Lab for credit. You'll spend over 10 hours a week but that's ok. It's fun if you like your lab.",
    "This is a great course to take to get first-hand experience at doing research, from performing experiments, to presenting your data, to writing a research paper. It made me realize whether or not research is something I want to do in the future, and that in itself makes the course worth it. The course is structured with a short plan of research statement paragraph during shopping period, a 4-5 page research proposal about a month into the semester, a 12-15 minute presentation in front of your PI and lab group, and a 12-15 page research paper (at ~3,500 words). You're supposed to spend ~10hrs in lab each week--sometimes it's more than that, so be prepared.",
    "I still think this should have a course organizational meeting. Alan Garen's name will be on my transcript 3 times and I've still never actually met him.",
    "Research but you get credit for it; a proposal, an oral report, and a long term paper.",
    "A good use of your time if you're looking to get some lab experience. You're paying to get the credit, instead of getting paid to work, but that might just be more worth it in the long run.",
    "You can use MBB 471 to count towards the MBB major twice. It's an easy grade and you should be doing research anyway. There's no structure outside the paper and your grade all depends on your PI and how much you enjoy your work will depend on your lab mentor (and you, honestly).",
    "Great opportunity to do research, which is a very rewarding experience.",
    "It is a very good credit if you already are working in a lab or are continuing working in a lab from the summer. Not that much work during the school year apart from your experiments but there aren't any assignments until the end of the term.",
    "Yes! Do it if you want to do research during the year, but don't want to do it for nothing.",
    "Do research. Get a credit."
