    "Yes. Absolutely. The readings are not excessive, and are interesting. Topic is relevant to today's world.",
    "This is really a class on historiography--interpreting how history is written conerning events in the past 300 years of South Asian history. This is good but can be problematic if you don't already know a ton about Indian history because the history itself is given a very cursory treatment. Still, I enjoyed the class. Juned probably won't be teaching it again, but he is a very kind and helpful instructor. I am grateful for having the opportunity to take this class.",
    "Take this class. Although it is only a semester long course you are able to learn so much about Indian history. The course is reading intensive and discussion based, so it is very difficult to participate in class if you haven't done all the readings. However the workload besides the reading is on the lighter side and you end up really engaging with the material.",
    "This was a good, low-stress course that you can learn a lot from if you do the readings. However, the professor who taught this year will not teach it next year."
