    "This course has a lot of potential, but turned out to be a huge disappointment. Unfortunately, it's poorly structured and taught. The workload is unusually heavy, but the assignments bear little relevance to the final deliverable of the course which is your own research proposal. To make matter worse, the professor does not provide you with PDFs of her weekly lectures, but will instead post her lectures in Prezzi format which is extremely hard to view and analyze without getting a headache.Bottom line: do yourself a favor, and stay away from this course unless you want to become a frustrated student and waste your time at FES. Now, you should check out the Natural Science Research Methods course, since that instructor gets better reviews from students. And don't worry about the title \"Natural Science\", you can still take it even if your research is going to deal more with the social sciences. Good luck.",
    "Presentations in Prezi were effective as teaching tools; however it would bbe nice to have the ability to save them asfiles for reference later.",
    "The assignments for this class were particularly relevant and helpful. I think the pace of the course could maybe have been sped up a bit (?) to give more time for students to work on their proposals at the end?",
    "Some information on how to do qualitative research but very little on how to actually apply it. Most info could have been gained from simply reading and doing personal studies. A pretty shallow course overall",
    "This course didn't really fit with my needs, but it was somewhat useful nevertheless.",
    "I though the teacher did an good job of looking things up and responding to student questions. I did notlike how she did not seem especially engaged during our student presentations and gave no written (and pretty much no verbal) feedback. Given the amount of work that goes into a presentation I would have appreciated getting some feedback on what could be improved.She seemed distracted this semester and not particularly excited about the subject matter.",
    "I felt like this class had great potential but that it didn't quite get there. That said, it's an incredibly large, sweeping topic with a classroom full of a variety of research backgrounds. I think the students who found the class the most helpful were MEMs who had never done research before but that is not who the class should be directed towards. The class should be aimed at MESc students with a couple years research experience. I fall into that category and often felt like precious classroom time was spent talking about basic level research methods or justifying why qualitative methodologies are legitimate. I felt like my time (and required course credits) could have been used in a better way.I've thought hard about how this could be improved because as the only required course for MESc students, it is an important class. Perhaps what could be useful is breaking the class into multiple courses, grouping novice researchers together separate from intermediate ones. This, of course, would drastically the Professor's workload and time spent on the course, which may not be of interest.This all said, Professor Doolittle was thoughtful, considerate and engaged with the entire course. It is obviously an incredibly difficult (but important) course to teach, and she should be commended for her efforts.",
    "The course meets it's goals just fine. There is a need for additional research methods courses that cover additional topics. Also, given the number of students in the course, the school should consider additional course options and support.",
    "This class is very useful to start writing a proposal and learning about research methods for use in your own study. The breadth of techniques taught is useful to help with selecting what kinds of methods might be most useful for the student's work.",
    "I didn't purchase the textbook (which was required) and was fine without it. Amity's in-class presentation were EXTREMELY useful and provided all the information I needed. I also referred to them outside class very often. I was skeptical about taking the class but it was a requirement. It turned out to be super helpful. Of course, it was not as \"interesting\" or theory-based as other classes but in terms of teaching me how to write a proposal and carry our research, it was excellent. I feel very prepared (but will see how it goes!)."

I also felt the collaboration and discussions in class that allowed students to discuss their research and get feedback was helpful (presentations) although I felt there could have been more of this.",

    "Everything needs improvement in this course.",
    "The Thursday discussion sections are a good idea but could use some work to be more valuable and more tied in to class topics.",
    "As I mentioned above, I think it would have been good to incorporate a bit more of students individual projects and evaluating those projects (as peers) as the course progressed. There were a couple projects I saw presented at the end that I felt probably still have a long way to go, and it might have been helpful for them to get feedback like this earlier than the end of the semester.",
    "A practical training on some of the research tools.",
    "The survey section of the course is weak, but justifiably so since it is a course on qualitative methods. However, F&ES does not over survey training in any other course.",
    "See question 14",
    "While most of the readings were great, I did not find the Maxwell book particularly useful, especially given that it was the only book we were required to purchase. It was more theoretical and vague than other qualitative methods books that I have used in the past.",
    "would like to have covered more topics and discuss our specific topics more often.",
    "A lot of the assignments and readings were not really all that useful for my particular proposal, perhaps they were useful for some of the students in the class, but definitely not all.",
    "We needed more feedback from the presentations and final projects at the end of the course. We put in an immense amount of work in to the final projects and presentations and I have received no feedback from students of the instructor. What's the point of it all? There is some value in the exercise of working hard, but without feedback a great opportunity for growth is lost. I am really surprised at how little we were able to work on our research topics\/ideas in a collaborative fashion. Have the proposals due three weeks earlier, skip the presentations, and have us all spend the time critiquing each other's work.Also, rescheduling the last week of presentations to coincide with finals meant that I couldn't make many of my classmates' presentations. I wanted to be there but there was a scheduling conflict. This was not acceptable, as the entire purpose of the school scheduling the finals is that they can avoid conflicts.",
    "The presumed audience and their expected research experience should be clarified. The assignments at times seemed to be more of a gesture towards research than actual assignments.One can't teach all of anthropology background, theory and methodology in one class to get students up to speed to do acceptable qualitative research. If students are really at the level where they do not know anything about anthropology (or social science) theory and general methodology, they should not be in the same methods course as students who have had years of in-field research experience.",
    "Clarity. Instructor and coursework were not always clear\/directly related to people working on their own projects. Students might have benefited more from working together in groups to discuss and improve each other's research based on what each of them is doing and what methods might be best for their studies.",
    "More encouragement on applying to outside grants (not just internal Yale ones). I would have liked to see more concrete examples of others' research: sample proposals, more past FES student budgets, samples of their survey questions, etc."
