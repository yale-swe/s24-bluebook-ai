    "Death in 140 is GREAT. Like, absolutely great. If you have to take ENGL 114 for any reason, take this course. Unlike other 114 courses, this course isn't bad; in fact the way Heather uses technology in the course is really helpful in understanding the world around us better. Be prepared to use twitter and blogs a lot in the course. While this course is challenging, it really gives you a totally new perspective on social media and death while making you a great writer. So, if you're one of the poor souls forced to take a WR course, take this one. You won't regret it. P.S. If you take this course, go to office hours; Heather's extremely helpful. If she keeps Kroker in the course pack, just battle it through. It gets better.",
    "This class is literally not like any other English class offered. Take this class if you can! The topics are extremely interesting and the discussions can be very dynamic. Best class so far at Yale.",
    "If you are taking ENG 114 for a writing credit, there are many other opportunities to fulfil the requirement. Be aware of the workload and make sure you enjoy the course subject because that is what you will be talking about for the rest of the semester over and over again.",
    "McKendry is lively and engaging. She will push you to test your limits, and in the end your writing does improve substantially. However, she has a somewhat narrow, restrictive vision for students' essays, and often pushes them to follow her predetermined idea of what the essay should argue for instead of allowing for greater liberty.",
    "As with any ENGL 114, there is a lot of writing! Expect rather lengthy readings, and because of the small class size, expect to participate in discussion. Participation is 20% of your grade in this class, which you should see as an opportunity for easy points! If you engage deeply with the reading and contribute meaningfully to the class, then you will have that nice boost to your grade. The papers will demand that you spend a lot of time on them (especially the 8-10 page research paper), but the deadlines are not to harsh if you spread out the work. This class has lots of interesting components, which I felt greatly enriched the class. For example, each week you are expected to Tweet at least once about the class (e.g. a comment\/question on a reading, a relevant article\/photo, etc.) You will also be asked occasionally to do blog posts about various topics, which are essentially just short writing assignments (only 200-300 words). Just take the class. Do it! Try like hell during shopping period to get in if you don't make the list. You won't regret it!",
    "ENGL 114 15 is a much more philosophical class than one might imagine, requiring extensive discussion on and pondering of ideas of death, technology, and their intersection in the modern world. I would recommend this course as it is incredibly interesting and assists in improving essay writing skills.",
    "The course pushes you to improve your writing skills while studying something that is so commonplace in our modern world. I'd definitely recommend the course to another student because it's interesting and helps you develop skills that you'll need in whatever field you go into.",
    "English course with much writing. The big research paper is a toll but this course is really useful 1st semester freshman year for establishing college level, academic writing skills. Just choose a section that interests you. I don't regret taking this course.",
    "Standard english composition class."
