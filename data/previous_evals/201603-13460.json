   "comments": [
    "I gained such a unique appreciation and insight into the problems facing indigenous peoples today and in the past, and feel I am much more aware about issues and topics that I didn't even know existed before this course. I learned how to think critically about issues and to try and understand my role in things.",
    "In this course, I learned how to write a history paper using primary sources and how to use Chicago style citations. I learned about indigenous religious history and how this topic has been treated legally and in academia, and about the complicated issue of cultural appropriation. I know feel better equipped to have intelligent conversations about issues of Native American spirituality and to be an ally in those fights.",
    "This course was a fairly solid introduction to the many forms Indigenous Religions take around the world, as well as problems that many indigenous peoples face. Interesting and multifaceted, the course had plenty to unpack and analyze.",
    "Overview of themes in Indigenous Religious Histories. Really helpful in broadening my understanding of Indigeneity, religion, Indigenous histories, tradition, and much more. Good balance of history and theory with readings and discussion.",
    "Gained an understanding of Indigenous spirituality through a global lens. Learned a lot about concepts of spirituality and cultural understandings of the sacred.",
    "I thought more critically about issues relating to indigenous religions and also developed skills of historical analysis, from looking at and assessing primary texts to learning how to frame a historical argument.",
    "I learned a lot about alternative ways of thinking about and studying indigenous peoples. I really appreciated thinking critically about academic disciplines like history and anthropology and the level of personal responsibility and vulnerability that the classroom environment generated.",
    "This course challenged students to critically assess the methodologies through which Indigenous religious histories are written, and to examine various cultural differences in understandings of history. Discussion often centered on the motivations\/purposes of telling Indigenous histories, and we also explored the implications of various forms of historical documentation have on the experiences of contemporary Indigenous people. This course challenges students to connect historical and contemporary processes of colonization and decolonization to religious freedom in Native communities, and it also challenges students to rethink the definition of \"religion\".",
    "This course taught me the vocabulary and issues that specifically relate to the study of indigenous religious traditions. I was exposed to new ways of thinking about the topic and complex debates within the field. This class definitely improved my research and writing skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course did a really good job of addressing this topic from multiple points of view that addressed the limitations of each. The readings and film choices were wonderful, and brought about valuable conversations. However, as a non-native student in a primarily native student class, I often didn't feel comfortable addressing some topics that I didn't know much about. While I appreciate that this course made me address many of my own limitations in many of these topics, I felt that the atmosphere of discussion was often not conducive to participating with only a limited knowledge of the subject.",
    "I think sometimes the overall structure of the class and how each week's topics related and built on each other was not always clear. I think a little more guidance and context from Professor Hale would have been nice. I also felt that not everyone felt incredibly comfortable speaking given the sensitive nature of this topic, so I think a note at the beginning about how to approach the topic in a politically correct way might have been good as well. I think the strength of the class was that Professor Hale is very approachable and did a job of including each student's voice in our conversations and making sure everyone felt welcomed and supported. She clearly cares a lot about her students and meeting their needs.",
    "Strengths: Interesting because of the variety of topics and approaches, solid research skill development, get to evaluate various sources Weaknesses: because of the variety of topics and approaches couldn't really dig into any of the cultures to learn more than very surface level concepts, class conversation could get repetitive, however, this could be fixed through discussion moderation",
    "The organization by theme and not place or group of people was really helpful! Great syllabus and well facilitated discussions. No recommendations.",
    "The material selected from the movies to the readings were all interesting and worked well together. Sometimes in class I felt like we circled back to the same questions of representation but that may just be the nature of studying Indigenous spirituality.",
    "The course explored an academic area that is seldom covered at Yale - indigenous religions, it moved us to look at history from an alternate perspective that is focused on communities seldom discussed about. However, I do think the course would have benefited from a further exploration of indigenous communities and indigenous religions beyond North America and Europe.",
    "The strength of the course lay in its frank and fascinating discussions about the nature of indigenous religions. The readings were really interesting and engaging and the discussions even more so. Professor Hale was an excellent facilitator and knew when to make room for student facilitators and when to step in. The main weakness of the course was the cohesiveness of the course readings. I felt at times that it was difficult to connect the readings and that the course could have benefited from narrowing the topic. That being said, I think that the way Professor Hale pushed us to think about the ways that the readings did connect (even when seemingly disconnected) was great!",
    "Course discussions are heavily student led, which is an excellent way to practice the facilitation of a group discussion. However, the course would benefit greatly from more structured or pointed lectures at the beginning of each meeting, such that we could learn or review specific details from the readings\/related content, and also discuss the way certain histories are written."

   "comments": [
    "YES! I think this course should be taken by everyone at Yale. This is one of the most understudied subjects and the way it is taught in this course is engaging and thought-provoking.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Hale is an excellent teacher and the content is very important for everyone to know.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student! Amazing syllabus with lots of insightful perspectives that ended up actually changing the way I think about history and religion, both in and outside of an Indigenous context.",
    "A great course. One of only a handful in the college related to indigenous peoples or Native Americans. Really gives students the opportunity to conduct independent research on their own terms. Several checkpoints along the way in preparation for final paper, so I felt prepared for it. Really interesting course materials that I plan to revisit later.",
    "Yes, the course is particularly rewarding because of the integration of contemporary Native American issues alongside understandings of Indigenous spirituality.",
    "Yes. I particularly enjoyed the texts that we read for the course and if you are interested in indigenous communities the course will be an engaging way to understand and think about the way indigenous communities are perceived.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Professor Hale is a great teacher and very kind. The discussions are really interesting and make you reflect on your own relationship to the material!",
    "Anyone interested in challenging their preconceived notions or definitions of \"religion\" should absolutely take this class, and anyone interested in exploring the diverse ways history can be portrayed and the impacts that such portrayal has on Indigenous people would deeply enjoy this course. It emphasizes discussion, critiques of author positionality and motivation, and ethical research in Indigenous communities.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in religious or indigenous history. This class gave me the opportunity to read and discuss topics in history that are not discussed in many history classes. Professor Hale introduced ways of thinking about indigenous history that were entirely new to me, and the global focus of the course offered a variety of perspectives. The seminar was definitely shaped by the students and discussion was definitely able to go in the direction that we were interested in."
