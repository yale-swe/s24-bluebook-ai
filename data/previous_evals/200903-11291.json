    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I had taken French for 4 years, but the last time I took it was junior year of high school. This was a great fit. I got to review grammar thoroughly, learn new vocab, and practice my conversation, which was my weakest point. You cover everything set out in your syllabus, which is a great feeling. Professor Wynant is great. Very approachable, friendly, and knowledgeable.",
    "DO NOT take an 8:20 class unless you're a morning person. Other than that, I highly recommend this course to any L3 French student.",
    "If you want to learn french, take L3 at yale because at this stage you need practice with the basics",
    "Yes, I have recommended it to another student already. It is good for someone looking to be proficient in French - in all areas, reading, speaking, and writing, but also must have time to attend daily class and do daily homework.",
    "The grammar exercises were very thorough and effective, and the choice of literature\/films were unexpectedly interesting for this level of French. It is rigorous, but worth all the effort. My own instructor, Katrien Wyant, was an exceptional teacher: skillful, thorough, dynamic."
