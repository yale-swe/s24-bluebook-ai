   "comments": [
    "The strengths are in the diversity of faculty and instructors that facilitated the course. The weakness was in trying to use that diversity to discuss too many different topics. The course needs to be condensed to focus more closely on practical skills and unnecessary content cut (including: mongo db, parallel processing). In the future, the course would be greatly improved by focusing on real take away techniques that the students can learn. Conceptual information or research presentations from outsiders was interesting, but not wildly helpful. In the future consider whether or not the presenters research is actually going to lead to skill development or better understanding. This course could be really cool and extremely helpful... some thought needs to be put into the design, delivery, and assignments.",
    "some of the lectures \/ lecturers were really great, and others less so. I think the course could be improved by culling the less useful stuff. The data warehousing lecture comes to mind as not being very useful. I feel like survey courses always have to battle with depth vs breadth, and in some parts the course hit the mark and others could be improved. One direction I would like to see the course go is to incorporate the projects earlier -- like, the first day. I would challenge ppl to find projects that can accommodate each of the lecture topics and then have ppl use their own datasets for homework and whatnot. Often this isn't feasible in large courses but I think it could work here. More broadly, the needs of the students in this class (or at least the students like me) is to balance time spent learning new stuff and time spent making progress on our independent research. I think the closer you can align the former to the latter the more buy-in you'll get from students and the more we'll get out of it.",
    "Broad overview of the field",
    "Stengths: we learned a lot of different useful topics. The weakness was that we had a lot of assignments that were challenging for some students. Such as multiprocessing."
