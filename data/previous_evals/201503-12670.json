    "If you're super interested in ethnic conflict and want a good overview of the major literature and models on the topic, this is a good class. Expect it to be mostly lecture style rather than discussion based, and to focus a lot on Bosnia and the technical side of academic models. If you're not interested in Bosnia or don't have a background in reading political science models, this may not be the course for you.",
    "TAKE IT!!!",
    "This is a very good class. Not too much work (very manageable amount of readings, 3 short essays) and you engage with the political science literature on a level that I've never done before. You critique the prevailing theories, combine case studies with empirical studies, etc. Super relevant to modern context (Syria, Iraq, etc.) and it's good to be conversant in these topics.",
    "Do not do it. Class is spent 1\/2 of the time on some dull economic model rather than the interesting things it represents and the other 1\/2 of the time talking about the ethnic conflict in Bosnia. if you are HIGHLY interesting in Bosnia, take it. If not, do not do it to yourself. There are many classes at Yale that explore ethnic conflict to a deeper degree while presenting more balanced readings (not all of the professors readings and those he agrees with). Also, there are so many ethnic conflicts, why Bosnia was the only one really explored in depth is beyond my understanding.",
    "Yes take this class if you are interested in learning the reasons behind ethnic violence. A lot of the literature that you read has statistical models, but this is balanced out with qualitative literature on the topics as well. There is also a good amount of attention paid to specific case studies that balances out the theory of the class to make for an interesting and informative class overall. The class provides you with a good understanding of current events and pushes you to think of practical solutions to some very real-world and pressing problems.",
    "Good seminar if you are interested in ethnic conflict and want to delve deep in the content",
    "This is an out and out poli sci course - data analysis with only a little political theory. Take if youre interested in this stuff, because the professor is a great resource."
