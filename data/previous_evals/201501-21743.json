    "there is literally nothing to say about this class except that it is fine. if you want to learn latin prose comp (or more likely, someone is making you) then you should take this class. professor solodow is really nice and really knows his stuff. it's fine. absent a compelling reason probably take a reading class but also it's fine so whatever.",
