    "Alark was great... really friendly and accessible. However the class wasn't what I signed up for. Each seminar was spent looking at good and bad visualizations in a different field and nothing more. So while I learned a lot about what's already out there in the field, I didn't learn to actually MAKE a good data visualization. We had one brief workshop on Java and Processing, but basically had to pick it up on our own after that for the final project. This class would've been WAYY cooler had it been more hands on.By way of workload, we had weekly reading responses and a final project.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone interested in studying data visualizations and experimenting with methods of their own. Some of the reading is dense, but they all offer interesting perspectives into the visualization field.",
    "Yes, absolutely. You should know that this is more of a computer science class than a graphic design class, but if you're okay with that, you'll learn a lot and have fun.",
    "This course was an interesting treatment of the topic of data visualization, a field often misunderstood or not considered fully by many people, students and adults alike. Alark was an incredibly caring and passionate professor whose own work in the field made him very knowledgeable and engaging to learn from. The course had a fair amount of work but was not overly difficult and I felt like I learned quite a bit. That said, if it's offered again, hopefully Alark will fine tune the course a bit more. Also, if you're not very interested in the field of data visualization, the course will NOT be enjoyable, so definitely shop the first day of class and figure out if it's what you want.",
    "Take it if you're interested in data and graphs, it will help you. This is a perfect class for someone going into science or consulting. It's also a lot of fun."
