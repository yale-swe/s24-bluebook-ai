    "I learned a lot about biological techniques and literature reading. Very well-organized and inspiring.",
    "I developed a lot of knowledge of microscopy and spectroscopy techniques commonly used for studying biological systems. I also developed literature review skills and the ability to pick out important information from papers in order to be able to follow the logic, even if I dont understand all the details.",
    "I learned a lot of useful biophysical techniques and theory for developing experiments to utilize these techniques. Additionally, I gained a sense of comfort in evaluating the use of these techniques in the literature. I also learned how to prepare an NIH grant proposal."

   "comments": [
    "I really love the organization of the class. I enjoyed a lot about the class itself and the literature discussion. Also, I quite like the literature-based exam and the exam problems are quite good.",
    "A big strength is the paper based nature of the class. The fact that each lesson is followed up with a paper utilizing the method taught was very helpful in giving context for the use of the method and also helping to make it easier to understand. It was also good to learn about how these methods can be applied in ways that might not be readily apparent and also important biological discoveries made possible by these methods.",
    "This class is thorough in its coverage of popular biophysical techniques. Naturally, there are other techniques used in biophysical research that were not covered, but adding these techniques would compromise the coverage of the other techniques covered in this course. I can't think of any weaknesses of the course! I had a lot of fun learning about all the instrumentation and how to design experiments."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, of course! I really enjoyed this class. I would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "Definitely! This course was a very good introduction to the theory behind common methods used in biology. In addition, it introduced students to these spectroscopy and microscopy techniques if they have not used them before. The class provides a good toolkit for students to begin to look at unanswered questions and have some tools to start addressing them.",
    "Absolutely. This course was very helpful in covering the fundamental principles behind popular biophysical experimental techniques. I gained comfort in discussing the use of these techniques in the literature and feel that I could effectively design experiments that utilize the techniques that we covered."
