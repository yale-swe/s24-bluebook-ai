    "Having a speaker about each cancer is a very important strength of the course. I think having the PSA and HPV discussions were not really helpful. It would have been beneficial to just discuss the science behind PSA and HPV.",
    "Good course covering lots of different cancers, and associated research",
    "Interesting course, touch upon a lot of cancer types. Good interactive. Not too much workload.",
    "Great guest lecturers. Professor's lectures were a bit bland. Could have been much more exciting class given the interesting topic but it was a bit boring.",
    "It was a great course! I enjoyed the breadth of the class in learning about all of the different cancers.",
    "Dr. Cartmel was awesome. There were a lot of guest lectures, which I don't love, just because everyone has a different teaching style. Overall it was a really great course though.",
    "Great topics coverage in cancer epidemiology.",
    "Broad overview of all cancers and great visiting speakers.",
    "Strength: Provides a variety of information on general trends in cancer epidemiology as well as specific information on various cancers. Weaknesses: Very much a survey course, no particular topic discussed in great depth."
