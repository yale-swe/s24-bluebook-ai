    "Well, not sure if it'll be offered again since Claire is leaving, but if you have the chance, certainly take it. You'll learn so much, especially if you're from India\/Pakistan about things that you didnt have exposure to before.",
    "RLST 340 is a class that I would recommend to non-religious studies and non-theatre studies majors - the class material is relevant for anyone interested in Islam, and gives a great framework for examining many of the contemporary debates about what is 'permissible' according to Islam. Great course.",
    "Definitely. Ten times over."
