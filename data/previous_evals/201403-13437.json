    "Well, it doesn't really matter if I recommend it since all majors have to take a junior seminar anyway, but it was pretty good. Not as exciting as I expected, but since it was a new teacher this year I'm sure it will get better with time. But I definitely learned some interesting stuff about art history and criticism, and got to know some other majors, albeit a lot less than I expected.",
    "nononono except you have to so, yea.",
    "This class was unlike any other class I've taken at Yale. Discussions were enlightening, but wandered all over the place. The professor's cynical, blunt perspective provided a refreshing dose of humor & reality. And I'm not entirely sure what the class was about on an overarching scale, but I still feel like I learned a lot about my practice as an artist and my position in the art world.",
    "You have to take it for the art major. It's not that much work and the readings are intreating and good to know about.",
    "I can't compare this class to the other opinion for a junior seminar, but I thought this class was good. It was more art history than I thought but it was really interesting and I feel like I got a lot of new ideas to apply to my art-making and my notion of the art world. You get to meet other art majors in other disciplines so that is wonderful. Dushko knows a lot about his subject and is a good guide through art history and the art world.",
    "fun to get to know other art majors, but didn't learn too much academically.",
    "Junior seminar was a great way to become acquainted with the other art majors in your year--something very valuable, considering the small size of our major, which can be advantageous at times. The essays we read and discuss, and moreover the ideas presented in them, are important ones that anybody entering a creative field ought to know and understand.",
    "Dushan Petrovic, or Dushko, as hell have you call him, does a good job presenting modern and contemporary arts critical cannon. Through one dense reading a week from each movement (ab.ex., minimalism, conceptual art, etc.), hell portray the progression in an simplistic and neat way. While sometimes, I felt privy to his greatest insights, other times I felt like he was teaching us a history befit for grade-schoolers that didnt do justice to the complexity of the texts. But this is forgiven, because many of the texts werent complex, but rather muddled and obtuse, and even a one-sentence synopsis is hard to formulate. Dushko is a better lecturer than he is discussion leader, but hes best at leading a group of art students self-elevating banter about the art world and its woes. Whether lecturing, leading on-topic discussion, or just getting us going, its always about him. Not that I minded that. Youll find him chummy or charming, or both; hes undeniably intelligent and entertaining. On the first day of class, he managed to both undersell and oversell the class; he showed up without a syllabus, and asked us what we wanted to learn before graduating. In the end, he delivered lectures on his areas of expertise that I deduce hes devised over the years in the context of many lectures and seminars. I dont blame him for sticking to his tried-and-true material. His mistake was leading us to believe that he would deliver where our other teachers hadnt, for building expectations and then not delivering. The assignments he had us do werent particularly smart; do a drawing (of\/about?) nothing, invent an artists life and work. If either of these sound appealing, its because theyre impossible, and therefore not exactly fun (my classmates might agree); the profound insight I came to from doing them is that (1) you cannot do a drawing about nothing and (2) you cannot invent an artist without living their life (and making their work), so youll have to adopt and modify one. He didnt anticipate that wed be expected to present work in the end of semester show. When he learned, mid-way through finals week, he led us in a last-minute effort to do something collaborative, which ended up being, well, shitty. Agree on their merit or not, youll definitely be frustrated that so little time is spent discussing\/critiquing what you produce. He left crit to the end of class, and sometimes put it off until next week. Without much feedback from him and others, not only do you leave without a way to improve, but any idea of your grade. After being informed by kereszi that his class was to display something in the group show, we had to produce something last minute. This show basically became everyones final opportunity to show that they care and work hard. I guarantee this was peoples motivation for participating in the collaboration, because the idea we came up with was so shitty that no one could have actually wanted to execute it. While I write this, I have no clue what grade to expect. But hey, as I learned this semester, having good grades doesnt make you a good artist."
