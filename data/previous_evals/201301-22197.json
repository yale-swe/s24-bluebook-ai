    "In EP&E 215 with Professor Donahue, you learn about different moral frameworks. You see how different thinkers - Mills, Marx, Rawls, Hobbes, and more - want us to judge the world. Should we focus on maximizing happiness, or autonomy, or the \"greater good\", or something else? I would recommend this course to students who want to see how different philosophies apply to both historical and modern scenarios, and who want to get a good working knowledge of the writings of some of the most widely-read philosophers in both the U.S. and the world.",
    "Great course! You should definitely take this if you are at all interested in philosophy applied to economics and politics. Make sure to actually do the reading.",
    "Take it if there are enough people in the class",
    "Take this class. Professor Donahue is a great teacher, and I really enjoyed going to class. Philosophically minded people will particularly enjoy this, I think, but people more on the political science side will too.",
    "Good class. I wasn't able to shop Kapustin's version, so I can't speak to how they compare, but this is definitely a good option. The syllabus seems to change a bit every year, but this year at least we covered essentially the greatest hits of the Western liberal tradition (Marx, Mill, Kant, Rawls, Hobbes) plus some more modern considerations about race and a few others topics--so there is a good deal of overlap with more introductory classes. The additional, more specialized topics definitely added to the class. We also had visiting lecturers who led sections pertaining to their work, which I thought was interesting and added something unique to the class, though I don't know if that will happen again. Discussions were generally interesting and engaging, since the readings for each week were substantial but not overwhelming. I do wish there were more room for debate between students, but I understand that Donahue wants to make sure that we understand the material (even if it is his particular interpretation of it)."
