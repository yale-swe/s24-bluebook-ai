    "I took the class because Prof. Shneiderman was teaching it. It provided a good critique of development and makes you rethink a lot of things you took for granted in the field of international development. The readings are intense but you will get through. The class is what you make of it but try it during shopping period before sealing your schedule. Also make sure you have already taken an anthro course before taking this otherwise the theories turn a little bit too heavy.",
    "You must take this class if you ever even consider working internationally, in nonprofits, international business, trade or development. Its an excellent class that is well taught and fulfills a crucial gap in the way the Global is taught at Yale. Global Affairs - please make this a required course. Majors need some understanding of culture, the production of truth by institutions - I've had to cringe every time culture was written off as \":something to be sensitive to\" in most GLBL classes.",
    "Forget about the classes in the Political Science, Economics, EP&E and the Global Affairs. If you want a more nuanced and critical understanding of \u2018development\u2019 then this is the class to take. I loved the class reading list. The amount of reading assigned for each week were on average 400 pages but it was manageable and the readings were very enjoyable. The class was very well structured and well taught. The assignments were spread out throughout the semester and Prof. Shneiderman assigned each one of them well ahead of the deadlines so that we could start thinking about them in advance. Classmates were great, people didn\u2019t generally make shallow pointless comments. That again is a measure of the strength of the class; the class attracted real people who could do real conversations.",
    "This class should probably be titled \"Anthropological Critiques of International Development.\" The idea is this: read a book a week, usually but not always an ethnography, covering all the \"classics\" of anthropological critiques of development (like Ferguson and Escobar) and then moving into really current works (a majority of the books we read were published after 2010, I think). It's the class that will take a step back and ask, what is development, anyway? And how does it actually play out around the world - how do specific people involved in it conceive of it? And a million other questions, too. I think it's ridiculous that any Global Affairs major would graduate without having read some of this material - and lots of other people would benefit from it, too. Sara Shneiderman taught the course this year, and she won't be at Yale next year so somebody else might be teaching it. Shneiderman is amazing; Yale is losing a huge asset. She's a master at drawing out the relevance of what can be really hard texts, and explaining them in clear, simple terms. She was really lovely to have guiding the class. Our discussions were often good, though sometimes they stalled; it was good that we only had about ten people in the class. And the assignments were mostly worthwhile, but you'll get the most out of it by just putting in the work to read the readings and talk about them. One of the best classes I've taken.",
    "This class was great. The workload was manageable, though there is a fair amount of reading to be done if you want to get the most possible out of the class. I don't think Professor Shneiderman will be teaching it next year, but I would highly recommend taking a class with her. If you take this class, you'll likely gain a more nuanced perspective on development and its role in the world.",
    "Great class. Be prepared for reading a book a week in depth.",
    "This is an excellent course and EVERYONE going into development should take it. Often courses at Yale that focus on international development revolve strictly around economics, failing to recognize the cultural failures of development programs that focus on people as easily predictable in economic calculations... In this class you read all the important critiques of development, and important recent examples that all should be aware of. The only weakness of the course is that it was far too much reading (1 book per week) and I couldn't keep up. I really took only a tiny bit of what the class could offer because of not doing the readings."
