   "comments": [
    "This class is a huge book club. For me, that wasn't necessarily an issue because I enjoy independent reading and discussion of topics I myself have already worked through while reading a text. If you were immediately put off by the concept of a book club, then maybe this class isn't for you.",
    "I can not stress enough how much you should take this class. Though the reading list may look ambitious at first, the novels are such a pleasure to read that it often hardly feels like the course has significant work. If you want to consider American Literature in an entirely new light take the course. Even if you don't, still take the course.",
    "The reading list for this class is fantastic and varied enough to keep things interesting. Be aware that the reading load can be heavy -- essentially a novel a week -- but I honestly enjoyed it as it it was a nice change of pace from my other coursework. The written assessments are quite manageable (one short paper, one long paper) with very reasonable timelines; outlines are due weeks in advance, which helps you keep things on track. Professor Dimock is incredibly knowledgeable and responsive to comments during discussions, which are always engaging.",
    "YES! I would most definitely recommend ENGL 012 to another student! You will be expected to read a book a week, which shouldn't deter you from the course. The books are amazing, and so are the discussions. You have discussions led by either Professor Dimock or classmates who are \"presenting,\" which makes you responsible for your reading, so that you don't disappoint your peers on their days to lead. In addition to this presentation, you write a five and ten page paper, and are encouraged to come up with your own topic. Professor Dimock gives personalized feedback on every outline, which, as I've previously stated, is incredibly helpful for a freshman course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another Yale student! The freshman seminar program is amazing, and it's great to get to know other freshmen. I loved most of the readings in this course, and the concept of this course is very cool.",
    "This is a good freshman seminar that is highly reading intensive. You will read about a novel a week, but beyond that there is not much work required. Its a great way to get a writing credit, and a really fun class. Most of the novels are fun to read, so the work never feels that bad.",
    "An interesting course with great works of literature. You do have to read a book a week, though, and there are only two essays and a presentation. If you love literature and detailed literary analysis, go ahead.",
    "Demanding. Start your papers early",
    "A class for anyone passionate about reading many great books in a short period of time; a sort of One-Term American Studies version of Directed Studies. Also good for anyone looking for a transition-course to College-level English standards."
