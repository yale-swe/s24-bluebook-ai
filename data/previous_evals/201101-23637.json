   "comments": [
    "I think if it is refocused with more attention on discussion then I would. As of right now, I am not sure I have learned very much, but it was enjoyable.",
    "It is the study of the development of the American Gulf Coast, stretching from Florida to Texas. The timeline includes early, early colonization through present day issues such as Hurricane Katrina and the oil industry in Houston. I would absolutely recommendthis class, especially if brasseaux is teaching the course. You learn more from him than the books or papers, and he is an amazing resource and will get to be an amazing (professional, to be sure) friend for you in Yale administration.",
    "If you want to learn more about the Gulf Coast, absolutely.",
    "This is a cool seminar with interesting readings and material. The professor is fantastic. Anyone can take this and enjoy it.",
    "Yes. Take this class.",
    "A interdisciplinary study of the history, traditions, culture, and people of the American Gulf Coast (Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida).",
    "It was a great course. It's important to learn about this understudied region.",
    "I think people who really want to write a paper about the Gulf Coast should take this class, Ryan will be really fun to write with\/for, and the Gulf Coast is really fascinating. Make sure you like Ryan, and if you do it will be great!",
    "Unfortunately, I do not believe this class will be offered again but if it is TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I always looked forward to Tuesday afternoons because I knew I had 2 hours of the Gulf Coast ahead of me.",
    "Reasonable workload. Wide range of subjects and types of reading material - both primary and secondary sources. Engaging, delightful professor. Engaging discussion. Definitely take this class. If you aren't from the South, you'll wish you were by the semester's end, and if you are from the South, you'll come away from the semester with a newly informed connection to your home.",
    "Take this if you are looking for a fun seminar.",
    "This is a class largely on Gulf Coast history and culture. Take it if you want a survey course where you will learn a lot of information."
