    "YES! Prof Freeman is awesome, gives great feedback, class atmosphere is fun and relaxed, working with primary sources is awesome.. and Im not even a history major.",
    "An incredible experience for anyone with an interest in US history, politics, and\/or historical research. You get a really interesting new perspective on perhaps the most important period in our country's development and on the founding fathers. It's fun to see them get dirty in the political game; if you thought things were messy now, you ain't see nothing yet! Beyond that, though, you get to work a true scholar and mentor: Joanne Freeman. She makes class a joy every day with her energy and enthusiasm, and she encourages everyone to participate and be comfortable putting yourself out there. And then the paper comes, and you're terrified, and she supports you EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. If you've never written a true historical research paper before (I hadn't), this is the best course to learn. Professor Freeman, gives you tons of advice and aid as necessary. While the rough draft seems due early, it's because she then goes through it and gives LINE EDITS. Yes, all 20 pages (or whatever you submit), she reads and carefully offers feedback line by line. It's amazing. You will finish this course feeling so improved as a writer and researcher and so proud of your final product, that experience alone makes all the work (that you'll want to do, since you'll feel such ownership and connection with the paper) worth it. And yeah, Joanne Freeman is the best, you should absolutely not pass up the chance to work with her.",
    "Take this class to learn how to write a proper research paper!",
    "Early American history is not my field, but I took the class because I'd never written a long research paper before and I knew that Professor Freeman gives really good guidance about the research and writing process. First of all, I actually enjoyed the early American stuff a lot -- there's a lot that's surprising about this period and a ton of funny anecdotes that you'll learn. Professor Freeman is an expert on this period and her enthusiasm for it is contagious. She shares a lot of cool tidbits about her research and her own academic writing. We had really lively discussions where almost everyone participated, despite the class being at 9:25. But what really sets this class apart is that you will really learn how to write a long research paper. Professor Freeman gives super helpful comments on your draft and meets with you about it, and she's really committed to teaching you how to write. This class made me feel so prepared for the History major and taught me so much about sustaining and structuring arguments over 20 pages. I feel like I actually did the History thing which is really great!",
    "I recommend it. It's a class on political ideas and political culture (you don't study events like the XYZ Affair or the Embargo in detail), which is an interesting and valuable way to understand early national America. Most of the books are good, and the discussion was usually stimulating. I had a strong background in early American history which was useful for the class, though not absolutely necessary. The class was worth taking even just to get Freeman's guidance through the process of writing a long research paper. The effort she made was truly remarkable! She was incredibly helpful, everywhere from choosing the topic all the way down to footnotes.",
    "Overall, this was a great class. Professor Freeman is fantastic. She line-edits our 20 page rough drafts and really helps each of her students produce a high quality final paper. The class is a little tough if you don't know much about the era, though. It would have been nice to have a little five to ten minute overview of the topic at the beginning of each class.",
    "Both the books and the seminar discussions are interesting. Despite its 9:25 AM time slot, Professor Freeman's powerfully good teaching and discussion-leading made me excited to get up for class. The essay-writing process is long, but Professor Freeman is with you for every step of it, and she fully invests in improving each student's writing. You'll end up with a finished product worthy of your time. I highly recommend this seminar, especially for history majors who want a thorough preparation for the senior essay and for people who are really interested in the early republic.",
    ".Phenomenal, phenomenal, phenomenal. I have never written so hard on a paper, and I've never been prouder of a piece of my work. I think the only (small) area in which this class could be improved would be by making seminar discussion a bit more focussed--possibly by assigning less reading. It's difficult to read 200 some pages a week and be able to have a focused discussion in class. But overall, this is a magnificent class. In particular, Professor Freeman LINE EDITS! a full draft. That is absolutely incredible. To have a teacher put that much work into a student is really rare. Take a seminar with Professor Freeman if you can!! Also, try to have as full a draft as possible to turn in. The more you put into this class, the more you get out.",
    "Yes, without hesitiation. This was a really great course. Professor Freeman is clearly passionate about both uncovering and transmitting history. She is friendly, engaging, and fairly accessible. She encouraged great conversation. The early prospectus and draft were incredibly helpful in focusing my ideas for the paper. Professor Freeman's feedback was also incredibly helpful in terms of helping me shape the ideas and structure of my paper. The topic of the course and its readings were also incredibly interesting, and I especially enjoyed how the readings allowed us to delve in to the topic of politics in early America through so many different angles. It was also amazing to be able to ask Professor Freeman questions about anything about the time period and be answered in a nuanced way. The answers--I believe--could only have been accumulated by spending huge amounts of time in primary source materials and they added a lot of richness to the course, and my view of the time period in general. The primary source research for the paper and the exposure at Bass and the Beinecke were also just really amazing, exposing added dimensions of the period and the resources we have to explore them. Although, as a STEM major not used to this kind of course--the readings are a lot and writing the final paper takes an immense amount of time. The class is still really worth it though. And Professor Freeman is very helpful in terms of learning how to write the paper, so this is a great seminar to take if you also want to learn about the process of primary source research and historical paper-writing.",
    "I really enjoyed this course! Professor Freeman is a good section leader and very helpful with final papers. She is the only professor I know who will *line edit* your rough drafts, which is invaluable for improving your writing skills. I was also fortunate to have interesting classmates this semester who did all (most?) of the readings.",
    "Yes, if you have taken an early America course. This might be just me, but I felt like I didn't know enough to make strong contributions to the class discussion. But if you're a senior and this is your last chance to take an early America course, go for it, just to be exposed to the great characters of the era and Yale's wealth or resources to study this history."
