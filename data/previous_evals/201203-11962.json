    "You're probably taking this because you have to, but even if you don't have to, I highly recommend you take it, and take it with Madame Burton. She's easy to understand, very good at explaining grammar concepts, understanding of student concerns, and also hilarious! The great thing about L3 is you already get exposed to real French literature and cinema, while still learning vocab and grammar as you go. The class is much more work than you think it is, but as long as you put the time in, then it's not very difficult. Think twice before signing up for an early morning section - remember that this class meets every day!",
    "It is a fast-moving grammar review that improves your written grammatical skills, composition skills, audio comprehension skills, and vocabulary. It does not, however, make you a significantly more capable French-speaker. I would strongly recommend taking the class from Madame Burton.",
    "you learn french. more of an emphasis put on writing in this course than in the previous ones, it seems. you watch movies and read short books in french, then do grammar\/vocab exercises related to them. a lot more listening stuff, too.",
    "It is a daily french class where each unit focuses on a book or movie in detail. Readings like L'Etranger make the class intellectually stimulating while working on the language",
    "Yes, it is a great way to conclude the French requirement and even entices a student to push farther into the French language.",
    "French 130 is a great course. The workload is a little heavy at times... But it is not hard work, you just have to put in effort and time. Try to take the class with Madame Burton, she is definitely an amazing teacher."
