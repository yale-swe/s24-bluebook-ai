    "If you aren't a math\/science person but need an SC credit and don't mind walking up science hill, take Chem 103. The PSets don't take too long and you do demos in every class. Don't expect to revolutionize your understanding of environmental science, but still brings up some interesting topics.",
    "if you took ap chem in highschool and were good at it then take it.",
    "CHEM 103 was a decent course. It covered a wide array of subjects\/issues pertaining to the environment and the chemistry underlying them (Read: more environmental study, less chemistry). Very manageable workload\u00971 problem set every 1.5 weeks. Thought it is not a demanding course, I would not recommend CHEM 103 to another student. It is fairly simple and the instructor is wonderful; however, it is extremely superficial and there isn't a lot of new material to be taken from this class. There are equally painless science courses available that are more interesting.",
    "A really great way to fulfill language. Workload is fine, classes are interesting. Only downside is distance up science hill.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It isn't an easy class, but if you go to class and study you can do very well. The information is pretty interesting too",
    "Yes. Recommend. Great SC credit.",
    "Not a very difficult class. Lot of fun.",
    "Let's face it, Sc credits are hard to come by. I took this class to fulfill said distributional requirement, putting very little in and expecting nothing in return. There are probably more fulfilling options for Sc credits out there, though.",
    "As science credits go, this is an interesting one that will give you a very solid grounding in most of the environmental and energy-related issues that you hear about in the news (ozone depletion, acid rain, global warming, solar power, hydrogen-powered cars, etc.) It's a great way to feel more comfortable with science that will be relevant to your life, especially if you're interested in policy. But be warned that it's not at all a gut. Especially if your chemistry background is limited, the problem sets and tests can be pretty challenging, and the grading isn't too generous.",
    "yes if you enjoy environmental science.",
    "Yes. Professor is nice. Okay course. Not a bad science credit. In-class demos are interesting.",
    "A very interesting and enjoyable science credit. As someone big into environmental issues, I particularly enjoyed it. Take it if you're interested.",
    "Recommended for someone looking for a science credit. The problem sets are manageable and will not take too much time. The midterms can be a bit difficult... but overall it is worth it.",
    "Problem sets were a breeze; exams were death. Overall, not as easy a course as it should be.",
    "YES! Great class for non-science majors with easy tests and 6 problem sets. Tully is also the man."
