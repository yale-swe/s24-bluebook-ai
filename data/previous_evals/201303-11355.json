    "Highly, highly recommend. Being in class was a pleasure, and never the same twice. The workload really depends on your final project and your role in that project, but overall it was manageable. Readings were fun for the most part, which makes writing the responses pretty straightforward.",
    "Great idea for a class, still has some kinks to work out. Go for it if you're interested in working in museums, radio, journalism, documentary film, etc., because it will give you a great chance to test your thinking on the questions underpinning public humanities broadly defined. Be warned: if you don't like group projects, stay away! But this year the group project was fun, successful, and meaningful. Not too hard but gives back as much as you put in.",
    "Intro to the Public Humanities is a fascinating course for those interested in studying the ways methods and projects of academics can become something of interest to a broader audience. With guest speakers almost every week we discussed oral histories, documentaries, public television, and more. In addition,the class collaborates on a final project, the form and content of which is completely up to the class. This enables freedom to explore many options, all with the help of a course budget. Overall, the class is fantastic and incredibly valuable for students who want to incorporate the ideas of the public humanities into their future endeavors, both in and out of the classroom.",
    "It is a great way to think about the broader significance of academic pursuits, especially in American studies. I would definitely recommend it. It was a class I looked forward to every week.",
    "AMST 403 is one of those \"only-at-Yale\" classes that you imagine yourself taking upon coming to Yale: we talked about about museums, folk festivals, oral histories, documentary film and photography, NPR, Sesame Street, and more. Professor Brasseaux was an engaging discussion leader who invited several awesome guest speakers, including the cinematographer of a documentary we watched and a puppeteer who has helped develop Sesame Street programs in other countries. The capstone of the class was an oral history project on New Haven food trucks that everyone helped develop and execute and was a joy to be a part of, especially since our website launch reception at the New Haven Library was such a huge success. However, the project took up more time than I anticipated, especially since we met several times outside of class to work on it. The weekly required reading responses got to be pretty annoying, especially as we had to devote more and more time to our final project. We also never got the chance to discuss a few of the readings, since the guest speakers ended up taking up the whole class time (not complaining, since they were great, but we were assigned some interesting readings that we never talked about in class)."
