    "I think the course is strong in the content matter that it covers (which is interesting and relevant), but definitely has room for improvement in covering the models. Class lectures are more of a \"motivation to go read the textbook\" than covering the important materials.",
    "While 122 is mandatory for the major, you do have a choice of professors to take it with. Take it with Nordhaus. Yes, there is a paper at the end of the term, but it is only 10% of the grade and about 700-1000 words in length. He really loves what he is doing and the problem sets are straightforward. In comparison to my friends who took macro with Peters in the fall, I had a much more enjoyable experience.",
    "Don't take this class unless you absolutely have to. It is very confusing and you don't learn material very well, you don't get any feedback on your problem sets, there are no practice exams before the midterm and final, you have to write a paper (wtf?), and you honestly will just end up teaching yourself the course material. Totally not worth it, and I don't think Nordhaus is any better at teaching it than anyone else, so don't wait around to take it with him if it fits better in your schedule somewhere else.",
    "Ok. Better than Intro Macro. Take only if you have to though.",
    "Not necessarily easier than intermediate microeconomics - while the majority of the course is fairly straightforward, open economies and dynamic models can get fairly tricky. Reading the textbook is extremely important. Nordhaus is a great professor who appears to care for his students (a little hard to get a hold of, though). I did love how he constantly referred to real world situations. Do note that his problem sets and tests can be ambiguous. He does not always state his assumptions outright. So, if you're stuck on a problem set and wondering if you've gone crazy, there's a 50% chance that there's a typo. (Of course, there's a 50% chance that you have gone crazy...) Overall, I would strongly recommend this course.",
    "Only take if required for the econ major. Interesting topics in the macroeconomy beyond intro but there are definitely better classes.",
    "Econ 122 offers good coverage of macro for econ majors and econ-minded people in other majors. Prof. Nordhaus is a great teacher. He tries his best to keep students engaged, and I would say he is largely successful. Pay attention closely at the end of the course when you do the short run open economy models--it can get confusing, and the muddled presentation between the book and the lectures did not help. Overall, though, the material is very manageable. I preferred Econ 122 much more than intermediate micro.",
    "I'll say this, if you are an Econ major, then take macro under Nordhaus. If you aren't an Econ major and would always wonder what's going on in the economy with the Fed, interest rates and stuff then this is the class to take before you graduate.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed intermediate macro with Professor Nordhaus. Class lectures were always very information and did a good job of clarifying the material that we read in the book. I did not attend section, as it is not required, but it is vital to do the assigned textbook readings. The problems sets were very fair and did a good job of forcing us to understand the material. They were not tricky but simply help us to learn the material rather than wasting our time with necessarily difficult problems, which is something I enjoyed. The midterm and final were both very fair exams, and I somewhat enjoyed writing the macroeconomic analysis paper on a topic of my choice during reading week (~1000 words). It was a pleasure to have Professor Nordhaus for intermediate macro economics. He is actually THE reason that I waited to take the class this spring, and he did not disappoint. I felt lucky to learn this material from a famous economist such as himself. He is highly knowledgeable and taught the material very clearly.",
    "Necessary econ major class. Take with Nordhaus if you can, learn from a living legend. This class will help you make sense of all the stuff you learned in 116.",
    "You probably have to take this class. It is fine, has interesting material and is not too hard. Just be careful and prepared - once it gets down to crunch time the professor and the TA's are hard to reach and don't want to help you figure out things.",
    "Take it because you have to for the economics department. Not sure you should if you're not an economics major.",
    "Good class and the PSETS are not too tedious.",
    "I recommend it with Nordhaus.",
    "Lack of structure and gets kind of amorphous and confusing towards the end",
    "The course was ok. Not the most inspiring but not the worst either.",
    "You're taking this because you have to right? The subject material isn't particularly exciting but you don't have much of a choice. Nordhaus is fine, problem sets and tests are very fair. Be sure to do the practice tests that he gives out because they are very reflective of the real exams.",
    "Nothing special here. Basic intermediate macro. Probably not worth taking it if you're not an Econ major. If you do have to, though, take it with Nordhaus. He's really passionate about the material and that makes you want to learn as well.",
    "Necessary course for the Econ major. Not incredibly interesting, often very confusing, but you've got to take it.",
    "Take it! Professor Nordhaus consistently applies the macroeconomic theory to current events, which makes the class very engaging.",
    "Great course -- I would definitely recommend it, but just be careful with the IS-MP model in the latter course of the class. There is no textbook for this class, and for the Mundell Fleming open economy, when IS$ and MP$ curves are both flat, it is near impossible to understand the logic behind it, so ask ahead of time! It will probably show up on the final!",
    "Solid class, and I would take it with Nordhaus since you have to take it. Classes are fairly engaging and Nordhaus makes sure to apply the macroeconomic models to complex real-world case studies. Workload isn't bad except the paper right at the end of the semester in addition to the final.",
    "If you aren't an Econ major, I can't see any reason why you would want to take this class. Economics is my favorite subject, but this class was tedious and frustrating. Lectures were rambling and disorganized. Professor Nordhaus contradicted what the book taught about the IS-LM\/MP model, but he did not clearly explain the implications in models examined later in the course. Problem sets sometimes asked questions about material that was not directly related to what we learned in class or what was in the readings, and often asked questions that were so poorly worded that the multiple TFs I spoke with had difficulty clarifying and solving.",
    "tough course but it's a prereq so take it.",
    "It's mandatory if your'e in the major so.... That said, I'd take intermediate micro over this any day. Nordhaus is respectable and sweet, but the material is incredibly dry and sometimes rather roundabout.",
    "Decently interesting material, virtually no work, and a boring but tolerable professor. Basically this is in the top 3 Econ classes at Yale! Also, to all the students who want to just take a bit of Econ to be informed citizens, don't stop at intro. This is the class to take for basic economic literacy. This is a solid class. The material is important and covered at far greater depth than in intro. Still, the class can and should be made far more difficult. That so many people never go to lecture, cheat on every pset, but still earn a B+ or A- is a mark of how weak Econ education is at Yale. This class would be far more enriching if it actually challenged students with elements from economic theory. It also should be required that students in this class be somewhat able to read actual Econ papers, but that is currently way more than is demanded. My TA, Carlin, was also terrible. He told us the first section that he wasn't an Econ\/som student and actually hadn't taken an Econ class in years. It showed. He was completely useless and clearly was just keeping one lecture ahead of the class. Really disappointing. I ended up going to Nicolas Werquin's sections which were AMAZING!",
    "If you're interested in macro, this is the class to take to deepen the exploration of Intro. It's more demanding but makes the conversations of macro much less facile. If you're not huge on macro or short a QR I'd skip it because it's not super enjoyable.",
    "No",
    "Ideal for econ majors, but probably shouldn't take it otherwise!",
    "You have to take intermediate macro if you're an economics major, so you probably know what you're getting into. Professor Nordhaus is a great professor, and I'd recommend taking the course with him if you can.",
    "Nordhaus was a good professor but I recommend reading the book as well to get a more complete idea of the material. Nordhaus also references the book a lot in class although some of the notations are different which can be inconvenient.",
    "Econ 122 was a great integration of advanced macroeconomic concepts with real-world applications, through historical and present-day studies of economic events.",
    "Good macro course!",
    "Solid macrocourse. I would take it with Nordhaus.",
    "Didn't find it much more mentally stimulating than 116 at all. While we did review se topics that weren't from 116, overall it felt very reptetitve.",
    "Fun class, take it. I recommend going to class!",
    "The class was very interesting -- much more fun than the intro level course. You learn about stuff that is happening in our economy today.",
    "You have to take it -- good luck",
    "You have to take the class, but frankly - do not wait for legendary Nordhaus - not worth it, the class was disorganized in terms of giving back the psets (the did not decide they would drop the lowest one until the very end of the semester, so you could not just skip one when too busy.... I thought it's a standard at Yale but they had no idea about it). They didn't grade all the problems, just ones they chose (excuse me? there are many other big lectures out there...) and the exams were horrifyingly distant from everything else. Try taking it with a visiting professor.",
    "No choice if you're an economics major",
    "Take it if you have to",
    "Pretty standard macro course. Take it if you're a major obviously, but don't otherwise.",
    "standard econ req, take with nordhaus if possible",
    "You probably have to take it; so might as well take it with prof Nordhaus (who's superb).",
    "The material covered is interesting. Professor Nordhaus is a brilliant man who genuinely cares about his students and tries to make lecture as interactive as possible. The problem sets are extremely manageable and the TAs help a lot! Problem sets, a short paper, a midterm and a final - the workload is not that heavy for this class. Although lecture can be boring at times, if you put in the work you should do well.",
    "Econ 122 was a good course, it went more in depth that 111 and actually explored the real world implications of the models. It was useful in explaining the causative links between different macroeconomic phenomena. I thought it was way better than 121 and was very useful for understanding present-day macroeconomic phenomena. I think it would be a very useful course for non econ majors to take.",
    "Helps you better understand the macroeconomic policies",
    "A relatively straightforward intermediate Econ class. You're probably required to take it if you're taking it, and if not you can probably find something better. Nordhaus is a decent lecturer but a lot of the learning is simply left to the textbook even though he tells us some of the things in the textbook are outdated\/obsolete at the same time, so the homework can be difficult at times. Basically weekly problem sets, a midterm, one short paper at the end of the class, and a final. Not sure how other lecturers are in comparison but it's not difficult to get by and you should be able to get through it with an OK grade without a ton of effort (although getting an A will take a lot more time put in).",
    "I would summarize it as a class that will teach you Keynesian and classical economic views of the national and world economies.",
    "Econ 122 is a decent Econ course that will for you a basis in important models. I would recommend taking it with Nordhaus since he tries to make the class more engaging. The problem sets are pretty manageable."
