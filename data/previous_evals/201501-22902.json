    "This class is a gem in the math department. I learned more in this class than most of my other math classes in a low-key small class environment.",
    "Yes, especially with this professor.",
    "I highly recommend this class. It was an amazing class with eye opening material.",
    "This class primarily covers groups generated by reflections. It also covers some basic group theory and linear algebra in order to do this. It is on the easy side as far as math classes go, and has relatively little work. It doesn't cover much deep, fundamental stuff, but the stuff it does cover is interesting. I had a bit of group theory background going in to this course, but I think you would be fine if you didn't. Overall, if you are looking for a light, elective math class, (and have the appropriate prereqs), this would be a good course. If you're well into the math major, it would be way too easy.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who wants to be challenged in mathematics."
