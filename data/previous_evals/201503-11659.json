   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it. The bridge course is quite challenging but equally rewarding. The expectations of the course can be somewhat unclear in the beginning. Once the student adjusts herself to these expectations and the time commitment that is necessary, it is also manageable.",
    "Good, rigorous introduction to be reading prose on the advanced level. Be ready to put serious time into preparing readings. Handful of grammar and vocab quizzes, helpful in plugging any gaps in basic knowledge. The divide between graduate and undergraduate students made for a bit of a strange dynamic. Professor Inwood is both knowledgeable (serious expert in his field) and approachable.",
    "A solid Greek class, mostly language and some ideas. Plato is a joy--the best way to start the day. But you will only get something out of this class if you prepare! Do the reading twice and make sure you can translate into elegant English even the knottiest passages. Keep reviewing morphology and principal parts."
