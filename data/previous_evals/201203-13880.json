    "I really liked the course overall. It is a good introduction to nutrition issues. But I do think the class can be made more rigorous.",
    "The course was designed with students in mind - and therefore was excellent in creating an environment where students could learn both technical and systematic aspects of food and nutrition. Well organized and taught course.",
    "excellent course structure - the weekly quizzes are a lot of work but great for keeping up on the readings, and the discussion is great for stimulating conversation\/thoughts.the projects are all interesting and were things i wanted to work on. The final project should be due earlier (i.e. not in exam week) so that the group has ample time to come together and be organized - there were struggles with everyone having different schedules",
    "Course was very informative.",
    "Great course.S: The course is organized really well.W:",
    "This is a great course that is comprehensive in understanding nutrition and food. I also like that unlike other public health courses it doesn't focus on just the epidemiology and statistics of nutrition.More round table discussions would improve discussion in class.Would like more on some of the methodology of food and nutrition assessments out there.",
    "Good survey of different aspects of food problems around the world. Primarily focused on undernutrition, and gave good information about different approaches that have been tried to address it and what has and hasn't worked in different contexts. The course encouraged critical evaluation of these approaches and an understanding of the reasons for success and failure."
