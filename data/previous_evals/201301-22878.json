   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend DS History and Politics. If you're at all interested in politics and political theory and would like to see how many of our notions of the modern state, law, democracy, and majority rights developed over time, this is the course for you. DS is a truly wonderful program. You work a lot, but you certainly reap the rewards.",
    "Professor Semmel is quite nice and funny, though maybe too nice and too funny. He'll probably grade your papers leniently; he won't mind if you don't speak up all that much. You might feel that you don't *get* much out of seminar, that you're not coming to some grand conclusion about each text, but so it goes. Second semester DS H&P is less internally consistent (but probably more interesting) than first semester.",
    "Take DS if you want to read a lot and write a lot but not much else.",
    "H\/P second semester is a lot more interesting and relevant than first semester, definitely worth taking!",
    "Better class than H&P S1 take it if you want to know about the history of Western political thought - there's much more of a tangible tradition. More of a poli sci course, but a very good survey\/close reading of very important poli sci works. If sounds good, recommend.",
    "DS second semester H and P is like first semester, without really much of the history and a double dose of political philosophy. Except for social contract theory, which can get confusing sometimes and a little dull, most of the authors are genuinely interesting to read about. Professor Semmel is a great professor, fair grader, decent discussion leader.",
    "Good class. What's best about it is the syllabus, which everyone should read even if they don't take DS.",
    "Really interesting material (though you should probably like political philosophy). Generally good discussion. Professor Semmel is very good at guiding the discussion. Sometimes, however, class can get very slow in pace. Be prepared: papers are returned very late.",
    "I must admit that when I had finished studying for the H&P final, and could finally see the big picture - the development of concepts like Enlightenment, religion, social contract, and the people from century to century - I really saw the value of this class. Through the semester, though, I didn't always enjoy it. The reading is heavy and long, and only occasionally provides the stylistic elegance of a Literature or Philosophy text. This is just in the nature of the beast, I suppose, and there are exceptions; for example, Rousseau and Nietzsche. But it's still hard-going.Professor Semmel is a wonderful guy and a very measured historian, although sometimes I feel like this works against him. He is determined to bring out the shades of grey in every issue, and while this is hugely admirable, I wish he would be braver about giving black-and-white outlines first. At the risk of oversimplifying, this would be a more helpful starting point for difficult texts, from which moremeasured conversation could arise.That said, Professor Semmel has an incredible understanding of British and French history, so his classes on Burke, Rousseau, and Mill were great.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. The conversations we had in section would keep me thinking for a long time afterwards. I improved as a writer in this class, and also became much better at thinking critically about politics.",
    "I enjoyed the History& Politics the most out of my three DS classes second semester. Much of that is due to having sections with Professor Semmel, who is extremely nice and soft-spoken but is also intensely knowledgeable about the curriculum, especially in the history of Britain and the French Revolution. Since British authors and events revolving around the French Revolution make up a significant part of the second semester syllabus, Prof. Semmel is a great instructor to have.",
    "Professor Semmel is a good instructor, but discussions are diffuse and not always useful for understanding the texts. It is only the brilliance of the texts themselves that makes DS Historical and Political Thought a shining beacon of a class. Do the reading."
