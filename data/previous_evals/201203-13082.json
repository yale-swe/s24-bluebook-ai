    "Art 141 is a class in which you will learn the basic building block of the scene. You will learn how to create an emotionally complete unit that does not cut corners. You may not have this art mastered by the time you leave, but at least you will be able to recognize a situation that is real as opposed to contrived.",
    "Yes! Professor Roemer is great. The class overall focuses a bit more on the screenwriting part of filmmaking, but in the end you will come away with a good idea of how to go about writing and shooting a film scene.",
    "It's not a lot of work and you end up filming a scene at the end which is cool."
