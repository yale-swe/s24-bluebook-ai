    "I would absolutely recommend this class to someone else who is interested in Yoruba.",
    "Fun class. Really familiarizes you with the Yoruba language and culture.",
    "It's a continuation of the material from the L1 course.",
    "It was an interesting class but the workload was tremendously hard. Homework assignments close to every day that take hours. A lot of audio recordings are due each week (this wasn't listed in the syllabus). On top of this the professor expects you to keep a journal and record everything you do every day and you have to write it all in Yoruba. Definitely one of the harder of not the hardest language at Yale. I wouldn't recommend anyone to take the class. I certainly will not be taking it next year",
    "It's a good class if you're genuinely interested in learning the language and willing to put in the work.",
    "A language class that meets every day. Expect to have to do a lot of work for it. Could be group work or individual homework."
