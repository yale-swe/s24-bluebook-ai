    "English 114 is phenomenal. Take it with Professor Gosselink, you will not regret it.",
    "Great class, wonderful professor, and enthusiastic students. Even though I am an exchange student and English is my second language, the workload is not so heavy; three essays, one presentation, and ten reading articles for discussion. This class does not only focus on writing strategy, but also discussion skill and presentation. My favorite class at Yale.",
    "A great class to strengthen your writing techniques for college. Would highly recommend taking this course.",
    "Despite being annoying at times, I would definitely recommend this section of ENGL 114 to others. The final paper is pretty much on whatever you want it to be and instead of doing 4 papers in the term, you do 3 and a presentation, which turned out to be really nice.",
    "I would recommend this course as a rigorous introduction to American writing, especially for foreign students. Furthermore, if you are interested in development economics or global thinking, this is the course for you."
