   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it -- I took it credit\/d\/fail, and although the final paper is really long, I think it's worth it to take the course just so you took a course with Harold Bloom while he was here. Doing the readings is also a wonderful way of moving through Shakespeare, although I'd just make sure you've read Hamlet and know the character of Falstaff very well.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to anyone who wants to hear what one of the world's foremost literary critics has to say about Shakespeare.The workload is what you make of it; one or two plays are assigned each week, but in class, Professor Bloom does most of the talking. My depth of reading has ranged from secondary sources and twice through the play to SparkNotes on my iPhone on the way to class.The only grade for this course is the final paper, which is supposed to be \"substantial\"...most people interpret this to be between 15-30 pages. It's a good idea to choose your topic and set a schedule for yourself as early on in the semester as possible.",
    "If you are interested in reading these plays (which you should be, references EVERYWHERE become apparent), this is the perfect course. You can read or not read what you like, but class with Bloom is usually entertaining. More so if you are willing to speak up--it's worthwhile. Sometimes he will shut you down, but there's nothing like pointing out something he hasn't noticed before. Also, besides the reading, there is only one assignment, so there's really not that much work.",
    "Yes definitely. To hear him talk about Falstaff is to know the essence of imaginative freedom.",
    "Yes, for any lover of Shakespeare, this is the perfect course.",
    "If you want a modern academic discussion of Shakepseare's plays, this is not the class for you. If you want to read through the entire canon at a comfortable pace, and have it occasionally enlightened with Bloom's genius, it may be.",
    "This is a reading through Shakespeare's comedies, histories and sonnets in which each week one or two plays are discussed in a very thoughtful and free way. It is a wonderful environment in which Bloom shares his ideas with students. While he very manifestly wants to establish a dialogue, students are usually reserved and don't participate very much except for the more bold or arrogant, which is a shame,but overall it is a very stimulating and magnificent way to study Shakespeare.",
    "Take Bloom's Shakespeare courses if you have the chance. He's a Yale and a national treasure and anyone would be foolish to pass up the oppt to study with him .",
    "This seminar was exactly what I expected it to be. Prof Bloom sat and talked of his thoughts on Shakespeare and his plays, and there was not much discussion, but this was great because I got to listen to and learn from brilliant thoughts and explanations instead of having to listen to other students' nonsense."
