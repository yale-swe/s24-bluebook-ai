    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn physiology for cell biologists. The histology was very interesting, even though it wasn't very in-depth.",
    "This class encompasses an overview of physiological systems, including their function, related disease states, and histology. This is accompanied by histology sections once a week where the class discusses projected normal and abnormal histology images. There is a weekly homework assignment rather than exams. I would absolutely recommend this course. There was a very manageable workload and it provided insight into many different anatomical systems.",
    "Overall, a great overview of histology, especially for those without a strong cell biology background.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it."
