    "As I am obtaining a professional degree, this is definitely one of the most preparatory hours I spend for my degree. We learn from reputable industry professionals that are so kind to give us there time. Gives us a direct understanding of current HC issues and policies which we will encounter and hopefully help solve in the very near future.",
    "I really enjoyed our colloquium speakers this past semester. They provided us with diverse perspectives on the healthcare field at the moment.",
    "Fantastic. A wonderful opportunity.",
    "Strength: great talks by fascinating guest lecturers No apparent weakness.",
    "Outstanding lecturers.",
    "It's already amazing!",
    "Really enjoyed this class. Great speakers",
    "Fantastic",
    "The speakers chosen for the colloquium are very engaging and experienced. I feel that they each have lots of life lessons to share with the students regardless of their current field of expertise. This course is unique to Yale, and I think that is a definite strength. It would be helpful in the future to get an idea of what the speaker will be presenting on before the colloquium so students can do more research on the subject.",
    "Love attending colloquium each week! The speakers are extremely interesting, and students enjoy hearing about their personal and professional journeys.",
    "It was a very enjoyable course and was inspiring to hear from healthcare leaders.",
    "Some really interesting speakers.",
    "Colloquium is fantastic and the perspective gained from listening to the speakers is truly inspiring.",
    "Amazing lecturers.",
    "Strengths: Meet variety of healthcare speakers Weaknesses: None",
    "This is a fantastic course where leaders in healthcare share their personal as well as professional experiences. I have been humbled by hearing these highly accomplished individuals share their struggles, adversities and triumphs with their audience, from a human perspective. There was no pomp and show or a parading of their glory but rather a portrayal of determination and persistence in the presence of confusion and uncertainty. This was a common thread in all their stories, reaffirming the necessity for resilience, self-compassion and faith when pursuing one's dreams. This class should be entitled, 'Classes in Wisdom'. Highly recommended."
