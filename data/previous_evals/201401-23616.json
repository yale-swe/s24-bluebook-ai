   "comments": [
    "Very interesting class topics.",
    "Very interesting subject matter, the terminology can get a bit tedious at times, but you learn a lot and it's very enjoyable. Prof.Wherry is very eccentric and engaging, very knowledgeable, and very direct with what he is looking for in assignments. Great teacher. If you listen and follow directions, you will get a good grade",
    "Take this class. Professor Wherry was a joy, the readings were super interesting, and I feel like I understand global markets and culture much more. Sociology courses are less about acquiring facts, than understanding mechanisms through theories, case studies, and data.",
    "Markets is a good introduction to sociology, and there are some interesting units, like the one on nation branding. If you do the readings or pay attention in lecture (you don't always need both), you'll do well in the class. If you know anything at all about sociology, this course is probably too easy for you.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!",
    "SOCY 116 is a broad based introductory course on the interactions between markets, culture, and globalization from a markets standpoint. It focuses on how certain people\/groups\/nations are privileged in market processes, and discusses the efficacy of alternatives to the market system while seeking to have a deeper understanding of how the market system is created and \"performed\" based on cultural norms. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class, especially if Professor Wherry is teaching it.",
    "I would recommend this class! At first it seemed sort vague and like I didn't fully understand if I was learning but then I realized I had started drawing tons of connections to this class as I went about my day to day life. Lots of really interesting stuff and new ways of thinking about global relations in regards to the structures that reinforce poverty and image. Professor Wherry is awesome!",
    "The course goes over key topics concerning global culture markets. The most interesting topic being nation branding. The course begins with lessons on globalization and the multiple definition of it and ends with products and their cultural value. I would recommend this to any student. It's a very interesting course on globalization.",
    "Definitely recommend this course, its not too much work but the content is definitely worth it and once you go on a vacation you start to notice a lot of the things discussed in class. The course doesn't introduce ground breaking concepts, but gives you the vocabulary to discuss things that you may or may not have noticed before but never knew how to express it properly. Not too much work but definitely worth the time.",
    "A must take- you learn interesting, relevant matter without too much of a headache. The midterm and final are fair enough- good, solid class- take it if you're looking for a fifith credit or just want a random, really fun, interesting class.",
    "definitely take this course! and wherry is the best professor ever. Engaging classes!!",
    "Socy 116 explores the many faces of globalization on the analytical and real world level. It exposes students to nation branding, impression management, and what it means to have \"culture wealth.\" Although most of the material deals with nations\/large scale topics, Wherry managed to make it relatable and feel relevant to my life. The material is also relevant to today's changing global economy and will prove useful to me.",
    "If you are interested in global affairs I'd say this is a useful course. It gives a good foundation for what sociologists look at and study, and made me curious about other research that has been done. I'd say it is a fun class and would recommend it!"
