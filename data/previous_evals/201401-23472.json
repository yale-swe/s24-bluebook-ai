    "I would recommend this course definitely. The novels, short stories, play, and poems on the syllabus are mostly interesting works, make certain you have enough time up until midterm to read a novel a week. But be prepared to look at stereotypical Italian-American portrayals in film and television. Contribution includes: Reading journal throughout the semester, short essays for at least seven of the readings, attendance at weekly screenings, heavy in-class participation reviewing the literature (tues.) and film (thurs.), a midterm paper, a final exam of short essays and two long essays, and a final paper.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale, for sure. I learned a lot and got to read\/watch awesome books\/films. Doing work for this class always felt like getting away from doing work, and then class discussions made me see a greater depth to each of the works.",
    "This class is so wonderful, you will NOT regret taking it. Yes, class will be three days a week, but one of those is spent just watching movies. Class discussion is great, the books are pretty good, and I loved all but a couple of the movies. The coursework is very manageable, and the real plus of this class is that it's taught by Professors Marcus and Papallo -- take it just to have a class with them!",
    "Yes! The course was very enjoyable. Great films, interesting novels\/stories\/poems as readings, good class discussions and very manageable assignments. I also appreciated not having laptops or phones out in class, and having only 7 people in it, it was much more engaging that way! The walking tour and pizza at the end was also nice and allowed us to think of Italian-American life as 'tangible.\"",
    "This is a really interesting look at different authors\u2019 and filmmakers\u2019 perceptions and portrayals of the Italian American experience. This is not a history class, it is very much about analyzing artistic and storytelling devices, but Penny and Taylor threw in a lot of historical context that really helped my understanding of the subject matter. At least this year, the reading was heavily front-loaded, so you\u2019ll be reading a novel a week (later it trickled down to several poems or short stories) as well as watching a film a week. I found the work aspects of the class really fun, and wanted to spend time writing the two short essays. A lot of people in the class were of Italian descent, so I guess it helps to have a narcissistic interest in it, but if you\u2019re looking for a fun literature\/film analysis class about Italian Americans, with some really sweet professors, take this class!"
