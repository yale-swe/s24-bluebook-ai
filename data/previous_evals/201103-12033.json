    "Take this if you have any interest in writing. It's a worthwhile experience and it's by far the most enjoyable class you'll take in the semester.",
    "If you belong in this class, you probably already know it. So take it!!",
    "Writing SF&F was focused on reviewing major tropes, techniques, features, and forms of science-fiction, fantasy, experimental fiction, and fiction in general, with analysis of how to imbue one\u0092s writing with the power to make an impact on the mind of the reader. The majority of the class and homework time, however, was focused on students writing their own stories and the rest of the class critiquing them, pointing out weaknesses and strengths and offering suggestions. A small part consisted of students reading books about strange and unfamiliar real-world cultures and giving presentations on them for the class, so as to show us how weird the world can get.I would strongly recommend the class for those who are interested in SF&F writing \u0096 or even those just wanting to try something different from the norm. The contingent of the class this semester was incredibly diverse in interests and expertise, which meant that critiques of one\u0092s stories were quite variant and always interesting. It was also always a relief from other work to sit down on some night and read three SF\/F stories\u0085 as an assignment!",
    "This seminar is an enjoyable learning experience and I would definitely recommend it to any writer who enjoys telling a good, strange, spooky, creepy, weird, or just slightly \"off\" tale.",
    "Yeah it was fun. Good luck getting in.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The class draws a really diverse group of people, which made discussions interesting and fun, and Prof. Crowley knows a ton about this stuff and creates a really supportive environment. That said, the class is a significant amount of work, so definitely come prepared to do a lot of writing.",
    "Yeah, if you like this kind of stuff, absolutely take it. I don't have to tell you that.",
    "A great overview of genre writing of all kinds, looking at fantasy and science-fiction in all of their many permutations. I would recommend it, for the opportunity to work with Professor Crowley and confront your own preconceptions and prejudices regarding genre writing.",
    "Speaking as someone who loves creative writing and sci-fi\/fantasy, I enjoyed this course. It was refreshing and fun to take a Yale writing course that focused on these genres Structurally, it's a straightforward writing seminar: you're expected to write three stories in the course of the semester and to read\/critique the work of your classmates on a weekly basis. There's also a book report assignment which is interesting and not too difficult.One thing that does bear mentioning, though: Professor Crowley's knowledge of (and views on) sci-fi\/fantasy are fairly old-fashioned, for lack of a better term. Expect a lot of discussion of writing from the mid-20th century (e.g. Tolkein, Bradbury, Asimov, etc.) and almost no discussion of more recent work (e.g. Gaiman, Card, etc.), not to mention little recognition of how much the public perception of SF\/F has changed in recent years. I was a bit frustrated by this at first, but in the end I just had to accept that that was his area of expertise and the work he felt most comfortable commenting on. Still, I feel like the title of the class ought to have acknowledged this bias (e.g. \"Sci-Fi\/Fantasy of the 1950s and 60s\")."
