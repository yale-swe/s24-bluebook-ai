   "comments": [
    "Caz's command of this material is unparalleled. Take it if you're serious about it.",
    "Good selection of books; discussions vary in quality. Everything's too pertinent, though--not enough tangent or obtuse connections.",
    "Interesting survey of British literature since 1950. I had only heard of one book on the syllabus before the course, but it was definitely interesting in terms of learning about an area that I had never studied before. VERY focused on race and class, almost more of a cultural studies class than an English class. We had a surprise in-class writing assignment halfway through the semester, so be prepared for that. 20-25 page paper at the end of the semester, which is the only assignment aside from two in-class writing assignments.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. There are not many contemporary fiction courses offered in the English major, and this one is really worthwhile if you are interested in contemporary fiction. The course also differs from many English courses at Yale in that it focuses so heavily on the context of 20th century Britain and includes a couple of movies.",
    "Take it!",
    "Caz Phillips is the most badass English professor you will come across during your time at Yale. A novelist in his own right, Professor Phillips considers texts written in Britain in the last 50 years in a way that is sensitive to their linguistic and narrative excellence even as it shies away from getting tied down too deeply in thorny theoretical questions. If you're only interested in close reading, though, beware--this class is ALL about the social and historical context of contemporary Britain that gave rise to these works, some of which were the best books I'd read all semester.",
    "Highly recommended."
