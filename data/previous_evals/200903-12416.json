   "comments": [
    "Yes, it was a great course covering a wide amount of Colonial American History. As someone with little prior knowledge of the region in this period, I learnt a great deal from this course.",
    "Dean Farley is a very intelligent and interesting discussion leader, but the class itself could use some improvement. Colonial American History can be pretty boring, and the course's arrangement doesn't help much - you basically cycle through the different regions of the colonies every three weeks. The readings are generally good, but there is a LOT of reading. Not only that, but it is often not exactly clear what you are expected to know for class. There were weeks where I spent hours reading a book, only to either just graze on it during class or even skip it entirely. Other weeks, books were assigned that were not readily available, leading to a scramble around the different libraries and bookstores for obscure books. Make sure you plan ahead and get the books early if you plan on taking the course - not all of them will be there when you buy your reading list. There is a lot of primary source work, but a lot of it is very dull. Dean Farley is what you would expect from a dean - fair, but strict. He has that additional obligation, so keep in mind that his primary role is as dean and not as a professor.",
    "I highly recommend History 124J. The course gave me a completely new understanding of Colonial American History. It is heavily reading intensive, and requires a substantial amount of individual research, but Dean Farley is a great prof on the subject, and I would recommend it to any history major."
