    "The course is extremely fun and interesting. Not only did we get great insights into Zulu language and culture, but I really appreciated her willingness to share the history of South Africa and how it affected the language and culture we were studying.",
    "I loved the course. I think the Professor Sanneh is an amazing teacher who is very knowledgeable on the language and all African language and culture. I think the course could be improved by increasing the amount that students are pushed to speak the language in class.",
    "Although it is a language class at its core, Zulu 130 is also a class on South African culture at large. This holistic approach to learning a language through multiple cultural lenses leads us to better learn, understand, and ultimately use isiZulu. Reading folktales, for example, allows us to not only see particular grammar structures in the context of a traditional narrative, but also appreciate the intrinsic beauty embedded in the morphology of isiZulu. Learning about the traditions of the Nazarite Church in isiZulu grants us insight into some of the cultural values of the languages speakers. And our periodic exposure to current events through Zulu news sites keeps us informed about South Africa and acquaints us with the real-world use of isiZulu. Professor Sannehs ability to build Zulu culture into each class is the courses greatest strength."

    "I would definitely recommend his class to another student. For anyone who is looking to experience the with a totally new language Zulu is definitely a great choice. It is a manageable work load and a really interesting way to deviate from the Romance languages and learn about a different culture."
