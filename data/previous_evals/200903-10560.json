    "Interesting material. Chen is a great lecturer, I just wish we had weekly problem sets. More problems would have been helpful.My favorite textbook for the course was the one by Cochrane. Then I liked the Huang and Litzenberger book. The only issue is that it was out of print (and used versions can sell for more than $200 on amazon.com), so I had to get an electronic copy from a friend. If the professor could make the book available to the class, it would be helpful. I didn't like the Ingersoll book so much. There is another nice book by Leroy and Werner which was helpful and at times.Pay close attention in lecture. Read Huang and Litzenberger, Cochrane, and Leroy and Werner. Skim Ingersoll and ask Prof. Chen for more problems."
