   "comments": [
    "A fiction workshop where you read a lot of fiction (and gain a lot of exposure) and get to apply techniques you're learning to a bunch of exercises and finally a full short story of your own.",
    "Creative writing classes at Yale just became application-based. Apply! In this semester: Michael Cunningham held class in his apartment, discussed his bartender days as well as his first kiss, and had some insight about the Hunger Games, writing about blood, and Toni Morrison's personality (all kinda related). Working with him and your classmates will be a privilege. Warning: You will do more reading in this workshop than writing; you'll have weekly writing exercises, but will only produce one full story in the last three weeks, to workshop once.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Don't take it if you don't like writing or fiction (for obvious reasons). Otherwise-- take it; it's a brilliant course.",
    "This course is really an introduction to fiction writing. Most of the semester is spent writing quite short exercises and talking about great pieces of short fiction. The last few weeks, the class turns into a fiction workshop. It is a great class, and a great opportunity to learn from one of the greatest American writers alive today. I would certainly recommend this course to another student.",
    "Fun class with a good but tough professor. Some students can be too intense about the work and try to suck up to the prof. But overall, take it. Great readings, great assignments.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 134 to another student. Even if you have never written before, take this class because your skills as a reader and writer will improve exponentially. The first part of the class focuses on reading short stories and discussing how the elements of craft work in each story. For the last month, the class is a writing workshop in which you read and workshop your classmates short stories. Exercises aren't graded, but Professor Cunningham and the rest of the class will critique them (and sometimes critiques are harsh-- Professor Cunningham is direct in his criticism and his praise.) Nonetheless, a great class!",
    "Craft with Michael Cunningham is life-changing. He's not only a brilliant writer, but also a sharp, conscientious mentor. This isn't just a class for the aspiring fiction writer; it's an experience for the Yalie with an affinity for lyrical expression.",
    "Wonderful, inspiring, eye-opening course with one of the best professional writers out there."
