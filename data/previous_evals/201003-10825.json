    "I would recommend this class to another student if he\/she were interested in quantum chemistry.",
    "Relation of various representations of Quantum Mechanics, Reviewed Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory, Nonradiative Transitions, Scattering theory.Yes, it covers many thought-provoking topics.",
    "Yes I would most certainly recommend this course to anyone. The perfect conclusion to a physical chemistry curriculum.",
    "This is a graduate level course that you should only take if you are confident with the material presented in intro quantum and molecules and radiation. It addresses advanced topics which are useful for a more thorough understanding of physical chemistry.",
    "Yes. Professor Tully did an excellent job and providing a theoretical foundation on a number of very interesting advanced topics."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped re-establish basic principles as well as developed new insight into quantum chemistry that is relevant to my research.",
    "This course greatly contributed to my studies, and I will use my class notes for many years to come.",
    "I got a better appreciation for the importance and difficulty of approximating solutions to the time dependent Schrodinger equation. Already in my research, I read several papers describing various molecule-electron scattering processes, such as shape and Feshbach resonances and these topics now make sense. Molecules and Radiation also covered time dependent perturbation theory and Fermi's Golden Rule but it was extremely useful seeing the derivation from a different perspective.",
    "This course covered a number of topics that have given me a deeper understanding of the research I carry out in the laboratory. For example non-radiative transitions have helped me understand how intermolecular vibrational redistribution works as well as scattering theory could be applied to collisional cooling."
