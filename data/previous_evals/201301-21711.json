    "This is a very interesting class and you will learn a lot about autism, but you won't spend a lot of time learning from the professors listed here from the class. The class is mainly guest lecturers, who can vary widely in how good and interesting they are. Also, your whole grade is determined by one final paper. Placements are great!",
    "I think this course lacks in structure what it strives to make up for in prestige. Professor Volkmar is a very big name in the world of autism research, and Yale is truly lucky to have him. However, he only spoke at the first and last lecture, and one Q+A review-type class on the 2nd to last day that was the only class during which someone wasn't lecturing at us. I think some serious work needs to be done to get Prof. Volkmar more engaged with the students. Mandatory readings and discussion of those readings would be a start, or maybe just his presence in the classroom.I also wish there were a more stable way of knowing our grade before the end of the semester. I've submitted my term paper now, but have no idea whatsoever of the grading style. Further, a research paper does not in any way indicate what we learned throughout the seminar...",
    "Take it! Essentially the only work outside the classroom is writing one research paper and volunteering at a school or residence for people on the autism spectrum. Guest lectures can sometimes be tedious, but overall it's a great course and you learn a ton about autism.",
    "Yes. Take it if you can. It's a really cool opportunity.",
    "Great overview of autism, from start to finish of what we know today. Terrific professors, you really get as much out of this course as you put into it. I would take it only if you are really interested in autism though, don't try and use it to fill a spot in your schedule.",
    "Great class with real personal eye-opening experiences. Different from any other class I've taken at Yale. Not a big workload either.",
    "It's a differently-formatted class than anything else I've seen at Yale, but i enjoyed it. Most weeks are a guest lecturer presenting about the research they do on a topic related to Autism. You have a placement once a week - mine was in a group home for adults with Autism, and it was a great experience. Getting off campus once a week to go work with these guys, and just become a brief part of their weekly schedule, was both fun and educational, and was definitely something I looked forward to. But other than the placement, there was very little work - essentially it all came down to your final paper, which was due during reading week. This was stressful, but it was nice having a class that I didn't ever really need to worry about during the course of the semester. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Absolutely!!! Take this class!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It gives you a great sense of clinical psychology. The practicum was also a great experience.",
    "I would recommend, but be aware of the three hour\/week practicum. Sometimes it could be tedious.",
    "I'm a bit ambivalent about this course. Each class is essentially a lecture led by a different speaker, some of whom are more interesting than others (Prof. Volkmar is great, others... not so much). There really isn't any homework from week to week until the final paper, which you write on any topic you want without any specific guidance (probably both good and bad). Observation of autistic patients is 3 hours per week, which can feel like a long amount of time if you don't have anything to do; the practicum assignments are pretty open-ended and oftentimes I felt like I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do.",
    "If you want the incredible opportunity of working with people who have autism spectrum disorders, then take this class. If you're looking for a seminar where you read about and then discuss autism spectrum disorders, then don't take this class. It's billed as a seminar, but it's actually a lecture. Almost every lecture is a different guest, which is nice variety but can make it sometimes repetitive. However, for me, my placement at Benhaven School made the whole class MORE than worth it. So overall, I'd definitely recommend it for the placement, but don't expect to get a lot out of the class meetings themselves.",
    "It is a class where you get to focus on one topic, which is very different from typical yale classes and very cool I think. I really liked that about the class because you really master the material. in addition you get first hand experience with placements. You get out of it what you put into it. It is up to you to do the reading and no grade until the semester is over. manageable work load",
    "I would definitely take this class. Not a whole lot of work, but incredibly interesting subject material and field placement.",
    "If you want to learn about autism, this is a perfect place to start! you get to learn about autism from many different perspectives (neuroscience, genetics, education, etc).",
    "Guest lecturers and an internship once a week. I really enjoyed my internship, but had trouble actually remembering a lot of the material presented by the guests. There was not a lot of class discussion for such a small seminar, but that may change. The class work consists of one paper at the end of the term. Don't procrastinate too much."
