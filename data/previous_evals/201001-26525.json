   "comments": [
    "A VERY intro course- good if you are looking for something easy.",
    "Great introductory WGSS. This will change the way you think on a fundamental level.",
    "Good class to take if you want a broad introduction into women's studies, especially if you are looking for a modern approach. The topics covered are extremely interesting and Prof. Grewal has some great ideas. Be ready to be flexible with work load and topic change.",
    "This is an incredible interdisciplinary course taught by a very personable and awesome professor--Inderpal Grewal. As the course progresses, you will be able to tie different issues related to gender more easily with the curriculum. I strongly recommend this course to those interested in having a new perspective on different forms of globalization; whether it is economical, cultural or beyond.",
    "Its an ok course, don't take it if you have taken women's studies courses before because it doesn't add much!",
    "WGSS 115 isa great class. You start out thinking you're studying a bunch of different topics and by the end you realize that it's all so interconnected. The class is a good balance of work and you definitely learn a lot for what you put in. Professor Grewal is a really fun woman to work with and you'll really enjoy having discussions with her.",
    "Take this class! It starts off slow, but by the end it is an easy and approachable beginning to understanding women's studies in the context of this very particular and very modern society, and it genuinely can change the way you think about and approach issues. Also, Professor Grewal is wonderful!"
