    "Overall, the addictions seminar was an informative and enjoyable course. The weekly readings were well selected and well organized. The behavior change project gave a snapshot into the addictive process. Professor Baskin-Sommers is not only a natural teacher, but also a nice person. This year was her first at Yale\/as a professor, and she will only improve as a teacher. Now, a few criticisms. I believe that seminars should be discussion based; I think few would argue with this claim. Yet, despite the heft of our weekly readings outside of class, Professor Baskin-Sommers often presented significantly more material, lecture-style, during class time. If this material were so important, it should have been assigned with the out of class readings, thereby freeing up time in seminar for discussion. I also think we should read more original articles and fewer reviews. Also, one seminar went spent basically the whole time watching a movie, which again should have been done before class. Another smaller criticism is about assignment of topics for the final presentation\/paper. Professor Baskin-Sommers assigned the topics seemingly arbitrarily, despite the amount of time we would then go on to spend preparing a presentation and writing the paper. An easy fix to this problem is to ask students earlier in the term for their top three choices of topic, assigning the topics based on this expression of interest. Overall, I enjoyed the seminar a lot and hope it is offered in the future.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN ADDICTION.",
    "Very cool class on addictions research, treatment, and policy. The professor is fantastic and the final paper and presentation is really interesting. Could use a bit more discussion\/debate etc. throughout the course, as well as more integration of video\/clinical examples. Overall would definitely recommend.",
    "Class is great, in terms of material and way it's run. Usually starts off with intro to topic and then segues into discussion and questions. Arielle is an excellent teacher and conversation facilitator. She is also incredibly helpful, smart, and a pleasure to have in the classroom. Take this course!"
