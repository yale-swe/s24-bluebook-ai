    "I would certainly recommend Football in America to another student. It is a really fun class. It has a lot of reading, but seems consistent with other English classes. If you like football and want to take an English 114, take this one.",
    "I would never recommend this course or teacher to anyone. I have told all of my friends who are looking for a writing credit to overlook this class. The catchy title of the game draws you in, but don't make the same mistake I did. The class is boring; the readings are boring, and the grading is not fair.",
    "English 114 is a writing course that is similar to AP english. You will read a lot and write about 4 big papers during the course. It may not be the most interesting course, but it can provide some valuable writing help that is necessary for the rest of college.",
    "It was not as fun as it sounds and involved some hard essay topics but I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Hard",
    "It is an interesting class and it isn't what the first year student will expect. It was a fun class in an unexpected way."
