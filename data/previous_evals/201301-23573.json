Think of all the carbon we would save!I only did this course as a \"two credit\" course, and it was definitely one of my most intensive (time wise) courses I've taken at Yale. I can't imagine taking it as a three credit course and doing two projects.If Jim wants to keep two projects structure, this should definitely be turned into a four credit course."

    "The DC trips were rough. They were really badly timed for classwork in other courses and for me spending 8+ hours commuting for a 1 hour meeting seemed like a waste (and I'm sure expensive for the school). I would look into having at least one of the trips be replaced by skype or a teleconference thing or something. Being there in person was unnecessary.",

    "More lectures on current events? Or work sessions with instructor on projects? Constant check-ins are helpful. Our group benefited from a very responsive client.",
    "Not all of the projects are equally well-formulated. While some of the projects are precise in scope and expectations for the students and the project sponsor are clear, some projects need further refining and thought before turning over to the students. The difference between a thoughtfully crafted project (by the client sponsor) and a nebulous one is HUGE for the students. It quite literally makes or breaks the student's experience."
