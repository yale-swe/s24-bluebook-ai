    "Why is there no obvious relationship between the spread of democratic and economic parity? A survey of public policy areas where collective action problems, the difficulty of balancingequity and efficiency, and the devil of details complicate the distribution of wealth and social services. The course and the discussion are often too broad to gain traction on any area. Yet the course is a strong introduction to the tensions that define public policy, and sets out how to study a particular area in greater detail as you so choose. The course benefits from being cotaught.",
    "I would not recommend this class -- the lack of structure is very frustrating, especially since the material is so interesting.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in taking a class with law and graduate students, but don't think it'll be a piece of cake. You'll need to do a lot of weekly reading (if you want to participate in conversations) and write a 20-25 page paper by the end."
