   "comments": [
    "I experienced serious mental health issues as a result of this class. By that I mean I thought about suicide more than half the days I was in lab. None of my experiments were working, and I felt like I was wasting the lab's money because I am so incompetent at basic experiments, and that I was wasting the time of those around me because I am so stupid. Spending so much time in lab makes it very easy to lose perspective on life because you begin to care too much. I think it is extremely silly to have this \"intensive\" option--the distinction so does not matter. Just do 485; you'll be so much happier.",
    "Near zero instruction for assignments from the MCDB department. I was lucky that I had taken a few of Dr. Mario Moreno's courses in previous years and had already learned how to write a formal proposal, mock manuscript, and design my own poster. Any student who does not have a PI readily accessible to provide instruction on how to complete these tasks will struggle in the writing assignments.",
    "If you're prepared to take MCDB 485\/486, you might as well take 495\/496. It's barely more time in the lab, and you get a whole extra credit! Plus, both 486 and 496 have the same requirements (15 page paper, poster, and power point presentation) so you really don't have much more to do.",
    "20 hours or more of research every week, 2 credits. Definitely a more substantial research experience.",
    "It's a thesis",
    "This is intensive research for credit - I would recommend it if you are interested in spending a significant time in lab, or would have spent a significant time in lab either way. It was fun to go to the sessions where students presented their work, as well as to attend the poster session symposium at the end of the term. The thesis paper is 15-20 pages long, and is an article-like description of your research.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in doing research. Spending 20 hrs a week in lab allows you to get a reasonable amount of work done throughout the year and it's not very hard to meet the time requirement.",
    "If you love the research you're doing and want to spend more time in lab, this is a great course!",
    "There is not a lot of guidance in terms of the paper requirements from the course instructors, so make sure you have a good relationship with your PI beforehand. Also, if you are traveling for interviews, make sure not to try to attend the talk sessions by Skype. Scott Holley finds Ithat unacceptable.",
    "If you would find yourself in lab around 20 hours a week anyway (or are willing to take on this level of work) you should do this class. The benefit is that you may get more done in a semester and get more credit. The only difference is that you write a slightly longer grant proposal and thesis, which shouldn't be much of a problem, and you present twice instead of once. Probably less added work than taking another credit in its place. I enjoyed the continuity (lots of hours working\/ learning about one thing).",
    "The only difference between BS and BS Intensive is 10 extra hours a week, a slightly longer thesis, and a presentation in both semesters."
