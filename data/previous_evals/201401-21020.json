    "Definitely take it, loads of fun if you get the right teacher.",
    "It's annoying that it meets every day and there's work to do every night, but it never took me more than an hour a night (sometimes just ten minutes.) I found this class very similar to L3 and enjoyed it overall. Take it with a friend if you can (all the classwork and oral exams are in pairs) and take it with Pilar if you can too; she's great!",
    "Yes",
    "Having class everyday isn't great but if you need to knock out the language requirement it's not bad",
    "Yes! An opportunity to improve your spanish through learning about different cultures through films and interesting novels and literature.",
    "SPAN 140 with Asensio-Manrique was my favorite Spanish class at Yale! Asensio is wonderful, the material is interesting, and it moves more quickly than the first three levels. Definitely take this class!"
