   "comments": [
    "Kind of interesting, it becomes impossible to do all of the readings, but for the midterm at least, it was good enough if you went to class and paid attention.",
    "Don't take it. 9 AM DEATH.",
    "Good class that is not very difficult. Sometimes gets a bit boring but certainly an interesting time to take it.",
    "Yeah - pretty gutty. Easy to do well if you go to class - don't have to do the readings",
    "Definitely recommended- very light workload.",
    "Not a lot of work but it is very important to go to the lectures.",
    "Fantastic! Take it! I actually learned a lot in this course and loved Prof. Kahn's lectures despite the fact that it was so hard to wake up at 9am! There are only two exams and no participation or attendance grade. You'll love it if you are in any way interested in the subject.",
    "Yeah, good course",
    "You should go to the lectures because there is a lot of information to retain.",
    "This class is really easy and super interesting. The readings are also really varied, generally really short and well worth it (though definitely not necessary to do well in the class). Professor Kahl is also great and definitely makes it worth it to come to class. If you're at all interested in the intersection of religion and society\/government this class is well worth it. It will give you a new perspective on religion in the public sphere.",
    "Yes--very interesting, especially in light of the ongoing election right now. You will learn a broad overview of different theoretical approaches to religion and politics and then look at modern countries as examples. Highly recommend the intensive section; you do not want your grade determined by two exams, each of which have many (misleading) multiple choice.",
    "Easy and interesting. Take it.",
    "Great course because the material is interesting and it is taught really well. The lectures are a lot of fun and the work load is manageable too. Take it!",
    "It was really easy and barely any work. If you go to class and take notes you will get an A for sure. No question. It is crazy boring though so meh. But I did learn a lot about religion and politics where I previously knew nothing so that's good. I value the knowledge I gained.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class. It is interesting and engaging! I was never bored in lecture!",
    "Take this class if you can promise yourself that you're going to make it to basically every lecture. Honestly, don't take this class if you can't. If you go to lecture, take notes, and study those for the exams, you will get an A in this class without doing a page of reading. But you have to go to class... or risk getting notes from someone who does.",
    "Yes! take it!",
    "This is a good class but only if you put in the work. You can get by without doing much reading if you show up for classes but if you aren't really interested in the material I'm not sure why you would waste your time.",
    "This class was awful. I took it credit D and I would not recommend taking this for ANY reason with this professor. Incredibly boring and the professor was really bad.",
    "No. Didn't get anything out of it but it a very easy 5th class if that is what you are looking for!",
    "i would recommend this course for someone interested in the topic.",
    "If you're a political science major, definitely consider this course. The only grades are two exams so they are very important, but the questions are fairly straightforward and fairly asked.",
    "Take it.",
    "It was a good eye opener to the transformation of religion and politics over the years.",
    "It is a class that describes the intersection of religion and politics, using a comparative frame of the Muslim world to the Christian world, with a US focus. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the topic, Poly Sci majors (its cross listed as PLSC 415 so it is a seminar req out of the way), and also anyone seeking a fifth class that is engaging but will not overload you with unnecessary busywork.",
    "Basic lecture class, dont need to do readings just skim before test, and get really good notes from people if you dont go to lecture",
    "I would recommend taking this course. The workload isn't too bad and major concepts aren't very difficult to understand. Grade is comprised only of 2 exams so consider that when choosing to take the class.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, based on my experience. The professor was hospitalized a couple of weeks into the semester and missed a few weeks, which made things very disorganized and confusing. This was by no fault of the professor and if healthy I'm sure the class would have been a lot better, but based on my experience I would not recommend it.",
    "Yes. Interesting course about politics and religion."
