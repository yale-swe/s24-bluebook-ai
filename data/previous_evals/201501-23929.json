   "comments": [
    "A really great overview of techniques for paleoenvironmental analyses. The labs are time-consuming, but there are only two. Overall, the workload is minimal except during midterms and finals (two take home exams and two papers). The best way to do well in this course is to take very thorough lecture notes, as there's no textbook and very few other resources. I'd definitely recommend the course to any G&G majors.",
    "I would recommend G&G232 because it's good material to know - kind of a fundamental like learning algebra to study higher math. However, if you really want to get any solid knowledge or skills out of the class, be prepared to read up on topics outside of class or meet with the TFs every week because you probably won't get much out of the lectures, which were usually unclear and hard to follow the flow of. Nonetheless, the subject material, which I enjoyed very much, made up for this.",
    "The first weeks are an introduction to sedimentary geology, and then dives into biogeochemical cycles. In 2015, Erin Saupe co-taught the class, and she had wonderful lectures on paleontology interspersed throughout the term. The 2015 class also teamed up with Global Tectonics for a spring break fieldtrip in Barbados, which was as much fun as it was informative. You will definitely get out of this class only what you put in, which can be as little as you have time for or as much as you have interest. Overall, I'd give the class a net positive rating.",
    "Don't take this class because you want to learn everything in the world about sedimentary rocks. The class isn't even really about sedimentary rocks, per se; it's a lot about the ocean, especially about how you can figure out environmental conditions from millions of years ago with what we can find today. I strongly recommend taking one of the intro classes first, or a class on geochemistry, or being comfortable with chemistry in general. There is a lot of assumed background, but once you have at least part of it, this class turns into something rather rewarding. Also there is a large emphasis on the two papers, the second of which was an overhaul of the first, and it felt as if I were writing not for a class but for a real journal. That's the professor's standard, and he'll help you get there.",
    "This course is everything you could want out of a stray purse. It's amazing, the profs are amazing, and you get awesome field experience. ABSOLUTELY take this course."
