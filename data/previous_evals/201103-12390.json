    "I can recommend this class only if you're hardcore engineer.",
    "If you want to learn thermodynamics (for engineering or for physical sciences like geology), you will learn it by taking this class. But it's conceptually difficult and a large workload, so if it's not required you might want to take it Credit-D-Fail unless you can afford a major time commitment.Advice for students in the class: definitely go to the section if the TA is competent (Justin Tang was great). It will shorten the time you spend on the problem sets by more than the length of the section. Lectures focus on the theory, and the section focuses on actual examples relevant to the problem sets. Gomez writes open-book tests that are far too long and difficult for anyone to finish in the time allotted and then grades them on a curve, so getting a good grade is a matter of finishing more than everyone else. Gomez doesn't have the epic reputation that Dufresne has in terms of teaching this course, but provided you put in the effort, you will learn the material with either professor.",
    "This class was incredibly frustrating. The material was challenging and interesting, but not that bad if the time was taken to review lecture notes and the chapters. The problem sets were tedious but notparticularly challenging in a conceptual manner. The lectures were fine even if Professor Gomez's handwriting can be cryptic at times. The real problem was in the examination method. The weekly quizzes were designed so we would struggle and fail, which occurred regularly. The tests required way more time than was allotted and the numbers chosen often did not make conceptual sense or required an insane amount of interpolation. While this may not affect our grade in the end because the class is curved, it was an unbelievably frustrating experience.",
    "Yes if you are serious about engineering. Seriously though, you are probably not going to take this unless you need it for your major. Then you have to. So enjoy!",
    "Interesting material, poorly taught. Required for MENG so it doesn't really matter. Try to take this class with Dufresne. Gomez covers material at his own pace without even pretending he cares about undergrads."
