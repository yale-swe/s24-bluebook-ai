   "comments": [
    "The information was really fascinating and I learned so much. Sometimes the lectures could get a bit confusing and sometimes it was hard to read what was written on the board.",
    "The lectures were really interesting, and I enjoyed writing the paper.",
    "The assignments were minimal and the readings were interesting, but I would have liked to have more contact with the teacher. Maybe having a TA, a section, or a more intimate classroom would have been helpful.",
    "This course is very interesting. Primary source readings are interesting and lectures are very engaging. Even though the lecture size is small there is little discussion, which is good because I'd rather hear the professor share his knowledge than try to impart my own wisdom.",
    "Strenghts: the course material is interesting, Ivan is a good lecturer, and the effort required to get something out of the class is not reasonably moderate. Weaknesses: While Ivan may seem laid back, he has VERY specific expectations regarding the final paper, even if he doesn't make them clear."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course because I think it is a side of history that isn't learned as much as say European history. This information is fresh, interesting, and absolutely relevant to the world today.",
    "Yes",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course for someone interested in pursuing Judaic or Islamic studies, but has not had a strong introduction to the subject matter.",
    "I highly recommend this course, as it was definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale. The material was enlightening, since you learn in great depth about an area of history not taught or understood well enough outside of those who study it in detail. I definitely feel like I understand the Muslim Middle Ages better than the Christian Middle Ages, especially how Jews lived in those times. The class explains how different developments in Judaism in the Middle East, like the widespread adoption of the Babylonian Talmud and Kabbalah, spread throughout the Jewish World as a result of the centralizing powers in the region. Even if the topic sounds obscure, it is highly relevant to how Judaism is studied and practiced today. Again, I highly recommend.",
    "This course was very interesting. Professor Marcus is an engaging lecturer who brings life to the material. The workload is very light and manageable, as is the final paper. If you are at all interested in the history of Jewish or Muslim history until the 16th Century I would recommend this course.",
    "As far as history lectures go, this class is not too boring. Being already well-versed in Jewish texts and history, I found it easy to contextualize and relate to the course material, making it all the more interesting. Ivan is engaging, funny, and understanding, and his assignments are not too difficult (just make sure that your SHORT PAPER is TEN TO TWELVE PAGES). Readings are supplementary, and as long as you take notes in class, youll have all the material you need to be adequately prepared for each of the two in-class midterm-exams. For those of you to whom this is relevant, Ivan does not hold class on Jewish holidays."
