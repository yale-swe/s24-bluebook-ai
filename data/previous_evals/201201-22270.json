    "I would recommend DS H&P to anyone. It is probably the most applicable of the three sections of DS.",
    "Take Slanski if you're willing to DO THE READING and have ideas about the reading. She's a great thinker and does not waste her words, but also doesn't suffer fools gladly and can be a tough grader (or so I've heard--that's not my personal experience).",
    "Great! I loved this class, except when slogging through things like Hobbes. Much better than first semester: definitely more relevant to the modern world. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend DS -- it is a rewarding experience that exposes you to a large range of fascinating works and authors. The program was great for improving my writing, making me question belief systems I would have previously taken for granted, and opening my mind to many new ideas and philosophies.",
    "If you want to write better and think better, take this class with Professor Slanski. If you want an easy A, don't. In Slanski's class I got far more out of section than in any of my other sections. She insists on a close, accurate reading of the text and guides discussion to the heart of the argument. She makes sure you understand whatever text you are reading. Slanski puts lots of time and effort into her feedback on papers and you really grow as a writer. You will not, however, get good grades. In Professor Slanski's class you will do better work for a lower grade. It's worth it.",
    "Fight, claw, kick, do whatever, but get Slanski!",
    "This class is a review of Historical and Political Thought within the western tradition, the foundation of modern political science, history, etc. All students in the humanities and social sciences should take this course or something like it"
