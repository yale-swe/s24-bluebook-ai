    "TAKE THIS CLASS. NOW. Professor Camacho is brilliant and one of the most kind and accessible professors I have ever had at Yale. The reading list for this class is amazing (really, even if you don't take the class - check out the list) and you get to work on a semester long project about a topic of your choice. Great professor, great material, great class. Just take it.",
    "TAKE IT!",
    "Awesome class. Learn about things you care about.",
    "The ability to be creative in an area which you are interested in.",
    "The class allows you to choose a current social issue\/problem\/topic and research it over the semester. Each week you post new material related to your topic. At the end, you submit a creative project that us a culmination of all your research. The project can be in any form - a standard research paper, a fictional narrative, a booklet, a website, etc. This class is a true gem that epitomizes what it means to be an American Studies major. But, for any major should really consider taking this class. Sometimes we get caught up writing essays because we HAVE to. In this class, you will complete a final project because you WANT to. Professor Camacho is wonderful, always encouraging your thoughts and providing you with suggestions for your research. A standard book a week and in class we discuss the book and update each other on our projects. By the end of the semester, there was a great group dynamic. We are all excited to meet up next semester to show each other our creative projects! By far the best class I've taken at Yale. Take it take it take it take it!!! There is no class like this!",
    "The readings for the class are amazing. What I liked about the course was that for an AMST class, it had a very global perspective. This means one week we would be reading about the Rwanda genocides and the next week we would read something on favelas in Brazil or apartheid in South Africa. The course basically looks at different situations\/problems around the world and the ways in which they have been documented and remembered. And throughout the semester you are working towards your final project, which can be on anything that interests you. Some were on immigration, others on bilingual education, one on architectural utopias (so essentially your project can be anything!). Every week you post a blog that is related to your project. You have to interview someone related to your project and then your final project can take which ever form you like (can be like a regular research paper, a website...the possibilities are infinite). Camacho is extremely flexible and open to new ideas. I never felt limited, and she really encourages students to work in the manner in which they feel the most comfortable. Camacho is also an amazing professor. Discussions were sometimes weak because it was clear that people had not done the assigned readings for the class (the blog posts each week take a long time and we were never really \"graded\" on the readings, so it was something that could often be left to the last minute). So class dynamics depends on the people in your course. But if there is something that has always interested you that you would like to pursue in more depth, then this would be a great class to take. Many AMST majors also used this class to fulfill their senior requirement, so that would also be a good choice! Shop the class and see what you think.",
    "Definitely take this course. It is unlike any other offered at Yale and you will really be able to investigate a topic of your own interest with a significant amount of depth."
