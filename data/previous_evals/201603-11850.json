    "This course taught me so much about the possibilities--and limitations--of American Studies. It was so extremely helpful to have a concrete point of focus for writing my thesis, as well as a community to rely on that is in the same boat. The conversations we were able to have all together, as well as with Chris, made this semester's thesis work so much easier. I learned in a very different way: on a disciplinary level; how to treat my thesis as something that is both manageable and finite, but also that touches on my most intense interests."

   "comments": [
    "I appreciate having a setting to discuss my thesis with other American Studies seniors, and I imagine I will like it even more in the spring when my thesis is even more at the forefront of my mind. I do think the course could benefit from a bit more structure, however, as I felt I would be much further along on my writing by this point. I am somebody who benefits from having a lot of firm deadlines and this class was just a bit too flexible on that for me.",
    "This class is really all about working on your own steam. If you aren't prepared to stay on top of your work or to plunge yourself into whatever your thesis topic is, there is not much any structural changes can do for you. That being said, I liked being grouped with other folks in my major and brainstorming with them about our various topics; I liked having Christopher as a resource; I liked having the mandatory library tutorial. At first I was worried this seminar would be a waste of time but it really helped me appreciate what my peers are doing and to understand how to use the ridiculous number of resources around me.",
    "By trying to fit all different projects, the class fails to helps specifics of each individual projects (for some). Didn't think this class was that useful for my project. Would have preferred working in small groups once a month, or just having the option of checking in.",
    "This course feels geared towards those doing traditional theses, and didn't totally work for the ~50% of students doing creative projects. It often entails working towards an intellectual explanation before the actual creative project. Not sure what a solution would be to this, just noting.",
    "I love the format and setting, which is basically a place for people to share ideas and give feedback, and this facilitates creativity and improvement on all ends. Chris is a great teacher who is always supportive and helpful.",
    "Chris made this class so wonderful: I learned how to keep my eyes on the political ramifications of what I am writing, but also not to take myself too seriously. I realized coming out of each session that I was much more energized about my work, and ready to get back to it. I particularly liked the class session in which we read the introductions of a lot of different American Studies-esque books, and dissected them for writing strategies. Chris does an amazing job of fostering a community in the classroom, too. The only thing I would like, is to get some readings about American Studies as a major\/discipline. I would love to know about its history, and how it is thought of today\/debates about its place and political horizons. I often feel very lost as an American Studies major--as if I don't know what disciplinary\/academic tools I should be using. I know this is partly due to AMSTUD's interdisciplinary nature, but I would find it so helpful to get a little more history, too."

    "If you're doing the intensive major, you have to take it, so",

    "If you are passionate about your project and you want to have enough to do\/research\/write\/understand everything you think you want to, take this. It's an incubation pod for your work and a reminder of how cool and smart your peers are, too (in a motivational and not competitive sense).",
    "It's mandatory for yearlong thesis.",
    "Yes. Gives you a chance to do something creative around others who are doing equally creative things. great fun",
    "Yes; this is extremely helpful for writing your thesis: You get a community of people who are in the same boat as you, and a grad student who's been there\/done that, knows the struggle, and takes you and your ideas seriously!"
