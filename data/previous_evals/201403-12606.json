    "Chill Biology lab but you will learn a lot.",
    "Very nice and helpful.",
    "Overall - great class. It would have been nice to have slightly more structure in the laboratory setting, as there were multiple times where we were waiting for reagents to be prepared by TAs or just simply unsure of how to calculate certain values (problems that could easily be solved with advance preparation). But again, a great introduction to using techniques you might not be accustomed to, even if you have prior research experience.",
    "Take it; great course. Prof Nelson really cared about how the students are learning. Still a bit disorganized and the classes usually run much longer than the formal time period. (don't schedule other classes\/ meetings after this class). We also had to do a final paper detailing our experiment that was very time-consuming.",
    "A must-take class if you ever want to go into molec bio.",
    "It was great! Long hours but nice experience",
    "Great lab course if you're willing to spend 7 to 9 hours in lab a week. Prof. Nelson is a great instructor and you'll learn new techniques, even if you've been in a lab before. The second half of the semester (MCDB 343) was slightly better in my opinion because we didn't spend as much time repeating experiments but that's the nature of biological research - lots of repetition.",
    "342L was a fantastic introduction to molecular biology techniques. Professor Nelson is an absolute joy to have as an instructor. He is super patient, approachable, and willing to answer any and all questions you may have. As you will see, the class is dictated by the project you are assigned so you should definitely take both 342 and 343L, as I found the 343 topic to be more interesting and the 342 course to lay the foundation for many of the techniques we used in both. Absolutely take this course if you're an MCDB major, pre-med, or just interested in research techniques.",
    "I would recommend the class. It is a good introduction to nucleic acids lab work and a great way to fulfill the lab requirement. It can be disorganized and frustrating at times, and our project did not work out at all. Take notes during the lectures because they help out with the problem sets and always ask Dr. Nelson questions! It can become easy to get lost in the class, but Dr. Nelson is very willing to help so make sure you use him as a resource! You also really get to bond with other students in the class too, which is an added bonus!",
    "This class is time-intensive, but it is a great way to fulfill your major\/premed Bio Lab requirement. You learn the basics of major bio techniques while spending quality time with classmates during the duration of the experiments. Its strengths includes the applicability of the completed work since it pertains to actual lab research projects. One weakness is the disorganization of the class at times, which prompts us to leave later than we should.",
    "The class solidified a lot of techniques I learned in lab (cloning, DNA purification, PCR), but at the same time, it meant I was doing techniques I was already familiar with. The days were generally pretty long: instead of ending around 4:30pm, it would usually end around 5:00-5:30pmsometimes later. I think some of the extra time could have been reduced if things were better organized and prepared for in advance. Of course, that can be difficult because were working on current research and what we do next depends on previous steps. Nevertheless, Professor Nelson was very patient, understanding, and put in a lot of extra time himself so that we wouldnt have to waste time redoing steps that failed. Overall, I believe the class is well taught, but not the most organized. In the first half of the semester, your grade is based on psets, your lab notebook, and a final paper (~10 pages?)."
