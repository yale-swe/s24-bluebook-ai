    "If you can, do. It will be worth it.",
    "Yes. Voice lessons are a great idea if you want to take singing seriously. They've helped me tremendously. It's not much of a time commitment, but the work is very focused and intense.",
    "They changed it from a grade to a credit, which was the right decision to do (although it should actually be a half credit). I was perfectly happy with that change, but I didn't like my particular vocal teacher. Your experience is wholly dependent on who you are assigned to, so you have to watch out.",
    "Do it! You know you want to.",
    "Great course. You get to practice the art you love and get credit for it. If you want to be a better singer and learn a ton about vocal technique and history, take the course."
