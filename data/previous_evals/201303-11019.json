    "1st half - atonal melodic dictations; 2nd half - 7th chords, quartal chords, study of pre-dominants. Professor Lalli is one of the most genuine professors I have met, with a sincere commitment to teaching his students.",
    "As Professor Lalli taught this course, he heard once or twice from colleagues, \"That sounds more like 'Advanced Musicianship' than 'Intermediate Musicianship.'\" In general I would agree with this assessment (though Prof. Friedmann teaches a further course in the topic). The material was always presented effectively, and it was definitely manageable (given, though, that I had years of performing experience before taking the course), but the title was a bit misleading. The jump from 218-219 to 318 is noticeable, and I would only recommend this course to someone who did very well in the aural components of 218 and 219.This course definitely builds skill. I feel that I noticed my sight-reading technique improve more in the first half of this course than in 218 and 219 together.I would recommend this course to skilled musicians looking to further their technique. As the course relies primarily on aural skills, I do not believe that strong work habits or dedication to the topic could be a substitute for skill in being prepared for this course, though (this is not a course in which caring more or less or putting in more time will help past a point).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you're looking for some extra ear training practice. Lalli is a good teacher, and will work on whatever the individual students need most!",
    "Very good."
