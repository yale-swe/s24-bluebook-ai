    "I would definitely recommend that anyone take this class, regardless of your major. If you're in ME, it will help lay a foundation for most of the courses you'll take in the next four years, as well as beyond that. If you're not, but think you might be interested in the field or want to see if it is right for you, it will give you a broad sense of what the field is truly about, and from there you can determine if taking more courses makes sense.",
    "It is a really great class. The final project took time to put together but was very rewarding when it was completed.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "If it's taught by Dr. Becene it's an excellent introduction to Mechanical Engineering. If you have any consideration to do MechE , take this course! It's very hands-on and has more breadth (less depth) than most courses, but you'll learn a lot! We also had a lot of fun in class and I haven't made so many friends through a class before.",
    "If You can take this class, I would definitely suggest doing it. It's interactive and You learn a lot and Professor Becene brought us donuts a lot. The only caveat is that it is a lot of class time: in addition to having the normal lecture twice a week, You also have to go to a 3 hours lab once a week. The labs were generally fun though (we got to play with servos and a strobe light), and a fair number of the classes and labs ended early. Also, Professor Becene answered a bunch of questions during the exams so You knew exactly what he expected for every question (this was true on the hw too).",
    "A great intro class, which apparently changed and improved greatly this semester compared to semesters prior. A bit more organization\/planning with lecture material would have been really helpful--as someone taking this as a first MechE class I was really lost with the context of each lecture. I would also suggest learning Solidworks on your own over winter\/summer break before the class if you can!",
    "Good introduction to the ideas and concepts which serve as a foundation to engineering knowledge. Great for freshman both already decided upon engineering and those still undecided to obtain an idea of what to expect from an engineering major. Some tasks will provide slight difficulty (in which case utilizing assistance from either peers or instructors proves very beneficial), but most will be appropriately leveled given the time to complete said tasks. I highly recommend this course to another student, as Dr. B is awesome and makes the class very enjoyable. Do not put off the final project too long - it will come back to bite you. (prototype often, it helps)",
    "Great class even if you didn't know anything beforehand. You will learn a lot about mechanical design processes.",
    "Fun class--you build a robotic arm! My favorite class this term. Also pretty cool to hear about mech. engineering from someone who works in industry (quite a bit different than academia).",
    "freshmen? thinking about mech eng? or any eng? want to do some hands on stuff? take it. not freshmen? probably you can take more useful classes."
