    "Take it! It's fun!",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course.",
    "Obviously take it if you get in. Professor Cunningham is brilliant and accessible and really friendly, and your writing will get better because of it.",
    "Yes, an absolute must. Great, nurturing workshop.",
    "I would recommend this workshop without hesitation. We each wrote two stories in the semester, and in class we just discussed writing--and that was great. Michael Cunningham's comments are usually spot on, but he is very good at letting others voice their own opinions. I would say that everyone in the class (made up of students who already seem pretty comfortable writing) improved--though when people whipped something out, I think it showed. Michael Cunningham really will help with your other stories or revisions outside of class, which is great considering he is busy, and he'll probably give you some interesting and relevant outside reading to do.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "You write two stories (that's right, two) over the course of the semester. They can be anywhere from three to 25 pages (that's right, three). So, it's not much work if you don't want it to be. If you do want it to be, you can send drafts back and forth to Michael and work on improving your writing. Otherwise, there's really no point - and you WILL get aggravated.",
    "Yes. Great workshop, occasionally frustrating as all workshops are wont to be, but you won't regret it."
