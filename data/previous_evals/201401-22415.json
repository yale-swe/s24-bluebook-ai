    "ANTH 594 is an introduction to the almost impossibly complex issues of affect, materiality, ontology and their relationships. Prof. Dudley's syllabus is excellent, and the pieces speak to each other intimately, though often in less than obvious ways (which she lets you figure out on your own). Highly recommended.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend it. I would especially recommend the course for those who are interested in ethnographic methods, affect theory, or new materialist theory. Many of the students who took the course were familiar with affect theory, but less so with new materialist theory. However, this was a great entry point into these two theoretical fields. It was also a great entry point into a theory-heavy course."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me theorize some of the ideas I have been thinking about for my dissertation project.",
    "I am not sure how I will incorporate what I learned in this seminar into my research just yet, but the theoretical training was extremely useful. I also enjoyed the diversity in disciplinary training of our seminar. In general, I think I will draw on some of the theorists (especially the affect theorists) in my eventual dissertation work."
