    "I learned about causal inference techniques.",
    "Helped me understand the various different types of data based research methods.",

   "comments": [
    "The biggest weakness of the course is that we did not have pencil and paper homework problems that required us to do matching by hand before the midterm.",
    "This class was fantastic! I think the end, when we went through method after method, got a little dull. I preferred the earlier part of the course where we focused on more theory, like DAGs and modeling the problem. Everything before the midterm was fantastic. I got a little disengaged when we got into method after method at the end.",
    "Strength: very clear lectures, problem sets that basically gave chances to practice concepts, excellent TAs, a final paper to REALLY practice Weaknesses: Lots of different concepts that were sometimes hard to keep ALL straight... but overall well-packaged to leave the course with a TON of new knowledge",
    "The course is highly accessible to students. But I would like to see a more systematic approach of introducing various causal inference techniques.",
    "Really interesting course, taught by amazing instructor and teaching fellows. Lots of great and challenging problem sets that really helped solidify the theories learned in class.",
    "This course did a good job giving me a practical understanding of the different methods used to estimate causal identification. I liked the structure of the course; I found both the lectures and sections to be helpful in different ways.",
    "Can spend some time discussing the answers of the problem sets in class.",
    "This is a rigorous course that teaches causal inference and the underlying econometrics behind it."

    "Yes- I highly recommend!",

    "I would highly recommend this class. I learned a ton of useful methods and ways of thinking. The course staff were outstanding.",
    "1000%. Super clear and usually engaging lectures. Not overwhelming workload amount.",
    "Yes, if they are interested in causal inference.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It did a very good job covering the basic methods of causal identification, and I felt I got a very hands-on approach that helped me in my own research.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to the students who are interested in causal inference and research design.",
    "This is a rigorous course by the end of which you are sure to have understood the core concepts of causal inference. The weekly problem sets and the midterm and final exam make sure that you have this understanding -- it is difficult to slack!"
