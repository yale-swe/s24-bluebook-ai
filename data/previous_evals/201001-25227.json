   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you're interested in the history and development of Buddhist thought. This course may be difficult for a complete beginner. Think carefully about taking the course if you're not very interested in history.",
    "If you want to take a course to learn about buddhism, you can take this course but you must be interested enough to do the readings. Or else it'll seem like a waste of time.",
    "RLST 134 provides an introduction to Buddhism via a close reading of primary source scripture. Although this is basically an introductory class, it would help to have some background on Buddhism since the beginning of the class moves fast. You should know that the only way you're going to get anything out of this class is if you do the reading, because the class just consists of Prof. Shinohara speaking quietly to himself about the material. You write four 5-page papers over the semester, and that's the only work. Take this class only if you have a strong desire to read primary source Buddhist texts.",
    "I would highly recommend the class.",
    "Take it! You will learn a lot by the end of the course. The course starts fairly easy, but don't think that it will be easy throughout. I've done the first two assignments without any problems, but last two assignments were quite challenging.",
    "I would recommend this class, but beware the readings are a real challenge.",
    "To gain an understanding of what Buddhism actually teaches, this would be the perfect class.",
    "4 papers. You don't really have to go to class, but you should try to do the readings because they will help you out on the papers.",
    "Great class, very insightful. One of the most interesting classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "If you are interested in seeing the broader picture of how Buddhism developed in different places, I would recommend the course. However, it was difficult to have a firm grasp on Buddhism in general. The course leaves broader questions about the nature of Buddhism open while it gives you a more technical grasp of different Buddhist traditional practices (according to primary sources)."
