    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. GLBL 368 was great!",
    "Yes! Its a super interesting class, but there is a lot of reading.",
    "Generally a very satisfying class. Despite being a diplomat, Evans showed that he can be a remarkably engaging and interesting professor. His anecdotes, as well as subtle sense of humor made the class informative as well as interactive and engaging. Seminars were a little dry at first, as we merely summarized the readings, however towards the end class became incredibly interesting and thought-provoking. There are few opportunities to hear about diplomacy from a man who's experienced it, and a number of the readings were confidential and only available because of Evans. in short, this is a unique opportunity to learn about diplomacy.",
    "This is an okay course. It is the first time that it was taught this year and Mr. Evans isn't a professor either. I personally enjoyed the experience he brought to the classroom as a diplomat, but I thought the class discussion lacked a coherent structure. Also, rather than focusing the course along particular themes, we discussed different types of diplomacy which ended up being quite repetitive each week. The essay prompts were strange as well. They were questions that required a lot of creativity both because not much academic literature exists about diplomacy but also because he just put together questions that didn't really present straightforward answers. He is also a very easy grader although he claimed not to be in class.",
    "Yes. Professor Evans was great. It was very cool to have an actual diplomat teach a class, because. He is very humorous in a British way, which was great. The introductions were interesting -- if not sometimes just a little bit long. He is very approachable and very helpful. The assignmentswere very reasonable. The foreign policy memo was particularly interesting because it really felt like we were simulating a diplomat's task in the real world.This was a GREAT class. It was essentially \"Diplomacy 101\"; which offered a fresh perspective in terms of international policy-making and global affairs. The seminar structure was great; the professor would give a brief introduction about the week's topic, and open the floor up to discussion. The discussions were very interesting. The guest lectures were awesome; with CIA agents and Chinese diplomats, it was really cool to see real-world actors who were engaged in diplomacy.",
    "If you are interested in a diplomatic career at all or are otherwise considering something to do with IR I would almost suggest this class as a must have. The readings can be a tad boring at times if you are not very interested by the material, but it is definitely still worth it.Professor Evans is great, and he is only going to be here for a limited amount of time. Be sure to take advantage of it.",
    "I think this is a good introduction to diplomatic processes and machinery for someone who is interested in the profession. It is less a course detailing key diplomatic trials and successes.",
    "The class is excellent, but if you take it, you should take it for professor Evans, not the particular material. It's a good introduction to the role of diplomacy specifically, which is undeveloped as a field, if you'd like to think about it.",
    "Yes, especially if you are considering a career in diplomacy.",
    "I definitely would recommend PLSC 196 to another student. This course covers a wide range of interesting topics regarding diplomacy. Although there is a lot of reading each week, the readings are meaningful and oftentimes thought-provoking. This was a great seminar and I think that students who are interested in diplomacy and international relations would really get a lot out of this course. Also Professor Evans is great and was able to bring a lot of real-world insight to the course, as well as great guest lecturers.",
    "Power& Influence in International Diplomacy is an excellent course on how foreign services and diplomatic corps work in nations across the world. Professor Evans is a great teacher and structured the class with a good mix of lecture, discussion, and personal anecdotes from his service.Professor Evans seemed very frank throughout the class, explaining both the enjoyable and frustrating aspects of diplomatic service as well as which readings he liked and disliked. It was particularly interesting to learn about the foreign services and diplomatic efforts of small and emerging countries such as India, Brazil, Turkey, Singapore, which does not seem to covered in many (if any) other Yale classes. Overall, I would highly recommend the class for any with interesting in working for a diplomatic service or interested in diplomatic history.",
    "The class gave a very real insight into diplomacy and how it works, but falls a little short of what its class title suggests - linking it to bigger themes of power and influence in international politics. Evans though is a great resource - he's very well-connected."
