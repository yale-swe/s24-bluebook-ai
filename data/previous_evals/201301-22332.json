   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. As a senior seminar, it offers a great and wide-ranging list of texts and it is not too difficult to manage work-wise. Professor Stepto is an amazing professor; you should definitely take a class with him before you graduate Yale if you have the opportunity to do so.",
    "A class where you will read autobiographies that ask you to explore the role of place, writing about another, and various social movements throughout history. TAKE IT. There is no way you will not find something interesting in this course. Plus, Professor Stepto is just hands down THE BEST.",
    "You get to write your autobiography as an option for the final paper, which is much less work-intensive than a literary analysis paper. You get to employ techniques (or \"strategies\" as Stepto calls them) from the readings with your own autobiography. It's cool how much you discover about yourself through the process!",
    "This course was structured by weekly reading assignments. The works we went through were interesting and provided a diverse perspective on autobiography.",
    "Class is a discussion of the week's reading. The assignments are leading one discussion, a short critical essay, a short essay that could be critical or creative, and a longer final essay that could be critical or creative. Overall a very manageable and enjoyable work load, especially if you enjoy creative autobiographical writing. Stepto is a kind professor, and good discussion leader who provides interesting anecdotal and historical contexts for the readings.",
    "I would recommend Autobiography in America to someone looking for a relaxed seminar experience. This class is wonderful in that it allows you the flexibility to engage with its subject matter in the way that is best for you."
