   "comments": [
    "If you enjoy being taught by a huge jerk, then take Journalism with Brill. He takes great pleasure in making people feel bad.",
    "Yes, definitely take it. If you're at all interested in journalism, or any sort of reporting or research, it's a very helpful course. You pick up some practical skills and really learn how to source an article. You look at the history of journalism, it's present state, and where it's going. Useful both for relative beginners and journalism vets.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the role of journalism, both as a public service and a business. You learn the fundamentals of what it takes to be a good journalist. Know that Professor Brill does not emphasize writing itself so much as content \u0097 i.e., what makes a good story and how can it be told accurately and fairly?",
    "Journalism is probably one of the most unique seminars at Yale. In some respects, you do what you would do in any seminar - write papers (in this case, a profile of another student and a final magazine-style piece) and reading responses and participate in class. (The work, by the way, is definitely manageable; the reading is light and interesting, and you have a lot of time to work on the papers, though if our class was any indication, the last week before the final paper is due will be extremely stressful.) What's different is that the seminar is REALLY personality-driven: Brill is a veteran of the journalism industry and sort of legendary for being both entrepreneurial and harsh, and he isn't afraid to call individuals out in class for mistakes and give horrible grades at first. But he's very accessible, willing to help and a softie at heart. He also knows most people in the business and can provide great career advice, as well as amazing guest lecturers (like David Remnick, the New York editor) and field trips (we went to the NYT building). Be warned that he'll teach you more about the business of journalism and fair reporting than he will about writing, and that the class can feel more like a small lecture than a section sometimes. A final thing: the quality of the class is also determined by the other students, who are mostly YDN\/Herald people; most of them have journalism experience and are serious about it, too. Take it if you get in.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone looking to gain the basic but paramount skills that underlie solid, meaningful reporting. You can\u0092t produce fluff or b.s. for the class, because Prof. Brill will see right through it, and that\u0092s great training for any aspiring reporter.",
    "Take this class. Don't wait for Abramson. Brill is a really great teacher and a really great contact. He'll make sure he convinces you to go into journalism after you graduate and he'll help you get a job. He has a super tough attitude but if you work hard for him he'll make it pay off.Also he's a softie when it comes time for the final grade. This is the kind of class where I stressed over the final paper not for the A but because I wanted Brill to think well of me. That's the sign of a great teacher.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in pursuing journalism as a career. The focus is less on writing as it is on surviving in the journalism industry. Brill's lectures were good, but even better were the opportunities to discuss internships and the introductions to journalists and editors that he provided throughout the semester. Be prepared for tough love."
