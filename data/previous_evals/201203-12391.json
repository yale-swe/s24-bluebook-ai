    "Excellent, informative, interesting History lecture with not too much work. Keep up with lectures and section, and you'll love it.",
    "Some interesting topics covered in the class. However, the topics are disparate at times. The midterm is just IDs and an essay, but a lot of detail is required. Rogers covers a lot of material and uses powerpoint slides. However, she simply reads off her papers and goes really quickly through her slides that you can barely copy them down.",
    "Good survey course on America's public health history. Not too hard. Excellent, excellent reading packet! I enjoyed every article--first time I can say that about any course.",
    "Public Health in America is an overview of the health movements and major events that have occurred since the inception of the US. I would recommend this class to another student. The class lectures are interesting and there isn't that much reading each week.",
    "This is a great history course. The course load is manageable and all the lectures are very interesting. Especially if you are interested in a health care profession, this course is extremely relevant.",
    "It is a great class if you don't care about the grade.",
    "TAKE IT IT ROCKS",
    "Great survey course for people interested in public health. Lecture moves FAST, so don't skip.",
    "Yes, very interesting class",
    "Professors Rogers goes through her lectures incredibly fast, so bring a laptop and be prepared to type nonstop for about an hour. Also the lecture slides aren't posted anywhere (and wouldn't be most help if they were) so class attendance is crucial. The readings aren't to bad, and they aren't incredibly necessary because the readings influence discussion class but not the exams.Overall it's a pretty decent course and I feel like I learned a lot.",
    "This is an excellent course. The readings were nearly all interesting and the lectures were FANTASTIC. Lectures were engaging, insanely interesting, and gave great context. It has one midterm, one final, and a paper--pretty standard. It's not too tough. Regardless of what they tell you don't actually have to do any of the readings, btw...they're strictly supplemental, as long as you can BS your way through section. Though you'll probably want to do them because they're great (except for the AIDS book, if that's still assigned in the future). Prof. Rogers is an amazing lecturer with a delicious accent. You'll love this course.",
    "Great survey course. Prof. Rogers is awesome and spunky. Her lectures are thematically grouped in interesting and informative ways and she posts essential \"terms\" for each lecture that help one to keep tabs on the material. The readings are absolutely fabulous - I read all of them and quite happily, as they were very interesting. If you're interested in the subject, you should definitely take this class.",
    "This is a fabulous course on the main problems in American public health within the past 200 years. There is ALOT of reading (a 400 page course packet for the semester), but the readings are really interesting and very informative. The course only requires a midterm, final, and term paper, no other assignments!",
    "This class is well-taught, and the material is very interesting. I would recommend it if you are at all thinking about taking the class. There's one midterm, one final, and one 10 page paper, so overall I think I was very manageable.",
    "Interesting material, but grading can be pretty arbitrary. Be extremely careful about who you chose for a TA. This year, there were two TAs who were enthusiastic and interested in public health and one who clearly had no interest in the subject. There are better HSHM classes. If you want to take this, take it credit d or else beware of the frustration you will feel over being graded unfairly. Also, Professor Rogers will never ever mention any of the exams or the paper in class (which is unfortunate because you are graded on these things).",
    "Yes. Take this class! If you're at all interested in the material, this is the class for you. I think that anyone interested in medicine, history, science, or public health should definitely take this course. Take it with Naomi Rogers if possible! I learned a lot about the material and thought it was always very interesting.Make sure to go to lecture because it'sthe best prep for the final. The paper is pretty painless -- it's only 10 pages. Also, the midterms aren't too bad as long as you start studying 3-4 days before the test.",
    "All in all, this class is a nice general overview of what's on the tin, Public Health in America. One caveat: I've noticed quite a few people (yes, usually pre-meds) interested in *current* health policy taking this course getting frustrated; this is still a HISTORY course. Also take note of the syllabus: most of your grade comes in the last couple of weeks with the final paper and exam. If you look at the rest of your finals schedule and notice that it's going to be hellish, you might want to re-think taking this. Other than that, it's a pretty easy-going course. The weekly workload of readings is fairly light. Professor Rogers speaks very quickly about many interesting events and details so lecture may seem a bit overwhelming at first (she also does not post her slideshows online). However, she does put up lists of key terms for each week's topic so studying from that tends to be the most efficient.",
    "HIstory 140 01 was a good class, but not what I expected. I expected more relation to medicine throughout American history. It turned out to be more public health in American history",
    "I would recommend this course for another student if they want to memorize a lot.",
    "HIST 140 explores public health from smallpox through AIDS. It explores the major themes of public health as well as specific examples. It focuses on pioneers in public health and government cases that have shaped policy. There is one midterm exam, a final paper, and a final exam. Students can select any topic they want for the final paper. I would definitely recommend this class for a fellow student.",
    "There's a midterm, a final paper and a final exam, so the workload isn't too bad. The paper isn't due until reading week and is worth 40% of the grade, so putting it off can be really risky. The midterm and final were both straightforward and fair, and if you put a decent amount of time into studying you should do fine.",
    "Good for HSHM majors in public health route. Going to lecture is not always necessary but having good lecture notes is key",
    "Gives a good overview of the major public health issues of the past few centuries. It's a broad course, so it doesn't go into much detail. It was interesting, but can also be somewhat repetitive if you've taken another survey history course at Yale.Not a big workload - midterm, final paper, final exam. The exams are very fair.Try to get a good section leader!",
    "Learned a lot about public health. Take it only if you have an interest in public health! Many people might not have enjoyed the class since they weren't used to a history class-- memorizing dates and facts. However, I was interested in public health and this provided a great overview of the course. One midterm, one final, one paper. No homework in between those deadlines, but be prepared to memorize years and facts for these tests. Professor Rogers goes through the slides very quickly and sometimes puts facts, such as specific years of when the doctors went to medical school, which is not essential and will not be tested on. I would recommend this only if you have a prior interest!",
    "Certainly a very interesting class. Naomi Rogers is a pretty good lecturer, despite the fact that she speaks VERY quickly and flips through the slides VERY quickly (and doesn't post them later). The midterm and final was fair. A good overview of public health in the US.",
    "Fascinating material, good lecturer, very low workload. Readings take<1 hour every week, and none of the course is difficult. Learn about the transforming role of public health in citizens' lives through the lens of history, each epidemic, each incident.",
    "I liked the material. I was bored with the lecture format. Discussions were not very exciting. I disliked having a grade based on 3 things.",
    "I would recommend it. The subscribe material is fascinating and it's not too much work.",
    "I would definitely recommend. It is a very interesting overview of American history through a lens that you probably haven't investigated before. The lectures are interesting, the reading isn't too bad, and the workload is comprable to any other survey history course. Professor Rogers knows her stuff well, and finds ways to communicate it in interesting ways. I came out feeling like I learned quite a bit.",
    "Public Health is a pretty comprehensive history course. Lots of time periods and different diseases to get to know. Because there is so much covered, it is sometimes difficult to keep up. Yet I felt like I learned a great deal from this class.",
    "I'd recommend it, it's a pretty decent course overall. Doing the reading isn't necessary",
    "not much work- the reading isn't really necessary but it's interesting if you have time. low maintenance and pretty interesting.",
    "This course is a comprehensive overview of American history taught through the lens of public health. Though the term \"public health\" comes first in the title, this is, first and foremost, an American history class. Topics including slavery, the Civil War, immigration, liberalism, the new right, and global politics will be covered with a mind to health and medicine, albeit sometimes not an exclusive one. I would whole-heartedly recommend this course to a fellow student interested in history and public health, though not, perhaps, to a student interested in the history \"of\" public health.",
    "Yes, I would recommend HSHM 215. It's a fun course that'll make you feel like you're learning a lot about American history.",
    "I would recommend this class. It covers a little bit of everything (with a big focus on epidemics and civil rights medicine), and the lectures and readings are interesting. The workload is pretty straight forward.",
    "great class!",
    "History 140 contains knowledge applicable to everyone's life. If you live in America you deal everyday with products that have been subject to FDA and EPA controversies over the past 30 years, and you should know how these come about.",
    "The classgives you a good into. to the history of public health, covering all the main topics and giving ample historical context necessary to understanding the health situation. As it is an overview, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to get to in-depth with any topics. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essentially a history class, so you memorize dates, names, and terms for exams (which was somewhat annoying although not hard for a science major). The class isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work intensive at all. Readings were also really enjoyable \u00e2\u0080\u0093 largely things like NYT articles, I often read them as breaks from problem sets (this was my one non-chemistry class). Lectures were also enjoyable, and Prof. Rogers is good at telling the story of public health history. If you have Jenna as a TA, be happy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she gives a good section.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a solid andengaging overview of public health in America. The midterm and final require a lot of studying, but it is also manageable. (Comforting to me was that if you do the work, it will definitely pay off - the same cannot be said of the midterm\/final evaluations for many other classes I have taken here.) The section for the class was also the best I've had at Yale, though that of course is specific to the TA. A decent amount of reading, but you don't have to do it all as long as you're well-versed enough to contribute to section discussions.The paper is on basically anything you want within public health in the U.S. Pick something you're genuinely enthused about and then if you get a thesis and outline done ahead of time and run them by your TA, it should not be too complicated to write the entire paper from there. The ten pages go by pretty quickly.Professor Rogers' lectures are pretty fast-paced, but also engaging. I've never been that enthused about history, but I think public health as a lens is incredibly fascinating. So yes, take this class!",
    "The material is very interesting, and the class itself is not too much work - midterm, final, one paper and weekly section. Unfortunately, since the material in lecture is presented as a string of stories, people and dates that never gets tied or compared from one class to another, a lot of the work in understanding and digesting the material has to happen on your own or in section.TA quality is variable and my TA for this course was incompetent. With a good TA and hopefully more effort from Prof. Rogers to connect the material across historical periods, this class should be very good.",
    "This class was a waste of time. It was just a regurgitation of facts that you can look up on Wikipedia. The professor was boring and lackluster and made the exam grading way more difficult than it should haven been for such a low caliber course. If you are interested in taking this course because you like the material presented, just read up on it yourself--don't waste time taking this course. Definitely not worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in domestic public health. The first part of the semester can be slow to those interested in current policy, but it is important to understand the public health foundations, and the rest of the semester picks up. Overall the course is really quite enjoyable and the workload is manageable. Professor Rogers is really phenomenal and probably knows more about the subject matter than anyone you could find.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in public health. I would recommend taking advantage of office hours, especially when working on the term paper. The workload is manageable for the most part and the weekly readings are very interesting. The lectures are very fast-paced so it is important to do some research on your own in order to fully understand the information.",
    "Great material. But the professor is flighty. Like, you'll feel lost and confused during class, before class, and after class.",
    "Covers variety of topics. Not too much work, just a lot of reading!",
    "Good survey course",
    "Yes I highly recommend this if you have any interest in public health. It's a fantastic introductory course! It really shows you the entire history of public health in America from all perspectives in history. As long as you go to lecture, do the reading, and study it's a fair class! There is only a midterm, paper, and final. So it's really important that you go to lecture and actually study (which is a lot of memorization). Though the workload is light (weekly reading) it's hard to bank on only three grades for the entire class. Public health people take this!",
    "Interesting material and lectures. Helpful to be a fast notetaker because the professor speaks and clicks through ppt slides very quickly. Reasonable workload: midterm, final (requires lots of date memorization which can be tedious), weekly readings and discussion section, and 10 page research paper on a topic of your choice.",
    "Material is very interesting, but nothing too exciting about the class or professor. None of the slides get posted, so take good notes.",
    "Yes! It's a great overview - more comprehensive than media and medicine or any other HSHM class I've taken.",
    "HSHM 215 (Pubic Health in America) is a fabulous introduction to a vast array of public health issues in the past few centuries. The lectures are very interesting, though the pace is extremely fast (it's difficult to type notes, and almost impossible to take hand-written notes!) The work is manageable: there was a midterm, a final, and a research paper. The weekly readings are interesting. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Beware: a majority of your grade in this course (70%) is determined by a paper and a final that both occur during finals period. Make sure you have ample time to work on\/study for both.",
    "Take it if you want an overview of Public Health in America. You definitely learn some interesting things, however, it's not the most engaging lecture and the TAs grade very harshly on exams.",
    "I had high expectations for his course and I am sorry to say that I was very disappointed and cannot say that I would recommend this course to another student. The topics and lectures were very interesting but section, the exams and the paper were frustrating and I don't feel that I was adequately prepared or advised during any of it.",
    "Really interesting subject material. Take it. It's easy to get away with not attending lectures or reading, but I wish I had resisted that urge more. It sucks though that like 70% of the final grade comes in the last two weeks of the semester.",
    "If you have taken other HSHM courses that covered some of the materials on the syllabus, I would not recommend it. This class proved to be an exercise in memorization and writing notes at a sprint rather than engaging with the concepts at any depth.",
    "Great class. Learn a lot. A lot of material. Not a gut if you are a science major looking for a humanities credit, but really helpful for premeds wishing to learn more about medicine from a historical perspective.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you like spending your tuition money on a soporific posing as a lecture course. It's probably one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. The instructor seems to be fighting its reputation as a gut by making the class grading extremely tough, without making the material any more interesting. Professor Rogers doesn't post her slides, so you are forced to attend a lecture that lacks any sort of panache, but is essentially the content you'd get if you read a wikipedia article on the given topic. Section, while not having any requirements, is super boring. And a ten-page paper is 40% of your grade; in real history classes, you at least get 20-25 pages to make an argument if it's worth that much of the grade. This course needs to be seriously redone in order to have any value... it puts the \"oy vey\" in \"survey course.\"",
    "Series of lectures that follows the progression of public health in America from the late 19th century to the 21st century. Lectures twice per week and section once per week. 1 midterm, 1 final, 1 10 page research paper due right before the final. I would recommend the course.",
    "Only if you are interested in public health. Not that great.",
    "This was a solid course which provided a good overview of public health in America. Be forewarned that there is a lot of information here, some not even related to public health, but if you put in the time, it can be a rewarding experience. Professor Rogers also talks very fast, and most of the information comes from the lecture, so be prepared to always come to class and write like mad when you're there.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who likes either public health, American history, or both. There were a lot of HSHM and biology majors in my section, but I think anyone can benefit from taking this course.",
    "Very interesting if you like history and\/or public health. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class! Each lecture was very insightful, and covered a lot of material. The readings were very manageable. I learned a whole side to American History!",
    "This course is alright. Make sure you get a good TA though."
