   "comments": [
    "Greek 120 is a demanding and time-consuming, but ultimately rewarding course. The beginning of the semester moves quickly through increasingly complex rules and exceptions within Greek grammar, and new endings and vocabulary accumulate very quickly. Greek 120's main weakness (in my opinion) was the infrequency of testing. During Greek 110, there was 2-3 short quizzes every week, and I felt that this helped me stay on task and reinforce what I was learning. With quizzes less than once a week, I found that I often forgot material that I might have otherwise remembered if I were tested on it sooner. However, Greek 120's strength is the remarkable pace and confidence with which we were able to read Plato's Apology. Of course moving on to a real Ancient Greek text was challenging, it is remarkable that we were able to start understanding an original text after only about 6 months of learning the language. Overall, Ancient Greek is definitely not an easy language credit. But if you are interested in the Classics, then this should be a highly rewarding experience for you.",
    "I wouldn't take it unless you are really interested in the language and classics in general.",
    "I would recommend it to any student taking ancient greek. It's a fairly straight forward classical language class.",
    "Take this class! It's likely to be small and active and reading a real text so soon is incredible.",
    "I would recommend this course to all pursuing the Classics. Hard work but ultimately worth it. The small class size can make it stressful as the student must always be accountable for the material. The joy of reading real Greek is worth it.",
    "Learning Attic Greek simply isn't for everyone. If you are just looking for your language credit and want to get out as easy as possible, this isn't for you. If you like speaking a language and don't much care for grammar, this isn't for you. If you can't enjoy nerdy pleasures of etymology, this class may not be for you (though that's less critical). However, the fact that Attic Greek isn't for everyone is in a way one of the best parts of the course. You meet in a small class of people who care enough about Greek to take a harder road and learn a dead language. I was not self-conscious about caring about what we were doing. People would volunteer to try passages that were hard just for the challenge of it. It was a class where you could laugh at Plato, commiserate over vocabulary quizzes, and learn a lot. The progress I made in this semester, to be able to read Plato on my own by the end of the semester, was really exciting and gratifying. So if you like languages, if you are interested in anything from Plato to Herodotus to the Bible's original text, you can do it here. This is one of those rare Yale opportunities if you are interested, and I'm glad I could take advantage personally."
