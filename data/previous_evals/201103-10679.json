   "comments": [
    "The portions of this most relevant to my research specifically were Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics. While Lagrangians were covered very well, Hamiltonian dynamics, which came at the end of the semester, felt rushed. In terms of direct usefulness, I would rather have spent more time on that material and less time on, for example, central forces or rigid body motion."
