    "This class gives great insights into Japanese economic history since WWII - a must for any aspiring macro-analyst, or even just for someone looking to improve your general understanding of global economics. You also learn how to compare and contrast economies in terms of macro-policy, which is always a useful skill.",
    "I learned an immense about Japan's economy, the US economy, and broader macro trends over the past several decades. I learned how to do 'forensic macro' which tries to identify trends, using data, in messy situations involving entire economies. I learned how to write 'editorial-style' papers, something I have not learned to do in any of my other yale classes. I learned how to make and give a presentation.",
    "Great applied macroeconomics skills",
    "I learned a lot about economic problems in Japan since 1990 and its relevance to current economic issues in the world.",
    "The key lesson of this course is how to conduct forensic macroeconomic research; we analyze what happened in Japan and try to apply those lessons to other economies, which is very useful.",
    "Macroeconomic prowess",
    "The topic of this class is \"forensic macroeconomics\", which uses data-based storytelling to uncover sources of problems in macroeconomies and financial systems. We used a lot of different data analytics, chartbuilding, news watching and some accounting tools (ratios, valuations, etc.) in the course.",

   "comments": [
    "The homework op-ed assignments were engaging and very useful - it forces you to think about both sides of an issue thoroughly.",
    "This course is incredibly well structured. The *only* things I would change are: (1) putting presentations before class discussion. (2) getting a little bit more background on Japan at the very beginning - we kind of jump right in with Rosenbluth.",
    "The lecture and discussion in class are the best parts, and the readings and students presentations are very informative and interesting. It would be better if we can have more time to discuss in class.",
    "-Would love more Macro in the News-style sections of the seminar at the beginning of each class a la Debates in Macro -Presentations should come before Prof. Roach's lecture -More time for in-class debate would be great",
    "The strengths of this class are the in-depth knowledge you learn about the macroeconomic conditions that can cause crises in an economy. I'd say in-depth knowledge has a tradeoff with the amount that Professor Roach lectures. I wish we got more time to focus on discussion.",
    "Great course. More courses like this should be offered by the department!",
    "Strengths: we do a deep dive into the subject matter and draw from a variety of sources in conducting analysis. Weaknesses: course can definitely run at a faster pace than it did.2",
    "If you are even remotely interested in macroeconomic analysis and the current challenges of macroeconomic policies across major world's economies, definitely give it a try with getting into this course. It was a really unique opportunity to be able to learn from Professor Roach's experience in a seminar setting. He is an engaging lecturer, a very skilled discussion leader and a caring professor who greatly respects every student's opinion. Even though I had almost no knowledge of Japanese macroeconomics coming into the course, I really enjoyed all of the readings, assignments and thought-provoking discussions, and feel like I came out of the course with a much better ability to compare the failures and successes of macroeconomic policies across developed economies."

    "Fairly interesting class that uses the Japan case study as a frame work for applied macro. Nothing groundbreaking. Fairly long and tedious student presentation every class. It would be better if Professor Roach taught\/facilitated the discussion since he is very knowledgeable than if half of every class was spent learning from other 20 year old college students. Also, don't underestimate the workload. Seems like just one final paper, but there are two other four page papers (double spaced), a long presentation, a five page paper proposal and weekly reading responses.",
    "Yes, take this class if you're looking for a economics class that isn't too technical but still has some very relevant economic policy lessons.",
    "This is by far the most excellent and well-structured economics course st Yale.",
    "An incredibly well structured class. You begin with discussions about Japan, and by the second half of the course you move on to the US and global economies. Roach does a fantastic job structuring the course: every class is split into a third student presentations, a third teacher presentation (i.e. his own analysis), and a third seminar style discussion. Homeworks are WSJ-style \"editorials,\" but ones that must be backed up with facts and data. Homework is not at all burdensome, and makes for some really interesting reading -- a good combo of editorials, news pieces, and econ research. I've always lamented the fact that at Yale, the econ department spends a lot of time teaching concepts\/models, but almost no time applying those models. If you want to be able to speak, read, write about the global economy with facility, this is the class to take. Roach is a fantastic teacher - a quick grader with clear comments, and an appreciation for fact-based arguments. You may not always agree with him, but he's great to learn from.",
    "Yes. This class connects economics knowledge to the real world very well. It lays a great importance on political economy. It is a great for global affairs students who are interested in both the economic and political aspects of world macroeconomy.",
    "This is a great class and well worth taking. You go through what went wrong in the Japanese economy both before and during the Lost Decade, and then apply those lessons to the EU and the US. Half of class time is spent on a student presentation and a bit of in-class debate about the economic themes of the week's lesson, and the other half is spent listening to Prof. Roach lecture. This year we had a Bank of Japan official also come and speak to us. Prof. Roach does a good job of admitting folks who are smart and interesting, and the Workload is pretty light: two 2-page homework assignments and a final 20 page paper (5 page proposal by midterm). You also get pretty in-depth feedback about your papers, which is cool. If you liked Debates in Macro, definitely take this class (and if you haven't taken Debates, take that too!). Highly recommend it for seniors and juniors alike.",
    "Great course. Professor Roach really puts a lot of work into the class and really cares about his student. He gives great feedback on papers and has some super interesting things to say that you won't here in other economics classes.",
    "Professor Roach is one of the realest professors. Take this course to better understand the world",
    "This class is an awesome experience. The Japanese narrative is really worth studying especially considering current US economics and Professor Roach is a really great guiding hand and is accountable to students and generally provides clear guidance. The only gripe I had was that I thought the class could be faster-paced, and challenge the students a little more.",
    "Definitely take this class! It's one of the best senior seminars that the Econ department offersyou won't regret it."
