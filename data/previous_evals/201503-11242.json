   "comments": [
    "Great survey course that draws from contemporary and historical anthropology, and introduces students to the methods and ideas at the core of the discipline. A really enjoyable class for those with no interest or serious commitment to anthropology.",
    "Anthropology 110, or introduction to cultural anthropology, largely studies African cultures in comparison to the United States. The readings are very interesting and very manageable with time. It's a fairly small lecture class, which made for a much more personal environment. I felt much more connected to the class than I expected and genuinely enjoyed coming to class. Professor Lombard is a great lecturer and I never found myself dozing off in class. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, as the readings are interesting and I feel that I gained a lot from the class. I'm more knowledgeable about the rest of the world and about the basis of anthropology. The class has encouraged me to keep more of an open mind about others and about the world around me.",
    "I would summarize Anth 110 as a way to open your mind! I would definitely recommend it to fellow students who are not only interested in social sciences but anyone who is curious about the study of culture and the study of humans. As a relatively modern discipline, I think it is important for as many students as possible to learn about what anthropology is and how it relates to the world.",
    "This is a good class if you are looking for a 5th course. Not a lot of work and not very hard to follow. The readings are actually pretty interesting and lecture is good. The tests aren't that hard if you pay attention in lecture and do the reading.",
    "Life-changing. Incredibly engaging. Not to mention super manageable workload. In the first lecture, Professor Lombard says that you should take the class because anthropology will make you NEVER BORED AGAIN. And it was prescient. You will learn about cultures and ways to think about the world that will carry with you for the rest of your life.",
    "I would recommend the class.",
    "I have a much deeper appreciation for people, culture, and social traditions as a result of this class, and I feel like everyone should take an introductory anthropology class. I really enjoyed learning about different types of ethnography, how social relationships are built across different cultures, structures of power, and globalization in just one class, and I feel like it has given me the tools to analyze my own experiences more critically. Also, the five ethnographic assignments we did were so much fun! Everything was very low pressure and I felt like I could learn without stressing about my grades.",
    "This is an introduction course to the field of anthropology. The course starts with the founders of anthropology and progresses to discuss different types of modern anthropology and the different styles of ethnographic studies. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone because I think many people do not know what exactly anthropology is, and this course definitely breaks down the abstract. Also, I think that everyone can benefit from learning about people and different cultures worldwide.",
    "A decent intro to anthropology class! I enjoyed doing all the assignments. As someone who took more advanced anthro courses prior to this class, I found the course, at times, a bit broad and light, but that is the nature of the course. That being said, it is a great intro course to get the feel of anthropology. If your interest is piqued by this course (or if you're interested in anthropology at all), i also recommend taking seminars.",
    "Solid intro to cultural anthropology. I feel like I understand anthropology as a discipline more (which I wanted, as an HSHM major\/ global health fellow), but not necessarily that I know a lot more facts or anything like that. In a lot of ways, anthropology is a method and an attitude, and you can pick that up from this class. 5 short assignments and two tests, so the workload isn't crazy.",
    "Much of the time, it felt more like we were learning more about what anthropology is than about anthropology itself. Over the semester, there were many salient and currently relevant anthropological themes, theories, and debates we touched upon but didn't really dissect and explore in very deep or meaningful ways. The lectures weren't super organized and the style wasn't consistent. We'd never really be sure what the format of the lecture would be (e.g. Prezi or not, whether the lectures would be about readings or new content, etc.) Nonetheless, Professor Lombard is a strong, articulate, and expressive lecturer. Staying attentive during lecture was never really an issue for me. The writing assignments aren't too much work and you can have some fun with them. Overall, I'd recommend taking this course if you're at all interested in what the field of anthropology is about.",
    "This is a very interesting course giving you an overview of Cultural Anthropology and an exposure to the different questions Anthropology tries to answer and explore. Very interesting course even for non majors.",
    "Good intro anthro class. The lectures aren't particularly interesting, but the assignments are fantastic and the readings are really interesting. Gives you a pretty good idea of a lot of famous early anthropologists and the emergence of the field.",
    "This is a course to take if you're interested in learning about what anthropology is exactly. It's also very helpful in learning more about Yale as a culture, as it makes you see Yale through an anthropologist's eyes. It was fascinating and you definitely learn more about humans in general. This is a good class to take if you have an empty slot to fill and want to learn about something fun and interesting!",
    "I would definitely recommend ANTH 110 to freshmen, as well as to upperclassmen who may or may not be interested in anthropology, you learn skills that can be applied elsewhere.",
    "An easy and sometimes boring introduction into cultural Anthropology.",
    "yes. Nice easy social science credit.",
    "This is an interesting and very doable class with a kind, engaged professor who really cares about the subject and its relevance to our lives. Make sure to do your readings on time because there are a LOT of them, and it's difficult to catch up once you fall behind. Be prepared to learn a lot of cool things!",
    "The Workload - Let's be honest. All of us immediately want to know how much time and energy a class will demand of us. The bulk of the work in this class comes from readings that are relevant to each lecture and 5 assignments throughout the semester that are basically writing about cultural phenomena you observe on the Yale campus. These assignments are easy and even fun as long as you don't wait until 2 hours before the deadline. The readings can be long at times but they are enjoyable and you don't really even have to do them as long as you pay close attention in lecture. So, if you do readings, expect to spend about 6 hours per week. Every other week, add an extra 3-4 hours for an assignment. The Lecture - Professor Lombard is really into what she does. She studies war, violence and conflict in the Central African Republic. Really cool stuff. One downside was that lectures felt a little rehearsed because she referred to lecture notes often. This got better as the semester went on. She also brought in guest lecturers who are applying anthropology in their lives. Also a perk, lectures are only 50 minutes and fly by. The Grading - There are 5 assignments, discussion section participation, and two half-semester exams. Assignments are easy as long as you do what they actually ask. Discussion sections are engaging given that you at least know something about the readings. The two exams (both in-class) are easy as long as you have been paying attention in lecture, taking decent notes and maybe skimming readings. To study, I recommend going through the syllabus with the readings, memorizing the reading name and author, and jotting down a few main ideas. Very easy grading if you follow these. Why Take It? - Take it if you are an anthropology major, if you want to be exposed to parts of the world and worldviews that you did not know existed, if you want an intro to the amazing world of anthropology, or even if you just want to see what it's all about.",
    "A good introductory course to help you figure out what interests you in anthropology and similar fields.",
    "Easy workload for the most part. All the homeworks that you have to do are easy assignments that you can do in a day",
    "I think this class is important to any student that wishes to be an active global citizen once they graduate, and would therefore recommend it to anyone. This class supplies students with the tools with which to understand the greater world's many lively cultures and to thus understand how one fits into them all. This class teaches thoughts and skills that are valuable for any profession in this dynamic and ever-changing world."
