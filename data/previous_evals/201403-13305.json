   "comments": [
    "Take it! This was a great course! Rachel was a caring instructor, the readings were interesting and of the appropriate amount\/level, and the assignments made sense. Good discussions.",
    "The course covers major pollution issues, mostly in the US and western Europe, from roughly the early-to-mid 19th century through the present. The topics are varied, from coal smoke, to occupational health, to radioactive fallout, to global warming, but each week is compelling. The course requires a lot of reading, and a final paper that requires in-depth primary research. If you're interested in the topic, or in getting a better grasp on history or history of science methods, then absolutely take the course. It's rigorous, but the work pays off.",
    "I would take this course. It's something to be familiar with, super relevant to a variety of academic interests as well as political issues going on today, and is overall really interesting.",
    "Yes! It is super interesting if you are into this topic. Rachel is amazing and the load isn't too too bad because it is so interesting.",
    "It was a great way to learn about pollution and pollution policy beginning with the Industrial Revolution and ending on Global Warming. It is more theory heavy and heavy in the political dealings than the actual science, especially in the second half of the course.",
    "This is a class worth taking if you have room in your schedule. It isn't super applicable to today's environmental issues, but does provide you with an excellent historical background.",
    "The course takes more time than other HSHM courses to look at the difference between history of science and environmental history methodological approaches."
