   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student seeking understanding of the intersection of contemporary American culture and the embodied experience of individuals in that culture.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course to another student with interest in policy history, or feminist\/intersectional histories. Great intro to some key texts in the field, and a good way to grasp the way that questions in those fields are being structured and investigated.",
    "A thought-provoking class that shows health policy should be a required topic for anyone doing US history. I would absolutely recommend it, not only to people interested in the history of medicine, but histories of race and gender, as well.",
    "Other student: \"Should I take this course?\" Me: \"Do you have a body?\" Other student: \"Yes.\" Me: \"You have your answer.\" Seriously though, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding perceptions of the body, how they have changed over time, and how they are different in different contexts. The readings covered many fields, but prioritized an historical approach. It could be useful for anyone.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I believe the books covered change each semester, but I am positive that the quality of the course will remain consistently spectacular."

   "comments": [
    "This course generated many ideas for future research, as well as endless reading lists!",
    "This course is quite relevant to my own research, and also helped me to think about the structure of the writing I hope to produce in the future.",
    "Much of this course was somewhat out of my temporal focus, but I still felt like the conceptual issues were broadly applicable, and I have a much better understanding of health policy (I never thought I would get so excited about policy) after taking this course. This course solidified my suspicion that I should pursue further research related to the history of medicine and the body. I have also become very interested in disability studies as a result of this class.",
    "I hadn't known before taking this class that I was interested in medical history, but I now know that I would do a great disservice to my project if I didn't not address the historical aspects of the topic. This was a very rewarding course."
