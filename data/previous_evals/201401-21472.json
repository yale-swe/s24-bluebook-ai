    "Absolutely outstanding course! Interesting, challenging, engaging, with a wonderful reading list. You read everything from classic poetry to touching children's books to insightful criticism. The work-load is not too onerous, and Prof. Stepto is a wonderful instructor!",
    "AFAM 423 is a lovely class. You get to take a step back from hardcore analyzing text or art, and instead see them side-by-side as what they are. For several classes, you'll be in libraries or galleries just looking at art. For a class that doesn't emphasize conventional analysis, the first assignment feels quite independent (a typical essay) and I don't think students should feel like they need to prove they can write a good essay. The students who should take this class are interested in book art, representing race\/ethnicity, and their own creativity. A huge draw of the class is the opportunity to pursue your own creative project for the second\/third assignments (or you can do a research project, engaging with primary documents and delving into a specific artist or movement)\u2014and in a noncritical space. Although I liked that the class wasn't a workshop, I would've loved to hear informal updates from my peers on their projects throughout the semester.",
    "A study of the African American book and its contributing artists. I definitely recommend it",
    "Definitely take it!"
