   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Reading harder texts, critical analysis, analysis of \"science,\" historical analysis, theoretical writing, open discussion and dialogue",
    "Wow. I have learned more than I can really express in this class. But in short, this class opened my mind to how complex the idea and discourse of sexuality is, while simultaneously helping me to develop into a more detailed and descriptive writer.",
    "I learned how to critically read all kinds of sources (theory,science papers, archives) and connect different concepts together.",
    "I gained the ability to think critically about scientific tests and studies, which is especially useful because my academic focus is not particularly science oriented.",
    "I learned how to write three different types of paper, how to write effectively (with stronger words in less convoluted sentences), and about the different methods and theories that people have had to explain sexuality.",
    "This course was really helpful in learning how to analyze and really deconstruct hard pieces of literature. It helped us realize the subjectivity in science and the ways we have to constantly be aware of bias.",
    "I developed writing skills for various types of papers. My knowledge on sexuality has broadened and my interest in this subject has increased.",
    "Analyzing history, theory, philosophy, gender studies, anthropology, and everything in between. This course covered so much. The three papers (on primary source, theory, and archival material) taught me a lot about different types of writing.",
    "This class really taught me how to handle difficult texts without feeling overwhelmed. It also developed my skills when it came to writing original essays based on my interpretation of archival materials (something I recommend everyone do). As for the topic of sexuality, I learned that there is no right or wrong answer. In fact, there is no answer. This class taught me how to acknowledge and internalize that while consonantly questioning my own thoughts.",
    "I learned how to analysis historical and current scientific texts. I learned how to write a primary source paper, a theory paper, and an archives paper. I also learned how to better use Yale resources.",
    "In this course, I learned a lot about how people have interpreted sexuality in western culture throughout a few centuries, and how science is not a definitive field of study, but rather continues to evolve over time. History of Sexuality taught me that our conceptions of sex, gender, and sexuality AND our scientific beliefs are not set in stone -- they are likely to change over time, even when we think they are correct. Additionally, both science and interpretations of sexuality are largely reflective of the societies in which they're found and can hint at the priorities and the beliefs of the time. I feel that the skills that I practiced in this course will be useful in many fields of study. I practiced essay writing skills, such as writing strong introductions, topic sentences, theses, and concluding paragraphs. We also practiced how to edit a paper after we were finished with it. This practice was very helpful. We also learned how to write different types of papers, such as primary source papers and archive papers. I had never done any type of archival research before, and learning how to in this class was extremely useful. I feel like I have a great grasp of finding archives and choosing elements to use in a paper, which I hope will continue to help me during the rest of my Yale career. From writing, to reading, to discussions, to research, I feel that History of Sexuality was the most interesting AND useful course that I've taken at Yale. I am so happy that I took this course, and I feel that I can't completely communicate all the skills and insights that I learned from it, because there were just so many."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course seemed daunting at first, but was so super accessible. The environment really facilitated comfort and participation from everyone, and the conversations that we had in every class, large group or small group, were all insightful and thought provoking. I definitely think about the concepts we encountered even outside of class now. As indicated by the feedback people gave in our last class, this was truly a great freshman seminar experience. Weakness? Maybe I wanted more inclusion of actual history. A more spelled out indication of other historical movements or what developments had occurred in between the time gaps in our reading would have been nice so things weren't just open to interpretation.",
    "All I see are strengths. Professor Trumpler leads us while still allowing us to control our conversations and come up with well-thought-out opinions about the topics we study. That is the class' largest strength: the amount of freedom we have in discussion with each other.",
    "The readings were very well selected and the essays really helped me interact with the material.",
    "An weakness is that at times the course material is. it engaging, and I would fix this by including more contemporary references to help the course feel a little more relatable. Other than that the course was very strong.",
    "A strength is that in this seminar, everybody was able to speak and take part in the discussion.",
    "I loved the go-a-rounds we did the beginning of each class because it gave us a chance to all share our opinions and made everyone speak without any pressure. We read incredibly interesting texts and got to talk about subject matter that is normally not discussed in an intellectual context. While for the most part this wasn't a problem, sometimes I felt that the professor was steering us towards certain topics and didn't let the conversation flow completely freely.",
    "My biggest weakness coming into this course was my lack of exposure to discussing sexuality. I think Professor Trumpler did a great job organizing discussions.",
    "I wish there were more group-work\/small group discussion. Other than that it was a very well-planned and well-thought out course.",
    "The biggest strength was the class size because it made it personal. Professor Trumpler also has every student in every class give their thoughts on the readings and it really creates a safe environment in which everyone participates. As for the weaknesses, sometimes I wish we could have talked about sexuality in the context of completely different cultures rather than just based on Western ideals.",
    "I loved how the class was based on peer-to-peer discussion. The readings were all very interesting.",
    "I really loved the diversity of the readings and the assignments. It was very helpful for me to practice writing different types of essays and reading different types of material, because I feel like I'll be able to continue using these skills in the future. I also loved the amount of time we had to discuss each reading. It was really nice to focus each discussion on only one or two texts instead of many, because it meant we were able to deeply analyze the text. I understood the material much better after discussions, so I think they were very helpful."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "This course was, hands down, the best course I took in the entirety of freshman year; I would recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in the study of sexuality. The course is very discussion-based and you may not arrive at concrete conclusions most of the time, but the material is extremely thought-provoking and Professor Trumpler is a great facilitator. The readings are pretty dense and the essays are difficult in terms of understanding the material well enough to write about it, so be prepared to put in the effort. It's well worth it though!",
    "Most certainly this class won't be what you expect it to be. This can be interpreted a lot of different ways for different people, but nevertheless, I ensure that you'll learn a lot about the material, about yourself, and about how learning can actually take form.",
    "Yes! I learned so much about sexuality from this class, but I also learned about my own perception and biases and realized that an concept as complex as sexuality can never be fully explained or quantified, and that is totally ok.",
    "Definitely take this course! The readings and discussions are so interesting and the assignments really help you think about sexuality in which a different way. The teacher is also so engaging and caring.",
    "I would - it's a good way to get a writing credit and a good way to be introduced into how to analyze scientific texts and studies.",
    "I would recommend this course because of it's interesting subject matter and because of the instructor.",
    "Yes definitely! It was incredibly interesting and we read amazing texts and for to freely discuss and really learn from our classmates. It taught us to read with a critical eye and appreciate the difficulties of science",
    "Would most definitely recommend this course to another student. The professor and learning material are both top notch.",
    "Please take this class. Specially in today's era, this topic should be in everyone's mind as we try to become more inclusive and acceptant. A part of getting there is actually understanding the theories of sexuality already out there that have shaped the way we view it today. This class is great for people who are willing to be open to challenging their own beliefs.",
    "Definitely. This was easily my favorite class from this year. The class is very discussion based, so be prepared to do the readings and have something to say about them. Professor Trumpler does a great job of making sure you come away with a grasp of the materials and confidence in your own ability to analysis scientific texts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material was extremely interesting, and we develop many reading, writing, and discussion skills along the way. Professor Trumpler is very engaging and really allows everyone to voice their thoughts during discussion. I learned so much during this class."
