   "comments": [
    "Greater grasp of Chinese",
    "A LOT of higher level political and economic vocabulary that may or may not be useful in my everyday life. Learned how to memorize a lot of characters and make fine distinctions between similar grammar patterns. Also learned that Chinese is very much an idiomatic language that you need to learn just by talking\/learning from a native speaker.",
    "Through taking this course, I improved my Chinese language skills in speaking, listening, and writing. Since I was on the Heritage track, I was able to gain all of these skills while exploring the complex and incredibly interesting social, political, and economic history of China!",
    "An upper-midlevel Chinese course. More focus on technical Chinese, elevated expressions, more abstract vocabulary.",
    "I surpassed simple conversational Chinese to learn much more sophisticated grammar structures and vocabulary. My speaking skills also improved as well as my accent.",
    "This class was definitely my favorite class in my entire freshman year. Aside from getting better at speaking Chinese, reading Chinese, and writing Chinese characters, I was able to build strong relationships with friends who came from similar backgrounds as I did and to be able to interact with a teacher who really did care about my learning and life outside of the classroom. I was able to practice my communication skills and presentation skills in class while I explored more of my cultural background with others who had similar backgrounds.",
    "I learned a lot of Chinese characters as well as grammar. In addition to the language, I also learned a lot about Chinese culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class was great in allowing the students to practice Chinese both in writing and in speaking, but I believe that more grammar-related assignments from outside the textbook would have helped reinforce grammar concepts more effectively. Only doing grammar drills in class and doing the textbook homework assignments meant that old grammar could be forgotten easily.",
    "Well-organized; why does an A have to be a 95%, instead of standard 93%?",
    "Consistently heavy workload, but learned a lot and received very good feedback. The teachers invest a lot of effort into making the course as involved as possible.",
    "The course has many strengths and very few weaknesses! I felt that the course really pushed me to improve, which I really appreciate! Every class was well-structured--sometimes we went over the grammar points, other days we had discussions--and I felt like it was a wonderful balance. One weakness is that sometimes the classes can seem a bit repetitive since we are going over the same grammar points, but sometimes it helps to see them at least once to really understand them.",
    "The course sometimes emphasizes reading over drilling of new grammatical concepts and phrases. Sometimes nuances are not particularly well-emphasized, which is problematic since this constitutes the crux of the content for this course.",
    "The strengths of this course is the daily quizzes, which kept me on track with learning all the vocabulary. The discussion days were also very helpful. I also really liked the essays and oral exams because I was able to apply what I learned in a more challenging and elaborate way. The weakness of this course is probably that certain people are called on more than others so certain people aren't allowed to speak as much.",
    "The strengths of this course is definitely the small class size and sense of community with students across the three sections in the course. I really enjoyed getting to know my classmates and looking forward to interacting with them and discussing the day's lesson with them in class. Another strength of the course is definitely the amazing professor in Professor Liu who is as caring as anyone can be. I always looked forward to coming to class because I knew that I would be in a good mood leaving the class. A weakness of the course is that the amount of material could be a little intimidating at times. Particularly prepping for final exams, it was difficult memorizing so much material in such a short amount of time. However, I understand that this was more of a fault on my end in not preparing enough for the exam rather than the course itself. I think have more time for review sessions over grammar and dictation mistakes that students oftentimes get wrong will be helpful in resolving this issue.",
    "Strengths of this class is that the discussions are interesting and pertain to topics we as students would be interested in. Also, the professor and teaching fellows were very nice and willing to help us whenever we asked."

    "This class is fantastic! It's a essentially continuation of 132, which means daily homework, daily character quizzes, oral presentations, and chapter exams. As with 132, my Chinese improved leaps and bounds from all the constant daily practice. Both Liu Laoshi and Chen Laoshi are great at engaging with the class and making sure everyone has a chance to participate. The subject matter of the textbook changes drastically, with 132 being focused mostly on daily life, and 142 being focused on politics and problems in society. Makes way for some interesting discussions! Tutoring is also fun to go to, essentially you're just sitting down with a grad student and talking about the class material. But really it's just a casual conversation, and you can talk about anything you want. Definitely take this class if you're looking for a rigorous but rewarding language course!",
    "If willing to do Chinese work every night",
    "Yes. Challenging, but necessary to take the next step in Chinese ability.",
    "I loved Chinese class! Liu Laoshi is super sweet and cares a lot about her students. Unlike Chinese 132, Chinese 142 involves a lot more discussion but in a very low-pressure environment. We talked about everything from China's economic development to the lives of senior citizens and were able to share our own viewpoints on the subjects. Even if you are an introverted person like myself who gets anxious at the mention of class-wide discussion, please do not shy away from this class! The class feels very casual and is a great way to improve your Chinese.",
    "Yes, yes, yes! Take this course if you want to astronomically improve your Chinese language skills! You will meet a wonderful group of teachers and students who are all super passionate about Chinese culture!",
    "Yes.",
    "There's not much to say - you'll take this class if you took L3 or if you placed into it, and it is good at continuing what you covered in L3 heritage.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who has already learned basic Chinese. It allowed me to appreciate the Chinese language and culture so much more.",
    "Absolutely. The course load of this class is pretty high relative to other Yale courses, however, it's pretty normal relative to other language classes from what I hear. You're going to work hard in the course and you're going to reap in the benefits of your hard work. You get to explore your cultural heritage more with other students who are from a similar background while actually getting better at speaking, writing, and reading Chinese.",
    "I would recommend this to another student because in the end, it is a lot of work but you do learn a lot as well."
