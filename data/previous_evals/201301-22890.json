    "Italian 151 01 is great if you want to improve your speaking abilities and reading comprehension! Classes are mainly made up of discussions around various subjects or readings, and there are rarely assignments. Super casual, but fun and helpful!",

    "This is an excellent course as one has the chance to apply one's understanding of the Italian language in the context of translating thought provoking works. Definitely take this course with Michael Farina."
