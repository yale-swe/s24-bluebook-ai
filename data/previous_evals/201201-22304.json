    "This is a great way to learn about screenwriting by trying your hand at it. Professor Lapadula is passionate, personable, and knowledgeable, and he's a great person to get to know. Try to take this as a sophomore in case you want to follow through the progression to advanced screenwriting.",
    "The best class I've taken at Yale. If you can get into it, take it. It's worth the work.",
    "Yes take it! The midterm folder is a lot of work but it is worth it. You are forced to read a lot of screenplays, which in the end helps you write your own.",
    "Fun class, you learn important screenwriting basics. If you are interested in a career in screenwriting, learning coverage is also useful.",
    "I highly recommend it. It is a fun course, and a reasonable amount of work.",
    "An introductory screenwriting class that meets once a week. You have to meet with a group outside of class, and the members in your group are randomly assigned, but so important. If you have a group that's motivated, great; if you don't, things might get hard."
