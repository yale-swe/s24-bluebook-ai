   "comments": [
    "For a math major, this isn't too tough, but you don't learn very much from the lectures-everything is from the problem set. It might help with contest math. If you're not a math major, this class may be much harder than you expect showing up- make sure you can write a good proof.",
    "With Professor Hirn, it's a lot of following the textbook. I'd say Combinatorics (the latter half) if easier a bit more fun than Graph Theory (the first half of the course). He's kinda a dull lecturer - you have to stay motivated. That said, you don't really have to attend class because he basically follows the textbook.There's a problem set a week, totaling about %40 of your grade (and keep in mind that homeworks are usually graded by undergraduate graders who have taken the course before, so they may end up being really stingy assholes, or possibly really lenient angels). We had a take home midterm and a take home final.Work together for the psets.Overall, not terribly interesting material, a lot of it is intuitive at first then gets complicated later. Take it only if you have to - it's certainly not the easiest math class out there, but it's not the hardest either. It's definitely not a class to take if it doesn't get you somewhere in your major.",
    "The combination of a fresh-out-of-grad-school teacher and a mis-represented course make this class a living hell if you are a CS major or applied math major unfamiliar with the subject. The class is 100% theoretical...every test questions, homework response, and in class example is a proof. Furthermore, the midterm took at least 20 hours, and contained problems which required vauge connections to class material. The mean\/median on some questions was literally 1 \/ 10. Perhaps this is a shortcoming of the new teacher more than the course itself, which could improve with more experience.Despite the course being a substitute for Math 202 for CS majors, I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE anyone from taking this class unless you have to. The first week we were given a list of interesting real world problems in the class, but we failed to ever allude to anything remotely concrete. The single worst decision I've made in college (Including drinking, sex, and drugs) was by far taking this class over 202. Don't do it unless you have experience in or love Graph Theory. It's interesting, but very hard in the middle of the course. Combinatorics wasn't as bad and essentially relied on variations on a couple concepts.Avoid this class. No one should willingly choose to take it.",
    "MATH 244 is a course in graph theory and then combinatorics. This class is incredibly difficult - the material quickly becomes very hard and Prof. Hirn lectures straight out of the book. He's very meek and speaks quietly and looks at the floor a lot. The lectures recite the book, the book is terrible, and the grading is very steep. I would not ever recommend taking this class if Prof. Hirn is teaching it. He managed to take two topics I thought I loved and was very interested in and make them boring and lifeless. How can I be interested in the material if he doesn't even sound interested?",
    "This class is the most time consuming I have taken at Yale. The topics covered were interesting and the material provoking but the time commitment necessary was huge. Judging by other reviews, some professors choose graph theory or combinatorics to cover, but Hirn covered both and in depth. We will see if he backs off his hard line about a tough curve, but by the amount of work put in, everyone deserved high marks and won't necessarily get them.Also, while this class claims to not need any math background, a background in proofs would be hugely valuable as they are the base of the course.",
    "Yes. Discrete Math is just cool. The problems arise very naturally and you don't need to learn a lot of abstract machinery to understand the proofs.Matt Hirn was a very clear lecturer; he explains everything very well. That said, he moves too slowly and his lecture style is a tad pedantic.Problem sets were in the average range for a math class, definitely nowhere near daunting. Sometimes they were flat out easy. Exams were take-home and pretty long, but also interesting.",
    "Math 244 had its good points and bad points. Professor Hirn was a decent instructor, but most of his lectures were fairly boring and came straight from the book. However, the material was fairly interesting, and the problem sets were challenging but very doable.Students who are interested in the practical applications of discrete math may want to stay away from this course. The homework problems are almost all proofs of some sort, so they're more fitting for people who are interested in math for math's sake.",
    "It wasn't exactly a gut, although I had no problem destroying all the p-sets\/tests--you get out of it what you put into it. Having take-homes was nice; although they were decently long (and occasionally painstaking), I felt like I learned a lot more in the process than I would have if I'd simply had to regurgitate definitions on a one-hour midterm or three-hour final. It's a very low-pressure class. I sat in the back on my laptop and it didn't matter--Matt Hirn's lectures basically involved just writing the book on the board--and most people didn't even go to lectures. The material itself is absolutely fascinating, though. I took it partially to be prepared enough for Graphs and Networks next year.",
    "If you like proofs and all that jazz, by all means. Otherwise, no.",
    "Math majors who have taken any proof-based math class should find this class manageable but certainly not trivial. People with no prior math background will spend much more time learning standard proof techniques and conventions in addition to the math material, but the class is definitely accessible.",
    "A very interesting class. Careful of the grading though, no longer a gut class.",
    "The topics are very interesting and you learn to write proofs if you've never taken a proof based math class but the negative side is take homes take lots of time and in the end it is still impossible to get everything right after you spend 1 week on it.",
    "It completely depends on who the instructor is.",
    "This class has the potential to be a great class that isn't too difficult (see past evaluations from past years) and unless Professor Hirn is teaching it you should ignore all these reviews and shop the course because the material has the potential to be extremely interesting. This year Professor Hirn made it an extremely rigorous and unnecessarily difficult course. Also he lectured basically word for word out of the (very good) textbook so lecture was useless.The problem sets were pretty time consuming but his two take home exams were simply too difficult and time consuming given the time allowed (a lot of people spent 20+ hours on the midterm and I spent over 50 hours on the final and my solution was 35 pages long). Really that final exam ruined an otherwise ok course.",
    "The material was interesting, but the lectures were very boring - he would basically spend each class writing very involved proofs on the board, with little discussion of applications or specific problems. The problem sets were very challenging (all proof based) and with the exception of a few shorter ones mid semester, expect to spend about 10 hours on each one. So take the class if you'd like to challenge yourself\/develop your proof writing, but otherwise it wasn't a stand out.",
    "The material of this class was very interesting. The class itself was certainly not easy, even with a background in proof based math. The problem sets took a lot of time and thought. For a Math\/Applied Math major they might not seem bad but a CS major may be shocked (especially if you are taking CS323 at the same time). If you are a CS major deciding between this and 202, remember that the work load is much greater in this class. Professor Hirn seemed like a good guy, although he is a new professor and gives very dry lectures that make it hard to learn the material in class. However, it seems that Hirn will improve\/the teacher for this class seems to switch every year so this may become irrelevant.",
    "A little dry, especially the combinatorics section. The graph theory section was better.",
    "Math 244 is harder than you think it will be. It's much more than linear algebra or differential equations. You need to be ready to do some extremely difficult proofs and solve challenging problems. It's probably a bit easier than 250, but don't assume it will be that much easier.",
    "Yes, if you like math and the subject material. It's a lot of diverse topics but they are all pretty interesting."
