   "comments": [
    "A pretty standard intro class. I found it to be a bit boring- most of the material in class was just straight from the textbook, and was not presented in an interesting way. Not very hard at all, though.",
    "Never, ever take this course unless it is for your major. This is the single reason why Yale should loosen it's requirements. I was forced to take this for an Sc credit and it was the worst thing I could have ever done.",
    "I don't know that I could. Its trying to be an intro course on a subject that one needs strong proficiency in many other topics to be able to fully understand.I would not recommend this course unless this is your intended profession.",
    "No, there is hardly any math involved. The textbook is also really dry, and the professor just pulls the vast majority of his lecture slides off of the textbook anyway.",
    "Good intro course. Don't take it unless you need it for your major. There are much more interesting science credits.",
    "I would recommend this for anyone who is interested in water technology.",
    "Its a pretty easy class. Problem sets can be confusing and require a lot of outside research rather than what is learned in class. It's a good was to fulfill a science credit because it does have real world applications and doesn't require too much quantitative work.",
    "Before entering ENVE 120 with Prof Elimelech, know what youa re getting into. While the course itself is not a particularly bad course, it is by no means a traditional science credit. The questions on the problem sets are almost entirely qualitative, and some of mine totaled 7 pages of single spaced essays. Lectures are not particularly exciting, but they are survivable. Overall, the course was neither challenging nor engrossing.",
    "I probably would not recommend this course only because I think Yale has to offer at least one other course that might give a better and more interesting insight into the field of environmental engineering.",
    "I would probably not recommend this class unless the student planned to major in something that required the class. It was not interesting enough to take as a random class that is not required. Even to fill distributional requirements, I am sure you could find a more interesting class to fill a science credit. I really did not learn very much new information and the lectures were not interesting.",
    "Midterm was easy, final was trickier. Take the class if you're interested in the major. Otherwise, probably more work that you're looking for.",
    "If you need this for your major, take it. If you need a QR, you can find a better science class.",
    "I heard that the regular professor is great, but he was on sabbatical spring '11. Bottom line, DO NOT take this class if Elimelech is still teaching it. Meet him as a person, because his research and work is extremely well-known and he is great, but he is the worst professor. He read off the power points, and the homework had nothing to do with the lectures, so I literally just stopped going to class. The TAs didn't come to class once and were snooty to deal with. I don't know how the class is usually run, but the homeworks were pretty much busy work with long essays thrown in (I probably turned in more pages for this class than my Eng 120 class).",
    "Very good introduction to the topic, homework sets got really long by the end though, lots of research\/writing about current issues in environmental engineering - interesting stuff though. Midterm and final are open note and not that stressful.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. It is a great introduction to environmental engineering. Fun class that isn't too difficult.",
    "Menny is super nice and genuinely excited about environmental engineering. His focus is on water quality and water reclamation, so you will be spoon fed this information many times. I took it for the qr and sc and it wasn't that bad for someone like me who hasn't done math in five years.",
    "I should've known not to take this class when I almost fell asleep during the first lecture. I thought the content would be able to pull me through, but nope. If Menachem Elimelech is still teaching the class, please don't take it. He reads off of powerpoints that are mostly just pictures and diagrams out of the textbook. This is not a quantitative class, most of the homeworks were essay questions.Definitely not a hard course, it was actually pretty easy, just really boring.",
    "ENVE 120 was a very good overview of the environmental engineering field. We hit the major topics: water, soil, and air quality engineering and also addressed new and upcoming technologies such as novel forward osmosis process which originated at Yale. Prof. Elimelech has a great teaching style that reinforces the information you need to know. I'm not an engineering major, but this class was very interesting. The one thing to note is that the problem sets were often not so much problem sets as short essays and they took along time each week.",
    "If you like the subject matter, take it! Elimelech is wonderful, and it's really interesting. That said, if you don't care at all about the subject matter, don't take the class.I'm not a science major, but I found it fascinating to learn about water quality, drinking water, wastewater treatment, ecosystems, energy, desalination, etc. Not a hard class to do well in.",
    "The work is pretty light but the class is boring and unnecessary to attend. I personally find environmental engineering a really interesting topic but it was presented in such a blah way that I never wanted to attend lecture.",
    "the course was pretty good. it can be a little frustrating when you're a science major though because the class doesn'nt include that much math or equations. a lot of non science majors take the class (probably to get rid of a distribution requirement) and sp the class has to cater to those students too. I",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking this class (unless you want to be an EnvE major and need to take it). The class covers topics such as water quality,, water treatment, wastewater treatment, and air pollution. I am interested in environmental issues, but that is not what this class is generally about. If you want to be an environmental engineering, however, do not be discouraged by this class. I've talked to a couple of EnvE majors and they said that they too did not enjoy the intro class, but that the major gets a lot better after this.",
    "For a science student, Environmental Engineering was fairly boring. The class went at a very slow pace, and most of the material we covered was very conceptual without going into any details of the scientific processes.",
    "This course provides interesting material but it is not presented in a very engaging way. However, for those interested in environmental sciences or environmental engineering, I would recommend the course as a general survey.",
    "I'm a Poli Sci major who took this class for a Sci credit.I don't think it was especially difficult, and I think it was much more interesting than taking a gut science class. The material is fairly easy to follow because almost all the information is in the book plus the prof puts all the important information from the book on the slides and reads them basically word for word. I can see how this repetition would be aggravating for someone who's actually a science major but I think it's a very manageable intro course and a very manageable Sci credit.One problem set a week, of which less than half the problems are quantitative. A lot of the non-quantitative questions on the problem set is just busy work (summarize this article; research the processes used in your local municipal wastewater treatment plant; calculate your daily carbon footprint etc.) but not difficult to do.The midterm was graded pretty easily with immense amounts of partial credit given out, and I'm sure the same is true of the final.",
    "Definitely no! Often atrocious lectures, pointless problem sets, and nonexistent TAs. Very little that one could say positively about this one. Professor Elimelech seems like a sweet person but he just can't teach for the life of him. The textbook is horrendous. Really an embarrassment as a co-author teaches at Yale. Interesting topics in the course were few and far between. Desalination, which is Elimelech's specialty, was interesting. Most people just stopped coming to lecture after spring break. The exams were generally fair but had an undue focus on the quantitative parts of the course.The one saving grace here may be that Jordan Peccia will teach the course in the future. He's the usual instructor but was apparently on sabbatical. Rumor is he's a decent instructor.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in science or engineering. This class covers many of the most important issues facing the world in the future.",
    "Horrible.",
    "It is a good choice if you are only looking for a QR credit. Lectures are mostly from the book. The book by Julie Zimmerman is a good read.",
    "I think this could be a really interesting course if taught differently... but with Professor Elimelech, the lectures are dry powerpoint presentations and example-solving directly from the book. The problem sets are often long essays that involve searching online for obscure facts, but I definitely learned more about the environment and my personal footprint on the environment. I thought the course focused too much on water quality and water treatment, but I guess it depends on the professor (Elimelech is involved with water quality research). Also, the textbook sucks... but you won't have to use it that much thankfully. On the bright side, the three guest lectures we had were awesome.",
    "i would recommend it to another student on any environmental science track at yale, but probably not the course youre looking for if its just for fun. take this if youre a geology major too",
    "It was an okay class that didn't delve deeply into any topics except towards the end regarding reverse osmosis and desalination which are the professor's specialties. I would only recommend environmental engineering if a student really wants a really EASY course with minimal work and they don't care about the substance of the class. Really you will not learn a lot and will end up becoming apathetic about learning envioronmental engineering. But it does serve its purpose as a really easy class with minimal workload and time effort involved, though you still have to do things like weekly p-sets and a midterm and a final.",
    "This class is a really good intro class. It is interesting and not difficult. Topics covered included: desalination, water treatment, wastewater reuse, air quality, water quality etc. We had problem sets due once every 1 and a half weeks. They were actually quite heavy on the writing, rather than the quantitative side, although that could have been a function of the professor (I had Elimelech).If you think you are at all interesting in the environment then take this class! It is also a good class for people looking for a Sc\/QR credit.",
    "If you are interested in the topic of environmental engineering, then totally take this class. If you're more excited about a humanaties approach to the subject of the environment, though, steer clear-- I have a lot of friends who took this class not expecting math and chemistry, however basic it was.",
    "Avoid this class. It focuses a lot on membrane technology for water treatment to the exclusion of everything else, the lectures are impossibly dull, and the homework is basically \"teach yourself the material and then write two paragraphs about it\"",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in environmental engineering or considering it as a major. It will definitely give you a better idea of what the field is about. Anyone people taking it just for a QR credit would probably be bored out of their mind, unless they have an affinity for water treatment.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in majoring in Environmental Engineering to get a taste of the scope of the major. Be mindful that it is not as interesting as it sounds during shopping period somehow, perhaps because the way this class is taught as a lecture class makes it uninteractive and dry. If however you complete the course with your interest intact, you'll know the major is probably for you. A relatively easy Sc and QR credit to earn otherwise. The homework sets are very tedious and research-intensive, but the mid-term and final are easy.",
    "It is not very difficult but also not very engaging."
