    "Chinese 130 01 is a great class. The teaching is comprehensive. Homework and class time combine to truly teach you how to write and speak Chinese.",
    "Challenging course, but very worthwhile I would say. The textbook follows the lives of a couple alternating between chapters. You learn some useful things such as how to write a letter and important vocabulary for finding an apartment or job. As someone coming from L1-L2 last year, you are prepared for this class although you won't believe so after the first few day. You get into a rhythm after a while and the teachers are quite enjoyable. Overall, a very good class, and you do learn a lot.",
    "It required a lot of work -- due to homework and reviewing.",
    "The workload of Chinese 130 is much, MUCH more manageable than Chinese 110, and while you have work to do for Chinese every night, it's nice not to have daily quizzes. Chen and Mu Laoshi are both fantastic teachers. You might have trouble keeping up at the very beginning, but don't worry about it- it took me about a month to get back into the swing of things. If you're coming straight from Chinese 110, like I was, you won't be disappointedby this class.",
    "Yes, but just know that the class is really boring, make sure you know this if signing up for 9:20 section and you are not a morning person. But otherwise, I feel like I have learned a ton, improved in listening\/talking a bunch.",
    "YES! Great class! Take it!",
    "A lot of work but well worth it. You will learn to speak, read, write, listen Chinese better than at any other program.",
    "Yes. It's a Chinese course. If you took Chinese in high school, this is the course for you.",
    "Yes. You probably already have to take this class, so I will just tell you what to expect. 1.) you have to figure out how to study on your own -- as opposed to chinese 110\/120 class and homework alone will not get you A's on the exams. 2.) 45 minutes of homework a night -- there is only one assignment per night, as opposed to intro chinese where you could have homework and a presentation on the same day. 3.) There is a lot of direct recitation of sentences in class. It can be pretty monotonous.",
    "A fair amount of work but totally manageable, helps your Chinese a lot!",
    "L3 here is a great course. Don't underestimate it. There are about 70 to 80 characters a week, try to keep a hold on all of them. The professors are great. Use them.",
    "Chinese 130 is a difficult course. There is 1-2 hours of homework every night and you need to constantly prepare for class the next day; however, I think that all the work truly benefits and helps your Chinese by the end of the semester. I feel like my speaking, writing and listening abilities have all improved tremendously. I would definitely recommend that any student take this course, particularly with the same three teachers that I had.",
    "I would highly recommend them taking this course - my Chinese improved drastically after taking it. Enough said.",
    "Take the class, you don't really have any other options. The class is good at teaching you Chinese, even if it is frustrating at times.",
    "This was my favorite class of the day. Yes it is intense, and the format of the class is repetitive, but I actually enjoyed our lessons and my Chinese has improved tremendously. Every day there is a set lesson which is projected onto the screen with some characters missing. Then the teacher plays the recording of the lesson and the students repeat. First we go over the text of the lesson we have just read. The next day we go over the new grammar patterns, and then we go over word usage. Then we do a lesson from the online textbook, Listening and Speaking Chinese. Every night you will have about half an hour to forty-five minutes of homework. You have a multiple choice quiz on the content of the David and Helen lesson, a quiz on pinyin and meaning, online homework, a dictation (which is actually pinyin projected on the screen which you have to write in characters), an online quiz, and then an essay to write. You have a test every two weeks. And an oral test every month. I had never taken a class with oral tests before, so this was a challenge. Although this course is intense and a lot of work on a regular basis, I thought it was actually less stressful than my other courses. You can't get behind because you have to do the work every night. Also, the teachers are great, but demanding. Because the classes are so small, they definitely pay attention to each students' class participation. Take Chinese.",
    "If you test into this class freshman year, then do it. If you take Chinese L1, I recommend doing a Light Fellowship over the summer.",
    "Chinese 130 is a very straightforward class. There are patterns to both the sequence of homework and lectures in the class, which can be very boring at times. However, the instructors are great and very likeable. I felt that my Chinese improved a lot during the semester, especially when I really put in the time outside of class to practice.",
    "Coming from an intensive PKU program, and never having taken a Chinese class at Yale before, I found it difficult to adjust in the beginning. Chinese 130 is the intermediate level of Chinese- there are daily quizzes, 180 character essays, 3 tests, 3 oral tests, and listening and reading comprehension. If you want to continue Chinese, then you will obviously take this class. It shouldn't be any more difficult than 1st year. I would recommend considering the Light Fellowship after L2 instead of taking this class",
    "Chinese 130 is an enjoyable class, though it is not necessarily suited to everyone's learning style. The class focuses less on learning by practice, and more on learning by memorization and regurgitation of material. Classes consist on going through and repeating a lesson (less helpful) or going through the grammar involved in said lesson (more helpful). The exams must be conquered through brute force of memorization; the oral exams in particularare tests of patience and stamina, as you are to be recorded as you speak into a microphone.Nonetheless, the material is interesting and instructional, and the instructors are all capable and helpful. The class is not overly taxing in terms of outside work, though about an hour daily IS required at the bare minimum, and exam preparation requires more.",
    "Yes, but only if you are really committed to the language. If you are taking it just for credit or to try out chinese then you will likely get very bored since Chinese requires a lot of repetitive studying.",
    "It is just another level of Chinese, but unfortunately it can be the most boring of all levels. Since the class is only about repeating the textbook dialogues everyday, although it will improve your Chinese skill it is not necessarily the most exciting class at Yale.",
    "If you want to continue with Chinese after beginning, then you have no choice but to take it. Don't expect it to be the same format though. It's not enough to go by the teachers' daily lesson plan. If you want to retain\/learn it you're going to have to take more personal initiative to review. And do try to get into a good section (ie. with friends you can meet with outside).",
    "Unless you are truly interested in Chinese language as a gateway to undertanding Chinese spirit and culture, do not take this course. As much as the course reinforces the passion of those who were already interested in this language, it takes away that of those who hardly had any idea what Chinese is.",
    "I would recommend Chinese 130 to other students. I think it is less intensive than Chinese 110\/120.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it if you're willing to put in about an hour to an hour and a half every night, which is not too bad at all.",
    "It's the next step from 120. Tough, but well done and well taught. Keep at it; you'll see a big improvement.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is willing to put in the time and effort to learn the course material. Studying Chinese language requires alot of time outside of class. But at the end of the semester, there is great reward because students learn so much. Also, study in this course allows students to prepare for Light Fellowship\/ language study in China.",
    "If you do well in larger classes and under pressure I would recommend this course. However, if you crumble under pressure or being put on the spot in class I would definitely not take this course",
    "I would definitely recommend Chns 130 because it gives you a wider understanding of Chinese grammar in the context of Chinese culture. The professors are all very warm hearted and caring.",
    "Not as hard as Chinese 120 and 115. It's worth it whether you need the credit or you just like Chinese.",
    "It's easier than CHNS110, and subsequently, you don't learn as much. There are serious problems with the current syllabus (hopefully they'll change it by the time you take it) -- there's much less classroom interaction and much more of a (very useless) focus on memorizing the chapter texts. Homework is very centered on oral exercises, which also means that it's much less focused on translation exercises (a huge problem for my ability to internalize the material).",
    "If you want to learn how to speak Chinese, then take this course. It is challenging but definitely worth it--I got a lot out of the class and feel like I can speak much more comfortably with my Chinese friends. The workload is very manageable."
