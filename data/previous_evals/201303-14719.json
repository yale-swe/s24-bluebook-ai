    "I would highly, highly recommend this course to any graduate student or post-doc interested in teaching. Students walk away with a familiarity of the principles of scientific teaching and the means by which to apply them in their own classrooms.",
    "You learn a lot about being a good teacher. You cover active learning strategies, assessment, and diversity. You also get to work together with your peers to create educational materials and practice your teaching skills. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in teaching."

   "comments": [
    "I have my eyes set on a career devoted to undergraduate education. This course provided me with essential vocabulary and tools to effectively communicate with others in the education field and with my own students. Our effectiveness in communication is tantamount to our success as scientists; in this way, this course could not have been more closely tied to my dissertation and research.",
    "It really didn't have anything to do with my research but it was one of the only things I've done at Yale that actually assisted in my career development."
