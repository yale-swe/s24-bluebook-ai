    "I would recommend the course but a different professor than Alonso.",
    "For me, the main difference between the lecture and the seminar is the relationship you can have with the professor. I would definitely say if you are going to go to class, take advantage of office hours, and go to the review sessions, you should take the seminar. Professor Alonso is great about responding by email and really wants her students to do well. The book used in this class is great! I would definitely say that it is worth it!",
    "The seminar is definitely a better experience than the lecture in that class sizes are very small and you can get more individual help from the teacher. Problem sets are every week, but overall both exams were fair.",
    "Horrible. Awful. Not Good. Bad. Don't go to class, just read the book. It'll save you time and help you learn better.Never takes this course if you don't have to.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, because it is a straight forward and very important subject for everyone to study. However, I would not recommend taking it with Professor Alonso.",
    "ABSOLUTELY DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. For your own good, take the lecture instead. No doubt you have seen the horrible reviews already posted for this course in years past; don't discount them. Unfortunately, I did just that and signed up for Irasema's seminar, which turned out to be a giant mistake. Although she means well, she reads from her powerpoints (if you can even call them that--they're more like regurgitations of the textbook) line for line for basically the whole class. It is the same as having the textbook read out loud to you, but this is done in an accent which you will probably struggle to understand. I almost never complain about the accents of instructors, but I found hers to be a genuine impediment to learning. Similarly, problem sets and some test questions are written in broken English that sometimes makes the questions difficult to understand. This year, the average on the midterm was slightly above 50%. This should show you that either: 1) No one learned everything because the teaching was horrible. 2) The test was absurdly difficult and did not test the material taught in class. Actually, it was probably a bit of both. Do yourself a favor and use the thousands you are paying for tuition to take a class that's actually useful.",
    "Econ 111 is a great course with which to fulfill your intro macro credit if you are looking to major in econ. If not, this class is still a great course for learning about the subject.",
    "Econ 111 is one of those required courses you have take for a variety of majors. You can do well in the course, but without a good professor, it's entirely up to you to make the best of it."
