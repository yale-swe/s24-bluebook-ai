    "Excellent course exploring Japan's economic history, applies ideas to current crisis and recovery. Eminently relevant to today. Readings are excellent and Professor Roach is brilliant. Assignments are surprisingly a lot of fun. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. It's not an easy class, but if you put in the work it's really rewarding.",
    "Yes. This class will make you a boss. Professor Roach is great. He has strong opinions but encourages you to challenge them. The workload is not bad at all and you have freedom to learn about whatever you find interesting.",
    "Definitely take it if you can get in. Roach is great. Don't let the large amount of work worry you - the papers are pretty low key and the final one is very interesting. Sometimes a bit repetitive, but overall an excellent class.",
    "Yes, good class if you're interested in macro trends and the Japanese experience. Good freedom to explore your own ideas.",
    "Be respectful and don't take the class if you don't care. It's hard to get into, and it's a special group of clever people. Plus he'll make you take stands and you'll [hopefully]look like an dunce if you don't have something useful to say.",
    "This was by far my favorite economics course I've taken in four years. Stephen Roach is not only one of the most knowledgeable and respected individuals in his field, but he is also able to convey so much of what he knows to students in a way that is both interesting and manageable. So much of what Yale economics teaches is theory -- stuff that is important in perfect world, perfect competition, perfect information markets, but doesn't really say anything about what happens in reality. This course was the opposite of that. Everything we learned was tremendously relevant to understanding the world we live in today. Stephen Roach is also super cool, so this class is worth taking for that reason if nothing else.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you have a decent econ background and are genuinely interested in economic policy. Weekly reading responses, homework assignments, presentations and a final paper mean that it's not a walk in the park, but the workload is manageable (and there's no final exam). Grading seemed reasonable and fair.",
    "I would recommend it, but would heed some caution that the course can become repetitive."
