    "Great course! As a CS person, you should learn some randomized\/approximation algorithms, even if you don't take this course. Lectures are fun- Prof. Aspnes has a way with presenting the material fluently, clearly, intuitively, and goofily. Problem sets (60% of your grade) are weird- inspired by real-world problems rather than built to be solved cleanly by methods learned, some of which are quite hard. Online notes are even more comprehensive than the lectures themselves, but you'll want to attend lecture to get his take on the material. Some mathematical maturity is required- one could say that the problem sets areof the same flavour as those from 365, but some proofs are a lot messier.",
    "A fine not-too-hard CS elective. Randomized algorithms are the best, and you should study them. Aspnes is also a swell fellow, who lectures in an engaging though disjointed way.It's worth noting that this class involves a lot of basic probability theory, so if you have a lot of background in probability, much of the class may be review.",
    "This is an interesting course that covers a lot of cool material. It is a decent amount of work, but not unreasonable. Professor Aspnes is somewhat disorganized in lecture, which can make things hard to follow.",
    "One of the best classes in the Computer Science department. Professor Aspnes is a very engaging lecturer, the problem sets are interesting and manageable, and the material is fascinating. If you enjoyed 365, definitely take it!",
    "Good class, hard but not too much work. The TA Rasmus was very helpful",
    "Great course, awesome professor, and the best TF at Yale. But make sure that you have the appropriate background!",
    "Interesting course - it seemed like a more practical and less rigorous version of STAT 251 Stochastic Processes. My friend was in the STAT class while I took this and we learned a lot of the same things. Prof. Aspnes is hilarious - even when I had no idea what was happening on the board I paid attention to catch the jokes. Not sure how useful randomized algorithms actually are, but the class is an interesting mental workout for people who like probability.",
    "Less about making intelligent randomized algorithms than analyzing them, but a fun CS elective with a reasonable amount of work.",
    "I would. Good overview of a lot of very interesting material"
