   "comments": [
    "Do yourself a favor and TAKE THIS COURSE. It is one of the most fascinating, challenging, eye-opening courses I've taken at Yale. You will find yourself pondering phenomenology in the middle of the night. You will find yourself wanting to clap after each lecture ends. Also, Professor Shore is one of the kindest people I've ever met. A must-take.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Good introduction to a lot of major Western thinkers. Not very much work at all and the subject matter is very interesting.",
    "You know, not the best class I've ever taken at Yale. But Professor Shore kind of owns up to that fact at the beginning of the semester. She says this is going to be an introduction to European Intellectual Thought in the most traditional, clear way possible. So take this class if a) you find this topic really inherent interesting, or b) you feel like you need to understand this topic so you can get to other more interesting classes later on. I kind of felt moderate levels of both, so no regrets on taking this class for me. Unfortunately, there were very few racial\/ethnic minority students in the lecture (literally maybe only like 10). I think that's kind of a shame, because the philosophers included aren't just \"old white guys.\" (I say this as a woman of color). Professor Shore includes several female figures, and not just as tokens, but convincingly discusses them as important in their own right. And although they were white, a lot of the later philosophers were serious leftists. You hear Adorno and Foucault mentioned all of the time in sociology, anthropology, and ethnic studies classes. Isn't it cool to see how they evolved within their tradition?",
    "The most disappointing humanities course I've ever taken at Yale. Don't buy into the hype that's coming from people who've never taken another history or philosophy course and avoid at all costs.",
    "A very rewarding class if you take your time with the readings- many of these are amazing. I found lecture was a pleasure to attend, though often I felt Shore gave too much biographical backstory. Girard lecture is super good, and probably more so if you don't do that particular reading first.",
    "decent introduction to eur intel history",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, it was very interesting and it related nicely to many of the concepts addressed in other classes",
    "A great introduction to western philosophy and modernity. You'll learn a lot that you can use for cocktail party conversation",
    "Overall I enjoyed the class. It was not magnificent, but the lectures were good, the material a nice introduction to intellectual history, and the workload was minimal.",
    "Overview of intellectual history, not too in depth of any subject, but surprisingly hard. Don't believe the lowish work load, it's a difficult course to do well in. Good stuff to know though.",
    "Strongly recommend to any major!!!!",
    "This is my favorite class I have taken at Yale, and I am a rising Senior so I have taken a lot. I took the class just because I thought the material was interesting. I'm an applied math major so intellectual history was definitely not something I was familiar with before taking the course. The readings were so interesting albeit sometimes difficult, but Professor Shore did a really good job clarifying them. If you are interested in taking a class that will make you think about philosophical questions from points of view you had never considered before then this is the class for you. If you are interested in understanding the origins of modern Western intellectual thought then this is the class for you. If you don't know what you want to do with your schedule and are desperately trying to find a class with a reasonable workload that is also actually good then this is the class for you. In conclusion, take the class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who didn't have a lot of exposure to philosophy before. This course gave me a lot of material to work with, and helped me contextualize a lot of philosophical, political and cultural ideas of the 20th century, and their effects on the 21st century.",
    "Every student at Yale who has not taken a philosophy course should take this course. If possible, every person in the world who has not studied philosophy should take this course. I am 100% serious. Engaging with phenomenology and existentialism has prompted me to look at and live my life in a new way. If you are looking for a low-commitment way to take philosophy in college, youve found it. If youve taken DS, this is a good postscript. If youre already an expert in philosophy youll get to appreciate Marci Shores good humor and stories about her Polish philosopher friends. Straightforward assignments, manageable workload (the reading can be dense but there is seldom a high volume of reading)",
    "Perhaps the whole premise of the class is a recipe for disaster it's tough to cover 150 years of controversial, nuanced ideas in 24 or so 50-minute lectures but I can't help feeling it could have been done much better. Lectures were maddeningly vague and didn't really analyze ideas so much as present them in the form of a series of vague, repeated propositions. Also, HOW DID WE NOT DO WITTGENSTEIN?? But if you do the readings and mull stuff over outside class, you can learn something.",
    "Great course to learn about a very select group of mostly male thinkers from a specific region of the world. The title says it all.",
    "Take it! This class changed my perspective on life. The lectures are so interesting. It's a great way to learn about and read major philosophers and intellectual thinkers without being a philosophy major. I do wish I took it credit\/D though.",
    "An amazing class that I'd recommend to everyone! Marci Shore is an incredibly engaging and clear lecturer. Her lectures are informative and fun. I had no philosophy experience prior to the class and became interested over the course of the semester. Everyone should take this class. Could not recommend it more highly.",
    "It was awesome.",
    "Good survey of Western European thinkers. You go through a lot of thinkers, so that means that you never go in depth with any one thinker. The lectures were really great though, go to class. The readings were all primary sources and some were very hard to understand. So this class can be a lot of work, if you take the time to really understand the readings, but it's not completely necessary.",
    "If you are interested in intellectual history, absolutely take this course. It was your typical introductory\/survey level intellectual history course, but it was extremely enjoyable because Professor Shore is a brilliant and engaging lecturer. And the content is fascinating. I was really skeptical about taking a class where I was not allowed to take notes on my computer, but Professor Shore was totally right: I paid a lot more attention in class and never found myself bored because she does such a good job explaining concepts in interesting ways and connecting with the audience as she goes.",
    "Absolutely would recommend this course. Incredible professor and ideas. While the course is a broad survey, it is just enough for a non-humanities major and for a freshman early in their career. Extremely enjoyable just to listen to Marci Shore lecture!",
    "I would recommend to the philosophy type but not really for anyone else",
    "A must take for any student at Yale, Intellectual History covers most of the thinkers you've heard about but may not know much about. I would describe the course as a \"life course\"something you should take to understand how others think about the world, and have thought about the world throughout time. If you want to know about the ideas, but don't want to dive too heavily into the \"philosophy,\" then this course is perfect. The ideas are situated in historical context and connected throughout time, which makes the course feel very fulfilling and complete.",
    "Yeah it was fantastic",
    "Loved the lecture, hated section. Take credit\/D if you can, more challenging than people make it out to be. Only one midterm, a paper, and a final, but all are challenging. Annoying how you can't use laptops in section and have to have all readings printed out, but I liked not having laptops in lecture and having to write down all notes.",
    "I would recommend the class. It's a solid survey class and is relatively accessible for people who don't know much about philosophy before taking it.",
    "I would really recommend this course to anyone who's interested in the general development of intellectual thought in modernity, and how one idea led to another.",
    "A very good survey course of some formidable thinkers. It's an absurdly high-level overviewyou will feel guilty about reading 15 pages of Hegel and pretending to know something about himbut the emphasis on connections between thinkers and their historical\/social worlds was really valuable. Ideally, one would take this course early in their Yale career and use it to choose more in-depth treatments of particular thinkers later on. Be aware that this is a history class and not a philosophy class, and so if you're looking for philosophical rigor from Professor Shore or your TA you're going to be disappointed. The lack of diversity on the syllabus (and corresponding lack of serious engagement with questions of ethnicity and gender) was disappointing, but Simone de Beauvoir made the list this year, and many people on the syllabus did influence later critical theorists in these areas. Overall, I was very happy with the course as a thematic overview, especially given how little work it required.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, and felt like I learned a lot. I had never been exposed to these thinkers before, and Marci did an amazing job at introducing them to us. I will say that I found the course to be rigorous - don't listen to the reviews when they tell you that it is not a lot of work! Overall though, I am so so happy I took this class. I feel like I am generally a better educated human now - I'm a senior, and this is still probably one of my top three classes at Yale.",
    "The readings are really well curated, and I had a great experience with my TF (Noah). The lectures, though, are very lacking\/superficial. A lot of the reviews last year were very positive, and I suspect that is because the lectures provide a fun look at 20th century intellectual gossip and give just enough insight into the thinkers' contentions that the students felt like they had enough for cocktail hour. Unfortunately, the lectures do not explain at all how the thinkers reached their conclusions and were remarkably repetitive.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone not thrown by the unique blend of history and philosophy, and someone willing to do at least most of the reading. The course was extremely engaging--I found myself thinking about the ideas days and weeks (and now months) after the lectures--and completely changed the way I view modern world.",
    "The course name pretty much sums it up. You will go through many major philosophers from a historical framework, which makes even the most difficult readings bearable for non-philosophy majors.Leaving the course you will feel like your Yale education was worth something.",
    "Incredible lecture that covers continental philosophy and intellectual history from Hegel to Derrida. A lot like DS for the 20th century but with less reading and better pacing. Professor Shore is a total gem of a lecturer.",
    "Great and important overview of intellectual history. Shore is a fun and clear lecturer.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I highly, highly recommend this course. HIST 271 is an interesting and surprisingly thorough introduction to modern philosophy. Readings were all interesting and section was super helpful.",
    "A good survey course to take especially if you are interested in supplementing your DS knowledge. However more of a philosophy course than history, if you are not interested in Metaphysical, airy concepts, would not recommend.",
    "Yes- if you have not studied these thinkers before, this course provides a great introduction.",
    "Take if if you're always all interested in learning about different ways to think!",
    "Yes! An excellent lecture. Learned so much and Marci is a blast.",
    "Big lecture course; a survey of a few key thinkers in the western diaspora. Would recommend as a course for complete beginners to philosophy, such as myself, to get an idea of the progression of thought since Nietzsche's killing off God.",
    "Good introduction to intellectual history. Will be difficult if you don't already have some knowledge of European history or philosophy.",
    "This was a great course. Excellent lecture materials and for anyone who wants to study continental (european, as opposed to analytic) philosophy, this course is so important. It clearly explains the ideas of each thinker and provides a great jumping off point for future courses in european philosophy. As with any lecture course, it is highly dependent on what TA you have as to how you will experience the course. Especially in a course where the material is difficult to work with (ie its difficult to tell whether what you are saying is correct), having a good or bad TA will very much color your experience in the course. However, the lectures are worth it and the material is excellent and I could not recommend highly enough.",
    "HIST 271 was a fantastic course for me and definitely my favorite at Yale so far. I truly looked forward to Professor Shore's lectures, and found most (if not quite all) of the readings very interesting. One should recognize that this course is primarily about the history and development of ideas; while there is some political historical context given in lectures, and some discussion of personal lives, these are not the focus. If reading Hegel, Marx, Heidegger etc. sounds exciting, I would definitely recommend this course. If not, you still might be surprised -- shop it! (It also is a very reasonable amount of work.)"
