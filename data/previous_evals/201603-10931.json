   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot of German, which is what I took the course for anyway. Getting up for a 9:25 am class everyday is a lot to ask for students, but I liked it and thought it was manageable.",
    "I came in knowing zero German, so clearly I have learned so much this past semester. I took Chinese in high school and studied abroad in China, so language learning is something I care about and consider a strength, and this class allowed me to really put that to the test. Having weekly tests forced me to study more for this class than any others, but it ended up with me learning much more material in GMAN125 than any of my other classes.",
    "I developed a solid foundation for the German language as well as learned a lot more about the culture and customs.",
    "In this course I not only gained a solid foundation for the German language but I also began to think in German as well, which I saw as a crucial stepping stone in learning the language.",
    "Intensive German helped me develop language learning skills that will be useful to my area of study and my approach to language learning overall. The first part of the sequences covered a lot of ground, and I am surprised by how much I am able to read by now.",
    "After one semester I can speak in German, write letters in German, and read in German.",
    "Thorough understanding of basic grammar and confidence holding conversations in German"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The textbook and required code is $275! That's a lot to ask students, especially because you go through the entire text book in one semester. The email partners also stopped responding after a while, and so I wonder how I will be graded based on that.",
    "I think the strength is simply that everyone is in Intensive German because they really want to learn the language, so that made sure that everyone was engaged and eager to learn. One weakness I would say is that there wasn't much outside of the classroom we could use to review that was very structured. In the last half of the semester, I began going to German office hours and seeing a German tutor, so that helped, but I wish there were more opportunities for conversation outside of the classroom.",
    "The pace of the class is absolutely perfect. We get through one chapter a week with a weekly test on Mondays, which become less daunting as the semester goes on. The stable organization is really helpful to learning the language. I think the textbook, class discussions, and final project were all great, so I really have no complaints.",
    "My only improvement to this course would be to have slightly more time spent on the rules of grammar in class using the blackboard, rather than only learning them through application. This would allow students to learn the grammar concepts by name in German, rather than only read about them in English in the textbooks.",
    "The textbook (print+ online) is truly way too expensive. There is no way out of buying the ~$130 online textbook in order to do the homework, and I ended up rending a print version for $60. If the book will not be changed, I think the department should consider providing a fund for students who might find the costs of the textbook materials to be prohibitive to taking the course, or at the very least, a disincentive. I know that the students in my class may have similar thoughts. I like the course's spread out focus on various skills- speaking, grammar, vocab acquisition (the latter was particularly intensive in the L1\/L2 semester). There was a good mix of doing informal presentations, and the video project at the end of the semester presented a fun opportunity to use the little german we know in a creative way. In general, however, I wish that language classes at Yale would stop putting so much weight on large group projects. A two-person oral presentation is fine, but doing something like a multiple person video project is taxing, and I'm not sure I learn a ton of german in these kinds of group projects. In a language course I took for L5 French, what worked well as a group project was choosing scenes from a play we read to act out. In my mind, this may be an exception to the generally negative experience I have with group projects. I liked the email partner component and the speaking components in class. The online homeworks were truly a pain, and the way they are automatically graded (you can also \"check\" your answer) creates a disincentive to making corrections. I think it is much better for learning to hand-write grammar exercises. Fill-in-the-blank questions often felt like I was trying to guess the write answer instead of using the grammar I knew. On the other hand, Connect homeworks had really great listening exercises. I found the aural exercises in differentiating vowels and consonants particularly helpful and unique. A test a week provided a good rhythm to the course for building on grammar and vocab. It was nice that some of the later chapters in the textbook reviewed certain themes for vocabulary that were already taught.",
    "This is hands down one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. I can honestly say I looked forward to it every morning at 9:25. The best textbook I have ever worked with paired with one of the best teachers.",
    "It'd be nice to have more practice on forming full sentences",
    "The system of testing every week worked really well and I felt like it kept me motivated to learn a little more each week",
    "The course could use more creative exercises. The course sometimes felt like it was composed solely of textbook exercises. It was nice when we were able to improvise conversations using scenarios."

   "comments": [
    "Gets you to a comfortable level of German ability, fast. Not too much work (certainly not two credits' worth), and with a good group of students it's pretty fun.",
    "If you want to learn German quickly, take this course! I have never taken another language class at Yale, but I didn't think intensive german was unmanageable. I think you learn twice as much each day as you would in a normal class, but the homework is do-able in an hour and there are weekly quizzes on grammar but nothing terrible. Everything is very straight forward. It has changed a lot from when the other professor taught it, and it is now essentially what taking German L1\/L2 in a semester would be, but it is still a great class.",
    "Yes! Take German! I am biased because I love the German language but if you are looking to get to L5 quickly or study abroad, GMAN125 is the way to go. Having a 9:25 am class every single day was rough sometimes, but it was always worth it. Be ready to work though.",
    "Patrick is a phenomenal teacher, and if you want to learn German, you want to learn it from him. Sitting down for two hours every day may seem daunting to learn the language, but you really progress quickly. I was surprised that only one month in, we were all having conversations about our weekends and interests casually. I absolutely recommend this class to any student that wants to learn German as a third language.",
    "Very much sowhen you spend so much time on a language in a given day with other students who want to spend two hours a day on that language, you cannot help but enjoy.",
    "Yes, intensive German is great. It forces you to wake up early in the morning and you will be amazed by how much German you know after one semester. If you have nice classmates taking it with you, it's really fun to learn a language with peers that are intelligent and creative in ways different from you. I imagine that people taking intensive german have a strong purpose for learning the language at the intensive level, so it brings a very diverse and focused crowd of people, which I really enjoy in a small setting.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn German. There's no better way to do it than intensive.",
    "Definitely a fantastic way to learn the language"
