    "This was definitely the French module where I learned the most and made the most progress, likely because of Professor Burton (and the format of the course). I'm definitely much better at speaking French now than I ever have been.",
    "Greatly improved abilities in written and spoken French.",
    "This course helped me in French both grammatically and conversationally.",
    "my french improved a lot",
    "My facility with French, especially in reading and literary forms, was improved.",
    "This course has given me a better grasp of more advanced grammatical concepts, as well as allowed me to brush up on fundamental concepts that I have learned in previous years. I feel confident reading written French in may different tenses, including the literary tense used only in writing. My confidence when speaking French has greatly improved as well.",
    "Much better grasp on french grammar and improved listening skills.",
    "I was blessed with knowledge of many different french literary worlds, which to me was the most exciting part of class. I think learning the actually french language came secondary to the artists, poets, writers, and stories that we encountered through speaking french every day and reading heartbreaking stories",
    "My oral french skills improved as well as my grammar. My understanding of french literature allowed me to better understand different cultures, but it also gave me the opportunity to analyse the stories we read."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No real weaknesses. Very well structured and taught. Material is engaging and interesting without being overwhelming.",
    "It was frustrating to recieve extra homework and quizzes not outlined in the syllabus, so I would either incorporate that work into the syllabus or not give it.",
    "TOO MUCH WORK as always with french. i don't like how the final is two parts. i also think its really frustrating that we have to write an in class essay, and that's it is graded harshly. i think the audio programs must be improved as well, they are outdated and often don't have answers which makes them absolutely pointless there should be more speaking required in the classes",
    "I enjoyed the incorporation of French history, in this case WWII, into the curriculum. I also enjoyed reading novels such as La Symphonie Pastorale and Un Sac de Billes, as that trained me to look to French literature to keep my French sharp in the coming years when speaking opportunities are rare. With that said, I would have preferred a more leisurely pace during class. Sometimes the amount of group activities and abrupt changes of topic felt forced and did not help me internalize French. Finally, I would prefer to spend more time studying France itself, its regions, culture, and history, utilizing the French language. We spent more time with former colonies and their cultures than with the nation that gave birth to the language. This is not a politically correct position, but someone who goes through years of French should come out with the broad outlines of French history and culture, as well the differences between Normandy, Languedoc, Provence, etc. I would wager that most of the students could not point these regions out on a map, even after years of French. However, this knowledge contextualizes and enhances the learning of the language, which is deeply rooted in history and culture. I would suggest, therefore, introducing more French classics into the curriculum and spending more time on France. In sum, let's get back to the fundamentals.",
    "Strengths: Lots of varied texts from different cultures. La Symphonie Pastorale and Un Sac de Billes were also very interesting. Weaknesses: Movies are kind of old, homework practically every day.",
    "I thought this course was designed in an optimal way to facilitate student learning. I especially enjoyed the opportunities to practice listening and speaking. I loved that listening exercises were built into the nightly homework, and that speaking exercises were built into classwork and long-term assignments, such as the oral presentation and the prepared debate.",
    "It's a really comprehensive course that teaches you french grammar and writing very well... weaknesses are that it's a lot of work which turned me off at times and also there wasn't enough discussion out loud in french. Also I heard that certain teachers gave more blatant hints as to what was going to be on the tests than others -- which isn't fair.",
    "I think the course has very clear objectives and the strict syllabus makes following the lessons much easier, The monthly assessments allow students to regularly practice grammar and to practice the mechanics of the language. I think more emphasis should go into talking about the specific texts in class in order for students to get a better understanding of the literature as a whole."

   "comments": [
    "French 140 is probably the module of French in which I personally made the most progress - it's when you're asked to engage most with the material - reading, speaking, etc. It's a well-designed course and the professors are very happy to be there. Take it.",
    "Absolutely. You will learn a great deal - and enjoy doing so.",
    "Yes",
    "yes if you want to learn french and are willing to put in a TON of time, as with all levels of french at yale",
    "Yes, especially with Madame Prof. Burton.",
    "Yes, although there is a lot of work, the difficulty isn't too high, and your French really improves. Not only do you pick up a ton of grammar rules and vocabulary, but you also read a variety of texts from different cultures.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I am taking a six-week trip this summer to a francophone country and I feel much more prepared to navigate using the French language in real-life situations than I would have at the beginning of the semester.",
    "Yes! great way to learn French."
