    "I would definitely recommend Psychopharmacology if you're at all interested in how we treat mental disorders. I took the class because I like Prof. Brown's teaching style and ended up deciding that this was a field I might want to study because it was so interesting. You not only learn the molecular biology and psychology behind drugs (if you ever wanted to know how aspirin works, versus tylenol, or the actual side effects of marijuana, take this class!) but also the politics behind drug research and prescription and the current problems facing our nation. It touched on so many aspects and so many age groups; it was very comprehensive but not overwhelming because exams were more concept-based. You never had to know all the side effects. It was more important to know why one class was better than the other, the pathophysiology behind diseases and what the drugs did to ameliorate it, etc. You get to discuss overprescription of ADHD meds, marijuana legalization, and many other topics. And as a treat, Prof. Brown brings cookies and pastries every week!! The workload is completely manageable and exams are lecture-based. Lectures are clear and easy to follow (both Prof. Brown's and Aswhini's). No reason not to take this class :D",
    "Yes, definitely take the course! You don't need a strong background in chem, bio, or clinical psych. Some background in neuroscience is recommended. This course builds you up and fills in the gaps in any of the areas that are lacking in terms of chemistry, biology, or clinical work. The information in this course is extraordinarily applicable to everyday life let alone to people interested in some health profession.",
    "It's the study of drugs and how they effect the brain. If you like that, take it. I thought it was fascinating and wished there was more like this at the undergraduate level.",
    "Good class if you're interested in drugs.",
    "If you are interested in the way all kinds of drugs work on the brain, definitely take this course. A background in neuroscience would be helpful, but not really required if you want to put in a little extra work.",
    "a really interesting take on psychopharm! If you're into neuro at all, take it!!",
    "Definitely recommend if you're interested and have a strong background in neuroscience. You have to learn a lot of material, but it's very clear what you need to learn in order to do well. You should have a strong background in neuroscience, brain anatomy, and some understanding of organic chemistry.",
    "Good overview, fun course.",
    "*Copied from previous response:One of the better psych courses out there. The material is not overwhelming because w\/4 exams the semester, essentially non-cumulative, you can actually spend time learning the material rather than memorizing it. A selling point, though it kinda just adds compliment to uh..the opposite of 'injury', is that the professor's wife bakes cookies every week for him to bring to class: enjoy, especially when she experiments with recipes.The main reasons you should take this class are if the material is interesting to you (don't be scared by a perceived difficulty) - clearly - and the fact that the professor and TF are both ridiculously awesome and nice people. Oh, and they know their stuff too, but that goes without saying.",
    "Definitely if they are interested in neuropharmacology"
