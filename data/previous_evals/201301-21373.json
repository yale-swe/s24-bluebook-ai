    "It's a tough class, namely because of the homework problems in Jackson. The exams are fairly qualitative though and are reasonable.",
    "While I feel like I got a fair amount out of the class, I wouldn't have taken it if it wasn't a departmental requirement. It isn't really directly related to any current research in experimental physics that I will be involved with on a day-to-day basis throughout the rest of grad school or my subsequent career.",
    "Yes. It does offer a good foundation for fundamental concepts in E&M.",
    "This course provides a rigorous overview of electromagnetic theory as expressed by Jackson, covering most of the important topics discussed in the book. I would recommend this course, especially for its helpful presentation of the theory behind many of the commonly used equations in E&M.",
    "Physics 508 is a very hard class. However, because it is required form the physics phd, I would advise keeping up with the material closely.",
    "This course is crucial.",
    "I think in terms of a grad E&M class following Jackson, this is one of the best versions of the class."
