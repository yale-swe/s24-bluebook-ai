   "comments": [
    "The books for this course were by and large extremely compelling modern works of scholarship, and the class discussion was very high quality. I would recommend this course to other students, as it's a good introduction to some of the more interesting religious history scholars today.",
    "The course is a reading seminar that covers religion (mostly American Protestantism with some focus on Judaism, Catholicism, and Mormonism) from the 1600s to present. I would recommend the course to students who need a stronger historiography of religion in American society.",
    "I would recommend it, but I would warn a prospective student about the idiosyncratic syllabus and the two professors' stark personality differences. Some might want that...Others might not.",
    "I would summarize this class by describing the activities that comprised its main work, which were the following: (1) holding highly structured discussions about the use and interpretation of evidence within readings nominated as part of the subfield of American religious history; (2) listening to colleagues make presentations about how these readings fit into a wider historiographical plane, but not necessarily connecting these larger considerations to actual collective discussions; (3) watching as professors miscommunicated with each other and sometimes derailed each others leadership; (4) writing two book reviews; (5) preparing and eventually writing a final paper in which we interpreted a primary document in light of the historiography of American religion. Assuming that a future version of this course were to resemble the iteration taught in Fall 2015, I would recommend it to some students. I would recommend it to students who are seeking formal opportunities to work with the professors teaching it. I would recommend it to students without experience working on historiography or who felt that they needed very structured ways of entering into the readings. I would recommend it for students who want a structured final assignment that is not quite a research paper but a very good first step to engaging primary sources in systematic and close ways. This question is sort of an artificial exercise, though, because I think that had there been a different subset of students in the class more people from the history department, especially the class might have been different. Exactly WHY there were very few History Department PhD students in a class on American Religious History is an interesting and disappointing question for our collective reflection."

   "comments": [
    "This course offered me a better understanding of my field and of some of the intellectual trends that exist within it. Although most of what we read for the course does not contribute to my research, it does contribute to my broader understanding of prominent methods in the field.",
    "This course provided occasion to read some books that I had not read before, to write a paper that I had not yet written, and to work with whom I needed to take a class. The class gave me a better sense of how two faculty from very different parts of the American Religious History subfield interact with each other as teachers and thinkers. It gave me an example of how an American Religious History class can be organized."
