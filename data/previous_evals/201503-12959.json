    "Musi 219 is a fantastic course for musicians interested in developing a range of musical skills: singing, dictation\/ear training, and keyboard skills (figured bass realizations). If you place into 219, you'll be able to handle it - the workload isn't too bad, unless you have no experience with piano, in which case keyboard lab could be difficult. I would definitely recommend 219 to anyone who's looking to expand his\/her musical horizons with a hands-on, relatively easy class.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone considering a major in music regardless of the fact that it is a prerequisite. In summary, MUSI 219 was a class dedicated to the improvement of the various vocal and aural aspects of ear training, as well as rhythmic, melodic and harmonic dictation, and it was quite helpful in each of these categories, though more so in certain ones over others. The workload is not very intense, but this also translates into very low tolerance\/leeway for unpreparedness. Staying on top of assignments and putting in daily practice time was key."
