    "Don't be scared of physical chemistry and quantum mechanics! This class is completely manageable if you are willing to put time into studying and going to class. I am not a huge physics or math person, but Zilm really made this class enjoyable. It was a fair amount of work to study for exams, but it's one of those classes where this work does pay off, and you'll feel amazing when you get your grades back. I thought I was going to hate 333 and I was dreading it, but it has been one of my favorite classes so far. If you're considering taking this, you're probably doing it because you have to for Chem or ChemE, but do the psets (even if you don't get the material completely or if you can't complete the questions...they're mostly graded for completion), go to class, study for exams, and don't be intimidated by your classmates (you're there for a reason! You can do it!!!!).",
    "Take it if it's with Zilm.",
    "As an MBB major, who decided this over the Biophysics class-- take this! You will learn way more, and Enrique de la Cruz seems crazy. Zilm is clear, and more than fair with grading.",
    "It ended up being less terrifying than I thought it would be. If you go to class and seek help when you need it, you'll be more than fine. Prof. Zilm wants everyone to do well and understand the material, and he's actually a great lecturer. His notes are also incredibly helpful. You'll probably need to take this class, but definitely look forward to it if Zilm is teaching.",
    "Pretty hard material but excellent course. The homework and notes are really well written.",
    "The cool thing about Zilm is that he posts well-organized lecture notes on classes V2, which he follows very consistently. So if you have the time to read them beforehand then you're in a good place. Also if you miss lecture or didn't take notes one day you can catch up on your own time with online notes. Zilm may seem impatient or annoyed when students don't understand the material, but he legitimately wants to help his students learn even if it's not immediately apparent. Some of the material was pretty neat, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to or if you feel confident in your ability.",
    "Prof Zilm is a fairly good teacher. He really tries and puts in a great deal of effort in teaching. He gives pretty good notes - they're much more useful than the txtbk. He's a bit difficult to understand at times, but the material is inherently difficult and abstract to begin with so given the difficulty of the material, Prof Zilm is a good teacher.",
    "A really wonderful course. For sure the hardest and fastest-paced chemistry course you've taken thus far, but stay motivated and the work is absolutely worth it. Don't worry about the math too much, because Zilm's exams are mostly conceptual. The notes are also wayyyyy better than a textbook, although quantum mechanics will be difficult to understand no matter what you learn it from.",
    "I would recommend CHEM333 to another student if they had a strong enough background--it isn't too challenging if you do, and the content, while fast, is understandeable and a lot of the more interesting implications of the content are reached without spending too much time on them.",
    "It is a hard course, but it is definitely manageable. You'll enjoy it more if you like math and physics, but if your math\/physics background is not strong you don't have to worry. If you take it with Professor Zilm, you should read the notes (posted on classes v2) before each lecture and then it will be much easier for you to keep up with the materials. His notes are very organized and typos are rare, but you will still need to read it a couple of times to fully understand the content, just because the material itself is hard.",
    "Overall, CHEM 333 was a fantastic course. The material was really cool, the resources were terrific, the lectures were well paced and engaging, the TA's were great, the class structure was very conducive to learning--every aspect of this course was very well done. In addition, the course load is manageable with weekly problem sets that take about five hours. Zilm provides incredibly useful lecture notes covering all of the material and the textbook is also a great resource. Almost all of the test material is from lecture notes or practice questions that Zilm provides, which makes studying more approachable. All that said, the material can be tough as it involves pretty much every math concept I have ever learned but the resources are there to help you out. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who might be interested in quantum mechanics. It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Would recommend. Amazing class, definitely take it.",
    "I would say for sure that the class is difficult. However, I learned a lot and Professor Zilm was actually really nice and good at explaining the material. I probably still wouldn't take it unless you have to, but if you have to it won't be so bad.",
    "Very good class, but pretty hard. Requires more math than I anticipated, and halfway through the semester you'll realize that it's actually a physics class. Nevertheless, it is probably one of the classes which I liked the most so far - I was introduced to several new fields of chemistry which I didn't know much about and am interested in learning much more about them. The workload is manageable but decently difficult since there is so much material to go through for each exam. The more you put into this class, the more you will get out of it.",
    "It's molecular quantum, and if Zilm teaches it you get some intro to statistical mechanics at the end (thats the \"applications\" part of the name I think). the textbook is a little useful, but not especually",
    "Quantum, in particular, is very interesting material, and Prof. Zilm does a good job with it. It's rough that it's an early morning class up science hill, but Zilm's notes are well-organized and his lectures are good. Definitely worthwhile.",
    "This course will kick you in the face over and over with sheer difficulty, but Professor Zilm does a good job trying to help you through the material. Be prepared to work hard, but you'll enjoy the trip.",
    "CHEM 333 is mostly quantum mechanics (with a little statistical mechanics at the end). Having a strong math background really helps, but the class is still manageable even if you have not taken linear algebra or have a weaker foundation in math - it just means spending some extra time learning the necessary math. The class is definitely challenging, but well-taught (Professor Zilm taught it this year) and quite a lot of fun if you take a step back from the stress.",
    "AAA. If you're thinking about taking physical chemistry, you probably have to take it. If you don't, you're probably a physics major, so screw you-go take your own quantum mechanics.",
    "More likely than not, you're taking this as a requirement. Bringing light to this fact doesn't change how you feel going through this course -- it's like you are singlehandedly pushing the Struggle Bus up a Science Hill that extends as far as the semester lasts. Some people did well in it though because they just understand this stuff. Or they somehow have time to study enough to actually understand it.",
    "This class covers quantum physics from a chemistry perspective. It is well organized with class notes provided. To better engage with the material, write on the notes or take your own instead of just sitting there following along. Problem sets are pretty straightforward once you understand the material and are good indicators of how well you are following what has been going on. Overall, I learned a lot and quite enjoyed this class."
