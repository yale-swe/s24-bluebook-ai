    "Thinking critically of previous anthropological analytical frameworks, and understanding cities as mobile, live, changing places.",
    "I learned about anthropological perspectives in cities in Asia and their relationships with socialist and post-colonial regimes. The course was very valuable and focused on the social-political pressures of cities and delved into a range of social groups. With each reading and discussion session I developed a greater understanding of cities in Asia and implications of mobilities\/immobilities."

My only slight recommendation would be to devote more time to student-led discussion. Professor Siu's lectures are insightful, but on occasion I wish I had learned more from my peers.",

    "I would recommend it for its non-Western focus and the range of subjects and time frames covered in the readings.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in urban studies. In fact, I would say this course is essential for any student interested in learning how cities navigate a globalized world.",
    "Professor Siu's extremely knowledgeable and clearly passionate about the topic, but we barely discussed the majority of the readings since she spends most of the time talking during seminar. If you're into that kind of teaching style, then definitely go for it. If not, then don't take the course.",
