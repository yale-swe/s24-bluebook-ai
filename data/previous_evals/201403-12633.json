   "comments": [
    "Take this course! It is great for a lab credit if you need one, but most importantly the material is extremely interesting and relevant, and the labs and field trips are SO fun! It's a small class and you will get to know each other very well.",
    "I highly recommend this class. Most of the students in the class are not even science or environmental studies majors, but everyone got something out of it. If you are interested in agroecology, forestry, or urban ecosystems, this class is perfect for you.",
    "A good class. I'd recommend it even if you haven't taken any environmental studies classes before. You'll learn a lot from readings, discussions and field trips. However lab reports for this class are not easy to write and little guidance is provided.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who can fit it in their schedule. The field trips are so much fun and totally unique, and definitely a great introductory experience for those interested in field work. Kealoha and Max are awesome people, and the class becomes really tight-knit. The course allows you to learn about a wide range of environmental science topics that are usually covered in a single specific course."
