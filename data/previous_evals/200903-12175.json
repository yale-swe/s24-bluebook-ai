    "Anthro 120 looks at the relationship language has with identity and culture, how the three interrelate and speak to each other. it addresses myths of gender, race, class, and nationality to understand how we truly speak and what that means for us as individuals and a people.",
    "This would be a good fifth class. It's very accessible and interesting, and a great mix between linguistics and social considerations. You don't really have to do the readings until right before you write the papers, and the papers are short and fun to write.",
    "I would recommend this course, since it is a good introduction to linguistic and cultural anthropology and an interesting topic even to people who do not want to do further studies in this area. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the social sciences, since it discusses politics, gender studies, ethnic studies, and linguistics in a very interesting light.",
    "This class involves a lot of lectures and a lot of reading. For the lectures I eventually discovered that I did not need to take many notes. Just a few notes on key areas was sufficient. The papers are mostly based on the readings so be sure to read carefully is you choose one of those topics. I would recommend this course to someone interested in language and its relationship to human identity.",
    "Take it",
    "A pretty good anthro course. The shopping lectures are better than the class itself, which is good for the first two units but gets repetitive by the end. Easy, but a lot of work (ie, 4 papers none of which are that hard). Errington is good.",
    "This class is very straight forward and enjoyable overall.Lecture meets three times a week. Prof. Errington is a good lecturer with a lot of great information to share. He has a wonderfully dry sense of humor and does an excellent job of incorporating current events and YouTube videos into his lectures.I found that there was no need to ever do the reading, which was often a plus. I always went to lecture, mostly because it was enjoyable, but also because I feared I would not get by if I didn't go to lecture and also didn't do the reading! In the end, however, I regretted not doing more of the reading. I think I would have gotten more out of the class and its material if I had. But that said, it was nice to take a straight forward, interesting course that didn't demand much.",
    "Good overview of linguistic anthropology- can get a little boring at times, but pretty easy yet interesting class.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in the subject matter. It does an interesting job of relating language, culture, and identity. However, I felt like it lacked a bit of concentration on cultures outside of the US.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. You don't get a lot of feedback on how to improve your essays (4 for the term) but Prof. Errington is (usually) an interesting lecturer and the content itself was interesting too. Workload is pretty light (you don't HAVE to do the readings, but they're helpful when writing the essays, there's no midterm and a take-home final).",
    "It is a fun class and very interesting. A lot of the material can be related to ones own life or experiences. Over all it was a very good class, but some of the lectures can be boring. There are 4 3-5 page papers and a take home final at the end. The papers are nice, because you can write about whatever interests you, this makes them not as tedious as other papers from other classes.",
    "This class was incredible! I loved the way the topic related to everyday life, so you could immediately start looking for examples of the things we talked about in your own life. The assignments (four 3-5 page essays) were definitely manageable, and even though Professor Errington gives a list of paper topics, you can make up your own if you want.",
    "Interesting class, lectures and course material, with some very interesting readings and a few rather dry ones. I'm not quite sure what to take away from all of it. Recommended with reservations.",
    "It's a study about how pieces of our identity can be found in our language.It's a rather shallow level of understanding, but interesting as a fifth class.",
    "I thought this was one of the most interesting classes I have ever taken. Every class topples a new issue in language that I took for granted before. If you are interested in languages and how they affect social interactions this is a great class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, it made me think about a lot of things I had never considered before. Plus, it seemed set up to be a smooth ride as long as you do the reading and pay attention but still very enlightening.",
    "Not an interesting class. 4 papers and a short take-home final. The workload is manageable but the content seems more interesting than it actually is.",
    "Great class for people who are interested in Anthropology but don't want something too hard right away. It has interesting, applicable to today topics so it's never too hard to focus\/understand.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in the material covered, but only if you are willing to engage it on your own.",
    "It was a wonderful course, covering the intersection of discourse and written language with one's cultural identity, racial identity, sexual identity, etc. Its broad nature allowed you to look at these ideas in a very inclusive way, finding trends and anthropological norms. At times, however, it was hard to find very conclusive examples of these broad trends. I would definitely recommend the course, though, as long as you are intrigued by human interactions and the way these interactions are shaped by language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is exposure to very central issues facing American society today through the lens of language as a vehicle for identity and culture. I am extremely grateful to have started thinking about these issues, though this course is far from perfect - lecture 3 times a week with a section that you may not be unable to attend means that it's an unusual format to absorb a lot of material. The general themes fit together extremely well, but only make sense in light of the detailed readings.",
    "I would reccomend this course. Try to do most of the readings and you'll find the course personally rewarding (it is not necessary to do much of the reading for your essays, though it will make them better!). And, if you put your best effort into the essays, you will get a good grade.",
    "There is no doubt that this is an intro course. The workload is pretty light and the class touches on many different themes. The reading is not difficult to complete at all and is very manageable and interesting. The four essays we wrote throughout the term were a short 3-5 pages each and don't take long to write if you are at least a little familiar with the reading that given week to pull from it and if you've been to lecture, though if you've missed a lecture or two or all of them in a particular week it isn't difficult to still do well on the essays anyway as long as you finish the reading on your own. The take-home final was surprisingly short and, again, was easy to complete if you'd done the reading and attended most lectures. I think this would definitely be a good fifth class for any course schedule if you're moderatly interested in linguistic anthro.",
    "This is a great introductory anthropology course. The class itself wasn't too big, so you didn't get that huge 'i'm lost in a sea of people' feeling that you get with some lecture classes. The majority of the class topics were very interesting, and help with a general understanding of the world and bilingualism, etc. I would definitely recommend taking this class. It was interesting, not too much work, and the papers were fun to write.",
    "Anthropology 120 is a pretty easy but interesting course with an emphasis on language and how it relates to culture and identity. I would recommend this course to another student particularly if that student is interested in language because the course places heavy emphasis on languages.",
    "Only take this class if you are interested in linguistics. It is filled with a lot of wide-eyed freshman who think it's great, but the teaching is really poor. Prof. Errington seems bored with the material, and aside from a lecture or two, the class was not worth it.",
    "This class was interesting and did not require a stressful amount of work. Doing all the reading will make the course much more interesting and engaging. Sometimes it was hard to find the thread connecting many of the abstract topics we covered, but there is such a broad range of information that it is easy to find an area of interest."
