   "comments": [
    "I very much enjoyed this course -- particularly the emphasis on the practical applications of Courage. It taught me to critically question our assumptions. I liked getting to know my class mates.",
    "This class was a completely different experience from anything I have taken in my Yale career. It was an intimate seminar that focused on self-reflection, giving students the opportunity to understand courage from a multitude of angles and ultimately how to apply such knowledge to their own personal lives. I walked in to the class with a pretty set definition of courage, and I walked out with a completely new take on the subject. It is fascinating how many contexts exist in which courage can be applied, and Roz does an incredible job of ensuring students engage with the material, not only through seminar discussion but also throughout the week in their daily lives.",
    "This class helped me to understand myself, and what having courage would mean in my life.",
    "This course was truly unique. I felt that I learned so much, not only about the theory of courage in the abstract, but about how to best facilitate courage in my own life and work. The insights I developed were personal at times, forcing me to rethink aspects of my life that had been underexamined before. The skills I developed were also personal, and I feel that in the future, I will be able to use them to ensure I live a courageous life."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The practical assignments made the class much more engaging and were absolutely the strength! The one weakness of the course was the reading response. Each week, it took 3 to 4 hours to write which is the longest I have spent on a single reading response at Yale.",
    "Strengths - emphasis on practical applications, a small classroom setting, engaged discussions, personal anecdotes. Weaknesses - at times the academic readings seems a bit heavy and unrelated to our conversations.",
    "I think one of the greatest benefits of the class was the class size. It was small and intimate, offering us the ability to get to know our classmates better and subsequently feel more comfortable opening up or sharing reflections on the readings. The constant theme of self-reflection and the weekly courage challenges were both useful mechanisms in ensuring I thought about courage and the coursework on a daily basis. The course was definitely reading-heavy in the first part of the semester, containing many works that were inundated with scholarly jargon. There could also be more accountability with courage challenges, such as having other people write them and picking them randomly, as we did in the last week of class.",
    "A very special class. Although I think I enjoyed the class a lot more than the readings, and having to write the reading responses felt burdensome.",
    "One of the big strengths of the course is Roz she is so committed and enthusiastic about the material, and so invested in her students' success that you cannot help but become invested as well. Another big strength is the class dynamic. Because the class involves personal reflection and discussion, the class attracts people willing to share their own lives and struggles with one another. I have no doubt that next year, the class will be more popular, but I hope it continues to attract thoughtful and engaged students, as our in-class discussions were highlights of the course."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class as a chill seminar that gives students an opportunity to be introspective on a weekly basis. The level of self-reflection and the empathy Roz has to those still grappling with the nature of courage are both reasons enough to take the course. It will serve as a motivator for you to become more courageous in your own life!",
    "Yes this is very interesting class that foster conversation necessary to be had but honestly rarely had on this campus, this would surprise you, but I am very grateful for the conversations took place during this class.",
    "Absolutely, 100%. Take this course if you are willing to put in the time and self-reflection, and you will get a lot out of it."
