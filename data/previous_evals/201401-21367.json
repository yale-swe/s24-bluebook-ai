   "comments": [
    "Yes. Anyone who is interested in learning more about how game theory works in a group situation where people can decide to cooperate or not (subsequently leading to vastly different outcomes) should take this class.",
    "Pretty easy if you have a good math & mathematical econ background.",
    "I would recommend ECON 471 to another student.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It's a chill seminar with really fascinating game theory concepts and implications, though you don't need to have taken game theory beforehand (I didn't). At the beginning of the semester, I was worried that I needed to know linear algebra, but I did perfectly fine with only having taken Math 115. Get a study buddy for the class, but besides doing three problem sets and a paper, there is very little work for the class (but high reward). The midterm was exactly like the problem sets. Professor Dubey is one of those very lovable professors. He is very down-to-earth, chill, but clearly brilliant. He jokes around in class while being committed to the math behind game theory. I adore him!",
    "If you are mathematically inclined, take it! Professor Dubey is a great lecturer, and you probably haven't encountered anything like cooperative game theory in the economics department (even if you've taken regular game theory).",
    "Absolutely!!!",
    "If you're an economics student interested in math or computer science, ECON 471 will prove very interesting to you. It is somewhat applied, in that the theory arises from real-world events, but this class is far more proof-based than other game theory classes.",
    "Take Econ 471 if you want a low-stress introduction to cooperative game theory, which is a very undervalued subject that has pretty cool real life implications.",
    "A good course to learn about cooperative game theory. The work isn't too bad as there were only 3 psets, a midterm, and a term paper. It was actually pretty useful too, since I had never heard of the Shapley value before, and it apparently is being applied to many problems.",
    "I would. For me it was one of the rare classes at Yale that was both (1) full of cool information and very useful and (2) not that hard."
