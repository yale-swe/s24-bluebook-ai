    "In EEB 247, you'll look at and take apart lots and lots of different plants, and you'll eat lots of food that comes from the plants you're studying that week. It's wonderful.I highly recommend this lab.",
    "YES! BEST CLASS AT YALE! It will make you so happy every week no matter what else is going on. And you will try lots of cool food and learn a lot about plant phylogeny and anatomy.",
    "This class is the best. Definitely take this if you're taking E&EB 246. It corresponds directly with the lecture and will greatly help you in preparing for the midterms. Not only that, it's actually a lot of fun. It's very low work and no lab reports. Professor Donoghue also arranges to have samples of different foods from the plant group you're studying.",
    "Professor Donoghue was absolutely fantastic. Not only is he brilliant, but also incredibly accessible and such a good teacher. In particular, he was a very incredible lecturer. No weaknesses!! The teaching fellow Beth was also wonderful. You learn so much about plants through the lens of phylogeny. The lab is incredibly hands on, and the greenhouses are one of the most hidden yet wonderful joys at Yale. Not too much work, but you learn so much. Also, there is food almost every lab to enjoy!",
    "Take this Lab! You get to go to the Marsh Botanical Gardens to look at plants and eat food every week. Everything about the course is very laid-back, but you'll learn a ton about the plants around you. Professor Donoghue is a great teacher and everyone at the Botanical Gardens is incredibly nice.",
    "Take it for sure!!",
    "This was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The material is very interesting and supplements the material of the lecture course (EEB 246) very well. Also, Marsh Gardens is a beautiful place and learning about the plant families and specimens that they have there was a great experience. Also there's food to accompany the plant groups that you study, so that's a plus as well.",
    "This class was just a great life decision. Great food, fun field trips, plus the opportunity to learn from Prof. Donoghue, who is both a fantastic instructor and a great human being. Not to mention all the other great people who work at Marsh Gardens and our awesome TA, Beth. This lab is a delightful experience.",
    "I loved this lab. Prof. Donoghue is really nice and knows an absurd amount about plants. Super chill setting--we basically just drew plants and ate food for a couple of hours each week. It was awesome. I would definitely take the lab if you're taking the lecture course.",
    "One of the most fun labs I've had at Yale! Unless you don't like plants. But if you do, you will learn so much and get to go on great field trips and eat so much great and crazy (in a good way) food. Being in the greenhouses was definitely a high point of the week every week.",
    "E&EB 247L provides a unique experience even at Yale. You get to explore the botanical gardens, dissect various exotic plants, and eat delicious food at every class. It is definitely worth the walk up science hill, especially if you take it with the regular class.",
    "This class was a great chance to get hands-on experience. It let you pick apart the diagnostic pieces of anatomy yourself, which made everything in the lecture a lot clearer. It was fun and you learn a lot. It's not much work if you can carve out the large chunk of time that a lab takes and it's rather relaxing. I highly recommend this class if you're considering taking the lecture. Or if you've always wanted to cut an orchid open.",
    "A must-take with the lecture course!"
