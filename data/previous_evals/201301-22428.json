   "comments": [
    "This was a great introduction to the study of religion, and also to anthropology in general. The readings in the first half of the course were sometimes a little dry, because we were reading a lot of academic papers that laid the foundations for religious anthropology, but they were fascinating, especially later in the semester when we read a couple full-length case studies: one on evangelical Christianity, one on the intersection of gender and religion in Egypt, and one on witchcraft in sub-saharan Africa.",
    "I would only take this class if you are very interested in the contents; there are a lot of readings so if you don't mind having an hour (maybe two) of reading each week then you should take it.If you like very small classes, I would take this course.Also, I would take it if you are interested in ethnography at all; the major project was an experience of a lifetime and I am very glad that I was forced to go out of my comfort zone to conduct personal interviews. It was a very mature assignment, and I would definitely do it again.",
    "I would recommend the course, but mostly for someone who has some prior experience in anthropology. Some of the readings are a bit complex and difficult and it seemed that having some previous experience was helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Great into course to religion and ritual. Covers Shamanism, Modernity of Witchcraft, blending of religion and politics, Feminism in Islam, and much more. This is a discussion based class and you will need to complete all readings. If you are looking for a blow off class this is not it. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I think freshman and sophomores will especially benefit from taking this type of class given the nature of the Ethnographic project. Its a great introduction into research and the human resources committee.",
    "I really enjoyed it. The ethnographic research was great in particular. Very helpful skills learnt and its made me see a lot of the rituals we do in everyday life very differently."
