   "comments": [
    "It's a very fascinating look at the complex commonalities and differences between the three main monotheistic religious as they pertain to their patriarch Abraham. Incredibly applicable to modern society though it concentrates on reading Genesis as a work of literature. However, this is only the first part--it continues to look at how Abraham evolved in later Jewish interpretation and also moves to Judeo-Christian separation and Islam. Overall my favorite class of the semester.",
    "JDST 015 is a look at the Abraham story from different points of view. We look at the Bible, the Quaran, Jubilees, and other texts. We see how Abraham and other people are portrayed differently and what values are emphasized in the different texts.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. Make sure you are interested in the subject matter or else the readings and class will not be that exciting for you.",
    "Take this class! It's very interesting and engaging and the workload isn't bad at all.",
    "Great class to learn about the figure of Abraham and learn to read religious texts closely. Expect to learn a lot about Christianity and Judaism--not so much about Islam.",
    "Yes, a great way to get a Hu\/WR credit! The readings can be dense and hard to understand, especially at the beginning of the course, but it gets easier after you're familiar with the subject, and Professor Kaplan offers a lot of help along the way. One short midterm paper, 10 one page reading responses and a 16 page final paper (on topic of your choosing) with a presentation.",
    "If they were interested in the story of Abraham or how those religions can view the same story in different ways, I would definitely recommend this class. However, as it was more focused in its interest, I would only recommend it for someone who is interested. It could be incredibly boring otherwise."
