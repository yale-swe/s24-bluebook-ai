    "Since this class is an elective, a student is free to take it at different points during his\/her program.For me it was a proper time to pass the course since I\u0092m planning to apply for the summer internship to the company dealing with the large-scale projects. This class provided me with a good background.",

Therefore,on consultations I was given valuable suggestions concerning equally architecture of my tower, its structure, as well as mechanical systems.This ability of our Professor to provide such a complex approach was very important to me.",
    "Good - sometimes it was hard to understand professor Moon because of his accent. In addition, he did carry a bias towards diagrid structures because it was a new trend that related to his ongoing professional work....seomthing he openly admitted to me and my teammate on various occasions. Nevertheless, overall he was a good professor",

    "I would like this course extended to two semesters with study of precedents and theory of skyscrapers in the first semester and the design development in the second.",
    "Great class! I enjoyed it and I learned a lot. Thanks Professor Moon!",
    "Two issues came up within the class that I think are noteworthyFirst is the issue of using the same design work for two different classes...which was apparent in this elective. Research and precedent study overlap between studios and electives seems to be common and effective at this school, but this elective made we wonder where the fine line is between permitted and problematic studio\/design overlap. One elective classmate in particular whose main design project was a diagrid facade structure around the Bauhaus had a project in this elective that was a \"tall version\" of the same diagrid facade system. It felt unfair throughout the studio process, seeing as myteammate and I made a completely different design project for this elective. However, based on the comments from the professor during the final, I guess this team had some special approval to use the same design for two different classes.Finally, the issue of having \u0093friends\u0094 on final reviews hurt this elective as well. Overall, the professor was able to bring in an amazing set of jury members whose main work is tall building design. However, he also brought in his old advisor from MIT, who was not the right fit for the class. The professor, John Fernandez, tried to accuse us of green-washing because we brought up the word sustainability without including any defined sustainable infrastructure within the tower, even though we tried to explain to him that the tower was sustainable simply because it was an ultra-dense community of spaces right next to the city\u0092s main rail station (running on the premise brought up by such individuals as UPenn Professor Witold Rybczynski and Author David Owen concerning \u0093true sustainability\u0094). However, no matter how many times we tried to explain this fact, he simply ignored what we were saying and kept making tangent statements about sustainability and architecture.",
