    "Usually mix of seminar & lecture - our class was small, but the majority of the time was spent with Siemer presenting from a powerpoint, with discussion sprinkled in. It's easy to not pay attention, but I encourage you to really engage in the class - the material is SUPER interesting, Siemer is an expert on all of it, and he explains things really well. Readings tend to come from textbooks giving overviews of the topics, and can be a little long. There are required reading responses, a few exams, and a final paper - all very manageable. Take this class if you're at all interested in emotion \/ cognition!!"

    "I am an undergrad studying Cognitive Science - the class focus was perfect for my theme in the major, and and offered a really amazing exposure to a lot of research that I'd never even been aware of before. It helped with my thesis a bit!",
    "Professor Siemer truly cares about his students and the course material."
