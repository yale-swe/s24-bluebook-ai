   "comments": [
    "Highly recommended. Attracted a great group of students, led by a smart professor, and based on a fine syllabus. A few of the works stand out for being less interesting, but the course as a whole is a great opportunity to either read or re-read classic texts on rhetoric - including some you might not expect to find, such as Machiavelli or Jane Austen. The Lincoln is great, Plato, as always, is a joy, and the discussions in the last week on the nature of different academic departments at Yale and the rhetoric used by those departments was insightful and revealing.Not much work at all - a short (5 pg.) mid-term essay, and a short (10 pg.) final essay, accompanied by one class presentation.",
    "Hopefully you get as good a group of students as I did. If you do, expect a dynamic class covering great works and ideas.",
    "Absolutely! Take this class! It's tough--there's a good deal of reading and, if it's still being offered at 9 a.m., you have to get out of bed and be ready to go. But if you're willing to do it, you're in for a treat. The discussions are fantastic, the texts are classic. This is the quintessential higher-level Humanities seminar. If you're into that, this is awesome.",
    "The course dissects the anatomy and the uses of rhetoric drawing from a broad range of sources.",
    "As I understand it, Rhetoric and Political Order is a course about expressing ideas to other people, and what that does to the ideas themselves. A syllabus on this topic could include all kinds of different things, and ours did, but it never felt incoherent. Instead, the themes of the course felt urgent, and we made progress in pursuing them. The course is taught by the exceptional (and often under-appreciated) Norma Thompson, who has clearly put a lot of thought into seminars and what makes them work. She guides discussion expertly and unobtrusively, which she is able to do mainly because she observes everything going on in a class meeting in a very sophisticated way. She has truly taught me to read better, and she demanded and inspired essays that I'm proud of. Really, take a class with her: I think she's the best teacher I've ever had."
