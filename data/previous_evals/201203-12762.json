    "one of the most incredible learning experiences you'll ever have, yale or otherwise. try to get in and then try to keep up.",
    "YES YES YES YES. If you do anything at Yale, apply to this class. Check-out the class website for a good summary: http:\/\/www.phoenixworks.org\/PLSC260.",
    "The past reviews are reliable. This is an amazing course, but you should allocate the time to invest in it. You will not find another course at Yale that is taught with the level of commitment and knowledge that JBS brings- he is quasi-retired and spends a good portion of his time working on the course. He cares about all of the students in the class tremendously and will be there to support you. Don't leave Yale without taking this course if you have the opportunity.",
    "Yes, highly recommended! Just make sure you have enough time to devote to the course (although the workload is definitely manageable).",
    "This is one of the two best classes at Yale, with the other being his spring offering. You cannot appreciate how amazing JBS's constructivist style is until you've sat through the class yourself. He has spent countless hours trying to craft the best possible two-hour seminar, and it works every time. Even if you have only a distant interest in the subject matter, it is worth it to try and fight your way into this class so that you can learn from the best teachers with many of the best students at Yale.",
    "How do you begin to describe a class like Public Schools and Politics? All of the hype surrounding the course is fair, and it may even be undersold, if that's possible. Professor Starr is the most dedicated professor on the Yale faculty hands down. The casebooks are thoroughly compiled (almost to an obsessive extent), and though the workload in the class is demanding, everyone ends up doing close to 100% of the work. This allows for incredibly productive, and really thoughtful seminar discussions. Truly, I could go on and on, but let me just put it bluntly: this is the best class at Yale. You're lucky to get in, but much more lucky to have the chance to learn from Professor Starr.",
    "This class is excellent. It is structured around different case studies each week - each casebook is approximately 200 pages about a different theme applied in a particular city (e.g. mayoral control in NYC). In class, you will be divided into small groups and participate in a variety of activities that range from simulated union negotiations to crafting school board evaluation rubrics. There is a substantial amount of work (a casebook, study group meeting outside of class, and written assignment every week), but it's worth it.JBS is an extremely dedicated professor who is always available to answer your questions. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of public schools and knows how to facilitate very productive class discussions.",
    "YES. If you don't get in, try next semester, and the next...",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in politics, education or just wants a phenomenal seminar experience at Yale.",
    "JBS is a fantastically dedicated professor, by far one of the best I've had in three and a half years here. He provides incisive and extensive criticism of every piece of work you submit, which proves quite helpful. The reading for this class is substantial (~200\/wk), but the spectre of guilt about failing your classmates (who, unlike in most seminars, you actually become friends with by the end) turns out to be a powerful motivator. In addition to being friendly, those classmates were quite intelligent and creative, which makes for a great learning environment. Weekly meetings are structured as small-group discussions. The professor sets discussion topics and formats and arranges the groups, but otherwise only wanders the room offering clarification on factual matters and the occasional challenge to orthodoxy to stimulate further discussion. The result is a learning experience unlike any you've had at Yale. If you're a serious student, take it, for the love of God.",
    "This is truly the best class I have taken at Yale. This is not overhyped; there's a reason JBS receives perfect evaluations every year. He is the most dedicated professor I have had at Yale (ok, so he's not a \"professor\", he's a lecturer, buthe's better than all the professors). JBS puts an incredible amount of effort into every class, which makes you want to do the same. The material is fascinating and the structure of the course is like no other you'll take at Yale. The case studies, study groups, and in-class group \"schedule\" where you break up into small group discussions makes for a wonderful learning experience. Lastly, JBS does a really good job at picking people to be in the course who are really interested in the material. You will become good friends with your classmates, regardless of year. It's a good amount of work, but very doable. Make sure you start your research for the final paper early, though. This class is very difficult to get into, but if you are persistent and show up every year, you'll get in eventually.",
    "Professor Starr does a great job of selecting students who are interested in the material, interesting themselves, hard-working and motivated to make the course a great experience for all. The class is set up such that each week focuses on a different case study. It is a great way to learn the material and to discuss\/debate specifics, rather than just theory. The course is FANTASTIC. It is entirely discussion-based and the flow of the seminar is refreshing (during class groups are created, rotated and mixed and given different prompts to discuss at each stage). Professor Starr puts more effort into this course than any other professor I've ever had-- he carefully designs each casebook, outlines the structure of each class, and provides lots of detailed feedback along the way. TAKE IT.",
    "This course is clearly well-structured and well-thought out. But a few huge caveats: there is no \"main point,\" so you might leave feeling like you did a lot of reading without learning much useful. And it's not really on education - it's on political systems, with education as a way to learn about them. You'll rarely, if ever, enter a classroom in your readings, which for me was pretty frustrating.",
    "Public Schools and Politics is exactly as the title sounds -- a course about different political issues and models of governance that face public schools in the US. I would highly recommend it for anyone who is even remotely interested in public education, education reform, and politics, both for the content of the class and, arguably more importantly, for the opportunity to study with an extremely dedicated professor and a phenomenal group of students."
