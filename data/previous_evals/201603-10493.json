   "comments": [
    "so much about kids",
    "I learned how to be a better observer. It takes time to learn how to approach and to make the most of the observations at Calvin Hill. When I prepared more before my observation, and did the assigned readings, I got much more out of it. I also connected the observations and knowledge to my own experiences, which was helpful in understanding the material further.",
    "I learned a lot about kids in general as well as developmentally appropriate techniques for teaching them, etc.",
    "This class taught me the basics of how an early childhood learning center can tackle the unique challenges associated with early childhood and develop curriculum that is developmentally appropriate to that age group. This class also provided me with practical examples of early childhood education theory and allowed me to apply what I learned in class to the observations I did at Calvin Hill on a weekly basis.",
    "I learned about what makes a good pre-school (re: teachers, classroom environment, kinds of activities); how children learn; and the importance of highly intentional learning support.",
    "This course was hugely insightful in topics like child development, educational theory and thinking critically about our how political events shape our education. Through weekly observations I obtained skills of working with children to create an enviornement which fosters their growth and development. Also, class discussions and readings allowed me to accrue a huge amount of knowledge about the aspects of a high quality preschool education, the many facets of the development of early childhood and the importance of quality care at these ages.",
    "All that I learned can hardly be summarized so briefly! But here's some of what I'm most grateful for learning: -intro to the policy and political reality of childcare in the U.S. -developmental basics of early childhood -practicalities of organizing a school and communicating with parents, gov't bodies, etc. -how to observe children for signs of developmental progress or troubles -intro to some of the classics in ECE theory and literature -glimpse into the complexity of early childhood and the challenges for those who care for children"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: hand-on learning with the children, Weaknesses: the seminar is much less discussion and much more Dr. Horwitz talking",
    "amazing",
    "The strengths are the readings, the observations, and the professor. Carla is so knowledgeable in every area of early childhood education. One thing that can be improved upon is the integration of the final paper\/project throughout the semester - I feel like if I had been prompted to develop a topic earlier, I could have made the most out of my observations and delved deeper into my subject.",
    "Weakness: The actual classroom meetings can get boring because they are so so long. The readings are also very redundant. Strength: Doing observations at the daycare is so fun!",
    "This course successfully offered an over view of topics that have to deal with early childhood education. However, it may help to trim down the syllabus and focus more thoroughly on slighlty fewer topics or readjust the days so there is more time to discuss certain things.",
    "The practicum component is unforgettable and useful. Though the breadth of the readings is admirable, I wish they were more focused (perhaps one or two books instead of a dozen articles some weeks). It was really interesting to focus our observations on one childI wish we had done that for a longer segment of the class.",
    "Honestly, this has been my favorite course so far at Yale. The discussion was led beautifully with the perfect balance of didactic teacher instruction and participation, both conversationally and with activities. The two hour class flies by and is honestly fun and engaging as well as informative. I would have preferred a paper course booklet instead of online copies but that's probably bc I prefer paper. Other than that, this course was incredible.",
    "I found very few (hardly any?) weaknesses. The strengths are largely in Carla Horwitz's teaching skills, her integrity and wisdom, and her care and forthrightness as a teacher."

   "comments": [
    "Take this class for a writing credit. It's not that much work, just 6 3-5 page journals which are pretty easy to write from all of the observations. The seminar is not great, and the reading is not necessary to participate in conversation, but it is mostly Dr. Horwitz talking and students supplementing what she says with some anecdotes from the observation part of the course. The main and most fulfilling reason to take the course is to work with the kids. They are such a joy and going to observation never feels like going to class- it's a nice break from the stress of the week.",
    "absolutely",
    "Definitely! Everyone can benefit from learning about early childhood education -- it made me think about children, society, and education in a completely new way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to a student who is interested in education or just wants a class that is fun and different from other things that are offered.",
    "Yes. If you think you are interested in children or early edit's kind of a no-brainer.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a friend. Not only is it managable work wise, it really makes learning a fun and exciting experience. Working with the children during observations is a breath of fresh air into the day to day slog of campus life. The faculty who work at Calvin Hill are inspirational and very informative for future working with children. Carla is an incredible wellspring of knowledge who makes a special effort to create a classroom community."
