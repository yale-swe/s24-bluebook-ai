   "comments": [
    "A ton of work. Only take it if you are really dedicated to improving your French skills and willing to put in 2ish hours of work a day.",
    "Great class - you'll learn so much and feel stronger with French! Take it with Madame Koundi!",
    "I took 140 Freshman year after not having taken French senior year of high school or having taken AP French. The beginning was rough because the course material moves very quickly, but in the end, I felt like I learned a tremendous amount of information and really enjoyed my time with my teacher Soumia Koundi. If you're deciding between 130 and 140, I would say that 140 may seem more challenging at first, but it's definitely worth taking because 130 in fact has a harder workload homework wise. If you're ready to keep up with your homework, which may take a fair chunk of time each night, consistently, then you will succeed in the class.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. Every day I looked forward to going to class. It requires a bit of work, but in the end I was really proud of how much I had improved.",
    "Challenging but fullfilling",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants a stronger foundation in french grammar and wants to improve their reading, listening, and speaking skills. I learned a ton and definitely thought the work was manageable.",
    "French 140 is without a doubt a challenging course. However if one is looking to improve one's spoken and written French, or to fulfill one's language requirement, then French 140 is nonetheless a good choice. One must put in a fair amount of time on daily homework for the class, as well as significant additional studying just prior to the usually biweekly assessments, if one wants to have a successful experience in the class. Some of the reading is difficult and boring, and the rote vocabulary and grammar memorization may occasionally get to one, but that is what sucessful language acquisition ultimately looks like. Overall, French 140 is a valuable learning experience, and a good class.",
    "I strongly recommend FREN 140 to anyone who is seriously interested in improving their command of the French language, but would caution them that their progress will reflect the amount of work they put in and that they may experience a healthy struggle at times during the course."
