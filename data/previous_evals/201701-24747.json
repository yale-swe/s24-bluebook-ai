   "comments": [
    "This course gives an excellent introduction to the challenges faced my monetary authorities. We covered relevant papers and talked about financial regulation across the world.",
    "This class was absolutely amazing. Sigga is a wonderful professor. The class is not very structured, so the main skill that I learned through this class was how to manage this lack of a strict structure. Of course, I also learned about financial crises and ways to prevent them. It was also great to learn about the Financial Crisis in depth for the first time.",
    "I developed a better general understanding of financial crises that have taken place around the world and the causes behind them.",
    "Overview of how economic tools involved in macroprudential policy apply in the real world. The course helps connect the theories learned in other econ classes to how econ is implemented in a governmental and more macro setting.",
    "Policy memos, in-depth practitioner-side analysist",
    "Learned extensively about causes and effects of banking and financial crises. Developed a great understanding of different financial systems and their interlinkages."

   "comments": [
    "This course is excellent. You learn a lot through a very reasonable workload. The topics are very relevant and interesting.",
    "Strengths: Sigga is amazing The subject matter is very relevant The student presentations Weaknesses: The textbook was a little weak Some of the readings were a bit technical",
    "Sigga is incredible. It is so amazing to have a professor that is passionate about the subject. Class was once a week and so lecture was long, but Sigga was fantastic.",
    "A lot of information is covered during the course so sometimes it is easy to get lost. Otherwise the material is very relatable and Sighga gives a good range of sources.",
    "More focus on specific in-depth case studies",
    "Great class, gives a great overview of a number of financial crisies and also explains how these crises occurred in first place. Organization of the class was exceptional. Perhaps the only change that would improve the class would be encouraging more student discussions and debates after the lectures and presentations."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely, this course is absolutely necessary to take if you want to understand the hurdles faced by monetary authorities. Basically, you will gain an understanding to the point that you can speak intelligibly about news about economics in the NYTimes.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, whether or not he is an economics major. Learning about how financial crises come about is. I believe, an essential piece of knowledge. Furthermore, Sigga is one of the best professors that I've had--certainly in the economics department, but at Yale more broadly as well. She was engaged with the material, clearly very knowledgeable about it, fun, and very passionate. A wonderful class to go to every week.",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in financial extremes whatsoever. Definitely take. Very cool way of actually learning about parts of economics that are important.",
    "The course has good potential and pretty interesting material, but also has room for improvement. The professor is really knowledgeable about the topic but sometimes overestimates every student's understanding of finance and economics. There were times when certain parts of lectures went over my head because I did not have the adequate foundation to fully understand it. I also think this class could be improved by having it twice a week rather than once. The lectures are pretty dense with technical material and at times it was simply too much to process. That being said, I learned some interesting stuff and the professor was great and understanding of students' needs.",
    "Yes!!! Sigga is very nice and understanding. She also has extensive experience in this field wich makes the material more interesting. Great class that puts econ in a real world experience.",
    "Yes",
    "Would definitely recommend this class! Professor Benediktsdottir is the most knowledgeable on the topic of banking stability and financial crises. Take this as your econ elective!"
