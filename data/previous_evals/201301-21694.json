    "I would recommend this course for any pre-med student looking to fulfil his or her physics requirement. Don't stress yourself out by taking a high level physics. Enjoy learning physics fundamentals, and using the extra time you have to take some other classes that interest you.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to!",
    "Its a rough physics class and the E&M can be a bit brutal do your readings and make sure to keep up with the material.",
    "I have to start off by saying many of the reviews will probably not reflect how this course will turn out next year. Professor Irons was given very little notice that he would be teaching this course, as the previous professor took a sabbatical quite suddenly. As such, the quality and nature of the course changed significantly over the semester, as I'm sure it will if he teaches it next year. Given the circumstances, Irons did a decent job. The beginning of the lecture was pretty shaky, and some math mistakes\/other mistakes were made during lecture. These rough patches were partially ironed out though over the course of the semester.That being said, his teaching style did not work the best for me. His lectures are very math-oriented, and most of it involves laying out obscure derivations and math examples involving differential equations or linear algebra, without touching much on the broader concepts we should be learning. While this teaching method may be valuable for those who appreciate the math examples, it does not appeal to my Biology\/Life Sciences minded way of learning, and I struggled to keep up in the course.However, the professor is quite fair and reasonable. He's really a nice guy, and I can say honestly that he is the only professor I have had who always answered the Piazza questions, my emails, and other in-class comments promptly. I think Irons and this course has a lot of potential, and you can learn a lot, particularly if you are good at self-study. I would recommend the course, if not because you have to take it anyway.",
    "i figure you're only taking this class because you're pre-med and you need it or you're a physics major. regardless you have to take it so hopefully you'll get the class when simon mochrie is back",
    "Strengths+ Professor was nice and easily accessible via Piazza+ Professor took the time to make individual appointments for struggling students+ Learning Catalytics questions were interactive and fun+ Demos were fun to watch and try to understandWeaknesses- Preflight quizzes were stressful and sometimes the wording was confusing; it was not fair to be \"graded\" on material we had no yet learned, but were just beginning to synthesize- No practice midterms accurately reflected the ones given in class- No practice problems or problem set questions accurately reflected the ones on midterms- No sections with TAs to review the week's major concepts- Equation sheet was just a bunch of symbols and numbers thrown onto a sheet, stressful to navigate and understand which equations could be used (in the past, Prof Mochrie would provide titles for the equations on each section, and also include the important equations in midterm\/in-class quiz questions)- Problem Sets took hours, with multiple parts. Having aset number of problems and parts would have been helpful for learning to budget study and homework time.- ALSO: Prof Irons needs to review his notes before class instead of making multiple last-minute corrections on the board - it confuses his students. He also needs to speak clearly, and make sure to end his sentences coherently. He often would begin to make a statement, then trail off without completing his thought.",
    "piazza literally made me insane.",
    "Another boring introductory class: check!",
    "Not with Irons. Most definitely not. His assignments and tests are much harder than should be if correlated to his awful teaching capacity. Often, he spent much of lecture ignoring the entire class and muttering to himself at the board as he got confused by his own equations. His class notes are confusing, often flat-out wrong, and his \"class summaries\" cover entire chapters of the much-too-advanced textbook we never mentioned in class but are somehow supposed to know. Trying to decipher any sort of organized syllabus was impossible and made this class far more work than the 1 credit it is, as did the million technological apparatuses Irons used (preflight quizzes pre-lecture, learning catalytics questions in lecture, piazza for post-lecture class summaries), as was the fact that there were NO sections yet weekly psets for a 150+ person class. E&M physics is on its own not intuitive and hard stuff, but having an inexperienced teacher made it much worse. Mochrie's is an INFINITELY better-organized and thus more-manageable class, but unfortunately Mochrie has given up 171 for good. Irons also taught it exactly like 181--not a single biological application. On the plus side, he's very attentive to answering questions\/piazza and meeting with you. Irons is a nice guy and in the end you feel sorry for him. Still, I don't think I've ever walked into a final feeling as thoroughly unprepared as I did for this class.",
    "This was a pretty poor course. Professor Irons, nice as he was, was not experienced enough to be teaching this class, and as a result he was very ineffective as a teacher. The book was terrible. And overall, I felt pretty hopeless throughout the semester about my ability to understand any of the material.Overall there was no structure to the class. It was hard to know what we were supposed to learn when. The ONLY reason I did not fail was because I bought a separate text book and taught myself the material before exams. Yale had nothing to do with it.I do not think that I could recommend Yale to an incoming student interested in physics after this experience. And for incoming physics students, AVOID taking this course if Professor Irons is teaching it. Like I said I feel bad saying this because he is SO nice, but he just doesn't have enough experience to teach this course. Take PHYS 181 if the teaching is better.",
    "Don't take this class. It is poorly taught, exams don't match the material (honestly, you might as well not study at all), problem sets are almost impossible and it is difficult to get the TAs' time for help on them, it is unclear how to study and never becomes clear... Avoid it.",
    "I mean. It's a premed requirement. So you have to take it. Its as painless as possible so thats good.",
    "Only if the teaching style improves",
    "It's physics. Learning electricity and magnetism is actually kind of cool, but this was not an enjoyable way in which to do it. Psets are wayyyy too long and hard. Exams are largely OK though. It was not cool that we had pre-class quizzes 3 times a week.",
    "NO. just NO. I would recommend it if Professor Mochrie (not Stephen Irons) teaching it, though. 170 (fall semester) with Mochrie was tedious, but he's organized and I never doubted that he understood physics. I'm pretty sure 171 with Mochrie wouldn't be too bad since 170 and 171 are supposed to be similarly structured.",
    "Not if professor irons is teaching it. such a train wreck of a class. prepare to study your ass off and teach yourself high level calculus and then get ready to leave each exam feeling like the worlds biggest failure when you cant answer over 80% of the questions",
    "This was the worst class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Tough to follow along, but try. Lots of work and not fun",
    "Stephen Irons is a super nice, funny man, but not a great basic physics instructor. The material is hard to follow and keep up with. However, the whole class feels that way and you're probably taking the course because you have to, so just take it and get it over with.",
    "A regrettable necessity.",
    "If Mochrie is teaching the course, and there are adequate TA sessions and peer tutors, then you will be fine. Just go to lots of help sessions; don't try to do everything on your own.If you are considering this class, you probably don't like physics that much but are required to take a physics class. You will learn some physics, but it will probably be a huge stressful struggle that takes up all of your time.I don't know why they made a physics class for biology majors that consumes everyone's time, when we are here to learn biology, and would much rather spend our time on our biology classes.",
    "Avoid Irons at all costs. I'll let other students tell you why.",
    "If you have to...",
    "It's so bad.",
    "Ugh. There was not a single thing good about this class. This was not Physics of Biological Sciences at all, it may as wellhave been 181.",
    "It's a very diffcult class that takes a lot of time if you want to truly understand the material, if not it can be managable to get through the class but also very very painful.",
    "Physics 171 is normally supposed to be Physics II with some life sciences involved, but because Professor Irons replaced Professor Mochrie on short notice, this class turned out to be more Phys 181, which is great for MCAT prep. Nothing special, just your basic second semester physics.",
    "I've heard that this course is less math intensive that PHYS181, but in terms of management, organization and overall difficulty it's probably not any different. In general it's not suggested to switchfrom PHYS170 to PHYS181, so I would suggest sticking with PHYS171.",
    "This was unfortunate because Professor Irons actually graded on a real curve instead of Professor Mochrie's \"give-everyone-an-A\" style. TAKE IT WITH MOCHRIE.",
    "Lecture isn't bad, but be prepared to devote a lot of time to the problem sets. It might be difficult but try to keep up with the reading, that'll make the problem sets easier.",
    "Chances are, you have to take this class. I enjoyed it with Prof. Irons but I'm not sure it will be taught by him again next spring. The problem sets were easier under Prof. Irons but the exams were harder - less math and more conceptual, certainly not as predictable as Prof. Mochrie's tests were. Lectures were a little rocky sometimes because Prof. Irons was notified only a week before the semester began that he had to teach it. He does a good job focusing on applying equations rather than deriving them (because who would remember that anyway). He's a very fair teacher. Piazza is great resource to go to for questions and answers - more people should use it. Greater usage seems to correlate with higher exam scores. You find out what you don't know on it.",
    "WORST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT YALE DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH STEPHEN. Beyond awful teaching, hard tests, annoying preflight quizzes...the list goes on. Stephen is the worst professor I've had at Yale. No section to review the material that was never properly taught. Good luck if you have to take this class with Stephen.",
    "Worst class I've taken at Yale. I cannot caution you enough against taking it.",
    "This course is a basic overview of the fundamentals of physics, with a strong emphasis on electricity and magnetism. To be honest, this is the worst class I have taken at Yale. I went into the semester, after shopping PHYS 181 and 201, hoping to master basics of E&M under the guidance of Prof. Irons, and it never happened. After much hard work and the use of outside materials, I was successful in the course. But, in my opinion, students at Yale should not have to use a plethora of outside courses to succeed in an introductory physics course! The physics department needs to consider seriously how they teach basic physics.",
    "Take it with another professor.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you have to take it. Expect to put ina lot of work and not necessarily have it pay off.",
    "I'm not quite sure how the situation will change next year, but PHYS 171 with Stephen Irons is not the easy A that PHYS 171 is with Simon Mochrie.",
    "Take it if you must, wish it were better, physics is cool and this was a terrible experience in terms of class and teaching, wait for a better teacher if possible, good of you are along the MCAT at same time and take physics lab, very difficult to understand and conceptualizer topics without such background if teaching is not good.",
    "Basic second semester physics course. There were definitely no connections to biology or the life sciences though, so don't expect to get that (it's not like PHYSICS 170 which was clearly geared toward pre-meds and bio majors).Professor Irons took some getting used to because he had a very different style than Professor Mochrie, who taught Physics 170 when I took it, but once I got used to his new style I liked it. Professor Irons put a TON of time and effort into teaching this course and making sure students understood the material. He is very understanding and easy to talk to. In order to get the most out of class you have to stay on top of the reading, the in-class LC questions, the pre-flight quizzes before every class, and the psets. There is a lot of work outside of class so this takes some getting used to. The tests were generally fair but not easy--I found them too long and was always rushing to finish. But when I think back to the beginning of the semester I realize I learned a lot.This was also Professor Irons' first semester teaching the course so a lot of the bumps will probably be ironed out if he teaches it again next year.",
    "This was one of the worst classes I have ever had the displeasure of taking at Yale. While Professor Irons is very nice and a great human being, he failed to teach the course material in a way that was even remotely understandable to anybody who has not had previous exposure to physics. The lack of formal sections to help review lecture material and complete problem sets was very nerve-wracking. The preflight quizzes did more to stress me out than to actually help me learn since there were so many of them and the wording of the questions and the relevant textbook material was always ambiguous. Most of this class was spent trying to teach physics to myself, and had I not have taken physics in high school, I would have drowned in the material.",
    "You probably have to do it. Take it over any other physics course if physics isn't your one true love and you have to take a physics course. Mochrie will be great, so sad that he had to leave us this past semester. Good luck.",
    "So many feelings about this class. I'll say this: my least favorite class I've taken at Yale. Now, this is due to a few factors, one of which is that I just wasn't that interested in the material. However, on top of that, the class was generally disorganized for half of the semester, where explanations were muddy and interspersed with random demos, and precious lecture time was spent with long derivations of questionable relevance to our understanding. A couple gaping pitfalls of the course were: 1.) Very minimal practice for the exams, which were in turn, pretty difficult. For someone (like me) to whom Physics E&M doesn't come super intuitively, practice is important, and this course lacked it very much so. 2.) The lack of a section. TF-led sections would have helped this class a lot, especially because so much of the material was conceptual knowledge that is better explained in different ways, multiple times, which is the function of a regular weekly section. 3.) Very questionable effectiveness of the professor. Prof. Irons got better as the semester went on, but a *good* professor is much more important to me in a difficult-to-grasp subject like E&M physics. That said, Prof. Irons is very approachable and willing to explain things if you make the effort. Lecture isn't the best use of your time, but study groups and office hours can be effective. You will have to try hard in this class to do well, even without the normal resources that you may be used to.",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!!!(note, this next paragraph was added after [planned]grade distributions were posted):Never would I have imagined that the grades of an intro physics class would be curved to a B. While I did acceptably, Prof. Mochrie's curves were significantly fairer.As to the teacher, Prof. Irons is akin to an incontinent puppy: absolutely adorable, but nonetheless unable to do anything without causing a giant mess. This has been the only class I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken where it was more productive to simply stay home and read the book instead of attending lecture. While the demos were most interesting and amusing, they hardly made up for the terrible lectures, which were characterised by bumbling ineptitude, useless algebraic calculations (during which he made a least one mistake per class), and mind-numbing explanations that often confused rather than clarified. I utterly failed the first midterm before realising that if I wanted to pass this class, I would need to take matters into my own hands; like many (read: most) of my classmates, we requested personal tutors who, frankly, were more helpful than the professor.I will qualify this by stating that Prof. Irons is *brilliant* outside of class (e.g. when I went to office hours to review the first midterm). Additionally, he did improve significantly by the end of the semester, and it was evident that he was trying to help us learn. He also had a lot going against him: he apparently was notified that he would be teaching this course about two weeks before it began.Nevertheless, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend that you take this course with him. Were he teaching PHYS 6xx or some higher-level course (or a seminar), I think he would be wonderful.Proportionally, this class was MUCH more work than 170.",
    "I would not recommend this course under the tutelage of Professor Irons, but it is a requirement for many students.",
    "No. It was way too much work and way too confusingly organized.",
    "Take it if you have to but seriously avoid taking with Irons",
    "It's a challenging class, but it teaches you the physics you need to know.",
    "Very poorly taught but material was reasonable and fair. If you keep up with homework and readings, you should be fine for the course",
    "I took Physics 200 first semester and that was pretty awful. At least the material in this class inherently takes less work. In general, you're not going to find a good introductory physics class (short of Physics 260, maybe). Take it because you have to.",
    "If you need to take it then it's doable, but don't take it just for the interest in physics.",
    "Only if you need to take it.",
    "Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t takethis course with Irons.It was the most frustrating experience of my Yale career.The test aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair, they reflect none of the practice problems or homework problems. Lecture is a mess, with Irons bumbling whenever a question is asked.He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of funny though, and awesome one-on-one, but a terrible lecturer.",
    "Professor Irons cares a lot about our learning physics. He made every effort to give us the available resources and kept us accountable for our work through preflight quizzes and problem sets. People may complain about the grading in these reviews, but the grades were not unfair. It is true, though, that the curve is a little bit low. Professor Irons is not a fantastic lecturer, though he gives good demos.",
    "Physics 171 this semester felt more like an independent study. We did not have formal sections, which made things really difficult, and I didn't find the lectures particularly helpful. I would not recommend this course.",
    "This isn't physics. This is pure math. Derivations, calculus, and attempting to figure out how an equation can be set up to represent the problem at hand. The class also ended up being curved very differently from the first semester, and this lack of continuity was extremely frustrating. Take it if you must, but maybe 181 is a better option.",
    "PHYS 171 is a challenging yet very rewarding class. I found it very helpful to go to class and take good notes, which helped to better understand the more complicated information presented in the book. The online resources such as the learning catalytic questions and the piazza forum are also very useful, and I would definitely take advantage of that. Also, go to the study halls, as they are a great way to understand what is being asked on the pset, rather than staring at it for hours and hours by yourself in the library.The more you invest in this class, the more you will get out of it.",
    "This class is good, only if you have to finish physics. Be prepared to learn a lot of things yourself.",
    "Screw 170\/171. Take 260\/261. Challenge yourself. Appreciate what you are learning.",
    "I can't say enough bad things about this course taught by Irons. I know my review won't do it justice. Don't take this class if its taught by Irons. Wait it out for another professor who can actually teach and explain things. It's a miserable experience...if you're a physics whiz, sure, take it because the teaching doesn't matter to you, but if you're someone who likes to be TAUGHT, don't take this. I worked my butt off in this class, and it was still impossible. Irons makes it difficult to succeed, which is unfair given his own lack of teaching talent.",
    "Stephen Irons did the best he could with what he was given. He's not Simon Mochrie but it's unrealistic to expect him to be, and plus you'll probably be tkaing this class with Simon anyway. I thought he was a fine professor, but then again I didn't go to class much. Ended up doing really well because you don't really need to be in class to learn physics, but there you have it. I thought the examinations were fair, the homework was challenging but not overly so. Would have appreciated more specific applications to biology though, this is an intro class geared towards biology, or it was supposed to be. So that could be improved upon. Kind of a meh class. Not really worth getting worked up about. My time at Yale could ahve been spent much more usefully, but if you're taking this class the odds are you have to take it, and there's only so much you can do to make basic introductory physics interesting",
    "If you have Irons, it will be much harder than with Mochrie. So watch out for that.",
    "Physics 171 was interesting but challenging. take it if you have to for a major requirement, and always go see the professor and\/or TA's when you feel you're falling behind, because it only gets worse throughout!",
    "Professor Irons is definitely different from Professor Mochrie in terms of teaching style and class structure, but his class isn't bad. It's probably more self-study, but he emphasizes conceptual learning more than computational which I thought was an improvement. The material itself in PHYS171 is also generally tougher than in 170 so you should keep that in mind.",
    "Take it if you must. But I would recommend considering 181.",
    "Phys 171 was different than in past years, with a new professor. There is a bit of a learning curve, especially in terms of some possibly new mathematical concepts. However, I believe with the right help, it is possible to bridge the gap between the material in lecture and on the psets. I believe the exams were fairly correlated with the hw\/class material. I would be aware of the online preflight quizzes that sometimes take a bit more time to complete by consulting the text on material often not yet covered in class (of note: the professor made these graded on correctness, not just completion; a change made after the start of the semester). Additionally, there were no formal sections for this class which would have proven helpful for understanding concepts\/abstract ideas. The study halls are helpful, but this year there was a poor TA to student ratio. Professor Irons is approachable and provides a number of resources, including his helpful class summaries online. There was limited discussion of physics in the context of the life sciences. Lastly, the older version of the book required for this course was much more in line with the online quizzes (and possibly even teaching\/hw material?), vs. the newer version used in other courses.",
    "Avoid Professor Irons at all costs. He's bar none the worst professor I've ever had at Yale, and I've had some bad ones. A very hard grader (before and after the curve), and he can't explain physics to save his life. I'm sure it's fine with Mochrie if 170 was any indication. But if you want to take it a semester that Irons is teaching, don't! Even if it messes up your schedule, it'll be worth it.",
    "physics will be hard no matter what. take advantage of all resources including study halls, TA office hours, Piazza, practice problems online. Prof Irons is very approachable, and always available to talk to students.",
    "ABSOLUTELY NOT. Do not take this class with Professor Irons. If you do decide to take it, wait until Professor Mochrie is back. There is not enough space to tell you the numerous reason not to take this class. It ruined my semester.",
    "I was sorely disappointed with this class. Professor Irons may be very knowledgeable about the subject, but his sill in communicating that knowledge is quite poor. Students were regularly lost, not because the subject matter was some kind of arcane craft, but because Dr. Irons always managed to get confused in the math or fail to emphasize the salient conceptual points. Also, there was very little biological relevance. This only emphasized the disconnect when he was teaching to a population of students who had self-selected for their interest in biology. Overall, this class was mediocre, but Dr. Irons' teaching style was depressingly poor.",
    "If Mochrie is teaching this course, it will probably be good. If Irons is teaching it, expect an easier, poorly taught version of phys 181. No biology.",
    "No.",
    "There are no good intro physics options at Yale, or at least there weren't this year, but I encourage you to shop your brains out and take whichever course has the best professor, no matter how advanced the course is (within reason). I say this because I think it is perfectly possible that PHYS 171 could have been a good class if Professor Irons wasn't such a disorganized lecturer with such low confidence. Even when he was giving us one final speech intended to be an impassioned advocacy for the use of physics in life, he failed miserably. Please don't take a class with him.",
    "dont take it with stephens--have i learned anything... doubtful...learned more from lab than anything from lecture.",
    "This semester is PHYS 171 was just...a mess. I imagine it is not like this every semester, and that this only happened because Simon Mochrie left at the end of last semester and no real replacement was found until maybe a week, two weeks, before the class started. Even then, the course was just a mess because there was such a shift from what the student expected the course to be to what the course actually was. The instructor seemed incredibly unprepared at times for the material, which might have been due to the quick notice of teaching following Mochrie.True, the class demonstrations were really enjoyable and cool, but none of that really helps the average student taking the class (probably a pre-med) to achieve what he or she was aiming to achieve (gaining the physics knowledge necessary to pass the MCAT). This class, taught by Professor Irons, was more conceptual and less applicable, which was very different than how Mochrie had approached the course.I would recommend this class only if Professor Mochrie is teaching it. Otherwise, I would be slightly worried.",
    "PHYS 171 with Stephen Irons was not a great class. Dr. Irons is a very nice guy and went to great lengths to make himself available to students, but he is just not a strong lecturer. His frequent pauses and moments of apparent indecisiveness about the material made it very hard to leave lecture feeling like knowledge had been gained most of the time. I ended up using my notes from my high school Physics C AP class rather than my PHYS 171 lecture notes to study for the exams, and I found them to be far more helpful than the PHYS 171 lecture notes. Given that, in my experiences and those of most of my peers, there are few good options for intro physics courses at Yale, PHYS 171 may be the lesser of three evils for pre-med students and science majors. One good thing about the class is that the accompanying lab (PHYS 166L) lines up nicely with the lecture and is not too strenuous a course. The TA help sessions Sundays-Tuesdays for PHYS 171 were also a great help when working on problem sets, and my friends and I found almost all of the TAs to be very competent and helpful. Finally, Dr. Irons is not the usual teacher for PHYS 171, so it may be a very different class with Prof. Mochrie or whoever is the usual teacher.",
    "DO NOT take this class with Professor Irons! He is not helpful. Wait for Professor Mochrie to take this class. This class was poorly structured. Professor Irons wrote a final exam to screw us over. He doesnt listen to the needs of his students. i put in a lot of hours each week but in the end still did poorly in this class. Simply put, do not take this class unless you have to, but if you can add taking it with Professor Irons.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course with Stephen Irons. Wait for Simon Mochrie.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. If you've never taken physics before, good luck keeping your head afloat. Even if you have taken physics, it's still horribly taught and difficult. Really awful course. Probably the worst course I've ever taken at Yale. The professor had a big heart, but was really not a good lecturer. Particularly in the beginning, his notes were scattered, he always made mistakes (like even on pythagorean theorem), and it was difficult to understand his thought process because he would say one thing, then take back what he said then erase something, then do something else. He really made learning physics difficult. The psets were impossible to do on your own because they didn't line up with his lectures. He doesn't do practice problems so you don't know how to solve questions that he puts on the tests or psets. One of the worst lecturers I've had at Yale. Really not helpful in learning introductory material. TA's didn't go to lecture so there was a disconnect there as well. You had NO IDEA what to expect on the midterm and finals because his psets were all on their own, his practice midterms were all taken from the previous professor or phys 180, and same with the final. Basically the TAs, the psets, his lectures, his tests, and his practice tests WERE ALL SCATTERED OVER THE PLACE. Worst science class I've taken at Yale.Professor Irons muttered, stuttered, made countless errors in his lectures and notes. It was hard to understand him and his thought process. He never did sample problems, and showed a bunch of demonstrations that ultimately weren't helpful to further understanding E&M. He's a very kind and very nice guy. But has little to none lecture skills. He made simple errors all the time. He sometimes stood for 15 seconds silent looking at his own work confused and flustered. He'd made changes on the whim towhat he wrote on the board and oftentimes confused the whole class.",
    "If you take Physics 171, be ready to do a lot of work outside of class. The problem sets and exams are not easy. Dont expect it to be like phys 170 and be ready to do a lot of practice problems.",
    "Physics 171 was a good introduction into the physics of E and M. I thought that the course did a great job of emphasizing the conceptual understanding of the physics, except for the harmonic motion bit in the beginning which was a bit confusing and complicated. Overall though, a good intro physics class with a manageable workload.",
    "Worst class at Yale, possibly. Avoid ad all costs if Irons is teaching it. Hopefully Mochrie will teach it (as he teaches Physics 170) in the future) because I don't recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Professor Irons is going to get terrible reviews for several reasons: 1) He replaced a much beloved professor on short notice. 2) He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never taught this class before 3) 171 is full of high strung and anxious pre-meds to whom grades are extremely important 4) He wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a very good teacher, and was extremely defensive about that fact 5) Physics is a tough subject and all of the above factors combined made it a miserable experience.However, before I give my review, I would like to say that Professor Irons is not a mean professor or a bad person (trust me, Yale has plenty of those.) It is obvious from his emails to the class that he cares deeply about the students. For that, I give him credit. The problem is not that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to teach well or doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want us to succeed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he simply has no conception of how to properly teach this kind of lecture course. At least the demos were cool.My perspective:The Pre-Flight quizzes are ineffective and annoying. There should not be quizzes on days that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have class; everyone I know always forgot to do them. In-class quizzes are better than online quizzes because they require you to actually prepare, rather than just google the answers. Working problems is more useful than multiple choice questions.The readings were good, but Professor Irons would never say the subject of the readings, just the chapter, so if you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the same textbook you just sort of had to guess what you should read based on the syllabus, and it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always match up.I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if Professor Irons worked out the mathematical problems beforehand, but assuming that he did based on the sheet of paper he usually had in his hand, for the love of God, do the problem correctly the first time. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confusing enough to try and follow someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mathematical reasoning without having to work the problem three times because the professor got the wrong answer and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t figure out what he did. Speaking of which \u00e2\u0080\u0093 most students in 171 have not taken linear algebra\u00e2\u0080\u0094don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it. When there is math, it needs to explain it step by step because not everyone is strong in calculus (or else we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be in 180.)Reinstate formal sections. The claim was that there were not enough TAs for section; hire more or get peer tutors to teach section. If we had enough TAs for \u00e2\u0080\u009cstudy hall\u00e2\u0080\u009d (which was useless) then we should be able to have section.The problem sets for this course have consistently been too difficult. A problem set is supposed to help you practice what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned, not ask questions about things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re weeks away from covering.Professor Irons did not take criticism well. If people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be learning in class \u00e2\u0080\u0093 try something new! He was also very hard to stop mid-lecture for questions\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is a key skill that serves any teacher well.This class had hard midterms and a hard final and a low class average overall. But it was curved, so that was some help\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wound up with a B+ which I think is consistent with my performance. I hope my criticisms are taken seriously because I think they would improve the course no matter who is teaching it. In conclusion, I would wait to take this class until either Professor Mochrie comes back or another more seasoned professor takes over.",
    "Yes, if a physics course is required.",
    "Physics 171 is an introductory overview of simple harmonic motion and electromagnetism. I would recommend the course, but with the reservation that this course will need a considerable amount of attention throughout the semester. Like I said, I enjoyed learning the concepts and taking this course, but that is mainly because I really felt as though I knew my stuff and put in the work.",
    "IF PROFESSOR IRONS IS TEACHING THIS CLASS DO NOOT TAKE IT! TAKE YOUR CHANCES WITH 180 WHICH IS ACTUALLY WELL TAUGHT.Also, if you are a Bio major you are probably wondering why you are even taking this class. The biology dept should take a really hard look at their curriculum and WHY a student studying ecology and evolutionary biology needs to be in a class studying electricity and magnetism.#questionsthatneedanswers"
