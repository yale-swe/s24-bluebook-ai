    "The course taught students how to write clearly and concisely about their topics for their theses. It also focused on professional development.",
    "How to approach a year long project by breaking it down into steps.",
    "I learned the importance of time management, as well as the value of peer review and presenting my progress to others. I wish more classes were run in such a collaborative form.",
    "I developed a much stronger working knowledge of how to build and structure a piece of academic work. This included such skills as how to write an abstract, how to properly cite, and how to critique the work of others.",
    "This course was very helpful in thinking about how to approach the senior essay--how to engage with previous literature, how to hone in on a topic, etc. It was also very helpful to hear how my classmates were doing, because it offered insight into how others approach the same problems."

    "The course would greatly benefit from teaching students different methodologies of investigation; when to perform experiments, how to analyze data, when to use a particular corpus, etc. Much of this \"how to perform high-level linguistics research\" was touched on only in passing. Many of the student's projects could have benefitted from this information and shaped their projects' development over the course of the class in a beneficial way. More emphasis on combining different fields of linguistics in the thesis could have been put in place. Many students wanted to remain just within their subfield and seemed reluctant to branch out, even when another subfield had an answer for why a phenomenon was the way it was.",
    "I wish I had felt more accountable to my peers in doing a good job with my work. It felt very self-motivated and I wasn't very motivated to do schoolwork this semester.",
    "'Twas an excellent course! Raffaella is both an amazing teacher and an amazing human being, and it is also very fun to have a chance to get together with all the ling majors every week. As for the course work, I thought that having this course is a great way to approach the writing of a senior thesis: We spend the whole semester doing small components of the thesis, so it didn't feel like I ever had too much work at any given time...but then, at the end of the semester, it was very satisfying to put it all together and to realize how much content I had actually generated!",
    "I like that this course provides very reasonable goals each week and lets students learn from one another. I think it would be useful if students were encouraged more consistently to meet with their advisors, since I think some of us weren't diligent about doing this."

    "If you're a linguistics major, you have to take this. If you're not a linguistics major, you should be a linguistics major, and then you'd have to take this. This is basically a course that helps you prepare for writing the senior essay. There are doable weekly assignments. It would help to come in with your topic already chosen (I did not), but if Raffaella is teaching it, she's really kind and will help you at whatever point you're at. It wasn't a ton of work and propelled me to actually settle on a topic, which is a pretty big deal. There's a lot of presenting your assignment to the class and then getting feedback from the other students. Linguistics majors are the best, so that was good. There was also FOOD. This semester, our final assignment was a senior essay \"skeleton\", which was basically an outline with some parts filled in (an abstract, some literature reviews, a list of references, etc.). It was basically just a combination of everything we'd produced over the course of the semester. A good start for the senior essay and totally reasonable.",
    "I would recommend to senior linguistics majors!",
    "Yes... well, if you're considering this class, you probably have to take it. :)",
    "It's a thesis class so, hard to say. But yeah it was worth taking.",
    "Yes for sure! Though of course you probably don't have much choice, it being a major requirement. But I would recommend it even if it were optional!",
    "One of the great things about the linguistics major is that you get to meet weekly with the seniors and hear how everyone is doing on their senior projects. This was a really enjoyable class, and you should be looking forward to it!"
