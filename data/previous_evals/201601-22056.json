   "comments": [
    "The class is more than a survey of Chinese history, but it also provide the latest news about China nowadays.",
    "Survey course of Chinese history from 1949 until the present. Focuses much less on the details of the political history to instead stress big thematic changes in Chinese society, politics and culture. I recommend this class to people without a significant background in China as a great introduction to the country and its context today. Grading is fairly easy (midterm, two short essays, and a final) and workload totally manageable. Easily taken as an interesting fifth class!",
    "Definitely take this class if you don't know much about recent Chinese history, or if you know a little and are looking to know more.",
    "An exploration of post-revolutionary China's history, organized thematically, rather than chronologically. Economic, political, social, intellectual, religious, educational, ideological, and labor history, all in one semester!",
    "A very good take on modern Chinese history -- thematically written, the course pulled together scholarship from history, architecture, ethnography, sociology, ethnography, and journalism to present a well rounded look of the changes and continuities in Chinese history over the course of the past century. Definite strengths on course design, engaging lectures, and a reasonable work load. Room for improvement on moving the second paper up in the schedule so it isn't due right before exams and possibly changing out some of the themes (maybe add foreign relations, SAR, art, etc.). Definitely worth taking if you need an intro w\/ some depth to Chinese history.",
    "Take this!! Professor Ho is fantastic, the teaching fellows were the best that Ive had at Yale, and the title of the course cant be beat! Im a history major, but this class is approachable to everyone and has a very reasonable course load. I found myself actually looking forward to lecture, section, AND the readings, and if that doesnt make you want to take this class, I dont know what else would.",
    "This course provides a fast but focused examination of recent Chinese history. It moves mostly from topic to topic and compares the present\/post 70s developments to the Mao era. It's a lot of material, and exams are pretty rigorous, so I would say it wasn't great as a Credit\/D\/Fail class. There were students auditing, however, and I think they got quite a bit out of the lectures.",
    "Take this if you're interested in contemporary Chinese issues, because so much of what happened in the Mao period affects what's happening now!",
    "This is quite possibly one of the most important classes I have ever taken. If you have any interest in China at all, this class will be amazing for you. It is a window into both the events and the historical narrative of modern China, and will allow you to draw connections between time periods that are essential for understanding China today and in the future. The course begins with a brief \"crash course\" in the chronology of events (form Mao's rise to power in the 1940s to the present day), and then proceeds to examine different areas (government, political, economics, society, religion, consumer culture, etc) individually and how they changed or stayed the same from Mao to now. Professor Ho is fantastic. She is very knowledgeable, cares about both the material and running an effective class, and wants to get to know her students. The lectures are fast paced, and you have to be ready to take intense notes, but if you do you will be well-prepared for the exams, which are very fair. I would recommend this class to anyone - you will learn so much.",
    "Pretty reading-heavy, interesting history class with a medium courseload and very labor-heavy exams, which require extensive preparation. Also, a professor who isn't the best lecturer, but who I've heard great things about as a person.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. Professor Ho and the teaching fellows do a great job of giving students a feel for issues that dominated both the Mao era and today, and it becomes clear throughout the course how China has changed and how it has stayed the same. Definitely a very unique country with a unique history compared to western nations, and also a major player on the worlds stage today. In my opinion, everyone should learn a bit about what China is like now and how it got there, and this class is a good way to do so.",
    "If you are at all interested in contemporary Chinese history this is the class to take. Really if you're just looking for a history credit this is the class to take. Really engaging course. Would highly recommend to anyone interested."
