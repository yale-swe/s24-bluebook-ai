   "comments": [
    "Strengths: discussion sections were great - should have more of those (not longer sessions, just more). Weaknesses: too much material presented in slide form. There is a wide variety of topics taught in this class, all of which were important. But it felt like there was too much crammed into the powerpoint slides. It was a 2-hr lecture that crammed 100 slides and it felt like we were flying through them without much time for questions. Professor Ferrucci did the best job she could fielding our questions, but there was no way she could have made sure we understood the concepts when she had less time to go through the content than was necessary. Some slides we literally skipped over. Maybe the slide decks can be condensed into just what's important, which would allow professor Ferrucci to speak more to each slide. Also, not all the information needs to be included in the slides. It would be great if the instruction was based more on the professor's knowledge - that would encourage us to take good notes and understand everything better.",
    "Good course for individuals interested in nutrition and chronic disease. My only complaint is that there was such a strong focus on memorization.",
    "Extremely broad class covering many topics. It was extremely insightful and interesting!",
    "I really loved this course. It's a great overview\/introduction to different concepts behind nutrition for people who are really unfamiliar with the field. The lectures can get a bit science heavy, but Leah definitely doesn't expect you to deeply understand the biochemistry behind diabetes. I really liked the set up of lecture and section\/homework review, and the midterms and finals were fair and straightforward. I do think it might be more helpful to have the homework relate more to the concepts from lecture, just so that we could have that material reinforced during section. Or maybe try to spend the first 10 minutes of section reviewing difficult concepts or answering questions? Overall, I really loved this class.",
    "Strength: Very interesting topic & I learned a lot of useful information from this course. Weakness: I don't have a specific idea but more interactive activities might be more engaging but I learned a lot with a lot of information.",
    "I liked that we learned about nutrition in a policy context, and I wish there was more of that!",
    "Strengths- the material of this course is extremely important to learn. Nutrition is a critical part of public health and this course taught important information of how adequate nutrition can prevent chronic diseases. I enjoyed discussion sections, where material was conversed over and it solidified understanding of concepts learned in lecture. I also really liked the small class size of this course, it allowed for a more conducive learning environment. Weakness- I did not enjoy memorizing material for exams of this course. I did not feel that this helped me learn about nutrition.",
    "This was by far my favorite class of the semester. I thoroughly enjoyed the topics discussed throughout the semester. However, this course was very fast paced and covered A LOT of information. For this reason, I believe this course could be broken down into two different courses... like a part one offered in the fall and a part two offered in the spring. I believe this would make the course feel less rushed and would allow us to spend more time learning about each of the topics in depth."

    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Dr. Ferrucci is awesome and knows a ton on this subject, with impressive research. See notes in overall assessment section for ideas for improved teaching methods.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0The instructor is super sweet! She already responds to student's questions and even if she doesn't know the answer to a question will often look into it on her own time.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Professor Ferrucci is extremely kind, responsive to students, and passionate about the subject. I can't recommend her enough!",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Professor is great. She is invested in the students, the material, and in making sure everyone has the best experience in class.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Leah is an amazing professor and a very nice person. she is accessible and really cares for her student. She had a lot of experience and knowledge. she is well organized and the course was really great. as a medical student i learned a lot in this course about nutrition.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Leah is great! Good lecturer, totally understanding of extenuating circumstances that might come up outside of class, and always available to answer questions. She also makes really great powerpoints.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Hi Leah, Thank you so much for your help & support for all of us. I really appreciated you for understanding our circumstances and your effort to include more interactive activities & lectures full of interesting & helpful information. I think if you could focus more on the content that you think we should really know, and less emphasis on the less important material could help us.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Professor Ferrucci is a very clear instructor! Very well prepared, and I enjoyed her organized teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Strengths- Dr. Ferrucci was very responsive to questions and graded fairly. I really enjoyed her lectures and she covered material that was interesting for us to learn.",
    "Instructor: Leah McArthur Ferrucci \u00a0Dr. Ferrucci is by far one of the best instructors at YSPH. She truly cares about her students and wants them to succeed. I also believe that since Dr. Ferrucci obtained her MPH from Yale, she relates to us more than other professors and understands exactly what we are going through."

   "comments": [
    "Great knowledge gains, requires a lot of memorization, and a significant amount of time to complete homework assignments. But that's ok because you discuss those assignments in depth on Thursdays and working through those questions allows you to form your own opinions.",

    "I would recommend this course to other students of epidemiology focus. I learned a lot of information that are relevant to students pursuing CDE & EMD.",
    "I took this course because it was required as a CDE elective, and I would recommend this course out of the 4 required courses.",
    "This is one of the most interesting and enjoyable courses I've taken at YSPH. There are about 9 different homework assignments given throughout the semester, some of which require more time than others. The only exams are a midterm and a final exam. It is not hard to do well on the exams since you know exactly what to expect going into each of them. However, since this course covers a lot of information, be prepared to put in quite a bit of study time when preparing for each exam."
