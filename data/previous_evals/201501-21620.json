    "Definitely for anyone interested in anthropology, or children in general! It's fascinating to learn about the assumptions American parents have made about how to raise children and realize how different it is compared with other cultures. In some cases, one way might be better than another, but many times they are simply just too different to compare. Very fascinating course.",
    "Take it! Especially if you are a senior anthropology major.",
    "ANTH 459 is a course about child care across different cultures. It combines readings about culture and human evolution. I highly recommend ANTH 459 to other students - the course material is interesting and Professor Valeggia is amazing!",
    "Ethnopediatrics studies childcare, child development, and parent-child relationships across cultures. There is a lot of flexibility based on your interests and you can bring a lot of personal experience into the classroom discussions. It was a class that attracted students from a lot of disciplines. Also, you start each class with 5 minutes of meditation, which made my week!",
    "I really enjoyed the general relaxed atmosphere of this seminar mainly due to the Professor's attitude. The readings were interesting and enjoyable as well! One weakness is that the entire discussion is led by students so sometimes important concepts aren't touched on as often."
