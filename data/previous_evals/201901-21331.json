    "Strengths: a positive, collaborative atmosphere; engaged participation from readers; an explicit expectation that this is NOT a forum for finished work, but for work in progress. That last point is really important, because it creates an environment that foregrounds discussions of research\/writing strategies while dissertators are in the trenches. Polished writing often has a way of--shall we say--concealing the means of its own production. By setting an expectation for work in progress, it's easier to see the different strategies people develop to tackle common research obstacles. That has the added benefit of both reducing imposter syndrome (since all polished writing starts as drafty prose) and giving everyone a shared, crowd-sourced toolbox of research\/writing strategies for surmounting those common obstacles if\/when they encounter them. Improvements: none. I think this went really well this year."
