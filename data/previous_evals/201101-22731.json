    "This class is awesome. It's great to learn about different theories behind dress around the world. The student presentations were a huge highlight--learning about J Crew, flannel, high heels... It was great with Professor Reid.",
    "Amazing professor, fascinating topic.",
    "Great course, interesting material. 3 short papers throughout the semester (5-7 pages each) plus participation. Class was enjoyable because it was varied (often watched applicable movies) and discussions were always intruiging.",
    "Definitely take this class. The material is interesting, and the workload is reasonable. 3 5-7 page papers and one presentation on a topic of your choice.",
    "This class is readings-based, with four essays spaced out throughout the semester. It's not an overwhelming amount of work, but you won't get a ton out of the class if you don't do the readings. If you DO do the readings, it will actually be a lot of work.",
    "Yes. It's a good course, and you learn a lot."
