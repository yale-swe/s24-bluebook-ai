   "comments": [
    "Although the concept may seem simple: learning about all different kinds of mandalas, the ways in which these art pieces relate to the entirety of Buddhist religion mean that the class actually covers a wide range of topics, such as ritual, east-asian history, religion, design, etc.",
    "I highly recommend this seminar for non-majors and majors. The topic is fascinating and different from other classes.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. If you are interested in art, history of art, and Buddhism (or really religious studies in general), then you should definitely take this class. If you are hesitant about any of those things, though, then maybe not. There is a lot of visual and cultural analysis of the ma\u00e1\u00b9\u0087\u00e1\u00b8\u008dalas, and it gets pretty in-depth with the Buddhist theology and cosmology.",
    "As a possible science major, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in Buddhist art. The philosophical ideas behind the Mandalas are often complicated, but Mimi does a great job explaining them in class. It is also important to do the readings to participate in the discussions. Although some of them are tedious and complex, they are all very interesting. In terms of work, this course requires each student to write a midterm and a final paper. Mimi is very open to different types of final projects; this may be helpful for those who want to create their own work of art based on the works\/ideas studied in class."
