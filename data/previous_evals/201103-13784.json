    "It is like a book club",
    "Take this class. Really, do not deprive yourself of this wonderful, wonderful experience. You will read about one ethnography (anthropological research) a week, and they are pretty extensive but usually incredibly enjoyable. Otherwise, you will write two book reviews (2 pages, single spaced, and she sets a very strict outline for it - follow the outline) and one comparative book review at the end as a final paper sort of thing (about15 pages double spaced). You will also have to lead one book discussion which involves summarizing your half of the book at the beginning of class and providing three questions for everyone to think about. The discussions are always wonderful and thought-provoking, and you will learn about interesting topics on reproductive technologies from all over the world. Marcia is also a flawless professor. She is elegant, approachable, and hilarious. She let us read her next book's manuscript, too, which was pretty cool. Take this class if you can get in - you really won't regret it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! However, my class consisted of 15 girls and one boy, so this class definitely is more geared towards girls. Also, more than half of the students in the class were pre-med and interested in obstetrics\/gynecology. Often, the class felt more like a book club than a class. So, if you can relate to any of this, most definitely try and take this class! Also, there's a field trip at the end of the year!",
    "Prof. Inhorn described this class early on as a sort of \"feminist reading group.\" There certainly is quite a bit of reading. The books are dense, and there is well over 2000 pages over the course of the semester. However, the reading is quite interesting, and provides students with grounds to have well informed discussions. Prof. Inhon is really good at directing the discussions, and you will learn a lot and have tons of fun in the process!",
    "YES! YES YES YES!!! Take this class! Doesn't matter if you're a boy, girl, or you don't associate with any sex. Regardless of your gender, everyone should have an open forum where they can discuss sex, reproduction, infertility, body piercing, circumcision, relationships, etc! This class definitely provides that forum!! Take this class. Seriously.",
    "I enjoyed it. But it's one of those classes that you won't like if you don't have a very strong interest in the material. Be prepared to read a 400-page book on menopause in Japan, or on the symbolic significance of birth in America! The final 15-page book review is a total pain, but Marcia Inhorn is the nicest professor ever!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was the perfect course as a freshman to take. It brought to my attention so many issues that are present in the world. It was a wonderful introduction to a seminar style class. And, overall, I looked forward to every discussion and class!",
    "I would recommend this class only if one is interested in reproductive technologies and health. Most of the people in the class are interested in being mothers, midwives, or being pre-med. The books do get kind of boning and difficult to read if you're not interested in the topic.",
    "This class involves reading several books (about 8) in a semester. In each class, a student leads a discussion about the book (or part of the book) that they read and for which they wrote discussion questions. Two book reports (on books of your choosing) are required. This class also involves watching documentaries and films (about 5). The final was a 12-15 page comparison of two books.I would recommend this class to another student if they are interested in medical (reproductive) anthropology. However, I thought this class would be more about reproduction and the medical side of things. This was not the case, but the class was still rewarding and I was not at all disappointed.",
    "Reproductive Technologies is a seminar class for an introduction into medical anthropology and an exploration on women's health. We read 8 (really cool) books, each on a different subject that related to the topic of the week. We balanced these books with various movies\/documentaries pertaining to the subject matter. After each movie or book we would have a discussion on what we though or the questions that the \"class leader\" had chosen to ask. It wasn't hard and it was a great way to kick off freshman year.",
    "A wonderful class if you are interested in anything from feminism to public health issues. I would recommend it if you enjoy reading about birth, menopause, and everything in between and discussing these issues in class.",
    "I would say that Anthropology 011 03 is a class that examines gender issues and sexuality from an ethnographic point of view. We learn about women around the world. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because it is interesting, engaging, and the workload is definitely manageable.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in medical anthropology, babies, women, etc.",
    "This course involves reading 8 books, watching film, and a few supplementary materials. We had to write two single spaced two page book reviews and one 12-15 page comparative book review for the final. You learn a lot through the conversations and the opinions of others. I would definitely recommend this course because you learn a lot about gender issues from around the world.",
    "yes I would recommend it!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! Marcia Inhorn is very easy-going and the material itself is fascinating."
