    "I learned how to think about design and how to analyze it in terms of the emotions it evokes, rather than the shapes it seems to literally represent",
    "Not that much, we just critiqued everyone's work during the two hour class that met twice a week (which is A LOT of time)",
    "The course is an amazing introduction to graphic design for those looking to pursue the field further but also for those who just wish to gain a better knowledge on how information hierarchy, composition, and basic typography works.",
    "I learned how to think in a designer's mind. There was a lot of doing by hand, and it was great to experience all steps of making a final design product, from using InDesign to create a design file to printing out the work and hand-binding it at DMCA.",
    "In doing projects and critiques, I learned a lot about the principles of composition and typography. I also learned how to think like a designer and notice things about our visual word I could not before taking this class.",
    "I was able to enhance my ability to look and see things differently in a graphic designer's perspective. I've learned to notice what's around me more carefully and effectively. It was also a chance for me to experience another field of the arts.",
    "I learned about many things in this class, but more than anything I learned that in order for artistic expression to be interesting, it must be exaggerated and done in a purposeful and powerful manner. Anything less than a completely bold decision can be perceived as an accident. Speak boldly in interesting typeface, basically. Then the rest can fit where it looks nice on the page.",
    "I learned how to speak more effectively about design. This course taught me to be more critical of my own work.",
    "I learned a lot about thinking critically about information presented to me. I learned to think about what is necessary and what isn't in communication. I learned about organizing and manipulating information and hierarchies to make communication as effective as possible. I learned how to effectively give my opinions in a constructive manner."

   "comments": [
    "Gives you a really strong understanding of design concepts but can get tedious with the critique style class.",
    "This course was very hands-on and also very time consuming. I believe we could've utilized the in-class time to work on our assignments more instead of having all assignments expected to be done outside of class.",
    "Strengths- -Consistent coursework that creates improvement -Considerable effort put into helping the students improve, especially in terms of time commitment -Exercises were helpful in a procedural way that made sense -Quality access to facilities and materials Weaknesses- -Did have to spend a considerable amount on printing, would rather have a larger materials fee and have printing covered up to a certain amount -Often felt as though there wasn't enough time in class to do everything we wanted to",
    "The strengths are the in class discussions. The weaknesses was how over schedule each session would run. This is due to how good to discussions usually were.",
    "Like all art courses, discussion was rich but often went over the allotted class time, meaning sometimes people were not able to present. Some class time should likely be regulated for more efficient conversations. Otherwise the discussions were always interesting and it was easy to participate and find something constructive to say."

    "This class is hard but engaging. Take it if you want to learn the basics of graphic design with a professor (Yeju Choi) who knows her stuff and doesn't pull ANY punches. She can be harsh with her critiques but she doesn't mean it personally. As long as you show up clearly having tried and with reasons behind all of your choices she'll be fair. The class does take up a lot of time, so be aware of that.",
    "Time consuming, but worth it! At first, I thought I'd never be able to make it through 2 hours of critiques twice a week, but after a few weeks, I realized that there was a method to the madness. I noticed my designs improving, my ideas get sharper, and my implementations become more effective. Yeju also took us to a fantastic field trip to NYC!",
    "Not worth taking if Yeju is teaching it.",
    "This class taught me how to think in a designer's mind, which was an approach that was very different from some other art classes I took at Yale (I'm a non-Art major but have taken a several art classes) and I deeply appreciate for having learned it. There was a lot of doing by hand, and it was great to experience all steps of making a final design product, from using InDesign to create a design file to printing out the work and hand-binding it at DMCA. It's a lot of work (really depends on how much you want to learn though, I observed various degrees of engagement from classmates; some people were taking this class as a first step into their design career while others just wanted to get a taste of what design is like. The more thought and time you put into work, the more you can learn--and you'll probably want to produce something that is at least not shitty, considering that everything you make will go through critiques!) but I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to think more like a designer.",
    "Yes! Take it no matter your major. You will learn so much about design and how to think like a designer.",
    "Yes, but only to students who have the time to contribute fully to the class. In addition to the material fee, there are a lot of other expenses that are required of this course such as printing and making of the final project.",
    "Yes. It helped me immensely with other courses and artistic development.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "I think this course really teaches you how to observe the details of the world around you. It teaches you a way of thinking that is invaluable in all aspects of life. It is a great introduction to an art form that is growing increasingly popular in modern life."
