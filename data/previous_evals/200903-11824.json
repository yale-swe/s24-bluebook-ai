   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're interested in autism.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. Interesting and fun, hands on work.",
    "A broad overview of autism spectrum disorders from a scientific vantage point- The lectures are interesting and the practicum is amazing. I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in ASD or education.",
    "great course. very interesting. really wish they could have integrated the videos and pictures into the lecture but i understand that it was only a one semester thing. i think it made the class significantly less interesting even though it was a very edifying course. the practicum is by far the most rewarding part and i looked forward to spending time at chapel haven each week. also, the professors are fantastic! they are THE experts in the field and are extraordinarily knowledgeable and approachable.",
    "Take it if you can. This semester wasn't as good as it usually is, but the material is fascinating and the assessments aren't too difficult.",
    "Would definitely recommend if you are interested in learning more about autism.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It is a unique opportunity that everyone who is interested in the field should take advantage of. The class consists of two parts. There is a lecture once a week given by a different member of the Child Study Center autism clinic faculty, each talking about their own area of specialization. The faculty at the Child Study Center are some of the best in the world, and it is wonderful to hear them talking about their own groundbreaking research. The only drawback is that having a different speaker every week means that the class doesn't always hang together. This class is NOT an introductory survey to autism, it is a random sampling of in-depth exposure to current research on different topics. That being said, its still a good class! The other piece of the class is a practicum placement at a residence or school for people with ASD. This was a wonderful experience, and presents a very unique opportunity to learn about a disorder while interacting with patients.",
    "Great way to learn about ASD in a chill environment that fosters learning and understanding rather than competitiveness within the classroom.",
    "The placement at Benhaven is the best thing ever",
    "The lectures for the class were not so great (disjointed and repetitive - everyone was on their laptops all the time) but the placements in autism schools were great! I worked at Chapel Haven (the school for young adults with Asperger's) and I learned a lot about ASD and met some very interesting people while I was there. The placement makes the class worth it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if you have any interest in Autism. It's a disorder that no one knows that much about so hearing about it from the top people in the field and learning about the most current research is fascinating. It's also not a difficult course so don't be intimidated."
