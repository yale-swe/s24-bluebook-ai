    "English 238 is an excellent inter-disciplinary survey of 18th century literature. Both the literary and theoretical readings were enjoyable. But most importantly, Jonathan Kramnick was an exceptional discussion leader, allowing for student contributions while offering incisive insights at appropriate moments. Highly recommended!",
    "This is a great class--the syllabus gestures towards big-picture questions but remains grounded in close readings of some wonderful poets, which makes the class feel both excitingly expansive (as implied by the title \"poetry and modernity\") and empirically rigorous. Jonathan Kramnick facilitates amazing discussions and is always a helpful and supportive interlocutor in office hours. There are only two essays, which provides a generously long timeline for researching and thinking through your ideas. If you liked the first half of ENGL 126, take this class!",
    "If you're excited about 18th century poetry I'm sure it would be great",
    "The syllabus of this course might be off-putting to those with little experience with Restoration-era\/modern literature, but Professor Kramnick leads a great discussion and class is far from boring. It's amazing how many topics of social\/intellectual history arise in discussion of the poems on the syllabus--from changing ideas about and expressions of sexuality, to questions of environmentalism, to debates over animal rights.",
    "A great introduction to the English poets of the mid-17th c until the early 19th c. Definitely an historicist\/thematic oriented poetry course (which I appreciated) and so less focused on the formal aspects of the poetry. Prof. Kramnick was a fantastic professor - very active in leading the seminar discussion (reviewing each class on what we talked about the previous class, and offering thoughts on the material for the current class). Take it even if you haven't done much poetry or aren't even an English major!",
    "This is definitely a great class. Using English poetry from the long 18th century, along with several essays\/chapters of books, it covers changing ideas about aesthetics, nature, animals, landscape, the city and so on. It manages to both give an overview of sorts and also to go in depth in certain areas. There is definitely quite a lot of reading, but if you have the time and interest the class is well worth it. The readings were interesting, the class discussion was great, and I learned quite a bit. Professor Kramnick was really wonderful, and I definitely recommend taking basically any class that he teaches (provided you are interested in the course material of course). There were two essays (one 8-10 page midterm, one 10-12 page final). These require quite a bit of work, but you definitely will have enough time to work on them and Professor Kramnick will give feedback on drafts\/ideas during office hours if you go. Bottom line: a great class with a great professor, lots of work but for sure worth it.",
    "The course is a very interesting look at a variety of poetry through the lens of the evolving concept of modernity. Most of the poetry was new and exciting to me, and I definitely wouldn't have encountered most of it without the course.",
    "I took this class to satisfy my pre-1800s and poetry requirements for the major (did not take 126). It was great for somebody who does not have a deep affinity for poetry, because it explored themes of modern interest: gender, sexuality, environmentalism, city vs. rural dynamics, etc. Most English majors know this, but seminar discussions about poetry can be a serious headache, with everybody sharing different interpretations and not always striving to have a continuous dialogue. That being said, this class was pretty enjoyable, had a decently coherent level of discussion for a seminar, and Kramnick did a good job facilitating.",
    "Poetry and Modernity is a lovely little seminar on eighteenth-century poetry. Professor Kramnick is wonderful, the students were all very thoughtful, the readings are solidly representative of the time period. There are only two papers and you get a lot of freedom with them to explore your interests. Take this class if you are interested in eighteenth-century Romantic poetry. Do not take this class if you are an English major who needs a pre-1800 and this one looks less awful than the others. Don't expect this class to spark interest in the subject if it's not already there. Find another class. If you're genuinely interested in the subject though, this is a great class!",
    "Kramnick is a nice guy who knows his stuff and clearly cares about the very specific topics he's researching. He's dry though and not great at giving particular instruction. Disinterested? I wouldn't let him discourage you from taking a course where you were excited about the material or needed a pre-1800 but I wouldn't let him encourage you either. This particular course was a drier redux of major English poets.",
    "Take this class! The material is interesting and Professor Kramnick leads great discussions. You get to learn about the origins of concerns about the environment and animal treatment through poetry."
