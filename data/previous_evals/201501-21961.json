   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend this class to any Yale student. Writing non-fiction in an interesting, honest way is true skill that every student should have some experience way. More than that, though, is the ability to read critically and for enjoyment simultaneously, a skill that one quickly learns in 120. 120 is a fun, interesting class that will develop your writing immensely in a very short period of time.",
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 120 to another student. The essay prompts were all very interesting, and the readings and discussions we did in class helped our essay writing improve. Take the course!",
    "It was a close-knit seminar in which students read essays by well-known authors and crafted their own personal non-fiction essays, which they then workshopped amongst each other to hone their writing styles.",
    "ENGL 120 is a course about writing essays in a way that is far from the high school essay. If you know Malcolm Gladwell, that's a pretty good idea of what to expect. It's not creative writing, but it definitely requires creativity. I enjoyed learning to write these kinds of essays and definitely saw my confidence improve over the course of the semester. Discussions were actually pretty fun (and super required). Write about stuff you like, and you'll have a good time.",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 120 to anyone-it's by far my favorite class at Yale. And this is coming from not an English major or someone who already has experience in journalistic writing, but enrolled in the class to gain the skill from scratch. It's hard to get a good grade on the essays, and you need to put a lot of work not only in the content but also in the stylistic issues. I wasn't familiar with this kind of writing, and was initially intimidated by the people who were and were taking the class with me, but I ended up learning a lot and and improving my grade, too",
    "ENGL 120 is a great class to take if you want to write interesting, personal essays. And I would recommend it if you are a creative thinker or would like to improve your writing style.",
    "Really great class! it hinges a lot on your instructor, but the vast majority are amazing based on what I've heard, and I had a really great time. It's a fair amount of work, but I think I came out the other end a better writer.",
    "This was a great course! The pieces you write for ENGL 120 are short (5 essays that are 1250 words\/5 pages) but you will be spending a lot of time thinking about\/revising what you write. Most of the readings were interesting, though of course in every class there are one or two that are long and awful. Overall, this was a fun course to take -- I definitely feel that I know myself better as a writer now and am able to prevent myself from falling into the same bad patterns. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has a little time in the semester and wants to improve their nonfiction writing\/analysis skills!",
    "I learned how to write essays about myself, a place, a person, an object and some satire. I read many interesting essays that I would not have gotten the chance to read otherwise, and most of them were pleasurable to read. I would definitely recommend this course to any student even remotely interested--I found it to be very enlightening, and challenging but very fun."
