    "Lowest level of math at Yale, if you get lucky enough and get a decent instructor you will learn in class, if not you will have to learn it all from the book yourself",

    "Do not take this class unless absolutely necessary.",
    "Don't take it if you don't already know it, because you won't learn anything in class.",
    "Yes because it's basic and a good class to have taken",
    "I would not take it out of the blue but to fill a ECON math credit it was great. Not too difficult.",
    "Only took this class because I had to. As someone who had limited exposure to calculus before this class, I found it challenging considering many other students had taken AB and even BC classes. Also, good luck finding a professor that you can understand.",
    "Don't take it, obviously. Unless you have to, like I did. Calculus will never come in handy for you unless you're a capitalist or like an actuary or something. (evil)."
