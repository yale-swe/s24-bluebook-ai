    "yes, take it! dont skip any lectures-- they are great.",
    "A really interesting class on a period of history that doesn't get a lot of attention. Professor Winroth is absolutely great - he's funny, charming, and has lectures that always end with an interesting spin on previously accepted historical facts. The only problem is the assignments - the papers are not normal research assignments, they're dumb things like reviews of wikipedia articles that you'd never, ever want to write 5 pages on. And the wikidiki is an enormous time-suck for such a stupid result. Overall though, the lectures are great and you learn a lot. Take it Credit\/D.",
    "The lectures themselves are great as this period is extremely interesting to study and Professor Winroth is an awesome lecturer. The assignments are what drag the class down a bit, as the 3 papers associated with the course are a bit ambiguous and unlike anything you've probably written before, which makes them a little difficult and confusing to approach(review of a Wikipedia article, a book review, and a final paper written using 5-6 primary sources that have to cover the period, which is the closest thing to a normal history paper). The WikiDiki project is fine and not too difficult to keep up with, though it's a little disorganized and the grading can appear arbitrary at times. If you can take the course Credit\/D then that'd be perfect as, aside for the assignments, it's an interesting class.",
    "History 210 01 lectures are a good and interesting overview about the Early Middle Ages. I found all of the readings throughout the course really interesting. Although a lot of people find the WikiDiki project annoying, I didn't think it was that much work. It was really helpful for studying for the two quizzes that are given during the semester. However, I would not recommend this class for anyone that is not comfortable with creative writing\/ has only written standard history papers because of the essay assignments.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in the material. Be prepared for time consuming and somewhat pointless work on the class WikiDiki.",
    "I would recommend the class as a great way to understand the foundations of European culture. The class was extremely enjoyable, the world load was manageable, and the content very interesting.",
    "If you are interested in European history from AD 200-1000, this isthe right course for it! If you have the idea of \"Dark Age\" lingering in your mind, you might want to take this course to gain a different perspective.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a survey of the fall of Rome and the early middle ages, and it is certainly almost necessary for any history major.",
    "I would recommend it but choose your TA wisely and be aware of the amount of work required."
