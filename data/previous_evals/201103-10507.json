    "A discussion course, where class participation and presentations are each 25% of the grade (the other 50% is the midterm and final). We had some interesting conversations and learned some interesting things, but it wasn't like any other computer science class I've taken. I'd recommend it if you're interested in the topic of copyright law and privacy, but be warned that there's not actually a lot of computer science going on.",
