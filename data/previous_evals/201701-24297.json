    "Very little, quite frankly. I learned some definitions and was able to review some topics, but overall many of the important theorems were either left unproven or not even gotten to. I can say that while I saw some things in this course, but I don't think I actually learned any of them.",
    "I learned a fair bit about abstract smooth manifold and differential geometry on them",
    "I learned the notions of smooth manifolds and smooth maps, immersions and submersions, vector fields and differential forms from this course. I also learned to interpret geometric notions by associating them with physical objects. For instance, the flow of a vector field can be thought as some fluid flowing through the underlying manifold."

   "comments": [
    "We didn't cover much material at all, way too much time spent on material that didn't pay off (esp on tensors and fundamental group), and calculations were done in class instead of proofs. There was no HW and we were unaware of the final exam until the end of the semester.",
    "Suggested exercises from the first chapter would have been nice. I did not think that the textbook was easy to understand.",
    "This course covers a variety of topics, but doesn't go fully in much depth in them. The main weakness is that there was no way to have a sense of how well we were doing in the class, as no homework is assigned and the only evaluation is the final. Thus we had little sense of what sort of questions would be on the final, or how to do them (as the specifics of the final exam questions were different than the type of example problems we did in class). So many of us thought we understood the material well and probably ended up with C's at best.",
    "This course provides clear and structured presentation of essential concepts and techniques of differential geometry. Pictorial representations are always provided in lectures to facilitate better intuition."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "No. I did not learn much, and what I did I could have gotten out of a textbook more quickly.",
    "This course is decently interesting, and quite abstract. It deals mainly with abstract manifolds, and doesn't do things that have much of a concrete geometric sense, like a metric. (With Smilga teaching) There is no homework. On the other hand, the final exam is your only grade. As he doesn't assign hw, we had little idea what sort of question to prepare for and really struggled. Smilga is a very harsh grader, so I expect the class average to be around a C.",
    "This course is definitely interesting and useful to take for math students. It demonstrates the powerful interplay of topology, analysis and algebra in the study of smooth manifolds."
