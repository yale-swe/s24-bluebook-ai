    "This was an extremely small seminar with five really bright kids and an amazing professor. We always had great discussions and we wrote interesting papers as a final. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot!",
    "If this is ever offered again, take it! Your research skills will develop beautifully and the information is fascinating. Josh is a great professor. He really cares that you are learning something valuable and has an amazing store of historical knowledge. The small, intimate nature of the class really added to the experience.",
    "If Professor Stein can offer this class again, I would absolutely recommend taking it. The material is interesting, Professor Stein is enthusiastic and genuinely interested in your progress, and you will be given a great opportunity to work on a substantial research project on a topic that interests you."
