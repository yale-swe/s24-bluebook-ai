    "This is a course I would wholeheartedly recommend to any other student who is looking to approach philosophy from a synthetic perspective - the connections, detail, depth and possibility of the texts really come alive (yes, ironic because of the course title!) through Professor Grewal's reading.",
    "A great course! But not easy to wrap your mind around.",
    "Yes! It is perhaps the most important course I have taken at Yale. It's very intellectually stimulating, gets you thinking in ways you might not have before, and confronts what is perhaps the most important issue we all must eventually face-death- with the wisdom of the ancients who have gone before us for a guide.",
    "I would recommend it to serious readers. The material was by no means easy. Weekly responses were, for me personally, time consuming but always rewarding. We all wanted to be there."
