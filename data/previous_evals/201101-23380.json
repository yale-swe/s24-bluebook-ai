    "Great notes and explanations. Very logical class and friendly. It kept me motivated all semester. Books were not that useful though.",
    "I thought the pace was a little fast, but instead of eliminating topics, I think I could do without as much mathematical background. I'm not as concerned about knowing what the computer is doing beyond what is necessary to explain differences in results.",
    "Please take the intro class before taking this class or be very meticulous about brushing up with foundations on stat.",
    "6) I would like to highly recommend that consideration be given to offering this class in 50 minute sessions that occur three times per week instead of two longer classes. I think you'd find better retention of information by students and a higher energy and engagement level. The information is dense and it's hard to stay as focused as you need and want to be for the full hour and twenty minutes."

    "JDRS is a great teacher. He makes difficult material accessible and fun to learn, and he is very giving of his time.",
    "The instructor, its clarity and contagious enthusiasm. The material covered is very helpful for research and provides a good base for stats. Powerpoint slides were simple and logical. The final Jeopardy was a wonderful interactive idea as a review.",
    "the large number of methods covered",
    "The professor is great!",
    "The methods taught in the class are difficult, but the teacher made them so easy to use.",
    "The instructor is funny~!",
    "Very useful in other courses",
    "The instructor was one of the best teachers I've had as an undergrad and a grad student. Was definitely the best statistics teacher I've ever had.",
    "JDRS's teaching style is extremely conducive to learning difficult conceptual material. He repeats concepts and asks for answers from the class which generates an engagement that fosters a greater understanding of the topics.",
    "Jonathan sets aside a lot of time for students",
    "Jonathan is an amazing teacher of the material. I had no experience in multivariate statistics and I learned so much and feel I have a working knowledge of statistical methods and how and when to employ them.",
    "This class helped me to analysis the data I gathered for my degree research, which was critical and something I couldn't get from my advisor. It also provided me with the ability to better critique statistical methods used in the primary literature.The TA for this course was very patient and available. I utilized her help on almost all problem sets and she helped me to truly learn the material. Without her I wouldn't have learned half as much from the homeworkassignments.Getting to learn R (seriously) and getting to use my own data in the context of a class."

    "Opportunity to program a little would make it a little challenging. It is great that the codes are all given. Maybe create a little algorithm in R or something. Also some improvement on granola bar throwing skills.",
    "pace",
    "There are in total 6 lab hours. However, for some of us, we may need more lab hours.",
    "This course would ideally be taught in the lab with a step by step \"here's how you use this software\" with a sample dataset. Then when we do homework, we can choose to use our own dataset, or a new dataset. I feel like there was too much theory and not enough application on \"here's how you use SPSS and here's what you have to do when you get inside the program...\" etc. That would really TREMENDOUSLY help increase the value of this course!",
    "There should be more required lab sessions. Otherwise it's really hard to learn how to use all the 3 softwares involved in this class.",
    "Nothing, it is a great class. Could perhaps do with a bit more structure towards the end of the semester because we finished the lecture material early.",
    "Not applicable.",
    "Notes and homeworks could be clearer and more consistent",
    "The pace can be quick because there's a lot of material to work through.",
    "I would have appreciated feedback about the dataset that I provided at the beginning of the semester and intended to use for the problem sets. It would have been very helpful to know up front what methods\/problem sets I likely wouldn't be able to use my data for. Instead, I didn't receive any feedback on what I submitted.It would be TREMENDOUSLY helpful for different versions of the course notes to be provided depending on which software package you are using. I think the creation of these different set of notes would help insure that examples for each software package are available for each method (with obvious gaps where particular software packages are inadequate).I cannot stress strongly enough how much the professor lost my respect by repeatedly either canceling lab hours at the last minute or showing up over one hour late. In addition, there were repeated instances where the professor did not show up for office hours--in spite of there being people signed up for every available office hour slot. In the case of lab hours showing up late meant that he had to quickly dash around the room to help everyone who had anxiously been waiting. This made his demeanor curt and dismissive and generally unpleasant to interact with. I was extremely disappointed in the lack of reliability and availability that this caused. Thank goodness for the TA!"
