    "Good - it showed me how difficult modeling can be but the great research and studies that are going on.",
    "Professors from a variety of fields who's work applied to modeling were chosen to speak. This was a strength that demonstrated the applicability of modeling across disciplines.",
    "Good speakers.",
    "This was a super cool course-- the timing was perfect, I feel like I learned from the sessions, and was able to draw parallels to things I was working on in class. It also introduced modeling concepts far more complex than I've seen, which I think was a helpful way of demonstrating the scope of the field.",
    "I thought this seminar was interesting and most of the speakers were accessible to students who did not have prior experience with modeling.",
    "I loved this seminar series and I'm looking forward to next semester. Great job with guest lecturers, very interesting material.",
    "good to know the latest research in the modeling field",
    "It is a nice way to experience and learn about different modeling projects and research going on in a large range of fields. However some of the talks get so complicated even after reading the papers that it is difficult to follow.",
    "It was very interesting. My favorite session was when we talking about the live donor kidney transplant chains.",
    "Simple seminar series with interesting speakers.",

    "I would recommend it.",
    "Great exposure to public health modeling! Perfect for people who are interested in working on interdisciplinary projects, and want to learn more about how people are using statistical models to make the world a better place.",
    "Great opportunity to expose yourself to modeling in different aspects of public health.",
    "yes!",
    "This was a very interesting course that gave a broad view of what the field of modeling is doing. I liked the variety in the lecturers. It served as a reminder that we can use this skill set in any path we choose.",
    "I would summarize it as a good way to expose yourself to the many different projects involved in modeling. I would recommend it to a student if they were interested in modeling.",
