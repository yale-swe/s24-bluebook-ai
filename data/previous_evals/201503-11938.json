   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student. The curriculum is very abstract, but it is a great way to get yourself thinking creatively.",
    "It's a good class, but probably depends a lot on the specific people you're with (as it's really small). I received a lot of insightful feedback, although the class felt stressful and judgmental at times. Also, the class is nearly all English majors, so there's kind of a tense aspect where people are taking this and hoping to get into the creative writing concentration. The class also focuses on development and creation of realistic characters above all other elements of storytelling (plot, world building, etc). In terms of the work itself the class is very manageable, two stories (8- 14 pages) and subsequent drafts for the whole semester and preparing for workshop this week by reading that week's stories. How much time you spend on each story really depends on the level of personal attachment to it. Because workshop was strangely harsh in my year (and I guess I'm extrapolating for the future), I would not write about anything too private\/personal or that makes you very vulnerable, because once the negativity train starts, it's really hard not to take it personally.",
    "I would summarize this class as a rigorous course in character creation in the world of fiction writing. I would recommend it to others, but only if they want a challenge.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's a great class, not too much work although it'll sneak up on you if you don't prioritize it. I looked forward to it every week.",
    "If you get in, ABSOLUTELY take it. He reads your stuff extremely carefully and is an incredible editor. Expect to do a lot of drafts and work very hard. You will come out a much better writer.",
    "Of course I would recommend this course to another student. It's such a rare opportunity to learn from a professor like Caz. (See answers to Questions 1 and 2.) This class isn't just about learning how to write -- a big part of it is also learning how to read what you write, and rewrite what you write. You come out of ENGL 465 with Caz feeling like you've learned so much, and yet you also realize how much further you have to go, how much more you must learn to do. You might be done taking this class, but you'll never be done with learning from it. Only the best classes have the future like this.",
    "You won't write a lot for this class, but you'll come out of it with two solid stories to be proud of as long as you put in the work. You get one workshop per story, but Prof. Caz makes himself very available through emails and office hours and is always open to more drafts."
