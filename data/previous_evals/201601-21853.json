    "You have to take it, but it's so chill. I didn't get much help from my adviser (Konigsberg) other than grammar edits, but I got a lot of help from my PI because I chose to talk about a research area from his lab. I'd recommend getting started early on reading papers and taking notes throughout the semester so when you have to write your first draft (which is due right after spring break), it won't be stressful.",
    "Required course; your adviser may or may not care about you, but the overall expectations are not extremely high, since the department expects you have to done most of the heavy lifting for the major through independent research or the lab course.",
    "Your required senior essay class. Pretty relaxed--you write a paper and do a presentation. It's made easier if you do it earlier, like any other term paper, but it's not too much work.",
    "Very casual \"thesis\" class.",
    "Compared to other senior seminars, this is a very light course: (1) final paper and (2) final presentation. During reading period, you will have to meet to hear each other's presentations but it is relatively low stress.",
    "Not super worthwhile. Depending, your adviser may not be very engaged. Not very demanding. Few people feel very much buy-in.",
    "It's not that hard -- but you really have to dive into the subject. I hadn't done this in a while, and it caught me by surprise as to how hard it was to reengage with basic science research. But the advisors really just want you to do your best and become knowledgeable about a certain problem\/area of inquiry. Don't stress about it, and view it as an opportunity to practice the expertise you've gained in this department.",
    "I mean you will take this if and only if you are MBB so not much of a choice here. But just to help you understand what you need to do - the commitments for this course are an info meeting where you will be assigned an adviser (out of like 3 choices whose research interests may or may not cover what you are interested in), meeting with adviser to choose a topic, abstract\/proposal, draft of your review, final draft, presentation. I would put work into your first draft, and even picking a topic you know you can write about, because you don't wanna push everything to the last minute because you'll have other things to do during finals\/reading period.",
    "You have to take this but it's fine. Quite unorganized but it's easy and the presentation can be fun.",
    "It was a good class but each instructor wanted something different from their paper.",
    "An opportunity to delve into an area of biochemistry in great detail and emerge with significant knowledge that you didn't have before. It's straightforward, and if approached in the correct way, can be a very rewarding exercise.",
    "No way around this one if you're an MBB major. It's a critical literature review and gives you the opportunity to explore a field you're not completely familiar with and engage with it in a way that would advance the field."
