    "Not recommended",
    "A lot of opportunities to encounter and discuss with great people. It is good.",
    "This course had a lot of potential but ultimately was a disappointment. The lectures were dry, and I didn't feel like there was a common theme tying them together. Although some topics were intriguing, we never explored them in enough depth to gain a real understanding of them. At least it was easy, both in terms of workload and also grading. Since this was the first time this course was taught, and it was clearly overloaded with more students than expected, it probably will improve in future semesters. Still, approach with caution.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course to a fellow student. It would be helpful to know at least a little bit of python and\/or R, but the course is completely self-contained. The workload is relatively light and the course is essentially an overview of applications of computer science to automated decision systems in various fields. It is very accessible to people outside of computer science and it is a good introduction to all the cool applications of computer science to \"the real world.\"",
    "It's a useful course",
    "It's useful.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The course is interesting so is the homework. There will be several interesting lectures given by guest speakers from different areas.",
    "Very informative and structured to provide an idea about real world systems.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who want to study decision systems applied in a wide range of areas.",
    "I will serve as the voice of balance in these reviews. To be fair to Slade, the course should have been taught as a seminar. Professor Slade desired to have more open-ended problem sets that would enable students to explore decision making. Systems to answer questions such as \"What car should I buy?\" or \"Whom should I marry?\" have no right answer. The best answer varies widely from person to person. However, it is difficult to write let alone grade such assignments for an 100+ class with only 2 TA's. The case-based (like VOTE) and rule-based systems are fascinating and interesting to work with. If the course were restructured to focus on them more, I believe it would be a much more solid elective. However, I would have to agree that lectures (though funny) were often slow and didn't cover much material. The guest lectures (from Google, Palantir, etc.) were cool but at times seemed to be recruiting pitches. In short, I believe the course has much potential to be a solid elective. It just needs time.",
    "Yes. Material is great. Only one or two dull sessions. Very practical."

    "Not at all",
    "As a student major in CS, it is good to broaden my area into Finance.",
    "Not too much.",
    "Yes, this course has very helpful. It exposed me to a lot of new and interesting areas of application for computer science, which has given me ideas for future research.",
    "It covers many financial knowledge",
    "It helps me learn python and R as well as many financial knowledge.",
    "I am very interested in financial technology. This course has covered a lot of topics in this area, which is really helpful for my career.",
    "I believe the course has much potential to have students think more on the qualitative aspects of decisions. I believe getting our hands dirty with code from decision systems would help exponentially.",
    "Theory of decision making is important in leading businesses. I will better understand how decisions are made and how to perhaps automate what I previously thought would be very difficult."
