   "comments": [
    "Incredible course. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. This class completely changed my conceptions about art...in every way. It is undoubtedly the class that has had the biggest impact on me so far in my career at Yale.",
    "I would take this class again but with the knowledge that material may be very hard to understand and scattered.",
    "Yes -- but you need to understand that much of this class is based on philosophy and concepts that are explained in short but incredibly dense texts. You will need to spend more time on this class than you think.",
    "Shop it. Professor Seeley is no good IMO. I do not regret taking the course because the reading material was really interesting. But if I hadn't done all the reading, I would have really hated this class.Take at your own risk!",
    "This class is more focused on art history and philosophy than the summary makes it out to be. Definitely worth taking- the readings and discussions may mess with your mind but in a productive and thought-provoking way.",
    "Go to the first seminar, and go with your gut feeling. Bill is a great professor with a lot of awesome experience. There was more philosophy in this course than I expected (it's basically an Art Philosophy course with some Cognitive Science papers sprinkled in), but I learned from it. Overall, not a terribly difficult course except for the three papers. A really cool way to learn about Art and\/or Philosophy in a seminar setting.",
    "This would be great for philosophy, art, or art history majors."
