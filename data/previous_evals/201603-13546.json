   "comments": [
    "Most importantly, I think I learned about how to approach philosophy. Even if I can't answer the questons, I have a far better understanding of what those questions may be.",
    "I gained a new appreciation for how frustrating old dead white philosophers are and realized that philosophy is not for me (that said, I also got an incredible base of knowledge about philosophy to figure out that I didn't like it).",
    "I learned how to approach philosophy both in a traditional argument analysis way and from a broader perspective.",
    "I think this course helped me gain a better ability to read dense texts. However, I don't think it particularly improved my writing.",
    "How to be very precise in analyzing philosophical texts; how to make nuanced distinctions between arguments and terms; how to structure a philosophy essay that includes objections and counter-objections; and the philosophical problems (e.g. the problem of evil, creation ex nihilo, the existence of God) that people have grappled with for centuries.",
    "I learned a lot about early western philosophy, in particular Plato and Aristotle. The most important skill I learned was reconstructing a philosophic argument, which I think I still struggle with but I certainly understand it better after taking this class. My quality of writing improved, and I got more used to the style of writing required for a philosophy paper.",
    "I learned to think critically about arguments and their flaws and strengths. I learned not to be afraid to voice my opinion. I became more aware of the dilemmas we face in daily life, and learned how to elaborate on them, using ancient philosophy.",
    "I had no idea how to write a sharp, interesting philosophy paper prior to this class. I am light years ahead of my self three months ago when it comes to the critical discussion of ideas on the page.",
    "From this class I learned how to do philosophical analysis, how to look for the valuable crux of an argument that I disagree with, and how to write a philosophy paper.",
    "This course gave me a foundation in ancient Western philosophy. Having entered this class with practically no experience reading philosophy, I gained an understanding of the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle and their successors. This course also developed my philosophic skills. Because I had no prior experience with philosophy, I did not know how to write a proper philosophical analysis, let alone a philosophic essay. By the end of this class, I had acquainted myself with this skills.",
    "this course was one of my most challenging courses ever. It helped me understand texts I never could have read on my own. It also taught me a completely new style of writing.",
    "The course provides a very strong and broad overview of some of the seminal texts of early western philosophy. Professor Garsten leads a great discussion section - you will learn how to reconstruct an argument, and how to trace the development of different theories."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "As with all of DS, it's impossible to do all the readings and felt like it moved too quickly at times. However, it was a wonderful, comprehensive foundation of philosophy.",
    "While Professor Garsten did a good job of facilitating student discussion, the overall nature of DS works in the philosophy track seemed removed from reality in many ways. Some of the works on the reading list were very interesting, while others were more dull and rushed through quickly.",
    "Strengths: Read a huge range of philosophical texts. Really exposes you to major lines of thought in the Western philosophical tradition. Although we only spend a little bit of time with each text I feel like the major arguments and perspectives are thoroughly outlined during seminars and lectures. Weaknesses: Philosophy can be a bit dry. Also they need to get a better colloquium speaker, preferably one who maybe does research or has produced a work relating to the philosophy we learn in the fall term. At the bare minimum, at least get someone who does philosophy.",
    "I enjoyed this course and the readings, and the Directed Studies curriculum holds together very well. It allowed a deeper understanding of western thought for certain. However, this course would have benefited significantly from more clear connections to current events or more modern ideas (beyond just the promise of reading more modern texts next semester). Connections to modern life would make the class more directly relevant and put these texts into better historical context.",
    "Really amazing conversations, warm sense of community. Little moments of excellence were sprinkled into the course -- someone would say something and accidentally stumble onto the Enlightenment, for instance, and it always felt special when the professor recognized these forward patterns. The conversations on how a democratic mindset informs our reading and occasional dissatisfaction with written ideas were, in my opinion, some of the most challenging and influential in the rest of my life. It may help if, from a logistics standpoint, there was a specific allusion to what exact passages in the texts would be looked at in upcoming classes. Sometimes the entire reading is so overwhelming that it would be helpful if the student could say \"Ok, I'm really lost, but I know that this particular passage is really worth a close reading, and maybe understanding this passage will help bring out the meaning in the rest of the reading.\"",
    "The chief strengths of this course are the seminars and the professors that guide them. Discussing the texts that we read in seminars was instrumental to my comprehension of them. The seminar allowed me to ask questions that I had when reading the text and to respond to questions posed by other class members. The reason for the success of these seminars are the professors. Although the students contribute the most during the classes, the professors guide the discussions, their comments often pushing the conversations in different and intriguing directions. The only weakness that I can think of regarding this course is its pace. We covered certain philosophers and philosophies so quickly that we failed to do justice to their thought. That being said, this weakness appears to be built into the course since it is designed to be more of a survey course than an in-depth one."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. The philosophy track of DS was my favorite despite some really difficult authors and concepts, and Professor Garsten's section is great.",
    "DS as a whole is its own decision. If you are doing it, however, Garsten is a fine professor. He's a nice, friendly guy who clearly knows what he's talking about. However, he is a PoliSci professor and it often felt like that. It seemed impossible to strike the proper mix of Philosophy and PoliSci in my papers, and his feedback and office hours weren't incredibly helpful in figuring out how to fix it.",
    "Professor Garsten does a great job of not getting too tied up in the intricacies of arguments and keeping things broad and in context.",
    "As someone who was initially least interested in the philosophy track of DS, Professor Garsten did a great job of connecting philosophical concepts to broader ideas and facilitating engaging section discussion. However, I felt the class lacked guidance on essay writing. I'm still not completely certain the proper structure Professor Garsten wants for essays.",
    "Yes, DS really improves your writing. Philosophy in particular forces you to examine an argument, actually ensure that you represent the argument charitably and in its best form, and then meticulously analyze it with a fine toothcomb. DS enables you to find something interesting within one particular premise of an argument and to make that into a five page essay. The final for philosophy was also very manageable.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course, especially to someone who has any interest at all in philosophy or reading the foundational texts of western thought.",
    "Yes",
    "You'll make friends with the books and your fellow students (and likely your professor!).",
    "I would recommend DS to any student interested in the humanities.",
    "To anyone who desires a foundation in ancient philosophy, this class is ideal. Over the semester, we covered nearly all the major ancient philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to Seneca, Sextus Empiricus, and Anselm. Those wishing to discuss these philosophers in a seminar-based class should especially take this class.",
    "Yes. I thought this course was really important, especially to those interested in humanities. This course taught me about things I did not know I was interested in or even that I knew existed.",
    "This class (and Directed Studies, in general) is a wonderful introduction to some of the highlights of the western canon. Definitely do try to take it if you are interested in the material, if you want to participate in small discussion sections, and if you want (or at least, don't mind) the challenge of a fairly heavy workload."
