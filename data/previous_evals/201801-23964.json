    "fantastic allocation of tuition",
    "Great course; great speakers and lecturers who were very knowledgeable. Didn't always feel like the assignments directly related to what we learned in class. I also enjoyed the case studies in class. They helped me better understand the material and some real life situations where they may be useful.",
    "The different guest lecturers were great as well as the group class components. I wish we were given breaks more frequently (class was held at 8 am and was 2 hours long). In addition, sometimes it felt like slides were being just read off of, instead of having additional information included by the instructor. Overall however, this course gave me a great framework in hospital epidemiology and I enjoyed it very much!",
    "An excellent course for health professionals. Very detailed and interesting.",
    "Really interesting course. I liked that every lecture was on a new topic within HC Epidemiology and that lectures were given by experts in the field. I would have appreciated more epidemiological methods incorporated into the class. At times, the class can be heavy on regulation or the strict memorization of facts. I would have liked to see more methods, real-world application, and microbiology incorporated into the course. I really enjoyed the group work and case studies performed in class. I would have appreciated more opportunities to do this.",
    "Homework assignments were poorly written, not well thought out, and not conducive to learning. Instructor needs to realize that most students are not clinicians. Lectures were incredibly boring and uninformative.",
    "Good.",
    "Great course for delving more into HC epi topics. Being unfamiliar with the large majority of hospital epi and health care systems in general, this class was a great introduction to the topics. I'm glad we were able to visit YNHH and tour the hospital while applying what we were learning in class to a real-world setting.",
    "I loved it! The material, the instructors, and the structure of the assignments were great - no complaints there. Whenever we discussed issues in small groups, I know that my classmates and I enjoyed those a lot. I do wish we had more of those in class, particularly while discussing case studies. The biggest strength was bringing in different speakers for different perspectives on topics. Ex: someone for clinical microbiology, someone for antimicrobial stewardship, someone for environmental disinfection, etc. Every speaker was engaging, informative, and receptive to student comments and questions. Additionally, they were happy to speak to students outside the classroom for research opportunities, general conversation, or career advice.",
    "Very practical, up to date, evidence based."

    "Instructor: David Banach \u00a0Soft spoken, but really intelligent on the topic",
    "Instructor: David Banach \u00a0Dr. Banach is very kind, intelligent, and is a great lecturer as he provides concrete examples. I enjoyed the two lectures he taught and wish he taught more during the semester.",
    "Instructor: David Banach \u00a0Approachable, good instructor. Interesting classes.",
    "Instructor: David Banach \u00a0wonderful. engaging.",
    "Instructor: David Banach \u00a0Very good professor. I enjoyed his use of group work and case studies to get students thinking about real-life health care epidemiology. Very effective in getting students to think about all facets of the epidemiologic decision making process.",
    "Instructor: David Banach \u00a0he was ok",
    "Instructor: David Banach \u00a0Excellent teachers",
    "Instructor: David Banach \u00a0Great - very knowledgeable. Approachable and friendly.",
    "Instructor: David Banach \u00a0Very helpful professor and always provided interesting thoughts or viewpoints.",
    "Instructor: David Banach \u00a0Dr. Banach is one of the nicest professors at Yale in addition to being very humble. He lead case study discussions and posed interesting dilemmas to the class, which resulted in engaging conversation. I wish there was closer to a 50-50 split between the two instructors, as Dr. Banach certainly had a lot to offer.",
    "Instructor: David Banach \u00a0Excellent. Very approachable and willing to teach.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Had great stories about noncompliant HC workers",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Dr. Dembry truly cares about the subject and has a world of knowledge of hospital epidemiology. She was kind, engaging, and really gave a great background to hospital epidemiology. I enjoyed having her as a professor very much. My only recommendation was for her to read off the slides a bit less.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Approachable, good instructor. Interesting classes.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0good, engaging.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0She needs her ego knocked down a peg and also to stop being so boring.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Knowledgeable and supportive. A fantastic instructor.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Excellent professor who is clearly quite knowledgeable about the subject. I would love to take any other course she may teach!",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Dr. Dembry is incredible. It seems like everyone in the ID community has not only heard of her, but have very high praise for her. After taking this course, I can see why. She has accumulated so much experience over the years (not calling her old), and it is special to have someone like that spread her wisdom and insight from all the challenges she faced. I wish she would engage the class more in case study discussions, as those were always very entertaining.",
    "Instructor: Louise-Marie Dembry \u00a0Excellent. Very approachable and willing to teach."

   "comments": [
    "Grading seemed arbitrary, points that were taken off werent followed by explanation as to why. Do not have this class at 8 am again.",
    "Good class for those who want to learn more about HAIs and be challenged.",
    "Excellent course for students in epidemiology \/ infectious diseases \/ microbiology \/ hospital administration. Would be helpful if the student had a little background in microbiology, but not necessary.",
    "Great for students interested in the field of health care epidemiology.",
    "Its a terrible class dont take it",
    "Excellent course. I would really like to encourage medical professionals to take this course",
    "Good.",
    "Great class if you're looking to learn more about hospital and health care epi, as well as basic clinical practices.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course, especially if you are interested in any area of infection control and prevention. There are quite a few professionals in the class such as physicians, nurses, and ID fellows. Being able to discuss cases with these professionals is a valuable experience. This course encourages you to think about the interactions between different departments in a hospital, such as in the case of an outbreak or proposed mandatory vaccination policy. The group projects encourage thinking out of the box, as you take fundamental principles learned from the course and apply them to situations we haven't exactly covered in depth. Overall, the course does a good job encompassing the inherent complexities of working in a hospital. If anyone plans on working in such an environment, taking this course is a must. I would say this has been my favorite class at Yale by far.",
    "Highly recommend."
