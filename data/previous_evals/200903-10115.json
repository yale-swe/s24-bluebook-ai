    "An experience that I will never forget. I got over the fact that I was taking class with a celebrity in the first few sessions and came to appreciate the unique relationship between Professor Berg and Professor Dean, a relationship that fostered the educational experience in this class. Don't come here expecting a policy class; indeed, those who were interested in political science seemed the most disappointed by the discussion in this class. Instead, expect to explore yourself, to challenge yourself, and to interface with a fascinating group of people.",
    "This class is not about politics. It is about the psychology of politicians. We talk about what makes them tick, what drove them, and the unique ways in which they relate to others - both their family and friends - and their professional adversaries (other politicians and journalists). Howard Dean, the headliner, is engaged and attentive in this conversation, but he focuses more on listening to the students than interjecting his own thoughts. This can be a bad or good thing depending on what you take this course for. I would recommend it to those interested to learn more about themselves - I would not recommend it to those interested in politics only and attracted to just the headliner's name.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. However, the class isn't about policy or any textbook version of learning political science - it's much more about our personal interactions in the political world, what motivates politicians, and what makes politicians successful (at all levels).",
    "This class is a great way to see a different side of politics, the media, and how you fit into the dynamic. I loved the fact that there were so many opportunities for introspection, and enjoyed all the class activities. The assigned reading is extremely light, and the professors are a lot of fun to hang around with. I felt like I really got to know my peers in this class, and learned a lot, albeit in an unconventional, unstructured sense.",
    "YES!",
    "TAKE this if you can get in, it is awesome and you will really feel like you got to know david and howard at the end of it. be warned, the class is much more about berg's specialty [organizational psychology as it relates to group and group identity, i.e. what does it mean to BE a politician?]and less about policy. but very min workload, even compared to other res coll seminars, and worth taking. it feels a little like group therapy at times - lots of self-analysis - but i had a chance to learn a lot about myself and really reflect in this class in a way that's rare at yale. also i got to do it while having coffee w howard dean, which is pretty cool.",
    "Yeah! This class was a great opportunity to learn from a major politician and a renowed psychiatrist in a way that melds pyschological expertise and political experience into a solid understanding of the political environment. It wasn't too much work, either, giving us the time and the space to really think over what we studied in class (which, yes, we spent a great deal of time doing on our own\/with classmates).",
    "This class is billed as a \"journey of self discovery,\" which, in all honesty, made me quite skeptical. I was wrong to be hesitant. Don't take this expecting war stories from Dean - the class is about Berg and Dean's relationship, and aboutyou asking the questions that interest you and exploring the topics that you find compelling. There was virtually no work besides two papers and an interview project last time, although I assume and hope they'll assign more readings if they teach it again. Berg is a fantastic professor and a great guy, and Dean is tons of fun and quite personable. I'd strongly recommend the class, but I definitely struggled because of how self-guided the learning was. It was a great experience for me to have, and really pushed my boundaries.",
    "This class was one of the best class I have taken at Yale, and I have no doubt that there will be no class that will top the experience I had in this course. David Berg and Howard Dean do a great job getting students to open up about their experiences, and they do a good job opening up themselves. Rather than learn about all sorts of theories from books, this class is about learning about life through each other. If it is offered again, I recommend it to anyone taking the course. I have no complaints about the way in which the class was structured and could only ask for more time for the course.",
    "I would recommend thisseminar and enjoyed my experience in class. Having David and Howard together as teachers was great and they complemented each other very well \u0097 David the psychologist and Howard the politician. This helped me see the person behind the politician, which was my main reason for taking the class. The class discussion and exercises were great, and it was interesting to see where they would lead us. It was fun to interview a working politician in the state of Connecticut, to draw comparisons, and to hear reactions from the class and teachers. If offered again, I wouldn't miss the opportunity to take this course."
