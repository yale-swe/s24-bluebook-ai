    "I'd definitely recommend this class to anybody who already has some knowledge of and interest in India, and I'd recommend the class with reservations to someone with no knowledge base at all. The professor is great, the readings are not so great, and the workload is manageable. Definitely expect to learn a lot.",

    "I would only recommend this course if you have a vast knowledge of the way the Indian government works, otherwise you will be a lost a majority of the semester.",
    "I would only recommend this class to students that have a strong interest in Indian political systems. Classes were slow sometimes."
