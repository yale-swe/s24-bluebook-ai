    "I got really good writing practice and really good at sifting through large readings for im[ortant information. We got to look at archives which will be really important moving forward. Also, everyone was really smart and contributed a lot so I think I was forced to gain confidence so that I could participate in class which I really appreciate.",
    "I learned so much about slavery that I had no idea about coming into the class. It was surprising to me learning so many facts that high schools seem to omit when they teach you about slavery. I also improved my historical writing skills as well as my historical research skills as a result of this course.",
    "This course was primarily helpful in learning how to conduct historical investigations. All of the texts we read and discussed, from fugitive slave narratives to how whites constructed a system of practical enslavement post-emancipation, were invaluable in attempting to contextualize the impact of the enslavement of African-Americans.",
    "Lots of reading, but very rewarding!",
    "I learned how to analyze primary source documents and write a concise historical research paper",
    "This course was excellent for getting guided practice with historical research and the processes of using archives and library services.",
    "This was my first discussion-based course at Yale, so it really helped me learn to articulate my thoughts. Also learned how to write a historical essay and skim books."

   "comments": [
    "I really liked everything",
    "Strengths: the readings were very interesting. The final paper assignment was a great opportunity to explore the archives on your own and delve into something that was particularly fascinating to you. Weaknesses: a book a week is too many; no one had time to read them all. Discussions were often really dry (especially when no one had time to read)! The readings were interesting but rather specific. Discussions of readings should have been paired with lecture-type talks in which we learned about general conditions of American slavery. The readings provided very specific views, and we were not able to understand slavery as a whole really. The archives didn't bring much to the class.",
    "This course was very good at traveling through time and teaching about slavery as time progressed in America as well as other countries. The discussions were very strong and the professor was very knowledgeable about the subject. The class is reading heavy and sometimes I felt we did not need to read an entire book to have a discussion and learn the material.",
    "The strength of the course rests the wonderful staff at Beinecke, specifically Melissa Barton, who was nothing but helpful and encouraging with our final research projects. Its strength can also be attributed to the knowledgeable Professor Rugemer, and the seriousness of the course material. However, at times, I felt that my classmates did not feel comfortable expressing all of their views on the material. This was not at all attributable to the professor, who I think did a very good job at making sure everyone's voice was heard and respected. I also do not think that this was attributable to any one student. In addition, it is vital that the course material is never watered down to make students feel more comfortable. The discussion of slavery and the continued systematic oppression of minorities in America is one that we all must have if we wish to make our society a better place for the people alive and those not yet born. In short, it seems to me that future students who take this course could use a little more trust in each other. I do not think that we students gave each other the benefit of the doubt until near the end of the course. Yet, how could we be expected to? In a predominantly white-run institution, that was born with blood money from the Atlantic slave trade, and which has so often in the past maintained white power structures, how could a student of color sit in a class about slavery with mostly white students and a white professor and be expected to be open to discussing these topics comfortably? My point, I suppose, is that I do not know the solution to the issues of trust amongst students. I do not know anything about trust building exercises, or anything of the sort, so I can not offer a solution. However, I think that the course would be more effective if Yale could make an even greater effort to allow students of color to feel comfortable expressing their views. So my challenge to Yale College is to step up. Instead of students worrying that they will be interrogated by campus police if they are \"out of place,\" i.e., not being white at this institution that they were enthusiastically invited to be a part of, they should be concerned with which courses they are excited to explore next.",
    "Having the opportunity to work with primary source documents",
    "This course demands a lot, and the archival research process is very time-consuming, but the course is excellent.",
    "The material of the course was extremely interesting, but the amount of work (mainly reading) was overwhelming at times. Reading a book a week was quite a lot. However, I loved our discussions."

    "Yes mainly because you get to analyze and look at archival material in a very safe environment.",

    "Yes. If you want to learn about how the foundations of American prosperity were built upon the backs of the brutalized, you should consider taking this course. If that disinterests you, it is necessary that you take this course.",
    "Yes because since the course is about the history of slavery it's extremely relevant to understanding many of the hot issues today",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is self-motivated and interested in the topic, but not to a student who is on the fence about the topic.",
    "Absolutely! However, it is not the best fifth class - be prepared to work!"
