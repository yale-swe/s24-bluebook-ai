    "PHAR 502 is a seminar course in which students read scientific articles and write a specific aims page in the field of the article each week. I would recommend this course to another student because I feel that it has helped improve my critical thinking and scientific writing skills.",
    "See first question. 100% I would recommend. Be prepared to work hard, but it is the most valuable class you will ever take.",
    "A required seminar course for MMPP track programs",
    "This course is an excellent way to become familiar with the strengths of the Yale pathology, pharmacology, and physiology departments. I would recommend this course to another MMPP student because it is a great way to learn about research and techniques that are accessible to you through rotations.",

    "This course has improved my scientific writing and critical thinking, which are skills I will use throughout the rest of my scientific career.",
    "Taught me how to read papers, critically analyze them, and come up with practical questions and ideas for further research. This was SO helpful for preparing for my dissertation\/research. I have grown so much because of this class.",
    "This course gave me an introduction to select topics in physiology, pharmacology, and pathology. It gave me a better idea of what research labs I wanted to pursue for my second and third rotations. While the papers weren't directly related to my current research, this course has helped me develop questions into an organized research proposal, which is invaluable to my graduate training.",
