   "comments": [
    "This is not by any means a joke class. The work load is pretty light, but you really do need to study and keep up with the lectures otherwise you will be doing a lot of catch up work in the last couple days of class to try to memorize the massive amounts of information you're presented with. The lab quizzes are pretty hard and they're difficultto know how to study for. Eric is a great professor though, and really knows his stuff.",
    "If you have any interest in mammals or playing with specimens, take this course! It's a lot of material and memorization, but it's very useful and interesting knowledge that you gain. Be prepared to study hard for the lab quizzes though.",
    "I LOVED this class, so my instinct is to recommend it (and its excellent professor) unequivocally. However, I should say that Mammalogy is exactly in my area of interest. I know the material here presented isn't everyone's cup of tea, and that it can be very hard. You have to memorize nearly every family of mammal (well over 100) and be able to identify them by skull alone-- that's no easy feat, and this class involves a lot of minute-detail memorization. Some people find it boring to study the teeth of the different microchiropteran bat families. If you like evolutionary biology and phylogenetics, though, this class is fantastic. It's my favorite Yale course thus far, and if you're anything like me, you'll love it too.",
    "It's an amazing class that you should definitely take. The lab days are really cool, you actually get to look at animal bones and pelts.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in mammals. The class is very memorization heavy, but it has one of the best labs at Yale where you get to handle skins\/skulls of various mammals.",
    "Very interesting class if you want to know more about mammals. I would recommend it - not much work during the semester but there are three lab quizzes that involve a lot of memorization. Professor is great",
    "Yes! I enjoyed it and learned a lot. It's really cool to get to see all the specimens in lab, and the lectures are interesting and well done. Lots of material to learn, and a lot of memorization before the final. I hadn't done anything like this before and was a little lost for the first few labs, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. Some advice: TAKE NOTES on the specimens to help yourself for the quizzes (don't just rely on the keys in the book).",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the material. I could see it being very boring for people who are not that interested, since there is a lot of memorisation involved about mammals we may never see in our lifetimes. That being said, I was interested in the material and I thought the class was great and I learned a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend Anthropology 310 to a fellow student. The labs are fun, the lectures interesting, the tests completely as expected. You get to learn about mammals, you get to hold a tiger skull, and you get to pet a pangolin skin. What more could you want?",
    "I would recommend this class because it's an awesome way to see narwhal horns and rare bats and gain a cursory knowledge of vertebrate anatomy, but be prepared to memorize an avalanche of information verbatim. The final is literally on any given bullet point from>1000 slides. If you want to do well, you'll have to commit time to learning facts by heart.",
    "Mammalogy is a fun course, once you figure out how to succeed in it. Follow these rules:1. Don't buy the textbook. Study the lectures.2. Don't bother keying skulls out. Instead, be able to memorize them by sight. Study them beforehand using the lab manual, identify the tricky ones in lab, and then practice them all by looking up the species online or with photos if you have a camera.",
    "Decent class. Memorization is the only way to succeed in this class.",
    "A great course, really interesting and fun, but lots of material and sometimes hard to study for.",
    "Yes, because as long as you're willing to memorize pages upon pages of stuff, it's a marvelous class, and getting a close look at the Peabody collections is a remarkable experience.",
    "Just know, if you're a non-major, what you're signing up for- an hour and fifteen minutes of osteology and clade-by-clade surveys of mammal groups can be an awful lot to handle unless you really love this stuff. Same to lab- it's just a TON of specimens that you of course wouldn't have a chance to otherwise see. Sargis is great at breaking out cool specimens and throwing fun facts into lecture, and generally the nicest and hippest professor of any organismal course at Yale (leagues cooler than Prum or even Near and Wells)."
