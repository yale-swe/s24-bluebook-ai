    "Prof. Stepto is a fascinating professor who never feels the need to push annoying, pain-staking analysis of poems-- he just sort of sits back and let's us all enjoy what we're reading in a low-stress environment. Amazing poems, you'll learn a lot. Trips to Beineke were insane",
    "A study of modern African American poets.",
    "Read the poetry of African American poets, learn about certain patterns in the poems anf learn about the lives of the poets. Learn what has jnfluenced them and how they influence moden poetry. Low work, but lots of learning. Class can be a little slow, but you really take time to appreciate the works. Amazing professor."
